The relative abundance of each TRIBBLES family member may be important for distinct oncogenic or tumor suppressor functions. We map the expression profiles of TRIB1, TRIB2, and TRIB3 in human and murine hemopoietic stem, progenitor and mature cells, and in human leukemia datasets. Our data show that TRIB1-TRIB2 have an inverse expression relationship in normal hemopoiesis, whereas TRIB1-TRIB3 have a positive correlation. We reveal that TRIB3 expression is high in the dormant hemopoietic stem cell (HSC) population, implicating a novel role for TRIB3 in stem cell quiescence. These analyses support a non-redundant role for each TRIBBLES member during normal hemopoietic differentiation. We show that TRIB1-TRIB2 display a significant negative correlation in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes, but not in acute lymphoid leukemia. This inverse relationship is specific to certain subtypes of AML. A positive correlation exists in different leukemia subtypes between TRIB1-TRIB3. The TRIB1-TRIB2 and TRIB1-TRIB3 correlations are consistent with a correlative relationship with C/EBP transcription factor family members.

We analyzed 131 adults with HL who underwent UCBT in European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation centers from 2003 to 2015. Disease status at UCBT was complete remission (CR) in 59 patients (47%), and almost all patients had received a previous autologous stem cell transplantation. The 4-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19% to 34%) and 46% (95% CI, 37% to 55%), respectively. Relapse incidence was 44% (95% CI, 36% to 54%), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 31% (95% CI, 23% to 40%) at 4 years. In multivariate analysis refractory/relapsed disease status at UCBT was associated with increased relapse incidence (hazard ratio [HR], 3.14 [95% CI, 1.41 to 7.00], P=.005) and NRM (HR, 3.61 [95% CI, 1.58 to 8.27], P=.002) and lower PFS (HR, 3.45 [95% CI, 1.95 to 6.10], P < .001) and OS (HR, 3.10 [95% CI, 1.60 to 5.99], P=.001).

There is increasing evidence of accumulation of various molecular alterations in the tumour cells of PCs, which may explain why extended PCs are related to a less favourable prognosis. To further characterize PCs, we compared the expression level of EZH2 protein, the overexpression of which has recently been recognized as poor prognostic factor in CLL/SLL, in the PCs and the intervening small cell areas in lymph nodes of 15 patients with CLL/SLL. We also investigated the mutational profile of EZH2 and the expression of its upstream regulators c-Myc, E2F1, pRB and miR-26a. Our results showed a significantly increased expression of EZH2 in the PCs. No EZH2 mutations were detected, however, overexpression of c-Myc, E2F1 and pRb proteins as well as reduced expression of the tumor suppressor miR-26a were demonstrated in the PCs.

Abnormal lncRNA expression was found to relate to the development and pathogenesis of multiple cancers. LncRNA LINC00152 served as an oncogene in multiple cancers; however, its role in ovarian cancer remains unknown. In our research study, LINC00152 was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. An increasing LINC00152 level was positively correlated with the histological grade, clinical stage, and poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. In addition, knockdown of LINC00152 reduced cell growth, induced cell apoptosis, and suppressed tumor growth. Moreover, we revealed that LINC00152 and Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) were targeted by miR-125b and had the same miR-125b combining site. The miR-125b level was negatively correlated with the expression of LINC00152, while MCL-1 was positively related to the LINC00152 level. MiR-125b could affect LINC00152 levels as evaluated by qRT-PCR. Finally, we affirmed that LINC00152 mediated cell proliferation by affecting MCL-1 expression and MCL-1-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathways and by working as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-125b. In summary, based on ceRNA theory, the combined research on miR-125b and MCL-1, and taking LINC00152 as a new study point, we provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of reversing cell proliferation in ovarian cancer.",['(c) 2018 The Authors.

In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL), ligand-independent activation predominates. Negative Regulatory Region (NRR) mutations trigger supraphysiological Notch1 activation by exposing the S2 site to proteolytic cleavage in the absence of ligand. Subsequently, cleavage at the S3 site generates the activated form of Notch, intracellular Notch (ICN). In contrast to T-ALL, in mature lymphoid neoplasms such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the S2 cleavage site is exposed through ligand-receptor interactions. Thus, agents that disrupt ligand-receptor interactions might be useful for treating these malignancies. Notch activation can be enhanced by mutations that delete the C-terminal proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T) (PEST) domain. These mutations do not activate the Notch pathway per se, but rather impair degradation of ICN. In this chapter, we review the mechanisms of Notch activation and the importance of Notch for the genesis and maintenance of lymphoid malignancies. Unfortunately, targeting the Notch pathway with pan-Notch inhibitors in clinical trials has proven challenging. These clinical trials have encountered dose-limiting on-target toxicities and primary resistance. Strategies to overcome these challenges have emerged from the identification and improved understanding of direct oncogenic Notch target genes. Other strategies have arisen from new insights into the ""nuclear context"" that selectively directs Notch functions in lymphoid cancers. This nuclear context is created by factors that co-bind ICN at cell-type specific transcriptional regulatory elements. Disrupting the functions of these proteins or inhibiting downstream oncogenic pathways might combat cancer without the intolerable side effects of pan-Notch inhibition.",,"['McCarter, Anna C', 'Wang, Qing', 'Chiang, Mark']","['McCarter AC', 'Wang Q', 'Chiang M']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. markchia@umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['T32 GM007315/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007863-37/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA196604/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2018/07/22 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/07/22 06:00'],"['2018/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-319-89512-3_18 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2018;1066:355-394. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-89512-3_18.,['NOTNLM'],"['*AKT', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*MYC', '*Notch', '*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Product-specific validation studies on virus reduction with two model viruses [usually murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and a parvovirus] performed in duplicate runs are standard for clinical trial applications. For the retroviral safety margin, a 6 log reduction is normally expected. Retroviral particle counts are measured traditionally by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and are commonly performed at contract laboratories. These procedures are quite time-consuming and can be associated with significant costs. In particular, the time factor is a hurdle for companies that want to quickly bring their new products to the clinic. In this session, several strategies on how to lower time, cost, and workload in the evaluation of viral safety for early clinical trial applications, while still ensuring sufficient level of viral safety of the product, were presented. In addition, virus reduction strategies for molecules that do not have the standard antibody structure are presented. Also presented in this session is the feasibility of the use of retrovirus-like particle (RVLP) in the prevalidation of virus removal and the use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as an alternative to infectivity assays in virus validation studies as well as its use as an alternative to quantitative TEM analysis for determining RVLP count in the bulk harvest of a perfusion bioreactor.LAY ABSTRACT: In this session, several strategies on how to lower time, cost, and workload in the evaluation of viral safety for early clinical trial applications of cell-derived biotechnology products, while still ensuring sufficient level of viral safety of the product, were presented.

The efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy depends on the engraftment and persistence of T cells following adoptive transfer. Most protocols for T-cell engineering routinely expand T cells ex vivo for 9 to 14 days. Because the potential for engraftment and persistence is related to the state of T-cell differentiation, we hypothesized that reducing the duration of ex vivo culture would limit differentiation and enhance the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy. We demonstrated that T cells with a CAR-targeting CD19 (CART19) exhibited less differentiation and enhanced effector function in vitro when harvested from cultures at earlier (day 3 or 5) compared with later (day 9) timepoints. We then compared the therapeutic potential of early versus late harvested CART19 in a murine xenograft model of ALL and showed that the antileukemic activity inversely correlated with ex vivo culture time: day 3 harvested cells showed robust tumor control despite using a 6-fold lower dose of CART19, whereas day 9 cells failed to control leukemia at limited cell doses. We also demonstrated the feasibility of an abbreviated culture in a large-scale current good manufacturing practice-compliant process. Limiting the interval between T-cell isolation and CAR treatment is critical for patients with rapidly progressing disease. Generating CAR T cells in less time also improves potency, which is central to the effectiveness of these therapies. Cancer Immunol Res; 6(9); 1100-9.

The role of lenalidomide was also not defined. This phase 2 study randomized 342 untreated patients with non-del(11q) CLL requiring therapy to fludarabine plus rituximab (FR; n = 123), FR plus lenalidomide consolidation (FR+L; n = 109), or FR plus cyclophosphamide (FCR; n = 110) and compared 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates of each to the historical control rate with FC (60%). Patients with del(11q) in at least 20% of pretreatment cells continued with FCR (n = 27) or were reassigned to FCR+L (n = 31) and excluded from the primary analysis. Among non-del(11q) patients, 2-year PFS rates were 64% (90% confidence interval [CI], 57-71; FR), 72% (90% CI, 65-79; FR+L), and 74% (90% CI, 66-80; FCR); FR+L and FCR had rates significantly greater than historical control. Median PFS was significantly shorter with FR compared with FR+L (P = .04) and FCR (P < .001): 43 (95% CI, 33-50), 61 (95% CI, 45-71), and 97 (95% CI, 61 to not reached) months, respectively.

An implicit assumption in these studies is that nanoparticles present in the blood are available for distribution to the tumor. This study documents significant levels of lipoplex uptake by circulating leukocytes, and its effect on distribution to the tumor and other organs. In agreement with previous studies, PEGylation dramatically extends circulation times and enhances tumor delivery. However, our studies suggest that this relationship is not straightforward, and that particle sequestration by leukocytes can significantly alter biodistribution, especially with non-PEGylated nanoparticle formulations.

Scarce evidence exists on the effectiveness of adherence-enhancing interventions. The present pilot study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of an intervention to improve TKI adherence in adult CML patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental pre-post intervention design, we included a convenience sample of 58 CML patients (median age, 60.5 years; interquartile range, 19) receiving TKI treatment in 4 hematology institutes in Israel (median previous treatment duration, 34 months; interquartile range, 60). Of the 58 patients, 36 (62%) were receiving first-line treatment. TKI adherence was assessed using electronic monitoring for 7 months (4 months for the baseline assessment and for 3 months after the intervention) and defined as the percentage of days with dosing taken as prescribed. The multilevel intervention combined training of health care workers and multiple behavioral change techniques (eg, motivational interviewing, feedback on electronic monitoring printouts, behavioral change techniques tailored to reasons for nonadherence). The baseline and postintervention adherence were compared using generalized estimating equation models. RESULTS: The median baseline electronically monitored adherence (n = 55) was 97.5% (range, 48%-100%). The odds of taking the drug daily as prescribed were 58% greater after intervention (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.15). Adherence improved by only 1.5% overall (95% CI, 0.1%-2.8%) but by 8.5% (i.e. from 71.2% average adherence before intervention, to 79.6% after; P = .04) in a subgroup of 10 nonadherent patients (baseline adherence < 90%). CONCLUSION: TKI adherence improved with our pilot intervention, mainly in patients with suboptimal baseline adherence.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The pathophysiology responsible for the deficits in bone tissue is still unclear. METHODS: Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses of known myokines from skeletal muscle were performed on dystrophic mouse models and wild-type (WT) controls to identify differentially expressed bone-regulating myokines. RESULTS: Twenty-four of 43 myokine genes demonstrated significantly different mRNA expression in the skeletal muscles of dystrophic mice when compared with muscles of WT mice. Several differently expressed bone-regulating myokine genes were identified, and their protein levels were also verified by Western blot. CONCLUSIONS: Dystrophic skeletal muscle demonstrated a significantly altered myokine gene expression profile. mRNA and protein levels of several bone-regulating myokines were significantly altered in dystrophic skeletal muscle, which suggests pathological role of bone-regulating myokines on bone homeostasis in DMD.

Non-neuronal microglial cells orchestrate neuroinflammatory reactions, and their adverse activation has been linked to AD pathogenesis. Methyl jasmonate (MJ) has anti-cancer properties and has also been shown to reduce peripheral inflammation in pre-clinical models. Recently, anti-neuroinflammatory activity of MJ was demonstrated in mice, but the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this beneficial effect are unknown. We hypothesized that MJ can regulate select microglial functions, and used two different in vitro models of microglia to test this hypothesis. MJ inhibited the production of damaging reactive oxygen species by differentiated human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells without reducing their viability. MJ also selectively upregulated phagocytic activity of murine BV-2 microglia, but had no effect on nitric oxide secretion by these cells. Since microglial phagocytosis can be beneficial for clearance of amyloid beta aggregates in AD, the observed upregulation of phagocytic activity by MJ, combined with its inhibitory effect on reactive oxygen species production, supports continued studies of MJ as a candidate drug for managing adverse neuroinflammation in AD.",,"['McKenzie, Jordan A', 'Klegeris, Andis']","['McKenzie JA', 'Klegeris A']","['Biology Department, University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC, Canada.', 'Biology Department, University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Neural Regen Res,Neural regeneration research,101316351,,,,2018/07/22 06:00,2018/07/22 06:01,['2018/07/21 06:00'],"['2018/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/22 06:01 [medline]']","['NeuralRegenRes_2018_13_7_1290_235078 [pii]', '10.4103/1673-5374.235078 [doi]']",ppublish,Neural Regen Res. 2018 Jul;13(7):1290-1293. doi: 10.4103/1673-5374.235078.,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'anti-inflammatory', 'glia', 'neurodegeneration', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuroprotection', 'nitric oxide', 'phagocytosis', 'reactive nitrogen species', 'reactive oxygen species']",7,,PMC6065217,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chicken blastodermal cells (cBCs) play an important role in both basic and transgenic researches as an important ES cell. However, the regulatory mechanism of small molecules involved in the self-renewal and pluripotency of cBCs remains unknown. This study revealed that the small molecule, SC1, can maintain cBCs in an undifferentiated, pluripotent state in serum- and feeder-free E8 media without leukaemia inhibitory factor. Furthermore, SC1 inhibits downregulation of pluripotency-related genes caused by retinoic acid and promotes the proliferation of cBCs. Furthermore, the results of this study indicated that SC1 functions by inhibiting ERK1 phosphorylation and promoting Akt phosphorylation, thus promoting the expression of pluripotency-related genes and maintaining the pluripotency of cBCs. The results also demonstrated that SC1 sustains the self-renewal capacity and pluripotency of cBCs cells by inhibiting ERK1 phosphorylation and promoting Akt phosphorylation. This kind of regulatory mechanism might be conserved in avian ES cells.

Results of the ALL-BFM 2000 trial.,96-103,10.1111/bjh.15503 [doi],"This study reports the prognostic impact of the expression of the natural killer cell marker CD56 in a large series of risk-adapted paediatric patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL; n = 493) treated within the ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 2000 protocol. The immunophenotype was analysed centrally at diagnosis using flow cytometry and correlated with clinical parameters and outcome. CD56 expression was detected in 7.1% and early T-cell precursor (ETP) phenotype in 6.7% of all T-ALL patients. The percentage of ETP in the CD56+ T-ALL cohort was 4-fold higher than in the whole cohort. CD56+ T-ALL frequently expressed the progenitor marker CD34 and myeloid antigens CD13 and CD33. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates for the European Group for the Immunological classification of Leukaemias/World Health Organization subgroups and the ETP phenotype were not statistically different. By contrast, patients with CD56 expression had a significantly reduced EFS (60 +/- 8%) and overall survival (60 +/- 8%) at 5 years, with a hazard ratio of 2.46 (P = 0.002) and 2.99 (P < 0.001), respectively. Moreover, CD56 expression in combination with the minimal residual disease (MRD)-based high risk assignment defined a population with a 'very-high' risk probability of relapse in the ALL-BFM 2000 trial.

FOXP3 polymorphisms are associated with autoimmune diseases, cancers, and allograft outcomes. We examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the FOXP3 locus are associated with clinical outcomes after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: Five FOXP3 SNPs (rs5902434, rs3761549, rs3761548, rs2232365, and rs2280883) were analyzed by PCR-sequencing of 172 DNA samples from allogenic HSCT patients. We examined the relationship between each SNP and the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), post-HSCT infection, relapse, and patient survival. RESULTS: Patients with acute GVHD (grades II-IV) showed higher frequencies of the rs3761549 T/T genotype, rs5902434 ATT/ATT genotype, and rs2232365 G/G genotype than did patients without acute GVHD (P=0.017, odds ratio [OR]=5.3; P=0.031, OR=2.4; and P=0.023, OR=2.6, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that the TT genotype of rs3761549 was an independent risk factor for occurrence of acute GVHD (P=0.032, hazard ratio=5.6). In contrast, the genotype frequencies of rs3761549 T/T, rs5902434 ATT/ATT, and rs2232365 G/G were lower in patients with post-HSCT infection than in patients without infection (P=0.026, P=0.046, and P=0.031, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: rs3761549, rs5902434, and rs2232365 are associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD and decreased risk of post-HSCT infection.",['(c) The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.'],"['Nam, Minjeong', 'Shin, Sue', 'Park, Kyoung Un', 'Kim, Inho', 'Yoon, Sung Soo', 'Kwon, Tack Kyun', 'Song, Eun Young']","['Nam M', 'Shin S', 'Park KU', 'Kim I', 'Yoon SS', 'Kwon TK', 'Song EY']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. kwontk@snu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. eysong1@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2018/07/22 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/07/21 06:00'],"['2017/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['38.591 [pii]', '10.3343/alm.2018.38.6.591 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2018 Nov;38(6):591-598. doi: 10.3343/alm.2018.38.6.591.,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'FOXP3', 'Graft-versus-host disease', 'Infection', 'Polymorphism']",6,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8250-914X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1286-9611']",PMC6056380,,['The authors declare that no conflicts of interest exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, several studies have demonstrated the negative prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutations in CMML patients. We evaluated the prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutations and compared five CMML prognostic models in Korean patients with CMML. METHODS: We analyzed data from 36 of 57 patients diagnosed as having CMML from January 2000 to March 2016. ASXL1 mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing, and the clinical and laboratory features of patients were compared according to ASXL1 mutation status. RESULTS: ASXL1 mutations were detected in 18 patients (50%). There were no significant differences between the clinical and laboratory characteristics of ASXL1-mutated (ASXL1(+)) CMML and ASXL1-nonmutated (ASXL1(-)) CMML patients (all P>0.05). During the median follow-up of 14 months (range, 0-111 months), the overall survival (OS) of ASXL1(+) CMML patients was significantly inferior to that of ASXL1(-) CMML patients with a median survival of 11 months and 19 months, respectively (log-rank P=0.049). An evaluation of OS according to the prognostic models demonstrated inferior survival in patients with a higher risk category according to the Mayo molecular model (log-rank P=0.001); the other scoring systems did not demonstrate a significant association with survival. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that ASXL1 mutations, occurring in half of the Korean CMML patients examined, were associated with inferior survival. ASXL1 mutation status needs to be determined for risk stratification in CMML.",['(c) The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.'],"['Kim, Hyun Young', 'Lee, Ki O', 'Park, Silvia', 'Jang, Jun Ho', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Kim, Sun Hee', 'Kim, Hee Jin']","['Kim HY', 'Lee KO', 'Park S', 'Jang JH', 'Jung CW', 'Kim SH', 'Kim HJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Gyeongsang National University Hospital, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, Jinju, Korea.', 'Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. heejinkim@skku.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians/*genetics', 'DNA/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Republic of Korea', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2018/07/22 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/07/21 06:00'],"['2017/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['38.495 [pii]', '10.3343/alm.2018.38.6.495 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2018 Nov;38(6):495-502. doi: 10.3343/alm.2018.38.6.495.,['NOTNLM'],"['ASXL1', 'Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'Korea', 'Mayo molecular model', 'Prognostic models', 'Risk stratification']",6,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3741-4613'],PMC6056400,,['No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated whether pinosylvin, a resveratrol analogue, induced cell death in leukemia cells. Cell death was found to be markedly elevated by 50- to 100-mumol/L pinosylvin in THP-1 and U937 cells. It was also shown that pinosylvin induced caspase-3 activation, flip-flop of phosphatidylserine, LC3-II accumulation, LC3 puncta, and p62 degradation in both THP-1 and U937 cells. These data indicate that pinosylvin-induced cell death may occur through apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, we showed that pinosylvin down-regulates AMP-activated protein kinase alpha1 (AMPKalpha1) in leukemia cells. Therefore, we correlated AMPKalpha1 down-regulation and leukemia cell death. AMPKalpha1 inhibition appeared to decrease pinosylvin-induced apoptosis and autophagy in leukemia cells, implying that AMPK is a key regulator of leukemia cell death. Moreover, we found that both pinosylvin-induced autophagy and apoptotic progress were reduced in AMPKalpha1-overexpressed leukemia cells, when compared with vector-transfected cells. Cell death was elevated by AMPKalpha1 overexpression, whereas pinosylvin-induced cell death was markedly decreased by caspase-3 inhibitors or autophagy inhibitors. These results suggest that pinosylvin-induced depletion of AMPKalpha1 enhances cell death via apoptosis and autophagy in leukemia cells.","['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Song, Jina', 'Seo, Youngsik', 'Park, Heonyong']","['Song J', 'Seo Y', 'Park H']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Institute of Nanosensor and Biotechnology, Dankook University, Chungnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Institute of Nanosensor and Biotechnology, Dankook University, Chungnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Institute of Nanosensor and Biotechnology, Dankook University, Chungnam, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Dankook University'],['Journal Article'],20180720,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Stilbenes)', '881R434AIB (pinosylvin)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'THP-1 Cells', 'U937 Cells']",2018/07/22 06:00,2018/11/01 06:00,['2018/07/21 06:00'],"['2018/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ptr.6156 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2018 Oct;32(10):2097-2104. doi: 10.1002/ptr.6156.

Whether diabetes confers the same excess risk of cancer, overall and by site, in women and men is unknown. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed for cohort studies published up to December 2016. Selected studies reported sex-specific relative risk (RR) estimates for the association between diabetes and cancer adjusted at least for age in both sexes. Random-effects meta-analyses with inverse-variance weighting were used to obtain pooled sex-specific RRs and women-to-men ratios of RRs (RRRs) for all-site and site-specific cancers. RESULTS: Data on all-site cancer events (incident or fatal only) were available from 121 cohorts (19,239,302 individuals; 1,082,592 events). The pooled adjusted RR for all-site cancer associated with diabetes was 1.27 (95% CI 1.21, 1.32) in women and 1.19 (1.13, 1.25) in men. Women with diabetes had ~6% greater risk compared with men with diabetes (the pooled RRR was 1.06, 95% CI 1.03, 1.09). Corresponding pooled RRRs were 1.10 (1.07, 1.13) for all-site cancer incidence and 1.03 (0.99, 1.06) for all-site cancer mortality. Diabetes also conferred a significantly greater RR in women than men for oral, stomach and kidney cancer, and for leukaemia, but a lower RR for liver cancer. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetes is a risk factor for all-site cancer for both women and men, but the excess risk of cancer associated with diabetes is slightly greater for women than men.

In vitro studies were conducted to investigate the capacity of rIFNgamma to improve antifungal host defense in terms of fungal killing ability and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cells of the patient as well as healthy controls. An 8-year-old female pediatric patient with leukemia developed A. terreus IA. She clinically deteriorated and had high serum galactomannan levels despite broad antifungal therapy. Therefore, adjunctive immune stimulatory therapy with rIFNgamma was initiated. After 3 weeks of treatment, galactomannan levels decreased and the patient clinically showed improvement. Addition of rIFNgamma boosted the capacity of monocytes of healthy volunteers to mount TNFalpha and IL-1beta cytokine responses to Escherichia coli LPS, and increased TNFalpha response to both A. terreus and Aspergillus fumigatus. Monocytes isolated from the patient's blood demonstrated a similar augmented cytokine induction in response to rIFNgamma. In addition, rIFNgamma increased the capacity of monocytes from healthy volunteers as well as monocytes from the patient to kill A. terreus spores.

In this study, we functionally characterized a novel UDP-glycosyltransferase (RcUGT1) that converted tyrosol to specifically produce icariside D2 from R. crenulata at molecular and biochemical levels. RcUGT1 was highly expressed in flowers and roots, while the icariside D2 content was much higher in stems than that in other organs, suggesting the potential translocation of icariside D2 from flowers and roots to stems. The high production of icariside D2 in stems provided a reasonable suggestion to farmers to harvest stems instead of roots for icariside D2 production. Enzymatic assays of recombinant RcUGT1 indicated that it converted tyrosol to specifically form icariside D2, with the values of Km 0.97+/-0.10 mM, Vmax 286+/-8.26 pKat/mg, Kcat 0.01552 s(-1), and Kcat/Km 159.55 s(-1) M(-1).

We have shown that CRBN is also targeted for degradation by SCF(Fbxo7) ubiquitin ligase. In the current study, we explored the mechanisms underlying sensitivity of MM cells to IMiDs using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening. We validate that CSN9 signalosome complex, a deactivator of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase, inhibits SCF(Fbxo7) E3 ligase-mediated CRBN degradation, thereby conferring sensitivity to IMiDs; conversely, loss of function of CSN9 signalosome activates SCF(Fbxo7) complex, thereby enhancing degradation of CRBN and conferring IMiD resistance. Finally, we show that pretreatment with either proteasome inhibitors or NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitors can abrogate degradation and maintain levels of CRBN, thereby enhancing sensitivity to IMiDs.

Cytokine associations were identified with clinical and genetic features, and Euclidian cluster analysis identified three distinct cluster groups associated with important clinical and genetic features in CMML. CMML patients with decreased IL-10 expression had a poor overall survival when compared to CMML patients with elevated expression of IL-10 (P = 0.017), even when adjusted for ASXL1 mutation and other prognostic features. Incorporating IL-10 with the Mayo Molecular Model statistically improved the prognostic ability of the model. These established cytokines, such as IL-10, as prognostically relevant and represent the first comprehensive study exploring the clinical implications of the CMML inflammatory state.",,"['Niyongere, Sandrine', 'Lucas, Nolwenn', 'Zhou, Jun-Min', 'Sansil, Samer', 'Pomicter, Anthony D', 'Balasis, Maria E', 'Robinson, John', 'Kroeger, Jodi', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Zhao, Yu Long', 'Ball, Markus', 'Komrokji, Rami', 'List, Alan', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Fridley, Brooke L', 'Santini, Valeria', 'Solary, Eric', 'Padron, Eric']","['Niyongere S', 'Lucas N', 'Zhou JM', 'Sansil S', 'Pomicter AD', 'Balasis ME', 'Robinson J', 'Kroeger J', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhao YL', 'Ball M', 'Komrokji R', 'List A', 'Deininger MW', 'Fridley BL', 'Santini V', 'Solary E', 'Padron E']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Flow Cytometry Core, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Flow Cytometry Core, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Flow Cytometry Core, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Hematology, AOU Careggi, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'INSERM U1170, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, Villejuif, France.', 'Hematology Departement, Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.

Given that both MM and the majority of ALL are of B cell origin, this raises the question of whether ALL in patients with MM arises from the same clone. We report 13 cases of B-cell ALL following therapy for MM. The interval from MM diagnosis to ALL onset was 5.4 years (range 3.3-10). The median age at the time of ALL diagnosis was 60 years (range 43-67). MM therapy included immunomodulatory agents in all patients and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in 10 (77%) patients preceding ALL diagnosis. ALL genetics showed a normal karyotype, TP53 mutation/deletion, and monosomy 7 or 7q deletion in 5, 3, and 2 cases, respectively. Analysis of paired samples of MM and ALL using whole exome sequencing demonstrated that the malignancies arose from different clones.

Besides its critical role in leukemogenesis, this genetic aberration serves as a disease-specific biomarker for rapid diagnosis and monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD). Moreover, PML/RARA is specifically targeted by All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), two agents that synergistically act to induce degradation of the oncoprotein. Large clinical studies including two randomized trials conducted in newly diagnosed APL patients have shown that the ATRA-ATO combination is superior to conventional ATRA and chemotherapy both in terms of efficacy and safety. Preliminary studies using oral formulations of arsenic and ATRA suggest that oral arsenic is as effective and manageable as intravenous ATO. Following early retrospective studies indicating the prognostic relevance of PML/RARA monitoring, several prospective studies were conducted in large cohorts of APL patients enrolled in clinical trials with the aim of better assessing the prognostic value of longitudinal PCR testing. The results consistently showed that molecular remission (defined as negativization of the PCR test for PML/RARA) correlates with a significantly decreased risk of relapse, whereas persistence of PCR positivity for PML/RARA after consolidation or conversion from negative to positive during follow-up is strongly associated with hematologic relapse. Based on these data, various groups started using pre-emptive salvage therapy for patients who persisted PCR-positive after frontline consolidation or converted from negative to positive PCR during follow-up. Finally, several expert panels have recommended that molecular remission should be considered a therapeutic objective in APL, and molecular response has been adopted as a study endpoint in modern clinical trials.",,"['Cicconi, Laura', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Tallman, Martin', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Cicconi L', 'Fenaux P', 'Kantarjian H', 'Tallman M', 'Sanz MA', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Hospital St Louis, Paris 7 University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Hospital Universitario la Fe, Hematology Department, Department of Medicine, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. francesco.lo.coco@uniroma2.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180719,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy']",2018/07/22 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2018/07/21 06:00'],"['2018/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0219-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0219-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Aug;32(8):1671-1678. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0219-5.

Through newly developed compound reporter mice, here we define molecular signatures of self-renewing and differentiation-primed adult Aundiff fractions and dissect Aundiff heterogeneity by single-cell analysis. We uncover an unappreciated population within the self-renewing Aundiff fraction marked by expression of embryonic patterning genes and homeodomain transcription factor PDX1. Importantly, we find that PDX1 marks a population with potent stem cell capacity unique to mature, homeostatic testis and demonstrate dynamic interconversion between PDX1+ and PDX1- Aundiff states upon transplant and culture.

Analysis of a randomized trial (APL 2006) by the French Belgian Swiss APL group.,2033-2039,10.3324/haematol.2018.198614 [doi],"In standard-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia, recent results have shown that all-trans retinoic acid plus arsenic trioxide combinations are at least as effective as classical all-trans retinoic acid plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy while being less myelosuppressive. However, the role of frontline arsenic trioxide is less clear in higher-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia, and access to arsenic remains limited for front-line treatment of standard-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia in many countries. In this randomized trial, we compared arsenic, all-trans retinoic acid and the ""classical"" cytarabine for consolidation treatment (after all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy induction treatment) in standard-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia, and evaluated the addition of arsenic during consolidation in higher-risk disease. Patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia with a white blood cell count <10x10(9)/L, after an induction treatment consisting of all-trans retinoic acid plus idarubicin and cytarabine, received consolidation chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine, arsenic or all-trans retinoic acid. Patients with a white blood cell count >10x10(9)/L received consolidation chemotherapy with or without arsenic. Overall, 795 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were enrolled in this trial. Among those with standard-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (n=581), the 5-year event-free survival rates from randomization were 88.7%, 95.7% and 85.4% in the cytarabine, arsenic and all-trans retinoic acid consolidation groups, respectively (P=0.0067), and the 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse were was 5.5%, 0% and 8.2%. (P=0.001). Among those with higher-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (n=214), the 5-year event-free survival rates were 85.5% and 92.1% (P=0.38) in the chemotherapy and chemotherapy plus arsenic groups, respectively, and the corresponding 5-year cumulative incidences of relapse were 4.6% and 3.5% (P=0.99). Given the prolonged myelosuppression that occurred in the chemotherapy plus arsenic arm, a protocol amendment excluded cytarabine during consolidation cycles in the chemotherapy plus arsenic group, resulting in no increase in relapse. Our results therefore advocate systematic introduction of arsenic in the first-line treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, but probably not concomitantly with intensive chemotherapy, a situation in which we found myelosuppression to be significant.

Using a chimeric mice model, we demonstrate that Twist1 deletion in the bone marrow microenvironment results in alteration of multiple niche cells as well as downregulated expression of major hematopoietic stem cell supportive factors. The perturbed microenvironment reduces hematopoietic stem cell homing and retention, impairs hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and induces myeloid skewing. Nevertheless, it accelerates the progression of MLL-AF9 leukemia, which is partially mediated by Jagged-2-dependent Notch signaling. Our data provide the first demonstration of a pivotal role of TWIST1 in favoring normal hematopoiesis and hampering leukemia development.

YARS2 encodes the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, which is responsible for conjugating tyrosine to its cognate mt-tRNA for mitochondrial protein synthesis. Here we describe 14 individuals from 11 families presenting with sideroblastic anemia and YARS2 variants that we identified using a sideroblastic anemia gene panel or exome sequencing. The phenotype of these patients ranged from MLASA to isolated congenital sideroblastic anemia. As in previous cases, inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability was observed, however, this report includes the first cases with isolated sideroblastic anemia and patients with biallelic YARS2 variants that have no clinically ascertainable phenotype. We identified ten novel YARS2 variants and three previously reported variants. In vitro amino-acylation assays of five novel missense variants showed that three had less effect on the catalytic activity of YARS2 than the most commonly reported variant, p.(Phe52Leu), associated with MLASA2, which may explain the milder phenotypes in patients with these variants. However, the other two missense variants had a more severe effect on YARS2 catalytic efficiency. Several patients carried the common YARS2 c.572 G>T, p.(Gly191Val) variant (minor allele frequency =0.1259) in trans with a rare deleterious YARS2 variant. We have previously shown that the p.(Gly191Val) variant reduces YARS2 catalytic activity. Consequently, we suggest that biallelic YARS2 variants, including severe loss-of-function alleles in trans of the common p.(Gly191Val) variant, should be considered as a cause of isolated congenital sideroblastic anemia, as well as the MLASA syndromic phenotype.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Riley, Lisa G', 'Heeney, Matthew M', 'Rudinger-Thirion, Joelle', 'Frugier, Magali',

Approach and Results- We screened various combinations of transcription factors, including Myocd (myocardin), Mef2C (myocyte enhancer factor 2C), Mef2B (myocyte enhancer factor 2B), Mkl1 (MKL [megakaryoblastic leukemia]/Myocd-like 1), Gata4 (GATA-binding protein 4), Gata5 (GATA-binding protein 5), Gata6 (GATA-binding protein 6), Ets1 (E26 avian leukemia oncogene 1, 5' domain), and their corresponding carboxyterminal fusions to the transactivation domain of MyoD (myogenic differentiation 1)-indicated by *-for their effects on reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human adult dermal fibroblasts to the smooth muscle cell fate as determined by the expression of specific markers. The combination of 3 transcription factors, Myocd (or Myocd*) with Mef2C (or Mef2C*) and Gata6, was the most efficient in enhancing the expression of smooth muscle marker genes and decreasing fibroblast gene expression. Additionally, the derived induced smooth muscle-like cells showed a contractile phenotype in response to carbachol.

Several randomized studies already demonstrated that anti-T lymphoglobulin (ATLG) is effective in preventing GVHD after myeloablative unrelated and HLA-identical sibling transplants. However, the issue of doses and the potential increase of relapses still remain unsolved. Here we report data on 190 patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent an unrelated HSCT with low-dose ATLG (15 to 30 mg/kg) given at an earlier timing (days -6 to -2). HSCT was performed from HLA 10/10 (n=62, 33%), 9/10 (n=91, 48%), 8/10 (n=30, 16%), and <8/10 (n=7, 4%) identical unrelated donor. Peripheral blood was the stem cell source in 42% (n=80). Median follow-up was 51 months. Grades II to IV and III to IV acute GVHD were 26% and 9%, respectively, and 2-year overall and moderate to severe cGVHD were 23% and 14%, respectively. The 3-year incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality were 26% and 18%, respectively. The rates of 3-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS) were 60%, 56% and 44%, respectively. Factors such as younger donor, good performance status, and early disease were associated with better outcome in terms of OS, DFS, and GRFS. Our data indicate that doses of ATLG lower that those used in randomized clinical trials can be used for GVHD prevention, even in the adult setting, without clear increases in relapse and infections; these findings need to be further validated by a prospective randomized study.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

Cancer cells and the support cells in the tumor microenvironment communicate via cytokines/chemokines, cell:cell contact, or alterations in the metabolic state of the niche (e.g. hypoxia) that promote growth and survival of the tumor cell, influence metastasis, and defeat immune surveillance. These signaling pathways involve dysregulation of not only protein kinases but also protein phosphatases as normal signal transduction processes require both activation and deactivation. For instance, aberrant receptor signaling can result from constitutive activation of a tyrosine kinase such as FLT3 or inactivation of a tyrosine protein phosphatase such as SHP-2 (PTPN11). Activation of serine/threonine kinases such as AKT and ERK are often observed during the development of drug resistance while genomic and non-genomic suppression of serine/threonine protein phosphatases such as PP2A achieve similar results. It is fairly clear that the various protein phosphatases will impact processes that support drug resistance. Of growing interest is the emerging model whereby the support cells in the tumor microenvironment actually serve as drivers of tumorigenesis. This phenomenon has been most prominently observed in osteoblast cells in leukemic niches. At least one protein phosphatase, PTPN11, has emerged as a critical driver of this process in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. This review will cover the role of various serine/threonine and tyrosine protein phosphatases in processes that are central to tumor microenvironment function.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The association of leukaemia with exposure to low-dose (<100 mSv) radiation is less certain, although this is the dose range most relevant to the general population. We aimed to estimate the risk of leukaemia associated with low-dose radiation exposure in childhood (age <21 years). METHODS: In this analysis of historical cohort studies, we pooled eligible cohorts reported up to June 30, 2014. We evaluated leukaemia and myeloid malignancy outcomes in these cohorts with the relevant International Classification of Diseases and International Classification of Diseases for Oncology definitions. The cohorts included had not been treated for malignant disease, had reported at least five cases of the relevant haematopoietic neoplasms, and estimated individual active bone marrow (ABM) doses. We restricted analysis to individuals who were younger than 21 years at first irradiation who had mean cumulative ABM doses of less than 100 mSv. Dose-response models were fitted by use of Poisson regression. The data were received in fully anonymised form by the statistical analyst. FINDINGS: We identified nine eligible cohorts from Canada, France, Japan, Sweden, the UK, and the USA, including 262 573 people who had been exposed to less than 100 mSv enrolled between June 4, 1915, and Dec 31, 2004. Mean follow-up was 19.63 years (SD 17.75) and mean cumulative ABM dose was 19.6 mSv (SD 22.7). 154 myeloid malignancies were identified (which included 79 acute myeloid leukaemias, eight myelodysplastic syndromes, and 36 chronic myeloid leukaemias, in addition to other unspecified myeloid malignancies) and 40 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, with 221 leukaemias (including otherwise unclassified leukaemias but excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) identified overall. The fitted relative risks at 100 mSv were 3.09 (95% CI 1.41-5.92; ptrend=0.008) for acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes combined, 2.56 (1.09-5.06; ptrend=0.033) for acute myeloid leukaemia, and 5.66 (1.35-19.71; ptrend=0.023) for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. There was no clear dose-response for chronic myeloid leukaemia, which had a relative risk at 100 mSv of 0.36 (0.00-2.36; ptrend=0.394). There were few indications of between-cohort heterogeneity or departure from linearity. For acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes combined and for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the dose-responses remained significant for doses of less than 50 mSv. Excess absolute risks at 100 mSv were in the range of 0.1-0.4 cases or deaths per 10 000 person-years. INTERPRETATION: The risks of acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were significantly increased after cumulative doses of ionising radiation of less than 100 mSv in childhood or adolescence, with an excess risk also apparent for cumulative radiation doses of less than 50 mSv for some endpoints. These findings support an increased risk of leukaemia associated with low-dose exposure to radiation and imply that the current system of radiological protection is prudent and not overly protective.

This system transports cationic amino acids such as arginine and lysine out of the cell. Arginine, in particular, is critical for T-cell activation and function in the immune response. METHODS: We analyzed the role of the SLC7A7 gene in the cellular activities of Jurkat cells, specifically the cell cycle and cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Cell proliferation was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8. Apoptosis and the cell cycle were determined with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. A Transwell chamber was used to measure cell invasion and migration. RESULTS: The proliferative ability of Jurkat cells was not significantly altered by transfection with SLC7A7 overexpression vectors. However, SLC7A7 overexpression significantly decreased the percentage of apoptotic Jurkat cells (P = 0.007) but significantly increased the proportion of G1 phase cells (P = 0.029) and cell migration (P < 0.001) and invasion (P < 0.001). Knockdown of SLC7A7 increased the cell apoptosis rate (P = 0.006) but decreased the G1 phase ratio (P = 0.002) and cell migration (P < 0.001) and invasion (P < 0.001).

Previous studies have shown that either acylation of the C20 position or esterification/amidation of the C1 carboxylate moiety is beneficial in terms of biological properties. In this paper, we present the first analogs combining such modifications. Evaluation of the anti-proliferative activity against a series of cancer cell lines showed that acylation of the C20 hydroxyl group improves the activity of salinomycin C1 amides but not of the corresponding C1 esters. Importantly, the activity of several of the doubly modified analogs surpasses that of commonly used cytostatic drugs cisplatin and doxorubicin in the LoVo/DX multi-drug resistant cell line. All analogs were tested against primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in standard cell viability assays; three were more potent than salinomycin. Further studies revealed that selected analogs induced characteristics of apoptotic cell death and increased expression of p53. Additionally, using an ex vivo model of breast tumor, tumor cell viability significantly decreased after treatment with salinomycin or its double-modified derivative (3a) in a time-dependent manner. The present findings indicate that double-modified salinomycin derivatives constitute promising lead compounds for targeting various types of cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

LY2784544 (gandotinib) is a potent, selective, small-molecule inhibitor of JAK2 that has potential dose-dependent selectivity for the JAK2 V617F mutation and may inhibit additional JAK2 mutant isoforms in nonclinical testing. METHODS: A multicenter, single-arm, outpatient phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of gandotinib administered to patients (120mg once daily) with MPNs, including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis (MF). Between May 2012 and March 2015, 138 patients received at least one dose of study drug. FINDINGS: Most frequent Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events that were considered study-drug related were anemia (11.6%), hyperuricemia (3.2%), fatigue (2.9%), diarrhea (2.2%), and thrombocytopenia (2.2%). Overall response rates (ORRs) in patients with JAK2 V617F-mutated PV, ET, and MF were 95%, 90.5%, and 9.1%, respectively, while patients with ET and MF without the JAK2 V617F mutations had ORRs of 43.7% and 0%, respectively. INTERPRETATIONS: LY2784544 demonstrated efficacy in JAK2 V617F-mutated MPNs, including in patients previously on ruxolitinib therapy, who had an ORR of 3.3%.

Costa Rica is one of the few middle-income countries (MIC) with a long-term high quality nationwide population-based cancer registry. METHODS: Data on incident cancers in children aged under 15 years reported to the Costa Rica National Cancer Registry between 2000 and 2014 were analyzed by diagnostic group, age, sex, and geographical region and compared with incidence data for Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) children in California, USA. RESULTS: During the 15-year period, 2396 cases of childhood cancer were reported in Costa Rica, resulting in an overall age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) of 140/million. Most frequent cancer types were leukemias (40.5%), malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors (13.9%), and lymphomas (12.7%). The observed ASR of lymphoid leukemia (46.9/million) ranked high globally. Low rates were found for most solid tumors including malignant CNS tumors, sympathetic nervous system tumors, and soft tissue sarcomas. There was almost no change in incidence rates over time, while geographical variations were observed within Costa Rica. The overall cancer rate in Costa Rica was lower compared to NHW (176.1/million) and Hispanic (161.7/million) children in California. CONCLUSION: Based on the longstanding registration system, the childhood cancer incidence rates were similar to those observed in other Latin American countries. While a degree of under-ascertainment of cases cannot be excluded, the markedly high leukemia rates, in particular of the lymphoid sub-type deserves further study in this population.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

However, infections with commensal bacteria are an important cause for non-relapse mortality (NRM). We have previously described the impact of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization on the survival of allo-HSCT patients. In the aforementioned publication, according to consensus, we there did not consider the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) to be an MDRO. Since rate of S. maltophilia colonization is increasing, and it is not known whether this poses a risk for allo-HSCT patients, we here analyzed here its effect on the previously described and now extended patient cohort. We report on 291 AML patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Twenty of 291 patients (6.9%) were colonized with S. maltophilia. Colonized patients did not differ from non-colonized patients with respect to their age, remission status before allo-HSCT, donor type and HSCT-comorbidity index. S. maltophilia colonized patients had a worse overall survival (OS) from 6 months up to 60 months (85% vs. 88.1% and 24.7% vs. 59.7%; p = 0.007) due to a higher NRM after allo-HSCT (6 months: 15% vs. 4.8% and 60 months: 40.1% vs. 16.2% p = 0.003). The main cause of mortality in colonized patients was infection (46.2% of all deaths) and in non-colonized patients relapse (58.8% of all deaths). 5/20 colonized patients developed an invasive infection with S. maltophilia. The worse OS after allo-HSCT due to higher infection related mortality might implicate the screening of allo-HSCT patients for S. maltophilia and a closer observation of colonized patients as outpatients.",,"['Scheich, Sebastian', 'Koenig, Rosalie', 'Wilke, Anne C', 'Lindner, Sarah', 'Reinheimer, Claudia', 'Wichelhaus, Thomas A', 'Hogardt, Michael', 'Kempf, Volkhard A J', 'Kessel, Johanna', 'Weber, Sarah', 'Martin, Hans', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Steffen, Bjorn']","['Scheich S', 'Koenig R', 'Wilke AC', 'Lindner S', 'Reinheimer C', 'Wichelhaus TA', 'Hogardt M', 'Kempf VAJ', 'Kessel J', 'Weber S', 'Martin H', 'Bug G', 'Serve H', 'Steffen B']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases Unit, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180719,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/microbiology/mortality', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*microbiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stenotrophomonas maltophilia/drug effects/*growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2018/07/20 06:00,2019/01/18 06:00,['2018/07/20 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0201169 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-00987 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jul 19;13(7):e0201169. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201169. eCollection 2018.,,,7,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6408-3536'],PMC6053200,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed this meta-analysis to assess the association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T/A1298C polymorphism and the adverse reaction after MTX using. METHODS: We searched for qualified studies according to PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science. The meta-analysis was performed by Review Manager 5.3. The analysis was conducted to compare risk ratios (RRs) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) to evaluate the relationship between different toxicity reactions and the genotype of MTHFR. RESULTS: We included 17 studies which satisfied with the criteria in this meta-analysis. The results of our statistical analysis showed that no significant correlation between MTHFR C677T/A1298C genetic polymorphism and patients' toxicity or the relapse and survival associated with MTX chemotherapy (P > .05). But we observed that a tendency toward increased risk of hepatotoxicity was also present for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the mutation model (CT/TT vs. CC: RR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.01-3.67; P = .05). CONCLUSION: The polymorphism of MTHFR C677T/A1298C may not be an important indicator for the accurate detection of side effects of chemotherapy after using MTX.

Prior clinical studies demonstrated a sustained drug ratio and exposure in vivo and prolonged survival versus standard-of-care cytarabine plus daunorubicin chemotherapy (7+3 regimen) in older patients with newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Patients and Methods In this open-label, randomized, phase III trial, 309 patients age 60 to 75 years with newly diagnosed high-risk/sAML received one to two induction cycles of CPX-351 or 7+3 followed by consolidation therapy with a similar regimen. The primary end point was overall survival. Results CPX-351 significantly improved median overall survival versus 7+3 (9.56 v 5.95 months; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.90; one-sided P = .003). Overall remission rate was also significantly higher with CPX-351 versus 7+3 (47.7% v 33.3%; two-sided P = .016). Improved outcomes were observed across age-groups and AML subtypes. The incidences of nonhematologic adverse events were comparable between arms, despite a longer treatment phase and prolonged time to neutrophil and platelet count recovery with CPX-351. Early mortality rates with CPX-351 and 7+3 were 5.9% and 10.6% (two-sided P = .149) through day 30 and 13.7% and 21.2% (two-sided P = .097) through day 60. Conclusion CPX-351 treatment is associated with significantly longer survival compared with conventional 7+3 in older adults with newly diagnosed sAML. The safety profile of CPX-351 was similar to that of conventional 7+3 therapy.",,"['Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Newell, Laura F', 'Lin, Tara L', 'Ritchie, Ellen K', 'Stuart, Robert K', 'Strickland, Stephen A', 'Hogge, Donna', 'Solomon, Scott R', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Bixby, Dale L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Schiller, Gary J', 'Wieduwilt, Matthew J', 'Ryan, Daniel H', 'Hoering, Antje', 'Banerjee, Kamalika', 'Chiarella, Michael', 'Louie, Arthur C', 'Medeiros, Bruno C']","['Lancet JE', 'Uy GL', 'Cortes JE', 'Newell LF', 'Lin TL', 'Ritchie EK', 'Stuart RK', 'Strickland SA', 'Hogge D', 'Solomon SR', 'Stone RM', 'Bixby DL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Schiller GJ', 'Wieduwilt MJ', 'Ryan DH', 'Hoering A', 'Banerjee K', 'Chiarella M', 'Louie AC', 'Medeiros BC']","['Jeffrey E.

We herein demonstrate a multiplexed quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) approach to simultaneously assess the activity and inhibition of multiple protein kinases. In this design, substrate peptides phosphorylated by kinases of interest are specifically harvested by metal-organic framework (MOF)-templated porous CeO2 and consequently transformed to the dephosphorylated forms due to the phosphatase-like activity of CeO2, resulting in a unique quantitative MS signal with an enhanced intensity. Based on the peak area ratios of dephosphorylated variants of the phosphorylated product to respective deuterated internal standard, the activity and inhibition of each kinase can be independently profiled. In addition to the accurate characterization of protein kinase A (PKA) activity and inhibition induced by H-89, the multiplexing capability of the MS-based method allowed quantitative evaluation of the activity of Abl and Src, the two tightly associated kinases in the occurrence of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in a multiplexed format, exhibiting excellent orthogonality for the dual signal readout channels. Moreover, the inactivation of both Abl and Src by the inhibitor imatinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib was simultaneously traced, giving a whole picture of the competition behavior between the kinases for binding therapeutic molecules. This approach holds great promise in global investigation of kinase signal pathways and high-throughput screening of effective protein kinase inhibitors.",,"['Xu, Hongmei', 'Liu, Meng', 'Huang, Xiaodan', 'Min, Qianhao', 'Zhu, Jun-Jie']","['Xu H', 'Liu M', 'Huang X', 'Min Q', 'Zhu JJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Nanjing University , Nanjing 210023 , P.

Extensive leukemic involvement was also found in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, lungs, kidneys, and brain. The cytopathologic features of the abnormal circulating cells were highly suggestive of being megakaryocytic in origin, which was supported by negative myeloperoxidase staining and positive von Willebrand factor staining on immunocytochemistry (ICC). The neoplastic cells were also CD61 positive and had variable von Willebrand factor expression on ICC. Although there were only 25% blast cells in the bone marrow, which theoretically supported myelodysplastic syndrome, the hypothesis that this case represented acute myeloid leukemia of megakaryoblastic origin was confirmed by the continuous increase in circulating blast cell numbers during follow-up visits and the extensive leukemic involvement of parenchymal organs.",['(c) 2018 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.'],"['Rochel, Daphne', 'Abadie, Jerome', 'Robveille, Cynthia', 'Dequeant, Berengere', 'Dagher, Elie', 'Roux, Francoise', 'Jaillardon, Laetitia']","['Rochel D', 'Abadie J', 'Robveille C', 'Dequeant B', 'Dagher E', 'Roux F', 'Jaillardon L']","['Oniris, Department of Biology, Pathology and Food Sciences, Nantes Atlantic College of Veterinary Medicine, Food Science and Engineering, Nantes, France.', 'LabOniris - Veterinary Biological Laboratory, Nantes, France.', 'Oniris, Department of Biology, Pathology and Food Sciences, Nantes Atlantic College of Veterinary Medicine, Food Science and Engineering, Nantes, France.', 'LabOniris - Veterinary Biological Laboratory, Nantes, France.', 'Universite Nantes Angers, Nantes, France.', 'Oniris, Department of Biology, Pathology and Food Sciences, Nantes Atlantic College of Veterinary Medicine, Food Science and Engineering, Nantes, France.', 'LabOniris - Veterinary Biological Laboratory, Nantes, France.', 'Oniris, Department of Biology, Pathology and Food Sciences, Nantes Atlantic College of Veterinary Medicine, Food Science and Engineering, Nantes, France.', 'LabOniris - Veterinary Biological Laboratory, Nantes, France.', 'Oniris, Department of Biology, Pathology and Food Sciences, Nantes Atlantic College of Veterinary Medicine, Food Science and Engineering, Nantes, France.', 'LabOniris - Veterinary Biological Laboratory, Nantes, France.', 'Oniris, Department of Biology, Pathology and Food Sciences, Nantes Atlantic College of Veterinary Medicine, Food Science and Engineering, Nantes, France.', 'Oniris, Emergency and Critical Care Unit, Nantes Atlantic College of Veterinary Medicine, Food Science and Engineering, Nantes, France.', 'Universite Nantes Angers, Nantes, France.', 'Oniris, Department of Biology, Pathology and Food Sciences, Nantes Atlantic College of Veterinary Medicine, Food Science and Engineering, Nantes, France.', 'LabOniris - Veterinary Biological Laboratory, Nantes, France.', 'Universite Nantes Angers, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180719,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Dog Diseases/*pathology', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/pathology/*veterinary', 'Thrombocytosis/etiology/*veterinary']",2018/07/20 06:00,2018/11/09 06:00,['2018/07/20 06:00'],"['2018/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/vcp.12642 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2018 Sep;47(3):363-367. doi: 10.1111/vcp.12642.

Retronectin is well established as an adjuvant for improved retroviral transduction, while its property to enrich less-differentiated T cells is less known. In order to increase these subsets, this study investigated the effects of retronectin-mediated T-cell activation for CD19-specific CART cell production. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors and untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients without or with positive selection for CD3+ T cells were transduced with a CD19.CAR.CD28.CD137zeta third-generation retroviral vector. Activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed by CD3/CD28, CD3/CD28/retronectin, or CD3/retronectin. Interleukin-7 and -15 were supplemented to all cultures. Retronectin was used in all three activation protocols for retroviral transduction. Expansion was assessed by trypan blue staining. Viability, transduction efficiency, immune phenotype, and cytokine production were longitudinally analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytotoxic capacity of generated CART cells was evaluated using a classical chromium-51 release assay. Retronectin-mediated activation resulted in an enrichment of CD8+ cytotoxic CART cells and less-differentiated naive-like T cells (CD45RA+CCR7+). Retronectin-activated CART cells showed increased cytotoxic activity. However, activation with retronectin decreased viability, expansion, transduction efficiency, and cytokine production, particularly of CLL patient-derived CART cells. Both retronectin-mediated activation protocols promoted a less-differentiated CART cell phenotype without comprising cytotoxic properties of healthy donor-derived CART cells. However, up-front retronectin resulted in reduced viability and expansion in CLL patients. This effect is probably attributed to the retronectin-mediated activation of B cells with prolonged CLL persistence. Consequently, CART cell expansion and generation failed.

Previous studies have shown that mRNA CAR T cells are transiently effective but lack persistence and potency across tumor types. It was hypothesized that the efficacy of mRNA CARs could be improved by utilizing recent advancements in RNA technology, such as incorporating a modified nucleoside, 1-methylpseudouridine, into the mRNA and applying a novel purification method using RNase III to eliminate dsRNA contaminants. T cells electroporated with nucleoside-modified and purified mRNA encoding CD19 CAR showed an initial twofold increase in CAR surface expression, as well as a twofold improvement in cytotoxic killing of leukemia cells that persisted up to 5 days. T cells generated with nucleoside-modified and purified CAR mRNA also showed reduced expression of checkpoint regulators and a differential pattern of genetic activation compared to those made with conventional mRNA. In vivo studies using a leukemia mouse model revealed that the most robust 100-fold suppression of leukemic burden was achieved using T cells electroporated with purified mRNAs, regardless of their nucleoside modification.

However, due to immune recognition of endotoxin (a lipid component in the E. coli cell membrane), these protein products must be extensively purified before application to avoid adverse reactions such as septic shock. E. coli-based cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), which has emerged as a promising platform for the development and production of enhanced protein therapeutics, provides a unique opportunity to remove endotoxins prior to protein expression due to its open environment and the absence of live cells. Pre-expression endotoxin removal from CFPS reagents could simplify downstream processing, potentially enabling on-demand production of unique protein therapeutics. Herein, three strategies for removing endotoxins from E. coli cell lysate are evaluated: Triton X-114 two-phase extraction, polylysine affinity chromatography, and extract preparation from genetically engineered, endotoxin-free ClearColi cells. It is demonstrated that current protocols for endotoxin removal treatments insufficiently reduce endotoxin and significantly reduce protein synthesis yields. Further, the first adaptation of ClearColi cells to prepare cell-free extract with high protein synthesis capability is demonstrated. Finally, production of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapeutic crisantaspase from reduced-endotoxin extract and endotoxin-free ClearColi extract is demonstrated.","['(c) 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

But so far, no quinazoline-artemisinin hybrids have been reported in the literature. In the present study, five novel quinazoline-artemisinin hybrids were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro biological activity against malarial parasites (Plasmodium falciparum 3D7), leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000), and human cytomegalovirus. Remarkably, hybrid 9 (EC50 = 1.4 nM), the most active antimalarial compound of this study, was not only more potent than artesunic acid (EC50 = 9.7 nM) but at the same time more active than the clinically used drugs dihydroartemisinin (EC50 = 2.4 nM) and chloroquine (EC50 = 9.8 nM). Furthermore, hybrids 9 and 10 were the most potent compounds with regard to anticytomegaloviral activity (EC50 = 0.15-0.21 muM). They were able to outperform ganciclovir (EC50 = 2.6 muM), which is the relevant standard drug of antiviral therapy, by a factor of 12-17. Moreover, we identified a new highly active quinazoline derivative, compound 14, that is most effective in suppressing cytomegalovirus replication with an EC50 value in the nanomolar range (EC50 = 50 nM). In addition, hybrid 9 exhibited an antileukemia effect similar to that of artesunic acid, with EC50 values in the low micromolar range, and was 45 times more active toward the multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells (EC50 = 0.5 muM) than the standard drug doxorubicin.",,"['Frohlich, Tony', 'Reiter, Christoph', 'Ibrahim, Mohammad M', 'Beutel, Jannis', 'Hutterer, Corina', 'Zeittrager, Isabel', 'Bahsi, Hanife', 'Leidenberger, Maria', 'Friedrich, Oliver', 'Kappes, Barbara', 'Efferth, Thomas', 'Marschall, Manfred', 'Tsogoeva, Svetlana B']","['Frohlich T', 'Reiter C', 'Ibrahim MM', 'Beutel J', 'Hutterer C', 'Zeittrager I', 'Bahsi H', 'Leidenberger M', 'Friedrich O', 'Kappes B', 'Efferth T', 'Marschall M', 'Tsogoeva SB']","['Organic Chemistry Chair I and Interdisciplinary Center for Molecular Materials (ICMM), Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Henkestrasse 42, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Organic Chemistry Chair I and Interdisciplinary Center for Molecular Materials (ICMM), Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Henkestrasse 42, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Organic Chemistry Chair I and Interdisciplinary Center for Molecular Materials (ICMM), Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Henkestrasse 42, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Al al-Bayt, P.O.

Timely detection of silent immune response can rely on immobilizing EcAII, to capture and detect anti-EcAII antibodies. Having recently reported the use of a portable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing device to detect anti-EcAII antibodies in undiluted serum from children undergoing therapy for ALL (Aube et al., ACS Sensors2016, 1 (11), 1358-1365), here we investigate the impact of the quaternary structure and the mode of immobilization of EcAII onto low-fouling SPR sensor chips on the sensitivity and reproducibility of immunosensing. We show that the native tetrameric structure of EcAII, while being essential for activity, is not required for antibody recognition because monomeric EcAII is equally antigenic. By modulating the mode of immobilization, we observed that low-density surface coverage obtained upon covalent immobilization allowed each tetrameric EcAII to bind up to two antibody molecules, whereas high-density surface coverage arising from metal chelation by N- or C-terminal histidine-tag reduced the sensing efficiency to less than one antibody molecule per tetramer. Nonetheless, immobilization of EcAII by metal chelation procured up to 10-fold greater surface coverage, thus resulting in increased SPR sensitivity and allowing reliable detection of lower analyte concentrations. Importantly, only metal chelation achieved highly reproducible immobilization of EcAII, providing the sensing reproducibility that is required for plasmonic sensing in clinical samples. This report sheds light on the impact of multiple factors that need to be considered to optimize the practical applications of plasmonic sensors.",,"['Charbonneau, David M', 'Aube, Alexandra', 'Rachel, Natalie M', 'Guerrero, Vanessa', 'Delorme, Kevin', 'Breault-Turcot, Julien', 'Masson, Jean-Francois', 'Pelletier, Joelle N']","['Charbonneau DM', 'Aube A', 'Rachel NM', 'Guerrero V', 'Delorme K', 'Breault-Turcot J', 'Masson JF', 'Pelletier JN']","['Departement de Chimie and Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'PROTEO Network, Universite Laval, Quebec, Quebec G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Center for Green Chemistry and Catalysis (CGCC), Montreal, Quebec H3A 0B8, Canada.', 'Departement de Chimie and Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Centre for Self-Assembled Chemical Structures (CSACS), Montreal, Quebec H3A 2K6, Canada.', 'Departement de Chimie and Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'PROTEO Network, Universite Laval, Quebec, Quebec G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Center for Green Chemistry and Catalysis (CGCC), Montreal, Quebec H3A 0B8, Canada.', 'Departement de Chimie and Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'PROTEO Network, Universite Laval, Quebec, Quebec G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Center for Green Chemistry and Catalysis (CGCC), Montreal, Quebec H3A 0B8, Canada.', 'Departement de Chimie and Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'PROTEO Network, Universite Laval, Quebec, Quebec G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Center for Green Chemistry and Catalysis (CGCC), Montreal, Quebec H3A 0B8, Canada.', 'Departement de Chimie and Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Centre for Self-Assembled Chemical Structures (CSACS), Montreal, Quebec H3A 2K6, Canada.', 'Departement de Chimie and Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Centre for Self-Assembled Chemical Structures (CSACS), Montreal, Quebec H3A 2K6, Canada.', 'Departement de Chimie and Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'PROTEO Network, Universite Laval, Quebec, Quebec G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Center for Green Chemistry and Catalysis (CGCC), Montreal, Quebec H3A 0B8, Canada.', 'Departement de Chimie and Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170517,United States,ACS Omega,ACS omega,101691658,,,,2017/05/31 00:00,2017/05/31 00:01,['2018/07/20 06:00'],"['2017/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/31 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/acsomega.7b00110 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Omega. 2017 May 31;2(5):2114-2125. doi: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00110.

Similar to other alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl electrophiles, parthenolide induces the heat shock response in leukemia cells, potentially through covalent adduction of heat shock proteins. Other thiol-reactive electrophiles have also been shown to induce the heat shock response as well as to covalently adduct members of the heat shock protein family, such as heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72). To identify sites of modification of Hsp72 by parthenolide, we used high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry to detect 10 lysine, histidine, and cysteine residues of recombinant Hsp72 as modified in vitro by 10 and 100 muM parthenolide. To further ascertain that modification of Hsp72 by parthenolide occurs inside cells and not simply as an in vitro artifact, an alkyne-labeled derivative of parthenolide was synthesized to enable enrichment and detection of protein targets of parthenolide using copper-catalyzed [3 + 2] azide-alkyne cycloaddition. The alkyne-labeled parthenolide derivative displays an half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in undifferentiated acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) of 13.1 +/- 1.1 muM, whereas parthenolide has an IC50 of 4.7 +/- 1.1 muM.

Innovative therapeutic approaches that overcome ineffective treatments on tumor cells may be a potential source of improvement in therapeutic approaches. Suppression of gene expression at transfusion level is one of the important strategies in gene therapy. The expression of PTPN22 and miR-181 genes in all types of hematologic malignancies increases and is likely to contribute to the survival and death of cells by affecting a variety of signaling pathways. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of PTPN22 inhibition by siRNA, and alteration in miR-181a and miR-181b in Jurkat cell line. Methods: Jurkat cells were transfected with 80 pmol of siRNA to inhibit PTPN22. After that, expression of PTPN22 mRNA and transcript levels of miR-181a and miR-181b were measured with Real-time PCR after 48hrs. Results: Experiments demonstrated that siRNA transfection resulted in significant downregulation of PTPN22 mRNA after 48 hrs in 80 pmol dose of siRNA. Moreover, transcript levels of both miR-181a and miR-181b was decreased after transfection. Conclusion: PTPN22, miR-181a and miR-181b might be involved in progression of Jurkat cells and targeting these molecules by RNAi might confer promising tool in treatment of T-ALL.",,"['Baghbani, Elham', 'Khaze, Vahid', 'Sadreddini, Sanam', 'Mokhtarzadeh, Ahad', 'Mansoori, Behzad', 'Mohammadi, Ali', 'Vatankhahan, Vida', 'Toosi, Parisa', 'Baradaran, Behzad']","['Baghbani E', 'Khaze V', 'Sadreddini S', 'Mokhtarzadeh A', 'Mansoori B', 'Mohammadi A', 'Vatankhahan V', 'Toosi P', 'Baradaran B']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180619,Iran,Adv Pharm Bull,Advanced pharmaceutical bulletin,101578021,,,,2018/07/20 06:00,2018/07/20 06:01,['2018/07/20 06:00'],"['2018/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.15171/apb.2018.032 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Pharm Bull. 2018 Jun;8(2):277-282. doi: 10.15171/apb.2018.032.

Seven animals were seropositive (positive group) and seven were seronegative (negative group) for BLV exposure. Leukocytes from each animal were collected and tRFs were extracted for sequencing. tRF5(GlnCTG), tRF5(GlnTTG), and tRF5(HisGTG), were significantly different between seropositive and seronegative groups (P < 0.0067).

While T and B cell antigen receptor (TCR/BCR) signaling induces the recruitment of BCL10 bound to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)1 to the lymphocyte-specific CARMA1/CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM-1) signalosome, alternative CBM complexes utilize different CARMA/CARD scaffolds in distinct innate or inflammatory pathways. BCL10 constitutes the smallest subunit in all CBM signalosomes, containing a 233 amino acid coding for N-terminal CARD as well as a C-terminal Ser/Thr-rich region. BCL10 forms filaments, thereby aggregating into higher-order clusters that mediate and amplify stimulation-induced signals, ultimately leading to MALT1 protease activation and canonical NF-kappaB and JNK signaling. BCL10 additionally undergoes extensive post-translational regulation involving phosphorylation, ubiquitination, MALT1-catalyzed cleavage, and degradation. Through these feedback and feed-forward events, BCL10 integrates positive and negative regulatory processes that govern the function as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly, and destruction of CBM complexes. Thus, BCL10 is a critical regulator for activation as well as termination of immune cell signaling, revealing that its role extends far beyond that of a mere linking factor in CBM complexes.",,"['Gehring, Torben', 'Seeholzer, Thomas', 'Krappmann, Daniel']","['Gehring T', 'Seeholzer T', 'Krappmann D']","['Research Unit Cellular Signal Integration, Institute of Molecular Toxicology and Pharmacology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Research Unit Cellular Signal Integration, Institute of Molecular Toxicology and Pharmacology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Research Unit Cellular Signal Integration, Institute of Molecular Toxicology and Pharmacology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180704,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,2018/07/20 06:00,2018/07/20 06:01,['2018/07/20 06:00'],"['2018/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.01539 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Jul 4;9:1539. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01539. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10', 'CBM complex', 'NF-kappa B', 'T cell signaling', 'adaptive immunity', 'innate immunity']",,,PMC6039553,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 152 children with newly-diagnosed B-ALL who had complete remission after the first cycle of the chemotherapy and had complete follow-up information were enrolled in this study. According to the MRD detection by flow cytometry on day 33 of remission induction, they were divided into three groups: standard-risk (SR) group (MRD <10(-4); n=60), intermediate-risk (IR) group (10(-4)</= MRD <10(-2); n=55), and high-risk (HR) group (MRD >/=10(-2); n=37). Nested RT-PCR was used to determine the IKZF1 genotype of all children before chemotherapy. The effects of MRD level on day 33 of remission induction and IKZF1 genotype on the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of children with B-ALL were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 7 common IKZF1 subtypes in all the 152 children with B-ALL: IK1, IK2/3, IK4, IK6, IK8, IK9, and IK10. Of the 152 children, 130 had functional subtypes of IKZF1 and 22 had non-functional subtypes of IKZF1. During the follow-up period, relapse occurred in 26 (17%) children, and the recurrence rate was highest in the HR group (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate between the SR group and the IR group (P>0.05). The cumulative recurrence rate of the children with non-functional subtypes of IKZF1 was significantly higher than that of those with functional types of IKZF1 (P<0.01). The predicted 5-year RFS rates in the SR, IR, and HR groups were (94.2+/-2.9)%, (86.7+/-3.8)%, and (56.2+/-4.5)% respectively (P<0.05). The 5-year RFS rate of the children with functional subtypes of IKZF1 was significantly higher than that of those with non-functional subtypes of IKZF1 (P<0.01).

Genomic arrays detected 73 aberrations in 39 patients (23%). Most frequently, patients had 1 aberration (25/171; 15%), while 14 patients (8%) had at least 2 aberrations. IGHV status was unmutated in 53/171 (31%) patients. SF3B1 was the most frequently mutated gene (26/171 patients; 15%), followed by NOTCH1 (15/171; 9%).

This report describes the popPK of GO following intravenous administration in 29 pediatric patients aged </= 17 years with relapsed or refractory AML who were enrolled in the 0903A1-102-US phase I/II study. METHODS: The pharmacokinetics (PK) of GO, as represented by total hP67.6 antibody, were described by a two-compartment model with two clearance components: a linear clearance (CL1) and time-dependent clearance that includes a decay coefficient. The PK of unconjugated calicheamicin (UC; payload) were described by a two-compartment model with CL1 and an input rate of formation based on antibody rate of elimination. Allometric scaling was included in both models, with baseline body weight as a fixed effect on CL1 and central volume. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: PK parameters for hP67.6 and UC were not significantly affected by any of the available demographic factors and safety laboratory values tested as covariates (except baseline body weight). Simulations to compare GO dosing regimens (6, 7.5, and 9 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 15 versus, 3 mg/m(2) fractionated dosing on days 1, 4, and 7) were performed, showing that total antibody and UC trough concentrations were maintained at higher concentrations during treatment following the more frequent dosing than following the original regimen.

We aimed to describe the clinical course of patients with hematological malignancies mimicking RS. We studied a series of four patients presenting with apparent RS who were eventually diagnosed with hematological malignancies, and reviewed the relevant literature. Our series consisted of 4 patients, with a mean age of 62.8 +/- 20.3 years, who presented to our rheumatology unit between December 2012 and March 2018. Two patients were initially diagnosed with polyarthritis. One of these patients was eventually diagnosed with multiple myeloma and amyloidosis and the other was diagnosed with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. The third patient was initially diagnosed with migratory arthritis and was eventually diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. The fourth patient was initially diagnosed with giant cell arteritis and eventually diagnosed with anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma. All the patients displayed a very good response to corticosteroid treatment. Vigilance for occult malignancy is essential in the diagnostic workup of RS. A good response to corticosteroids may constitute a major diagnostic pitfall in patients with hematological malignancies presenting with an apparent RS.

In contrast to brain metastases from solid tumours, metastases of ALL seldom involve the parenchyma but are isolated to the leptomeninges, which is an infrequent site for carcinomatous invasion. Although metastasis to the CNS occurs across all subtypes of ALL, a unifying mechanism for invasion has not yet been determined. Here we show that ALL cells in the circulation are unable to breach the blood-brain barrier in mice; instead, they migrate into the CNS along vessels that pass directly between vertebral or calvarial bone marrow and the subarachnoid space. The basement membrane of these bridging vessels is enriched in laminin, which is known to coordinate pathfinding of neuronal progenitor cells in the CNS. The laminin receptor alpha6 integrin is expressed in most cases of ALL. We found that alpha6 integrin-laminin interactions mediated the migration of ALL cells towards the cerebrospinal fluid in vitro. Mice with ALL xenografts were treated with either a PI3Kdelta inhibitor, which decreased alpha6 integrin expression on ALL cells, or specific alpha6 integrin-neutralizing antibodies and showed significant reductions in ALL transit along bridging vessels, blast counts in the cerebrospinal fluid and CNS disease symptoms despite minimally decreased bone marrow disease burden. Our data suggest that alpha6 integrin expression, which is common in ALL, allows cells to use neural migratory pathways to invade the CNS.",,"['Yao, Hisayuki', 'Price, Trevor T', 'Cantelli, Gaia', 'Ngo, Brandon', 'Warner, Matthew J', 'Olivere, Lindsey', 'Ridge, Sarah M', 'Jablonski, Elizabeth M', 'Therrien, Joseph', 'Tannheimer, Stacey', 'McCall, Chad M', 'Chenn, Anjen', 'Sipkins, Dorothy A']","['Yao H', 'Price TT', 'Cantelli G', 'Ngo B', 'Warner MJ', 'Olivere L', 'Ridge SM', 'Jablonski EM', 'Therrien J', 'Tannheimer S', 'McCall CM', 'Chenn A', 'Sipkins DA']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, The National Hospital Organization Hiroshima-Nishi Medical Center, Hiroshima-ken, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Vitrisa Therapeutics, Inc., Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'The Graduate School, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA.', 'Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'LabCorp, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. dorothy.sipkins@duke.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180718,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Integrin alpha6)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology', 'Basement Membrane/metabolism', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Movement', 'Central Nervous System/blood supply/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/metabolism', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Heterografts/immunology/pathology', 'Integrin alpha6/immunology/metabolism', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Laminin/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Skull', 'Subarachnoid Space']",2018/07/20 06:00,2018/11/23 06:00,['2018/07/20 06:00'],"['2017/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41586-018-0342-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41586-018-0342-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Nature. 2018 Aug;560(7716):55-60. doi: 10.1038/s41586-018-0342-5.

This study aimed to identify combination therapies that exploit clinical BH3 mimetics for prostate cancer.Experimental Design: Prostate cancer cells or xenografts were treated with BH3 mimetics as single agents or in combination with other agents, and effects on MCL1 and apoptosis were assessed. MCL1 was also targeted directly using RNAi, CRISPR, or an MCL1-specific BH3 mimetic, S63845.Results: We initially found that MCL1 depletion or inhibition markedly sensitized prostate cancer cells to apoptosis mediated by navitoclax, but not venetoclax, in vitro and in vivo, indicating that they are primed to undergo apoptosis and protected by MCL1 and BCLXL. Small-molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, lapatinib) also dramatically sensitized to navitoclax-mediated apoptosis, and this was associated with markedly increased proteasome-dependent degradation of MCL1. This increased MCL1 degradation appeared to be through a novel mechanism, as it was not dependent upon GSK3beta-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitylation by the ubiquitin ligases betaTRCP and FBW7, or through other previously identified MCL1 ubiquitin ligases or deubiquitinases. Inhibitors targeting additional kinases (cabozantinib and sorafenib) similarly caused GSK3beta-independent MCL1 degradation, and in combination with navitoclax drove apoptosis in vitro and in vivo Conclusions: These results show that prostate cancer cells are primed to undergo apoptosis and that cotargeting BCLXL and MCL1, directly or indirectly through agents that increase MCL1 degradation, can induce dramatic apoptotic responses.

PR1, an HLA-A2 restricted nonameric peptide derived from P3, has been targeted effectively in myeloid leukemia. We previously showed (Molldrem et al. 2003. JClinInvest 111: 639-647) that overexpression of P3 in chronic myeloid leukemia induces apoptosis of high-affinity PR1-specific T cells, leading to deletional tolerance and leukemia outgrowth. In this study, we investigated the effect of membrane P3 (mP3)-expressing PMN and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts on the proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells in vitro. We demonstrate that mP3-expressing PMN significantly inhibits autologous healthy donor T cell proliferation but does not affect cytokine production in activated T cells and that this effect requires cell proximity and was abrogated by P3 blockade. This inhibition required P3 enzyme activity. However, suppression was not reversed by either the addition of catalase or the inhibition of arginase I. In addition to P3 blockade, anti-low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) Ab also restored T cells' capacity to proliferate. Last, we show dose-dependent inhibition of T cell proliferation by mP3-expressing AML blasts. Together, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism whereby PMN- and AML-associated mP3 inhibits T cell proliferation via direct LRP1 and mP3 interaction, and we identify P3 as a novel target to modulate immunity in myeloid leukemia and autoimmune disease.","['Copyright (c) 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Yang, Tian-Hui', 'St John, Lisa S', 'Garber, Haven R', 'Kerros, Celine', 'Ruisaard, Kathryn E', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'Ma, Qing', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J']","['Yang TH', 'St John LS', 'Garber HR', 'Kerros C', 'Ruisaard KE', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Alatrash G', 'Ma Q', 'Molldrem JJ']","['Section of Transplant Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Section of Transplant Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Section of Transplant Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Section of Transplant Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Section of Transplant Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Section of Transplant Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Section of Transplant Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Section of Transplant Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Section of Transplant Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030 jmolldre@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA148600/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180718,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloblastin/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/pathology']",2018/07/20 06:00,2019/07/02 06:00,['2018/07/20 06:00'],"['2018/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1800324 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1800324 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Sep 1;201(5):1389-1399. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800324.

30020622,,Publisher,,,,,2022 Jan,Adenopathy,,,"Lymphadenopathy is a common abnormal finding during the course of the physical exam in general medical practice. Patients and physicians have varying degrees of associated anxiety with the finding of lymphadenopathy as a small number of cases can be caused by neoplasm or infections of consequence, for example, HIV or tuberculosis (TB). However, it is generally recognized that the majority of lymphadenopathy, both localized and generalized, is of benign, self-limited etiology. A clear understanding of lymph node function, location, description, and the etiologies of their enlargement is important in the clinical decisions of which cases need rapid and aggressive workup and which need only be observed.[1][2][3] The lymph node functions as an antigen filter for the reticuloendothelial (RE) system of the body. It consists of a multi-layered sinus that sequentially exposes B-cell lymphocytes, T-cell lymphocytes, and macrophages to an afferent extracellular fluid. In this way, the immune system can recognize and react to foreign proteins and mount an immune response or sequester these proteins as appropriate. In the course of this reaction, there is some multiplication of the responding immune cell line, and thus, the node itself increases in size. It is generally held that a node size is considered enlarged when it is larger than 1 cm. However, the reality is that ""normal"" and ""enlarged"" criteria vary depending on the location of the node and the age of the patient. For example, children younger than 10 years of age have more hypertrophic immune systems, and nodes up to 2 cm can be considered normal in some clinical situations yet, an epitrochlear node of above 0.5 cm is considered pathological in an adult. The pattern, distribution, and quality of the lymphadenopathy can provide much clinical information in the diagnostic process. Lymphadenopathy occurs in 2 patterns: generalized and localized. Generalized lymphadenopathy entails lymphadenopathy in 2 or more non-contiguous locations. Localized adenopathy occurs in contiguous groupings of lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are distributed in discrete anatomical areas, and their enlargement reflects the lymphatic drainage of their location. The nodes themselves may be tender or non-tender, fixed or mobile, and discreet or ""matted"" together. Concomitant symptomatology and the epidemiology of the patient and the illness provide further diagnostic cues. A thorough history of any prodromal illness, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, and localizing symptoms can be very revealing. Additionally, the demographic particulars of the patient, including age, gender, exposure to infectious disease, toxins, medications, and their habits, may provide further cues. As evidenced above, the critical step in evaluation for adenopathy is a careful history and focused physical exam. The extent of the history and physical is determined by the clinical presentation of the patient. For example, a patient with posterior cervical adenopathy, sore throat, and tremendous fatigue need only a careful history, cursory examination, and a mono test, while a person with generalized lymphadenopathy and fatigue would require a much more extensive investigation. Generally, the majority of the lymphadenopathy is localized (some site a 3:1 ratio), with the majority of that being represented in the head and neck region (again, some site a 3:1 ratio). It also is accepted that all generalized lymphadenopathy merits clinical evaluation, and the presence of ""matted lymphadenopathy"" is strongly indicative of significant pathology.Examination of the patient's history, physical examination, and the demographic in which they fall can allow the patient to be placed into 1 of several different accepted algorithms for workup of lymphadenopathy. The use of these cues and selection of the correct arm of the algorithm allows for a fairly rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of lymphadenopathy, including determination when it is safe to observe.[4][5][6] Algorithmic Analysis of Lymphadenopathy After a history and physical examination are completed, lymphadenopathy is placed into 3 categories: 1. ""Diagnostic"" such as strep pharyngitis or upper respiratory tract disease, in which case the course of action is to treat the condition. 2. ""Suggestive"" such as mononucleosis lymphoma or HIV wherein the history and physical strongly suggestive diagnosis specific testing is performed and if positive the action is to treat the condition. 3. ""Unexplained"" where the lymphadenopathy is divided into generalized lymphadenopathy and localized lymphadenopathy. For unexplained localized lymphadenopathy, a review of history, a regional exam, and epidemiological clues are used to separate patients into lower (no risk of malignancy or serious disease) versus higher risk for serious disease or malignancy categories. If the patient is at no risk for malignancy or serious illness, the reasonable course of action is to observe the patient for 3 to 4 weeks to see if the lymphadenopathy resolves or improves. In which case, the clinician is safely cleared to follow the patient. If the lymphadenopathy does not resolve or improve, the next step is to obtain a biopsy. If the patient is judged to have a risk for malignancy or serious illness, the procedure is to proceed immediately to biopsy. For unexplained generalized lymphadenopathy, the key to diagnosis is a history to evaluate for suspected causes. The initial search would be questioning for a mononucleosis-type syndrome such as evidenced by fever atypical lymphocytosis and malaise included in these differentials would be Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and (especially in the case of a flu-like illness and her rash) the initial stages of an HIV infection. The second step in the evaluation of unexplained generalized lymphadenopathy involves a careful review of epidemiological cues. Included in the epidemiological cues would be: 1. Infectious disease exposure. 2. Animal exposure. 3. Insect bites. 4. Recent travel. 5. Complete medication history. 6. Personal habits-smoking, consumption of alcohol, consumption of drugs-special attention to a history of IVTA, high-risk sexual behavior. 7. Consumption of under-cooked food/untreated water. Although there is no ""cookbook"" for the laboratory evaluation of generalized unexplained lymphadenopathy, the initial steps are to obtain a complete blood count (CBC) with a manual differential and EBV serology. If non-diagnostic, the next steps would be PPD placement, RPR, chest x-ray, ANA, hepatitis B surface antigen, and HIV test. Again if any of the above are positive, appropriate treatment can be initiated. In the presence of negative serological examinations and radiological examinations, and or significant symptomology, a biopsy of the abnormal node is the gold standard for diagnosis.Statistics concerning lymphadenopathy are not accurate as the great majority of lymphadenopathy is caused by a non-reportable illness and thus not reported or taken into account. This results in a statistical bias, or skew, toward the reportable causes of lymphadenopathy: malignancies, HIV, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Citations in the recent literature for general medical practice indicate that less than 1% of people with lymphadenopathy have malignant disease most often due to leukemia and younger children Hodgkin disease in adolescence non-Hodgkin disease and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in adults. It has been reported the general prevalence of malignancy is 0.4% in patients under 40 years and around 4% in those older than 40 years of age seen in a primary care setting. It is reported that the prevalence rate of neoplastic disease rises to near 20% in referral centers and rises to 50% or more in patients with initial risk factors.","['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']","['Freeman, Andrew M.', 'Matto, Patricia']","['Freeman AM', 'Matto P']",,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,2018/07/19 06:01,2018/07/19 06:01,,,['NBK513250 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,20180719,['20210714'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2018/07/19 06:01'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

As CT use has increased rapidly, radiation protection is important, particularly among children. We evaluate leukemia and brain tumor risk following exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation from CT scans in childhood. METHODS: For a nationwide retrospective cohort of 168 394 children who received one or more CT scans in a Dutch hospital between 1979 and 2012 who were younger than age 18 years, we obtained cancer incidence, vital status, and confounder information by record linkage with external registries. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using cancer incidence rates from the general Dutch population. Excess relative risks (ERRs) per 100 mGy organ dose were calculated with Poisson regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Standardized incidence ratios were elevated for all cancer sites. Mean cumulative bone marrow doses were 9.5 mGy at the end of follow-up, and leukemia risk (excluding myelodysplastic syndrome) was not associated with cumulative bone marrow dose (44 cases). Cumulative brain dose was on average 38.5 mGy and was statistically significantly associated with risk for malignant and nonmalignant brain tumors combined (ERR/100 mGy: 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.20 to 2.22, P = .002, 84 cases). Excluding tuberous sclerosis complex patients did not substantially change the risk. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that CT-related radiation exposure increases brain tumor risk. No association was observed for leukemia. Compared with the general population, incidence of brain tumors was higher in the cohort of children with CT scans, requiring cautious interpretation of the findings.","['(c) The Author(s) 2018.

Within this family, BH3-only proteins are the sensors of apoptotic stimuli and can trigger apoptosis either by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-family proteins or by directly activating the effectors Bax and Bak. An expanding body of research suggests that a number of non-Bcl-2 proteins can also interact with Bcl-2 proteins and contribute to the decision of cell fate. Dynein light chain (LC8, DYNLL or DLC), a hub protein and a dimerizing engine has been proposed to regulate the pro-apoptotic activity of two BH3-only proteins, Bim and Bmf.

In most patients, leukaemic cells can be kept under control using BCR-ABL1-targeting drugs. However, many patients relapse which remains a clinical challenge. In particular, patients with advanced (accelerated or blast phase) CML have a poor prognosis. So far, little is known about molecular and cellular interactions and features that contribute to disease progression and drug resistance in CML. One key prognostic factor at diagnosis is marked basophilia. However, although basophils are well-known multifunctional effector cells, their impact in CML remains uncertain. In this article, we discuss the potential role of basophils as active contributors to disease evolution and progression in CML. In particular, basophils serve as a unique source of inflammatory, angiogenic and fibrogenic molecules, such as vascular endothelial growth factor or hepatocyte growth factor. In addition, basophils provide vasoactive substances, like histamine as well as the cytokine-degrading enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase IV which may promote stem cell mobilization and the extramedullary spread of stem and progenitor cells. Finally, basophils may produce autocrine growth factors for myeloid cells. Understanding the role of basophils in CML evolution and progression may support the development of more effective treatment concepts.","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

However, the clinical application of ATRA has strict limitations, for its severe side effects due to the accumulation of peripheral blood leukocytes. The scaffold protein RACK1 (Receptor for activated C kinase 1), which regulates multiple signaling pathways, has been proposed to contribute to the survival of leukemic progenitors. But it remains unclear whether it is also involved in the oncogenic growth of APL. In the present study, we demonstrate that silencing of endogenous RACK1 expression synergized with ATRA to promote the death of NB4 and HL-60 APL cells without effect on cell differentiation induced by ATRA. Interestingly, RACK1 knockdown combined with ATRA treatment mainly induces apoptosis. It is distinct to the necrotic cell death induced by idarubicin in combination with ATRA, a regimen extensively used in the clinic to prevent neutrophil accumulation. Further exploration revealed that the lysosome-autophagy pathway is likely to be responsible for the anti-apoptotic role of RACK1. Taken together, our findings indicate that RACK1 is essential in maintaining the malignant features of APL, and targeting RACK1 may have promising therapeutic implications in the treatment of APL.",,"['Wu, Huifang', 'Liu, Jian', 'Huang, Xiaofeng', 'Pian, Lili', 'Cheng, Qianqian', 'Wang, Qingyang', 'Zhao, Min', 'Lin, Zhou', 'Shen, Beifen', 'Zhang, Jiyan', 'Li, Shulian', 'Wang, Jing']","['Wu H', 'Liu J', 'Huang X', 'Pian L', 'Cheng Q', 'Wang Q', 'Zhao M', 'Lin Z', 'Shen B', 'Zhang J', 'Li S', 'Wang J']","[""Henan University Joint National Laboratory for Antibody Drug Engineering, School of Medicine, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Molecular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100850, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Molecular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100850, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Molecular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100850, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan University Joint National Laboratory for Antibody Drug Engineering, School of Medicine, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Molecular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100850, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Molecular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100850, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Molecular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100850, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Molecular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100850, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Molecular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100850, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Molecular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100850, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Molecular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100850, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan University Joint National Laboratory for Antibody Drug Engineering, School of Medicine, Henan University, Kaifeng, 475004, People's Republic of China.

The underlying epigenetic mechanism remains elusive. METHODS: We evaluated the potential role of megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1), as a bridge linking epigenetic activation of NOX to ROS production and cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. RESULTS: Following IR injury, MKL1-deficient (knockout) mice exhibited smaller myocardial infarction along with improved heart function compared with wild-type littermates. Similarly, pharmaceutical inhibition of MKL1 with CCG-1423 also attenuated myocardial infarction and improved heart function in mice. Amelioration of IR injury as a result of MKL1 deletion or inhibition was accompanied by reduced ROS in vivo and in vitro. In response to IR, MKL1 levels were specifically elevated in macrophages, but not in cardiomyocytes, in the heart. Of note, macrophage-specific deletion (MvarphicKO), instead of cardiomyocyte-restricted ablation (CMcKO), of MKL1 in mice led to similar improvements of infarct size, heart function, and myocardial ROS generation. Reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that MKL1 directly bound to the promoters of NOX genes to activate NOX transcription. Mechanistically, MKL1 recruited the histone acetyltransferase MOF (male absent on the first) to modify the chromatin structure surrounding the NOX promoters. Knockdown of MOF in macrophages blocked hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced NOX transactivation and ROS accumulation. Of importance, pharmaceutical inhibition of MOF with MG149 significantly downregulated NOX1/NOX4 expression, dampened ROS production, and normalized myocardial function in mice exposed to IR injury. Finally, administration of a specific NOX1/4 inhibitor GKT137831 dampened ROS generation and rescued heart function after IR in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data delineate an MKL1-MOF-NOX axis in macrophages that contributes to IR injury, and as such we have provided novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.",,"['Yu, Liming', 'Yang, Guang', 'Zhang, Xinjian', 'Wang, Peng', 'Weng, Xinyu', 'Yang, Yuyu', 'Li, Zilong', 'Fang, Mingming', 'Xu, Yong', 'Sun, Aijun', 'Ge, Junbo']","['Yu L', 'Yang G', 'Zhang X', 'Wang P', 'Weng X', 'Yang Y', 'Li Z', 'Fang M', 'Xu Y', 'Sun A', 'Ge J']","['Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, China (L.Y., G.Y., X.Z., Z.L., M.F., Y.X.).', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, China (L.Y., G.Y., X.Z., Z.L., M.F., Y.X.).', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, China (L.Y., G.Y., X.Z., Z.L., M.F., Y.X.).', 'Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Zhongshan Hospital (P.W., X.W., A.S., J.G.), Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences (P.W., X.W., A.S., J.G.), Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Zhongshan Hospital (P.W., X.W., A.S., J.G.), Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences (P.W., X.W., A.S., J.G.), Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China (Y.Y.).', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, China (L.Y., G.Y., X.Z., Z.L., M.F., Y.X.).', 'Institute of Biomedical Research, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, China (Z.L., Y.X.).', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, China (L.Y., G.Y., X.Z., Z.L., M.F., Y.X.).', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Intervention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, China (L.Y., G.Y., X.Z., Z.L., M.F., Y.X.).', 'Institute of Biomedical Research, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, China (Z.L., Y.X.).', 'Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Zhongshan Hospital (P.W., X.W., A.S., J.G.), Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences (P.W., X.W., A.S., J.G.), Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Zhongshan Hospital (P.W., X.W., A.S., J.G.), Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences (P.W., X.W., A.S., J.G.), Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,"['0 (Anilides)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CCG 1423)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MG149)', '0 (Mrtfa protein, mouse)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Salicylates)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Anilides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Chromatin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocardial Reperfusion Injury/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myocardium/metabolism/pathology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Salicylates/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",2018/07/19 06:00,2019/09/29 06:00,['2018/07/19 06:00'],"['2018/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035377 [pii]', '10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035377 [doi]']",ppublish,Circulation. 2018 Dec 11;138(24):2820-2836. doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035377.,['NOTNLM'],"['*epigenetics', '*ischemia-reperfusion injury', '*reactive oxygen species', '*transcriptional regulator']",24,,,,,,"['Circulation. 2018 Dec 11;138(24):2837-2840.

Very limited earlier data are available on familial clustering of BOTs with other cancers. We aim to explore histology-specific familial associations among BOTs and associations between BOTs and any invasive cancers.Methods: On the basis of 16.1 million individuals in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, we estimated familial risks for overall or histology-specific patients with BOT considering both BOT and any invasive cancers in first-degree relatives (parents or siblings), as well as familial risks for invasive cancers considering family history of BOTs.Results: A total of 4,199 BOT cases were found in the offspring generation; among them, 34 (0.8%) cases had first-degree relatives diagnosed with any BOT, and 2,489 (59.3%) cases with any invasive cancers. A family history of BOT was associated with risks for all BOTs (RR = 2.20, P < 0.001). Papillary BOT in first-degree relatives was associated with the increased risk of having the same type of BOT (RR = 10.10, P < 0.001). BOTs showed familial associations with some invasive cancers, most consistently with colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, lung, and bone cancers, and with leukemia. In histologic analyses, associations of BOT with even rare cancers of the anus, thyroid, and endocrine glands were noted.Conclusions: BOTs may share susceptibility with themselves and a number of invasive cancers.Impact: These results provide insight into familial associations of BOT for the first time, which may help with the etiologic mechanism and preventive strategy of BOTs, as well as the genetic counseling for patients with BOT.

Complete remission (CR) rates were 34% for patients receiving blinatumomab and 16% for those receiving SOC. Adverse events were consistent with those observed in prior trials, with cytokine release syndrome and some neurologic events, including tremor, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and depression, observed more frequently in the blinatumomab arm, whereas neutropenia and infection were less common among patients receiving blinatumomab. Depression emerged as a rare but potentially severe neurologic event associated with blinatumomab. In ALCANTARA, a single-arm trial of blinatumomab in patients with Ph-positive R/R ALL, the CR rate was 31%, and adverse events were similar to those observed previously in Ph-negative R/R ALL. These results support conversion from accelerated to regular approval of blinatumomab for R/R ALL and broadening of the intended population to include both Ph-positive and Ph-negative precursor B-cell R/R ALL. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In TOWER, a randomized trial in patients with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), treatment with blinatumomab showed superiority over conventional chemotherapy for complete remission (CR) rate (34% vs. 16%) and survival (3.7-month improvement in median; hazard ratio, 0.71). In ALCANTARA, a single-arm trial of blinatumomab for treatment of relapsed or refractory Ph-positive precursor B-cell ALL, the CR rate was 31%. Blinatumomab is now approved for treatment of relapsed or refractory precursor B-cell ALL that is Ph positive or Ph negative.","['Published 2018.

Activating mutations in PTPN11 increase downstream proliferative signaling and cell survival. We investigated the signaling upstream of PTPN11 in JMML and AML cells and found that PTPN11 was activated by the nonreceptor tyrosine/serine/threonine kinase TNK2 and that PTPN11-mutant JMML and AML cells were sensitive to TNK2 inhibition. In cultured human cell-based assays, PTPN11 and TNK2 interacted directly, enabling TNK2 to phosphorylate PTPN11, which subsequently dephosphorylated TNK2 in a negative feedback loop. Mutations in PTPN11 did not affect this physical interaction but increased the basal activity of PTPN11 such that TNK2-mediated activation was additive. Consequently, coexpression of TNK2 and mutant PTPN11 synergistically increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and enhanced colony formation in bone marrow cells from mice. Chemical inhibition of TNK2 blocked MAPK signaling and colony formation in vitro and decreased disease burden in a patient with PTPN11-mutant JMML who was treated with the multikinase (including TNK2) inhibitor dasatinib. Together, these data suggest that TNK2 is a promising therapeutic target for PTPN11-mutant leukemias.","['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Although mast cells (MCs) reportedly express CD44, little is known about the regulation and function of this receptor in neoplastic cells in systemic mastocytosis (SM). We found that clonal CD34(+)/CD38(-) stem cells, CD34(+)/CD38(+) progenitor cells, and CD117(++)/CD34(-) MCs invariably express CD44 in patients with indolent SM (ISM), SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, aggressive SM, and MC leukemia (MCL). In addition, all human MCL-like cell lines examined (HMC-1, ROSA, and MCPV-1) displayed cytoplasmic and cell-surface CD44. We also found that expression of CD44 in neoplastic MCs depends on RAS-MEK and STAT5 signaling and increases with the aggressiveness of SM. Correspondingly, higher levels of soluble CD44 were measured in the sera of patients with advanced SM compared with ISM or cutaneous mastocytosis and were found to correlate with overall and progression-free survival. To investigate the functional role of CD44, a xenotransplantation model was employed using severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, HMC-1.2 cells, and a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against CD44. In this model, the shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD44 resulted in reduced MC expansion and tumor formation and prolonged survival in SCID mice compared with HMC-1.2 cells transduced with control shRNA. Together, our data show that CD44 is a RAS-MEK/STAT5-driven MC invasion receptor that correlates with the aggressiveness of SM. Whether CD44 can serve as therapeutic target in advanced SM remains to be determined in forthcoming studies.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Mueller, Niklas', 'Wicklein, Daniel', 'Eisenwort, Gregor', 'Jawhar, Mohamad', 'Berger, Daniela', 'Stefanzl, Gabriele', 'Greiner, Georg', 'Boehm, Alexandra', 'Kornauth, Christoph', 'Muellauer, Leonhard', 'Sehner, Susanne', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Staber, Philipp B', 'Jaeger, Ulrich', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Arock, Michel', 'Schumacher, Udo', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Valent, Peter']","['Mueller N', 'Wicklein D', 'Eisenwort G', 'Jawhar M', 'Berger D', 'Stefanzl G', 'Greiner G', 'Boehm A', 'Kornauth C', 'Muellauer L', 'Sehner S', 'Hoermann G', 'Sperr WR', 'Staber PB', 'Jaeger U', 'Zuber J', 'Arock M', 'Schumacher U', 'Reiter A', 'Valent P']","['Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Anatomy and Experimental Morphology, University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Center for Experimental Medicine, Institute for Medical Biometry and Epidemiology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria.', 'Molecular and Cellular Oncology Unit, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Paris, France; and.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Institute of Anatomy and Experimental Morphology, University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['P 27132/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180717,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/analysis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics/pathology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2018/07/19 06:00,2019/08/17 06:00,['2018/07/19 06:00'],"['2018/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60637-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-02-833582 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Nov 1;132(18):1936-1950. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-02-833582.

Despite ibrutinib's ability to produce durable remissions in patients, acquired resistance can develop, mostly commonly by mutation of C481 of BTK in the ibrutinib binding site. Here, we characterize a novel BTK inhibitor, GDC-0853, to evaluate its preclinical efficacy in ibrutinib-naive and ibrutinib-resistant CLL. GDC-0853 is unique among reported BTK inhibitors in that it does not rely upon covalent reaction with C481 to stabilize its occupancy within BTK's adenosine triphosphate binding site. As with ibrutinib, GDC-0853 potently reduces B-cell receptor signaling, viability, NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, activation, and migration in treatment naive CLL cells. We found that GDC-0853 also inhibits the most commonly reported ibrutinib-resistant BTK mutant (C481S) both in a biochemical enzyme activity assay and in a stably transfected 293T cell line and maintains cytotoxicity against patient CLL cells harboring C481S BTK mutations. Additionally, GDC-0853 does not inhibit endothelial growth factor receptor or ITK, 2 alternative targets of ibrutinib that are likely responsible for some adverse events and may reduce the efficacy of ibrutinib-antibody combinations, respectively. Our results using GDC-0853 indicate that noncovalent, selective BTK inhibition may be effective in CLL either as monotherapy or in combination with therapeutic antibodies, especially among the emerging population of patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Reiff, Sean D', 'Muhowski, Elizabeth M', 'Guinn, Daphne', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Fabian, Catherine A', 'Cheney, Carolyn', 'Mantel, Rose', 'Smith, Lisa', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Young, Wendy B', 'Johnson, Adam R', 'Liu, Lichuan', 'Byrd, John C', 'Woyach, Jennifer A']","['Reiff SD', 'Muhowski EM', 'Guinn D', 'Lehman A', 'Fabian CA', 'Cheney C', 'Mantel R', 'Smith L', 'Johnson AJ', 'Young WB', 'Johnson AR', 'Liu L', 'Byrd JC', 'Woyach JA']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, and.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.']",['eng'],"['R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA197870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA178183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA177292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA183444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180717,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'E9L2885WUL (fenebrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', '*Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Piperidines', '*Pyrazoles', 'Pyridones/*pharmacology', '*Pyrimidines']",2018/07/19 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/07/19 06:00'],"['2017/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)31936-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-10-809020 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Sep 6;132(10):1039-1049. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-10-809020.

The NEDD8-targeting drug MLN4924, which inactivates cullin ring-finger ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), has been examined in clinical trials for various types of lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia. However, the essential role of CRL4(DCAF2) in primary myeloid cells remains poorly understood. MLN4924 treatment, which mimics DCAF2 depletion, also promotes the severity of mouse psoriasis models, consistent with the effects of reduced DCAF2 expression in various autoimmune diseases. Using transcriptomic and immunological approaches, we showed that CRL4(DCAF2) in dendritic cells (DCs) regulates the proteolytic fate of NIK and negatively regulates IL-23 production.

Herein, we document the essential role of the interplay between histone deacetylases (HDACs), the polycomb group proteins, pluripotency transcription factors and the cell cycle machinery in the viability, oncogenicity and therapy evasion of IM-resistant CD34+/CD38- CML stem cells (CML-SCs). Using the proteotranscriptomic analyses of wild type (WT), CD34+/CD38+ and CD34+/CD38- K562 or KU812 cells, we showed that CD34+/CD38- SC-enriched cells expressed significantly higher levels of CD44, CD133, SOX2, Nanog, OCT4, and c-Myc mRNA and/or protein, compared to the WT or CD34+/CD38+ cells. This overexpression of stemness factors in the CD34+/CD38- cells positively correlates with enhanced expression of HDACs 1-6, cyclins D1/D3, CDK 2, 4 and 6, while inversely correlating with p18, p21 and p27. Enhanced co-expression of MDR1, survivin, and Bcl-2 proteins, supposedly involved in IM-resistance and CML-SC survival, was detected in both CD34+/CD38- and CD34+/CD38+ cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that in synergism with IM, SAHA reverses the tumor-promoting proteotranscriptomic profile noted above and elicits marked inhibition of the CML-SCs by up-regulating hsa-miR-196a expression. This hsa-miR-196a-mediated SC-limiting effect of SAHA is dose-dependent, low-dosed, cell cycle-modulating and accompanied by leukemic SC apoptosis. Interestingly, this anti-SC therapeutic activity of SAHA in vitro was reproduced in vivo using the NOD-SCID mice models.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Selection of a pre-existing TP53 mutated clone prone to acquire additional mutational events has been suggested as the main pathogenic mechanism of t-AML. Here, we report a unique case of t-AML which developed from a pre-existing DNMT3A mutated clone that persisted in the patient for more than 10years despite treatment with intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old male was diagnosed with AML harboring a normal karyotype and mutations in the NPM1 (c.863_864ins, p.W288fs*12), DNMT3A (c.2645G>A, p.R882H), and IDH1 (c.395G>A, p.R132H) genes. He achieved complete remission with intensive chemotherapy and was subsequently submitted to alloHSCT. Eleven years later, he was given chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat a lung carcinoma. Three years later, t-AML was diagnosed; the disease had arisen from a pre-existing DNMT3A mutated patient-origin clone that had subsequently acquired a TP53 mutation and a complex karyotype. Although a second transplantation was intended, the disease was refractory to induction chemotherapy, and the patient eventually died from disease complications. We retrospectively demonstrated the persistence and post-transplantation latency of the R882H-DNMT3A mutation using a real-time PCR allele-specific analysis at different time-points during the observation period. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The present case highlights the potential clinical implications of a R882H-DNMT3A mutated clone that persisted after conventional AML treatment, including alloHSCT. It also reinforces the notion of the importance of cell non-intrinsic factors, such as the hematopoietic-stress induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as drivers of clonal expansion.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data from 229 CLL patients were retrospectively evaluated. The main aims of the study were to describe the changes in clinical stage during the course of CLL as a result of the response to treatment and to determine the time to next therapy (TTNT) and overall survival (OS) according to those changes, in particular, among the heterogeneous International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) partial response (PR) category. RESULTS: Among the patients in the IWCLL PR category, differences were found in TTNT and OS according to the clinical stage at the response evaluation. With a median follow-up period of 91 months (range, 2-390 months), patients with a PR- Binet A at the response evaluation had significantly longer TTNT and OS compared with those with PR-Binet B/C (median TTNT, 26 vs. 11 months; P = .00; median OS, 63 vs. 43 months; P = .047). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study have shown that for patients with CLL, the Binet clinical stages are good outcome predictors throughout the disease course and also suggest that changes in Binet clinical stage could be useful as response surrogates and to divide the IWCLL PR category into different prognostic subgroups.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: cross-sectional study of 54 survivors aged >/=18 and who have a survival rate of more than 10 years. Quality of life was assessed by personal interview using SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: 53.7% of AL survivors developed more than one comorbidity (24.7% hypothyroidism; 20.3% obesity; 14.8% metabolic syndrome; 18.5% subclinical cardiac dysfunction); 20.3% of them were severe. 73.3% of high-risk leukaemias and 66.6% of patients treated with radiotherapy or stem cells transplantation reported long-term comorbidity, P<.05. Global quality of live score was: 86.3 (14) (classified as very good). Patients with high-risk acute leukaemia (83.2 vs. 89.5), severe long-term comorbidities (80.4 vs. 89.7) and females (81.8 vs. 89.9), reported worse quality of life, P<.05. Physical summary score was worse in: obese (80 vs. 92) and hypothyroid (84.9 vs. 92.4) and radiotherapy-treated survivors (82.3 vs. 87.5); mental summary was worse in survivors with hypogonadism (68.2 vs. 86.3) and trasplanted patients (77.2 vs. 83.1), P<.05. CONCLUSIONS: Acute leukaemia survivors reported an increase prevalence of chronic comorbidities, related to cancer-treatment. Despite a decrease in scores for certain physical or mental items, global quality of life was very good in all acute leukaemia survivors, even better than compared with the general population.","['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

FLT3-ITD upregulates the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM-1) expression and promotes the proliferation of AML cells. In this study, we investigated the role of protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation on the expression and function of PIM-1L. Drug screening in leukemia cell lines revealed that sotrastaurin (a PKC inhibitor) suppressed the proliferation of the FLT3-ITD-positive AML cell line MV4-11 but not of K562, HL60, or KG-1a cells, similar to SGI-1776 (a PIM-1/FLT3 inhibitor) and quizartinib (an FLT3 inhibitor). Sotrastaurin decreased the expression of pro-survival protein myeloid cell leukemia (MCL-1) and the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), both of which are downstream effectors of PIM-1. PKCalpha directly phosphorylated Ser65 of PIM-1L, which is a long isoform of PIM-1. The PKCalpha-mediated phosphorylation stabilized PIM-1L. The phosphorylation-mimicked mutant, PIM-1L-S65D, was more stable and showed higher kinase activity than PIM-1L-S65A. Expression of PIM-1L-wildtype or -S65D reduced sotrastaurin-mediated apoptosis and growth inhibition in MV4-11 transfectants. These results suggest that PKCalpha directly upregulates PIM-1L, resulting in promotion of the survival and proliferation of AML cells.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report evidence favoring such a role for the Pre-B-cell leukemia homebox (PBX) family member PBX3. METHODS: Western blot, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and datasets mining were used to determined proteins or genes expression levels. Wound-healing and transwell assays were used to examine the invasive abilities of GBM cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to determine how let-7b regulates PBX3. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and rescue experiments were performed to investigate the involved molecular mechanisms. Orthotopic mouse models were used to assess the role of PBX3 in vivo. RESULTS: We found that PBX3 expression levels positively correlated with glioma mesenchymal markers. Ectopic expression of PBX3 promoted invasive phenotypes and triggered the expression of mesenchymal markers, whereas depletion of PBX3 reduced GBM cell invasive abilities and decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers. In addition, inhibition of PBX3 attenuated transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)-induced GBM mesenchymal transition. Mechanistic studies revealed that PBX3 mediated GBM mesenchymal transition through activation of MEK/ERK1/2, leading to increased expression of LIN28 by c-myc. Increased LIN28 inhibited let-7b biogenesis, which then promoted the pro-invasive genes, such as HMGA2 and IL-6. Furthermore, let-7b suppressed PBX3 by directly targeting 3'-UTR of PBX3. Thus, repressed let-7b by PBX3 amplifies PBX3 signaling and forms a positive feedback loop to promote GBM mesenchymal transition. CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the importance of PBX3 as a key driver of mesenchymal transition and potential therapeutic target.",,"['Xu, Xiupeng', 'Bao, Zhongyuan', 'Liu, Yinlong', 'Jiang, Kuan', 'Zhi, Tongle', 'Wang, Dong', 'Fan, Liang', 'Liu, Ning', 'Ji, Jing']","['Xu X', 'Bao Z', 'Liu Y', 'Jiang K', 'Zhi T', 'Wang D', 'Fan L', 'Liu N', 'Ji J']","['Department of Neurosurgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Guangzhou Road 300, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Guangzhou Road 300, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Neurosurgery, Yixing People's Hospital, Yixing, Jiangsu, China."", 'Department of Neurosurgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Guangzhou Road 300, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Guangzhou Road 300, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Guangzhou Road 300, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Guangzhou Road 300, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Guangzhou Road 300, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. jijing@njmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['81300998/National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)', '81471269/National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)', 'BK20131022/Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province', 'BK20160047/Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province', ""XK201117/Jiangsu Province's Key Discipline of Medicine"", 'PAPD/Jiangsu Province and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu', 'Higher Education Institutions', 'KJXW2017038/Youth Science Foundation of Suzhou China', 'ky216r201307/the Specially Appointed Professor Foundation of Jiangsu Province']",['Journal Article'],20180717,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2018/07/19 06:00,2019/06/15 06:00,['2018/07/19 06:00'],"['2017/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-018-0841-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-018-0841-0 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2018 Jul 17;37(1):158. doi: 10.1186/s13046-018-0841-0.,['NOTNLM'],"['C-myc', 'ERK1/2', 'GBM', 'LIN28/let-7b', 'Mesenchymal transition', 'PBX3']",1,,PMC6050701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UGT1A1 is a major UGT1A isoform expressed in human liver. METHODS: UGT1A1*6 and *28 polymorphisms resulting in reduced UGT1A1 activity were genotyped in 726 adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with Ara-C based regimens. Influences of both polymorphisms on chemosensitivity and disease prognosis of the patients were evaluated. RESULTS: After one or two courses of Ara-C based induction chemotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rate was significantly higher in patients carrying the UGT1A1*6 (77.0%) or the UGT1A1*28 (76.4%) alleles as compared with corresponding wild-type homozygotes (66.9 and 68.5%, respectively). Carriers of the UGT1A1*6 or *28 alleles showed significantly decreased risk of non-CR (OR = 0.528, 95% CI 0.379-0.737, P = 1.7 x 10(-4)) and better overall survival (HR = 0.787, 95% CI 0.627-0.990, P = 0.040) as compared with homozygotes for both polymorphisms.

Currently, treatment options offer a 5year survival of <60%. In elderly patients, where the incidence is highest, the survival is much lower. Current standard treatments have significant toxicity and are least well tolerated in older adults, where the need is greatest. Therefore, alternatives are required. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), due to the specific targeting to cell surface proteins (i.e. antigens), represent a promising strategy for drug delivery to malignant cells. This concept favours the therapeutic ratio simultaneously by reducing toxicity and increasing efficacy. Although delivery of chemotherapeutics, genes and imaging agents using multifunctional nanoparticles has been substantially explored in treating solid cancers, less information on this approach is available in the case of AML.

The compound is currently administered to patients intravenously (i.v.) at low pH (3.5) due to solubility challenges. Reliance of low pH to enhance solubility of CX-5461 can adversely impact pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and therapeutic potential. We have addressed this solubility issue through a formulation method that relies on the interactions between CX-5461 and copper. Copper binds CX-5461 through the nitrogens of the pyrazine ring. Here, we describe synthesizing this copper-complexed CX-5461 (Cu(CX-5461)) within liposomes. CX-5461 was added to copper-containing liposomes and incubated at 60 degrees C for 30min. The pharmacokinetics of CX-5461 was assessed in mice following a single i.v. injection at 30mg/kg. Efficacy studies were completed in multiple subcutaneous mouse xenografts as well as in a bone marrow engraftment model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The novel Cu(CX-5461) formulation was stable at pH7.4 and exhibited increased plasma circulation longevity, increasing the total exposure to CX5461 by an order of magnitude. Cu(CX-5461) was more active than CX-5461 in AML models in vivo. In HCT116-B46 and Capan-1 solid tumour models that are BRCA-deficient, the Cu(CX-5461) formulation engendered activity that was comparable to that of the low pH CX-5461 formulation. We have generated the first Cu(CX-5461) formulation suitable for i.v. administration that is more efficacious than the existing low-pH formulation in pre-clinical models of AML. The Cu(CX-5461) formulation may serve as an alternative formulation for CX-5461 in BRCA-deficient cancers.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study of extended CC-486 dosing included patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). After a pharmacokinetic assessment period, 31 patients (MDS n = 18, CMML n = 4, and AML n = 9) entered a clinical phase in which they received CC-486 300 mg once-daily for 21 days of repeated 28-day cycles. Median age was 71 years (range: 53-93); 42% of patients were aged >/=75 years. A total of 5 patients with AML (63%) had prior MDS. Median number of CC-486 treatment cycles was 4 (range: 1-32). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were gastrointestinal (84% of patients) and hematologic (81%). Most common grade 3-4 TEAEs were neutropenia (n = 13, 42%) and anemia (n = 9, 29%). Ten patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia. Infrequently, CC-486 dose was interrupted or reduced due to gastrointestinal (n = 5, 16%) or hematologic (n = 6, 19%) TEAEs. Overall response rate (complete remission [CR], CR with incomplete hematological recovery [CRi], partial remission [PR], marrow CR) in the MDS/CMML subgroups was 32% and in the AML subgroup (CR/CRi/PR) was 22%. Red blood cell transfusion independence rates in the MDS/CMML and AML subgroups were 33% and 25%, respectively, and 2 MDS/CMML patients attained hematologic improvement as a best response on-study. No baseline gene mutation was predictive of response/nonresponse. CC-486 allows flexible dosing and schedules to improve tolerability or response. Neutropenia in early treatment cycles deserves scrutiny and may warrant initiation of prophylactic antibiotics. KEY POINTS: The safety profile of oral CC-486 was comparable to that of injectable azacitidine; most adverse events were hematological and gastrointestinal. Extended (21-day/cycle) CC-486 dosing induced responses in patients with hematological malignancies, many of whom had prior DNMTi failure.","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

A hierarchical model of communication was proposed, based on a theoretical framework of warmth and control. Methods: The sample included 115 children (age 5-17 years) with new or newly relapsed cancer (41% leukemia, 18% lymphoma, 6% brain tumor, and 35% other) and their mothers. Mothers reported distress (Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Impact of Events Scale-Revised) 2 months after diagnosis (Time 1). Three months later (Time 2), mother-child dyads were video-recorded discussing cancer. Maternal communication was coded with the Iowa Family Interaction Ratings Scales. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated poor fit. Exploratory factor analysis suggested a six-factor model (root mean square error of approximation = .04) with one factor reflecting Positive Communication, four factors reflecting Negative Communication (Hostile/Intrusive, Lecturing, Withdrawn, and Inconsistent), and one factor reflecting Expression of Negative Affect. Maternal distress symptoms at Time 1 were all significantly, negatively related to Positive Communication and differentially related to Negative Communication factors at Time 2.

Nevertheless, overtreatment-related toxicity and resistance to therapy have not been fully prevented. In the present study, we evaluated for the first time the clinical impact of the apoptosis-related BCL2L12 gene in prognosis and risk stratification of BFM-treated childhood ALL. Methods Bone marrow specimens were obtained from childhood ALL patients upon disease diagnosis and the end-of-induction (EoI; day 33) of the BFM protocol, as well as from control children. Following total RNA extraction and reverse transcription, BCL2L12 expression levels were determined by qPCR. Patients' cytogenetics, immunophenotyping and minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation were performed according to the international guidelines. Results BCL2L12 expression was significantly increased in childhood ALL and correlated with higher BCL2/BAX expression ratio and favorable disease markers. More importantly, BCL2L12 expression was associated with disease remission, while the reduced BCL2L12 expression was able to predict patients' poor response to BFM therapy, in terms of M2-M3 response and MRD>/=0.1% on day 15. The survival analysis confirmed the significantly higher risk of the BFM-treated patients underexpressing BCL2L12 at disease diagnosis for early relapse and worse survival. Lastly, evaluation of BCL2L12 expression clearly strengthened the prognostic value of the established disease prognostic markers, leading to superior prediction of patients' outcome and improved specificity of BFM risk stratification.

We analyzed the clinical, demographic, and biological characteristics and treatment response of children with DS-ALL versus those WDS-ALL. Patients and methods: Patients with ALL between January 1990 and November 2016. The demographic and biologic characteristics and treatment response were compared using the chi(2) and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The overall survival and event-free interval (EFI) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. RESULTS: 1795 patients were included; 54 had DS. Patients with DS-ALL were older (p= 0.0189). All had B-cell precursor immunophenotype and a lower incidence of recurrent abnormalities (p < 0.0001). They showed a better response rate to prednisone (p= 0.09) and a higher mortality in induction and complete remission (p < 0.0001). All deaths of patients with DS-ALL were treatment-related. The event-free survival (EFS) was 47% (+/- 8%) versus 73% (+/- 1%) (p= 0.006) and the EFI was 54% (+/- 9%) versus 75% (+/- 1%) (p= 0.0297) among patients with DS-ALL versus those WDS-ALL, respectively. The rate of relapse was similar in both groups (p= 0.6894). The EFI of patients with DS-ALL was lower in the group aged 6-9 years: 39% (+/- 19%) (p= 0.7885).

Formaldehyde-induced DNA-protein crosslinks and enhanced cell proliferation are important in the pathogenesis of nasal cancer and, potentially, leukemia. Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene Trp53 have been associated with formaldehyde-induced nasal tumors and might be a key mechanistic event in formaldehyde-induced leukemia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential role of the Trp53 gene in formaldehyde-induced nasal carcinogenicity, leukemia or lymphohematopoietic cancer, and potentially other neoplasms in genetically susceptible mice. Male Trp53 haploinsufficient (Trp53(+)) mouse strains (B6.129-Trp53(tm1Brd) and C3B6.129F1-Trp53(tm1Brd)) were exposed to 0-, 7.5- or 15-ppm formaldehyde (25/group) 6 h/d, 5 d/wk for 8 wk, and then held for 32 wk. Blood was collected for hematology, and major tissues and gross lesions were collected for histopathology. The primary formaldehyde-related finding was squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium of the nose. Inhalation of a maximum tolerated dose of formaldehyde caused significant injury to the nasal mucosa and cell proliferation, but did not cause nasal tumors or an increased prevalence of leukemia or lymphohematopoietic cancer in Trp53(+) mice. All observed neoplasms were considered background lesions for these mouse strains. The results of this short-term carcinogenicity study do not support a role for Trp53 in formaldehyde-induced neoplasia.",,"['Morgan, Daniel L.', 'Dixon, Darlene', 'King, Debra H.', 'Travlos, Greg S.', 'Herbert, Ronald A.', 'French, John E.', 'Tokar, Erik J.', 'Waalkes, Michael P.', 'Jokinen, Michael P.']","['Morgan DL', 'Dixon D', 'King DH', 'Travlos GS', 'Herbert RA', 'French JE', 'Tokar EJ', 'Waalkes MP', 'Jokinen MP']",,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book']",,Durham (NC),,,,,,,2018/07/18 06:01,2018/07/18 06:01,,,['NBK513193 [bookaccession]'],,,['NLM'],"['formaldehyde', 'Trp53 mutations', 'Trp53+ mice', 'nasal cavity', 'neoplasia', 'inhalation']",,,,,,,,,20180718,,['National Toxicology Program'],"['NTP Research Report on Absence of Formaldehyde-Induced Neoplasia in Trp53', 'Haploinsufficient Mice Exposed by Inhalation: Research Report 3']",['2018/07/18 06:01'],,,['NTP Research Reports'],,,,,,,,,,

A number of reports have demonstrated that apoptosis is associated with the growth and rupture of IA. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) perform vital roles in the regulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and signaling proteins. Increasing evidence has already revealed the role of miR29a in injury, including liver injury, cardiovascular injury and ischaemiareperfusion injury. However, the role of miR29a in IA remains unclear at present. The present study investigated the role of miR29a in IA pathogenesis and the underlying mechanisms. By using reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, the present study demonstrated that genes, including caspase3, 8 and 9, and proteins, including cytochrome c and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1), involved in mitochondrial apoptosis pathways were upregulated in IA groups compared with controls. In addition, microarray analysis demonstrated that miR29a, one of the most altered miRs in IA mice, was overexpressed in IA mice compared with controls. In vitro experiments revealed that miR29a downregulation attenuated human brain vascular smooth muscle cell (HBVSMC) apoptosis, while miR29a overexpression increased the apoptosis of HBVSMCs. Furthermore, luciferase reporter analysis revealed that Mcl1 is a direct target gene of miR29a. An in vivo IA model confirmed that miR29a overexpression may promote apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways. It was therefore concluded that miR29a may contribute to the progression of IA by regulating mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. Thus, miR29a is a potential therapeutic target for IA.",,"['Zhao, Wenjing', 'Zhang, Haifang', 'Su, Jin-Ying']","['Zhao W', 'Zhang H', 'Su JY']","['First Department of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, Hebei 056002, P.R.

Glycans, including Nglycans, are involved in numerous biological processes, including inflammation, cellcell interactions, as well as cancer development and progression. Lectinbased microarray analysis has provided a powerful new tool in recent years, for the investigation of aberrantly expressed Nglycans and their functions in the bone marrow microenvironment. In the present study, we used an in vitro stromal/hematopoietic cell coculture system to examine the effects of stromalderived signals on apoptosis susceptibility of cocultured KG1a hematopoietic cells under hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. MALDITOF/TOFMS analysis was used for the comparative global profiling of Nglycans in KG1a cells and cocultured KG1a cells under hypoxia. KG1a cells became more susceptible to p53dependent apoptosis when cocultured with HS27A human stromal cells (derived from normal bone marrow) under hypoxia. We observed enhanced levels of corefucosylated Nglycans (catalyzed by FUT8), bisecting GlcNAc (catalyzed by MGAT3), and their corresponding genes in cocultured cells. In addition we observed that overexpressing MGAT3 or FUT8 facilitated cell apoptosis in KG1a cells. Collectively, our data revealed the profiling of Nglycans in KG1a cells before and after stroma contact. Our findings and future functional studies of corefucosylated Nglycans and bisecting GlcNAc, will improve our understanding of the bone marrow microenvironment.",,"['Pang, Xingchen', 'Wang, Yi', 'Zhang, Sijie', 'Tan, Zengqi', 'Guo, Jia', 'Guan, Feng', 'Li, Xiang']","['Pang X', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang S', 'Tan Z', 'Guo J', 'Guan F', 'Li X']","['Key Laboratory of Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biotechnology, Ministry of Education, School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, P.R.

Western blotting was performed to detect levels of phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt). Reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to detect the levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)1, 2 and 3. The results demonstrated that OSM treatment significantly increased MCP1 levels in a dosedependent manner. Interleukin (IL)1, also significantly increased MCP1 levels; however, treatment with other cytokines, including IL6, IL11 and leukemia inhibitory factor did not affect MCP1 levels to the same extent. In addition, OSM did not affect levels of the chemokines MIP1alpha and RANTES; indeed, only IL1 significantly increased levels of MIP1alpha and RANTES. OSM treatment promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion in a dosedependent manner, which were inhibited by MCP1 silencing. The expression of phosphorylatedAkt, MMP1, 2 and 3 were increased by OSM treatment; however, these increases were reversed following MCP1 silencing.

In the present study, the role of miR21 in the proliferation and apoptosis of SKM1 cells, an acute myeloid leukemia cell line established in the AML/MDS leukemic phase was investigated. The present results demonstrated that downregulation of miR21 inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and caused G1 phase cell cycle arrest of SKM1 cells.

It is not known, however, how the resulting oncoprotein mutant NPM1 is leukemogenic. To reveal the cellular machinery in which NPM1 participates in myeloid cells, we analyzed the endogenous NPM1 protein interactome by mass spectrometry and discovered abundant amounts of the master transcription factor driver of monocyte lineage differentiation PU.1 (also known as SPI1). Mutant NPM1, which aberrantly accumulates in cytoplasm, dislocated PU.1 into cytoplasm with it. CEBPA and RUNX1, the master transcription factors that collaborate with PU.1 to activate granulomonocytic lineage fates, remained nuclear; but without PU.1, their coregulator interactions were toggled from coactivators to corepressors, repressing instead of activating more than 500 granulocyte and monocyte terminal differentiation genes. An inhibitor of nuclear export, selinexor, by locking mutant NPM1/PU.1 in the nucleus, activated terminal monocytic fates. Direct depletion of the corepressor DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) from the CEBPA/RUNX1 protein interactome using the clinical drug decitabine activated terminal granulocytic fates. Together, these noncytotoxic treatments extended survival by more than 160 days versus vehicle in a patient-derived xenotransplant model of NPM1/FLT3-mutated AML. In sum, mutant NPM1 represses monocyte and granulocyte terminal differentiation by disrupting PU.1/CEBPA/RUNX1 collaboration, a transforming action that can be reversed by pharmacodynamically directed dosing of clinical small molecules.",,"['Gu, Xiaorong', 'Ebrahem, Quteba', 'Mahfouz, Reda Z', 'Hasipek, Metis', 'Enane, Francis', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Rapin, Nicolas', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej',

Determination of the co-crystal structure of CF53 with the BRD4 BD1 protein provides a structural basis for its high binding affinity to BET proteins.

Compound 3q showed the most prominent broad-spectrum anticancer activity against 34 tumor cell lines, with mean growth inhibition percent of 45.80%. It exerted the highest potency against colon HT-29 cell line, with cell growth inhibition 86.86%. All leukemia cell lines were highly sensitive to compound 3q. Additionally, compound 3q demonstrated lethal activity to MDA-MB-435 belonging melanoma. Compound 3e exhibited the highest anticancer activity against leukemic CCRF-CEM and HL-60(TB) cell lines, with cell growth inhibition 86.69% and 86.42%, respectively. Moreover, it exerted marked potency against ovarian OVCAR-3 cancer cell line, with cell growth inhibition 78.24%. Four compounds: 3d, 3e, 3f and 3q were further studied through determination of IC50 values against the most sensitive cancer cell lines. The four compounds exhibited highly potent anticancer activity against ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 and leukemia HL-60 (TB) cell lines, with IC50 values in nano-molar range between 25 and 130nM.

Here, we report effects of panobinostat and 5-azacytidine on the proliferation of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) CD34(+) cells. PROCEDURE: We previously reported that stimulation of JMML CD34(+) cells with stem cell factor and thrombopoietin on irradiated murine AGM-S3 cells led to substantial expansion of JMML CD34(+) cells that contained leukemic stem cells capable of transplantation into immunodeficient mice. Using this culture system, we evaluated effects of panobinostat and 5-azacytidine on the proliferation of JMML CD34(+) cells. RESULTS: Panobinostat dose dependently reduced the numbers of day 7 CD34(+) cells generated under stimulation of hematopoietic growth factors on AGM-S3 cells in all eight patients with JMML. These patients possessed various genetic and/or karyotypic abnormalities. CD34(+) CD38(-) cells were substantially more sensitive to panobinostat at 10 and 20 nM than CD34(+) CD38(+) cells. Panobinostat, however, failed to influence the ability of AGM-S3 cells to stimulate JMML CD34(+) cell production. In contrast to HL60 cells, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in panobinostat-mediated inhibition were at low levels in JMML. The inhibitor also suppressed the factor-dependent proliferation of normal CD34(+) cells on AGM-S3 cells. Meanwhile, no substantial inhibitory effects of 5-azacytidine on the growth of JMML CD34(+) cells were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that panobinostat directly suppresses the growth of JMML CD34(+) cells, in particular CD34(+) CD38(-) cells, regardless of the genetic abnormality type, suggesting that it is a useful antileukemic drug to target JMML stem cells at a pretransplant stage.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kurata, Takashi', 'Matsuda, Kazuyuki', 'Hirabayashi, Koichi', 'Shigemura, Tomonari', 'Sakashita, Kazuo', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi', 'Koike, Kenichi']","['Kurata T', 'Matsuda K', 'Hirabayashi K', 'Shigemura T', 'Sakashita K', 'Nakahata T', 'Koike K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Nagano Children's Hospital, Azumino, Japan."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shinshu University Hospital, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Nagano Children's Hospital, Azumino, Japan."", 'Department of Clinical Application, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Shinonoi General Hospital, Minami Nagano Center, Nagano, Japan.']",['eng'],"['24390260/JSPS KAKENHI/International', '26461575/JSPS KAKENHI/International', '17K10105/JSPS KAKENHI/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180716,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Panobinostat/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2018/07/18 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/07/18 06:00'],"['2016/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27261 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Nov;65(11):e27261. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27261.

However, attention for secondary iron overload and its side effects in patients with hematological malignancies may need improvement. The aim of this study was to determine the number of transfused RBCT needed to reach a maximum bone marrow iron score (BMIS). METHODS: Bone marrow iron score was independently assessed by two researchers on consecutive bone marrow samples of 35 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The slides were blinded to both researchers to prevent bias. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed for estimation of the proportion of patients reaching a maximum BMIS. RESULTS: In total, 141 bone marrow specimens from 35 patients were included. The median number of RBCT to reach a maximum was 20 units (range 6-42, IQR 15-26), after a mean of 1.64 chemotherapy courses (SD 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the cumulative RBCT number is associated with BMIS. Due to the considerable variation in number of RBCT to reach a maximum BMIS, BMIS instead of only considering the cumulative RBCT number may be a valuable indicator of secondary iron overload in AML patients. BMIS could guide iron-lowering therapy and/or transfusion strategies in an early stage.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Among them, heterozygous de novo variants in KMT2A, a gene coding for histone methyltransferase, have been associated with Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS), a rare developmental disorder mainly characterized by intellectual disability (ID) and hypertrichosis. As KMT2A is known to regulate the expression of multiple target genes through methylation of lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me), we sought to investigate the transcriptomic consequences of KMT2A variants involved in WSS. Using fibroblasts from four WSS patients harboring loss-of-function KMT2A variants, we performed RNA sequencing and identified a number of genes for which transcription was altered in KMT2A-mutated cells compared to the control ones. Strikingly, analysis of the pathways and biological functions significantly deregulated between patients with WSS and healthy individuals revealed a number of processes predicted to be altered that are relevant for hypertrichosis and intellectual disability, the cardinal signs of this disease.",,"['Mietton, Leo', 'Lebrun, Nicolas', 'Giurgea, Irina', 'Goldenberg, Alice', 'Saintpierre, Benjamin', 'Hamroune, Juliette', 'Afenjar, Alexandra', 'Billuart, Pierre', 'Bienvenu, Thierry']","['Mietton L', 'Lebrun N', 'Giurgea I', 'Goldenberg A', 'Saintpierre B', 'Hamroune J', 'Afenjar A', 'Billuart P', 'Bienvenu T']","['Inserm, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Institut de Psychiatrie et de Neurosciences de Paris, Inserm U894, 102 rue de la sante, 75014, Paris, France.', 'U.F. de Genetique moleculaire, Hopital Armand Trousseau, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR S933, Faculte de medecine Sorbonne Universites, 75012, Paris, France.', 'Service de genetique, CHU de Rouen et Inserm U1079, Universite de Rouen, Centre Normand de Genomique Medicale et Medecine Personnalisee, Rouen, France.', 'Inserm, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', ""Service de genetique et embryologie medicales, Centre de reference Maladie du cervelet, CHU Paris Est - Hopital d'Enfants Armand-Trousseau, Paris, France."", 'Inserm, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Institut de Psychiatrie et de Neurosciences de Paris, Inserm U894, 102 rue de la sante, 75014, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France. thierry.bienvenu@inserm.fr.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France. thierry.bienvenu@inserm.fr.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France. thierry.bienvenu@inserm.fr.', 'Institut de Psychiatrie et de Neurosciences de Paris, Inserm U894, 102 rue de la sante, 75014, Paris, France. thierry.bienvenu@inserm.fr.', 'Laboratoire de Genetique et Biologie Moleculaires, Hopital Cochin, HUPC, AP-HP, Paris, France. thierry.bienvenu@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180716,United States,Neuromolecular Med,Neuromolecular medicine,101135365,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypertrichosis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Intellectual Disability/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Loss of Function Mutation', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/metabolism', 'Rare Diseases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syndrome', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2018/07/18 06:00,2019/05/15 06:00,['2018/07/18 06:00'],"['2018/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12017-018-8502-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12017-018-8502-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Neuromolecular Med. 2018 Sep;20(3):409-417. doi: 10.1007/s12017-018-8502-1.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) gene mutations are described in 12% of patients with AML and 5% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. IDH2 enzyme is involved in the Krebs cycle, catalyzing alpha-ketoglutarate from isocitrate. Mutant IDH2 enzymes acquire a neomorphic enzymatic activity with the ability to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate from alpha-ketoglutarate, inhibiting multiple alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase reactions; leading to aberrant DNA hypermethylation and differentiation block in myeloid precursors and ultimately promoting leukemogenesis. Enasidenib (formerly AG-221) is an oral small molecule selective targeted inhibitor of the mutant IDH2 enzyme, approved in August 2017 by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) IDH2-mutated AML. Preclinical studies showed the effectiveness of enasidenib in inhibiting the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate with high potency, and alleviating the mutant IDH2-induced differentiation block. In the original AG221-001 phase I/II trial, patients with R/R AML were treated with enasidenib single agent therapy at escalating doses up to 650 mg daily, with the 100 mg dose level identified to be safe and effective for further evaluation. Overall, 113 patients were treated in the dose-escalation and 126 in the dose-expansion cohorts. The overall response rate for R/R patients was 40%, including a complete remission of 19%. At a median follow up of 7.7 months, the median overall survival was 9.3 months, and reached 19.7 months in responders. Enasidenib was well tolerated, although adverse events of clinical interest include indirect hyperbilirubinemia and IDH-inhibitor-induced differentiation syndrome, which can be life threatening if not identified and treated promptly. Ongoing clinical trials evaluating enasidenib in combination with intensive chemotherapy and hypomethylating agents in newly diagnosed AML, and in rational combinations for R/R AML patients are underway.",,"['Abou Dalle, Iman', 'DiNardo, Courtney D']","['Abou Dalle I', 'DiNardo CD']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180601,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,2018/07/18 06:00,2018/07/18 06:01,['2018/07/18 06:00'],"['2018/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620718777467 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620718777467 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2018 Jul;9(7):163-173. doi: 10.1177/2040620718777467.

The ecotropic viral integration site 1 (Evi1) is a zinc finger transcription factor, which is highly expressed in AML, and its expression level has been associated with poor prognosis of AML. Previous studies have indicated that Evi1 may regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis by inhibiting the membrane-spanning-4-domains subfamily-A member-3 (MS4A3) gene in AML. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of Evi1 in the progression of AML. The results revealed that Evi1 was overexpressed in leukemia cells compared with normal T lymphocytes. MicroRNAs (miR)-133 and -431 that target Evi1 were investigated, and it was observed that there was a low expression of miR-431 in AML. The transfection of miR-431 was able to decrease the promoter methylation levels of the Evi1 gene in AML cells. The transfection of miR-431 also suppressed the migration and invasion of AML cells. The present study revealed that the transfection of miR-431 mimic was able to downregulate MS4A3 expression in AML cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers fibronectin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and vimentin were downregulated following the transfection of miR-431 in AML cells. The overexpression of MS4A3 was also able to suppress miR-431-mediated inhibition of the expression of TGFbeta and EMT markers in AML cells. The addition of TGFbeta inhibited the downregulation of EMT markers by transfection of miR-431 in AML cells. The transfection of miR-431 suppressed the migration and invasion of AML cells, which was also abolished by the addition of TGFbeta. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that Evi1 may be a potential molecular target of leukemia therapy via MS4A3-mediated TGFbeta/EMT signaling pathway.",,"['Jiang, Min', 'Zou, Xueqin', 'Huang, Wenhua']","['Jiang M', 'Zou X', 'Huang W']","['Department of Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, P.R.

Accumulating evidence shows that CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are responsible for drug resistance, metastasis, and relapse of leukemia. In this study, we found that Nanog, a transcription factor in stem cells, is significantly overexpressed in CD34(+) populations from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and in LSCs from leukemia cell lines. Our data demonstrate that the knockdown of Nanog inhibited proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. Moreover, Nanog silencing suppressed the leukemogenesis of LSCs in mice. In addition, we found that these functions of Nanog were regulated by the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway. Nanog overexpression rescued the colony formation ability of LSCs treated with picropodophyllin (PPP), an IGF1R inhibitor. By contrast, knockdown of Nanog abolished the effects of IGF2 on the colony formation ability of these LSCs.

Rac1 aggravates the damage of myocardial cells in the process of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion during myocardial infarction through activating the NADPH oxidase and bringing about the reactive oxygen species(ROS) generation. Myocardial ischemia and hypoxia are the basic pathogenesis of myocardial infarction and the underlying mechanisms are intricate and varied. Moreover, the regulatory effect of Rac1 on myocardial cells in the condition of serum starvation and the potential mechanisms are still incompletely undefined. Therefore, heart-derived H9c2 cells cultured in 0% serum were used to mimic ischemic myocardial cells and to clarify the role of Rac1 in H9c2 cells and the underlying mechanisms during serum deficiency. After Rac1 was knocked down using specific siRNA, cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry assay and cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay and EdU assay. In addition, the expression and activation of protein in related signaling pathway were detected by Western blot and siRNAs was used to testify the signaling pathways.

In model systems, mutant IDH2 causes hematopoietic differentiation arrest. Enasidenib, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH2, produces a clinical response in 40% of treated patients with relapsed/refractory AML by promoting leukemic cell differentiation. Here, we studied the clonal basis of response and acquired resistance to enasidenib treatment. Using sequential patient samples, we determined the clonal structure of hematopoietic cell populations at different stages of differentiation. Before therapy, IDH2-mutant clones showed variable differentiation arrest. Enasidenib treatment promoted hematopoietic differentiation from either terminal or ancestral mutant clones; less frequently, treatment promoted differentiation of nonmutant cells. Analysis of paired diagnosis/relapse samples did not identify second-site mutations in IDH2 at relapse. Instead, relapse arose by clonal evolution or selection of terminal or ancestral clones, thus highlighting multiple bypass pathways that could potentially be targeted to restore differentiation arrest. These results show how mapping of clonal structure in cell populations at different stages of differentiation can reveal the response and evolution of clones during treatment response and

Slc39a8(neo/neo) knockdown mice exhibit 10-15% of wild-type ZIP8 mRNA and protein levels, and show pleiotropic phenotype of stunted growth, neonatal lethality, multi-organ dysmorphogenesis, and dysregulated hematopoiesis manifested as severe anemia. Herein we performed RNA-seq analysis of gestational day (GD)13.5 yolk sac and placenta, and GD16.5 liver, kidney, lung, heart and cerebellum, comparing Slc39a8(neo/neo) with Slc39a8(+/+) wild-type. Meta-data analysis of differentially-expressed genes revealed 29 unique genes from all tissues - having enriched GO categories associated with hematopoiesis and hypoxia and KEGG categories of complement, response to infection, and coagulation cascade - consistent with dysregulated hematopoietic stem cell fate. Based on transcription factor (TF) profiles in the JASPAR database, and searching for TF-binding sites enriched by Pscan, we identified numerous genes encoding zinc-finger and other TFs associated with hematopoietic stem cell functions. We conclude that, in this mouse model, deficient ZIP8-mediated divalent cation transport affects zinc-finger (e.g. GATA proteins) and other TFs interacting with GATA proteins (e.g. TAL1), predominantly in yolk sac. These data strongly support the phenotype of dysmorphogenesis and anemia seen in Slc39a8(neo/neo) mice in utero.",,"['Chen, Jing', 'Galvez-Peralta, Marina', 'Zhang, Xiang', 'Deng, Jingyuan', 'Liu, Zijuan', 'Nebert, Daniel W']","['Chen J', 'Galvez-Peralta M', 'Zhang X', 'Deng J', 'Liu Z', 'Nebert DW']","[""Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45229, USA."", 'Department of Environmental Health, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45267, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, West Virginia University Medical Center, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Health, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45267, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Health, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45267, USA.', 'Amazon.com, Inc., Seattle, WA, 98101, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, 48309, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Health, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45267, USA. dan.nebert@uc.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30 ES006096/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES010416/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES016646/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180716,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (GATA Transcription Factors)', '0 (Slc39a8 protein, mouse)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Anemia/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cation Transport Proteins/*deficiency', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'GATA Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Morphogenesis/genetics', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/metabolism', 'Yolk Sac/cytology/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",2018/07/18 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2018/07/18 06:00'],"['2018/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-29109-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-29109-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jul 16;8(1):10703. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-29109-y.,,,1,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6227-7393', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7917-6559']",PMC6048144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms by which mutant ASXL1 induces leukaemogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we report mutually reinforcing effects between a C-terminally truncated form of mutant ASXL1 (ASXL1-MT) and BAP1 in promoting myeloid leukaemogenesis. BAP1 expression results in increased monoubiquitination of ASXL1-MT, which in turn increases the catalytic function of BAP1. This hyperactive ASXL1-MT/BAP1 complex promotes aberrant myeloid differentiation of haematopoietic progenitor cells and accelerates RUNX1-ETO-driven leukaemogenesis. Mechanistically, this complex induces upregulation of posterior HOXA genes and IRF8 through removal of H2AK119 ubiquitination. Importantly, BAP1 depletion inhibits posterior HOXA gene expression and leukaemogenicity of ASXL1-MT-expressing myeloid leukemia cells. Furthermore, BAP1 is also required for the growth of MLL-fusion leukemia cells with posterior HOXA gene dysregulation. These data indicate that BAP1, which has long been considered a tumor suppressor, in fact plays tumor-promoting roles in myeloid neoplasms.",,"['Asada, Shuhei', 'Goyama, Susumu', 'Inoue, Daichi',

Phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX at S139 and Y142 modulate its interaction with downstream DNA repair proteins and their recruitment to DNA lesions. Here we report ATM-dependent ZNF506 localization to the lesion through MDC1 following DNA damage. ZNF506, in turn, recruits the protein phosphatase EYA, resulting in dephosphorylation of H2AX at Y142, which further facilitates the recruitment of MDC1 and other downstream repair factors. Thus, ZNF506 regulates the early dynamic signaling in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and controls progressive downstream signal amplification. Cells lacking ZNF506 or harboring mutations found in cancer patient samples are more sensitive to radiation, offering a potential new therapeutic option for cancers with mutations in this pathway.

As AIHA is exacerbated by the increased number of CLL cells in the peripheral blood, it may have developed because of disease progression rather than IBR use. This phenomenon may also be attributed to the production of autoantibodies due to increased number of CD5+ B cells. In this case, withdrawal of IBR and administration of rituximab improved hemolysis. If AIHA develops during treatment, its etiology must be examined to confirm the effects of treatment.",,"['Suzuki, Takaharu', 'Miyakoshi, Shukuko', 'Nanba, Ayako', 'Uchiyama, Takayoshi', 'Kawamoto, Keisuke', 'Aoki, Sadao']","['Suzuki T', 'Miyakoshi S', 'Nanba A', 'Uchiyama T', 'Kawamoto K', 'Aoki S']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180714,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/blood/*chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage']",2018/07/18 06:00,2018/11/01 06:00,['2018/07/18 06:00'],"['2018/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3960/jslrt.18012 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2018 Sep 19;58(3):136-140. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.18012.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the population size of gammadelta NKT cells is tightly controlled by Id3-mediated inhibition of E-protein activity in mice. However, how E proteins promote gammadelta NKT cell development and expansion remains to be determined. In this study, we report that the transcription factor Egr2, which also activates PLZF expression in invariant NKT cells, is essential for regulating gammadelta NKT cell expansion. We observed a higher expression of Egr family genes in gammadelta NKT cells compared with the conventional gammadelta T cell population. Loss of function of Id3 caused an expansion of gammadelta NKT cells, which is accompanied by further upregulation of Egr family genes as well as PLZF. Deletion of Egr2 in Id3-deficient gammadelta NKT cells prevented cell expansion and blocked PLZF upregulation. We further show that this Egr2-mediated gammadelta NKT cell expansion is dependent on c-Myc. c-Myc knockdown attenuated the proliferation of Id3-deficient gammadelta NKT cells, whereas c-Myc overexpression enhanced the proliferation of Id3/Egr2-double-deficient gammadelta NKT cells. Therefore, our data reveal a regulatory circuit involving Egr2-Id3-E2A, which normally restricts the population size of gammadelta NKT cells by adjusting Egr2 dosage and c-Myc expression.","['Copyright (c) 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Zhang, Baojun', 'Jiao, Anjun', 'Dai, Meifang', 'Wiest, David L', 'Zhuang, Yuan']","['Zhang B', 'Jiao A', 'Dai M', 'Wiest DL', 'Zhuang Y']","[""Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, ShaanXi 710061, China; bj.zhang@mail.xjtu.edu.cn yzhuang@duke.edu."", 'Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710; and.', ""Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, ShaanXi 710061, China."", 'Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710; and.', 'Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.', 'Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710; and bj.zhang@mail.xjtu.edu.cn yzhuang@duke.edu.']",['eng'],"['P01 AI102853/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM059638/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AG034457/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180716,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 2)', '0 (Egr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Tcf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '135845-89-5 (Idb3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta']",2018/07/18 06:00,2019/07/02 06:00,['2018/07/18 06:00'],"['2018/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1800106 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1800106 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Sep 1;201(5):1452-1459. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800106.

We compared the incidence of breakthrough IFIs and early discontinuation between patients receiving delayed-release tablet and oral suspension formulations of posaconazole. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients receiving posaconazole between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2016. We defined probable or proven breakthrough IFIs using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. Overall, 547 patients received 860 courses of posaconazole (53% received the oral suspension and 48% received the tablet); primary indications for prophylaxis were acute myeloid leukemia (69%), graft-versus-host disease (18%), and myelodysplastic syndrome (3%). There were no significant differences in demographics or indications between patients receiving the different formulations. The incidence and incidence rate of probable or proven IFIs were 1.6% and 3.2 per 10,000 posaconazole days, respectively. There was no significant difference in the rate of IFIs between suspension courses (2.8 per 10,000 posaconazole days) and tablet courses (3.7 per 10,000 posaconazole days) (rate ratio = 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.3 to 2.3). Of the 14 proven or probable cases of IFI, 8/14 had posaconazole serum concentrations measured, and the concentrations in 7/8 were above 0.7 mug/ml. Posaconazole was discontinued early in 15.5% of courses; however, the frequency of discontinuation was also not significantly different between the tablet (16.5%) and oral suspension (14.6%) formulations (95% CI for difference = -0.13 to 0.06).

The BCL-2 family consists of regulatory proteins that either induce apoptosis (proapoptotic) or inhibit it (prosurvival). BCL-2, myeloid cell leukemia-1, and B-cell lymphoma-extra large are prosurvival proteins that are prime targets for anticancer therapy, and molecules targeting each are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax was first proven to be highly effective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and some B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes. Subsequently, venetoclax was found to be active clinically against a diverse array of hematologic malignancies including multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and others. Here, we give a brief introduction to BCL-2 family biology and the mechanism of action of BCL-2 Homology 3 (BH3) mimetics, and provide an overview of the clinical data for therapeutically targeting prosurvival proteins in hematologic malignancies, with a focus on BCL-2 inhibition. To prioritize novel agent combinations and predict responders, we discuss the utility of functional assays such as BH3 profiling. Finally, we provide a perspective on how therapies targeting BCL-2 family proteins may be optimally implemented into future therapeutic regimens for hematologic malignancies.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Valentin, Rebecca', 'Grabow, Stephanie', 'Davids, Matthew S']","['Valentin R', 'Grabow S', 'Davids MS']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180716,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Protein Interaction Maps/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2018/07/18 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2018/07/18 06:00'],"['2018/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60742-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-02-791350 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Sep 20;132(12):1248-1264. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-02-791350.

Their regulatory role in cancer progression has seen in different human malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML patients suffer from high resistance of the tumors against routine therapeutics including ATO. ATO enhance reactive oxygen species levels and induce apoptosis and suppresses proliferation in AML cells. However, some pathways such as JAK2/STAT3 ease anti-tumor activity of ATO by reducing reactive oxygen species amount and protecting the cell from apoptosis. In the present study, we use ruxolitinib (potent JAK2 inhibitor) to increase the sensitivity of AML cells to ATO treatment. We test, the effect of this combination on metabolic activity, proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, oxidative stress and DNA damage. Our results showed that combination of ATO with ruxolitinib synergistically reduced metabolic activity, proliferation and survival of AML cell lines. This combination induced G1/S cell cycle arrest because of reactive oxygen species elevation and GSH reduction. Besides, enhancement of reactive oxygen species increased apoptosis rate in combination samples. We uncovered that the synergistic anti-tumor effect of ATO and ruxolitinib in AML cells mediates via reactive oxygen species elevation and DNA damage.

By acting as an 11-ketoprostaglandin reductase, AKR1C3 generates 11beta-PGF2alpha to activate the FP receptor and deprives peroxisome proliferator activator receptorgamma of its putative PGJ2 ligands. These growth stimulatory signals implicate AKR1C3 in non-hormonal dependent malignancies e.g. acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AKR1C3 moonlights by acting as a co-activator of the AR and stabilizes ubiquitin ligases. AKR1C3 inhibitors have been used clinically for CRPC and AML and can be used to probe its pluripotency.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Somatic KRAS mutations are often detected in patients with solid and non-solid tumors, whereas germline KRAS mutations are implicated in patients with the Noonan syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome and Costello syndrome. The deletion of chromosome 10q22.3-q23.2 is a rare cytogenetic abnormality, which often leads to distinct facial appearance and delays in speech and global development. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report the case of a 4-year-old boy diagnosed with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The boy also had syndromic features, such as speech and motor developmental delay, multiple congenital malformations, including distinct facial features, club feet, and cryptorchidism. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a pathogenic mutation in KRAS [c.34G > A, p.Gly12Ser] isolated from peripheral blood DNA. Sanger sequencing confirmed the wild-type sequence in the parents and patient's salivary cell DNA indicating its somatic state. A 7311-kb deletion in 10q22.3-q23.2 was also revealed by chromosomal microarray analysis, which was later proved as a germline de novo variant. CONCLUSION: Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia in the patient was attributed to a somatic KRAS mutation, whereas the syndromic features of the patient were considered a consequence of germline chromosome 10q22.3-q23.2 deletion. Genetic testing for patients with complicated phenotypes can be valuable in detecting multiple pathogenic variants.",,"['Yao, Ruen', 'Yu, Tingting', 'Xu, Yufei', 'Li, Guoqiang', 'Yin, Lei', 'Zhou, Yunfang', 'Wang, Jian', 'Yan, Zhilong']","['Yao R', 'Yu T', 'Xu Y', 'Li G', 'Yin L', 'Zhou Y', 'Wang J', 'Yan Z']","[""Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute for Pediatric Translational Medicine, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China. yutingting@scmc.com.cn."", ""Institute for Pediatric Translational Medicine, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China. yutingting@scmc.com.cn."", ""Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute for Pediatric Translational Medicine, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute for Pediatric Translational Medicine, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Rare Diseases Outpatient Clinic, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Rare Diseases Outpatient Clinic, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute for Pediatric Translational Medicine, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China. dryanzhilong@163.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180716,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",,"['*Abnormalities, Multiple', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Developmental Disabilities/*complications', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*complications/*genetics', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics']",2018/07/18 06:00,2019/08/01 06:00,['2018/07/18 06:00'],"['2018/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-018-0377-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-018-0377-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2018 Jul 16;11(1):60. doi: 10.1186/s12920-018-0377-3.,['NOTNLM'],"['*10q deletion', '*Developmental delay', '*Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', '*KRAS', '*Whole-exome sequencing']",1,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6030-9614'],PMC6048798,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They showed a clear IFN-gamma inducing activity in human PBMCs, which suggests these polysaccharides to have proinflammatory effects. Treatment by beta-glucosidase caused the polysaccharides to be degraded into smaller fragments and at the same time increased their IFN-gamma inducing activity in PBMCs fourfold. In vitro, PPE showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the proliferation of the human leukemia Jurkat cell. At 100mug/mL the cells' viability was decreased by appr. 51% compared to the control.

Tirabrutinib (GS-4059/ONO-4059, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City, CA) is a second-generation, potent, selective, irreversible BTK inhibitor in clinical development for lymphoid malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). An accurate pharmacodynamic assay to assess tirabrutinib target coverage in phase 1/2 clinical studies will inform dose and schedule selection for advanced clinical evaluation. We developed a novel duplex homogeneous BTK occupancy assay based on time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) to measure free and total BTK levels in a multiplexed format. The dual-wavelength emission property of terbium-conjugated anti-BTK antibody served as the energy donor for two fluorescent energy acceptors with distinct excitation and emission spectra. The assay was characterized and qualified using full-length purified recombinant human BTK protein and peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from healthy volunteers and patients with CLL. We demonstrated assay utility using cells derived from lymph node and bone marrow samples from patients with CLL and DLBCL.

To evaluate our myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) inhibitors, we tested them against rodent Mcl-1 and found a significant loss of binding affinity when compared to that seen with human Mcl-1. To understand the affinity loss, we used sequence alignments and structures of human Mcl-1/inhibitor complexes to identify the important differences in the amino acid sequences. One difference is human L246 (F226 in rat, F227 in mouse) in the ligand binding pocket. Mutating rat F226 to a Leu restores affinity, but the mouse F227L mutant still has a ligand affinity that is lower than that of human Mcl-1. Another mutation of mouse F267, located approximately 12 A from the ligand pocket, to the human/rat cysteine, F267C, improved the affinity and combined with F227L resulted in a mutant mouse protein with a binding affinity similar to that of human Mcl-1. To help understand the structural components of the affinity loss, we obtained an X-ray structure of a mouse Mcl-1/inhibitor complex and identified how the residue changes reduced compound complementarity. Finally, we tested Mcl-1 of other preclinical animal models (canine, monkey, rabbit, and ferret) that are identical to humans in terms of these two residues and found that their Mcl-1 bound our compounds with affinities comparable to that of human Mcl-1. These results have implications for understanding ligand selectivity for similar proteins and for the interpretation of preclinical toxicology studies with Mcl-1 inhibitors.",,"['Zhao, Bin', 'Arnold, Allison L', 'Coronel, Marcelle A', 'Lee, Joyce H', 'Lee, Taekyu', 'Olejniczak, Edward T', 'Fesik, Stephen W']","['Zhao B', 'Arnold AL', 'Coronel MA', 'Lee JH', 'Lee T', 'Olejniczak ET', 'Fesik SW']","['Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 2215 Garland Avenue, 607 Light Hall , Nashville , Tennessee 37232-0146 , United States.']",['eng'],"['S10 RR026915/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA098131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180731,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dogs', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2018/07/17 06:00,2019/06/06 06:00,['2018/07/17 06:00'],"['2018/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00626 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2018 Aug 14;57(32):4952-4958. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00626.

This large single institutional retrospective study analyses the risk of SC in HL patients treated outside of clinical trials over past decades. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive series of HL patients were analysed with median follow-up 12 years. Standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and absolute excess risk (AER) were calculated for site-specific risk of SC. RESULTS: In total of 871 patients (491 men; median age 34 years), chemotherapy alone, radiotherapy alone, and combined treatment underwent 36%, 40%, and 24% patients. 154 SC were found with significantly increased SIR = 2.9 and AER = 80.8 for all cancers except of nonmelanoma-skin cancer. SC-related death occurred in 71 patients (15% of those who died, 8% of whole cohort). The most common SC were lung (17.5% of all malignancies, SIR = 3.2), breast carcinoma (15.6%, SIR = 4.4), and haematological malignancy (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma SIR = 13.1; leukaemia SIR = 5.8). For SC within radiation field, the highest AER was in breast (AER = 46.9), colorectal (AER = 22.8), and lung cancer (AER = 17). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HL are generally at great risk of developing SC, which is significantly increased especially by the use of radiotherapy. We suggested special follow-up schema for patients after initial HL treatment suitable for daily real-world clinical practice. The system depends on gender, form of HL treatment and especially the form of radiation therapy in terms of location of radiation fields.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Petrakova, Katarina', 'Vyskocil, Jiri', 'Grell, Peter', 'Majek, Ondrej', 'Soumarova, Renata', 'Novak, Jiri', 'Burkon, Petr', 'Kral, Zdenek', 'Kazda, Tomas', 'Vyzula, Rostislav']","['Petrakova K', 'Vyskocil J', 'Grell P', 'Majek O', 'Soumarova R', 'Novak J', 'Burkon P', 'Kral Z', 'Kazda T', 'Vyzula R']","['Department of Comprehensive Cancer Care, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Comprehensive Cancer Care, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Comprehensive Cancer Care, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Comprehensive Cancer Care, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy, Comprehensive Cancer Centre Novy Jicin, Novy Jicin, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Clinical Studies, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.', 'National Oncology Registry Unit, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Faculty Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Comprehensive Cancer Care, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Comprehensive Cancer Care, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180716,England,Int J Clin Pract,International journal of clinical practice,9712381,,,,2018/07/17 06:00,2018/07/17 06:00,['2018/07/17 06:00'],"['2018/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijcp.13235 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Int J Clin Pract. 2018 Jul 16:e13235. doi: 10.1111/ijcp.13235.,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7288-8975'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, regulatory elements such as transcriptional enhancers control the spatio-temporal expression of their target genes through physical contact, often bridging considerable (in some cases hundreds of kilobases) genomic distances and bypassing nearby genes. The human genome harbors an estimated one million enhancers, the vast majority of which have unknown gene targets. Assigning distal regulatory regions to their target genes is thus crucial to understand gene expression control. We developed Promoter Capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) to enable the genome-wide detection of distal promoter-interacting regions (PIRs), for all promoters in a single experiment. In PCHi-C, highly complex Hi-C libraries are specifically enriched for promoter sequences through in-solution hybrid selection with thousands of biotinylated RNA baits complementary to the ends of all promoter-containing restriction fragments. The aim is to then pull-down promoter sequences and their frequent interaction partners such as enhancers and other potential regulatory elements. After high-throughput paired-end sequencing, a statistical test is applied to each promoter-ligated restriction fragment to identify significant PIRs at the restriction fragment level. We have used PCHi-C to generate an atlas of long-range promoter interactions in dozens of human and mouse cell types. These promoter interactome maps have contributed to a greater understanding of mammalian gene expression control by assigning putative regulatory regions to their target genes and revealing preferential spatial promoter-promoter interaction networks. This information also has high relevance to understanding human genetic disease and the identification of potential disease genes, by linking non-coding disease-associated sequence variants in or near control sequences to their target genes.",,"['Schoenfelder, Stefan', 'Javierre, Biola-Maria', 'Furlan-Magaril, Mayra', 'Wingett, Steven W', 'Fraser, Peter']","['Schoenfelder S', 'Javierre BM', 'Furlan-Magaril M', 'Wingett SW', 'Fraser P']","['Nuclear Dynamics Programme, The Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus; stefan.schoenfelder@babraham.ac.uk.', 'Nuclear Dynamics Programme, The Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus; IJC Building, Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute; bmjavierre@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Nuclear Dynamics Programme, The Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus; Departamento de Genetica Molecular, Instituto de Fisiologia Celular, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.', 'Nuclear Dynamics Programme, The Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus; Bioinformatics Group, The Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus.', 'Nuclear Dynamics Programme, The Babraham Institute, Babraham Research Campus; Department of Biological Science, Florida State University; peter.fraser@babraham.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['MR/L007150/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB/J004480/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20180628,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,,IM,"['Animals', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics']",2018/07/17 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2018/07/17 06:00'],"['2018/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/57320 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2018 Jun 28;(136). doi: 10.3791/57320.,,,136,,PMC6102006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Frequencies and salient characteristics of hematologic diseases in Northeast Mexico were documented in a reference center at a tertiary care university hospital during the decade 2005-2015. Disease categories were grouped by age, sex and diagnosis. Age group distribution followed WHO guidelines in years as children (0-17), adults (18-64) and elders (+65). RESULTS: 2406 patients were included: 1239 (51.5%) were females and 1167 (48.5%) males; F:M ratio was 1.06:1; median age was 35 years (0-95). The frequency by age group included adults, 1370 cases (56.9%), children, 695 cases (28.9%), and elderly, 341 (14.2%). Most frequent diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 18.2% (n = 438), anemia 15.9% (n = 383), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) 15.7% (n = 378), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 9.8% (n = 235) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) 6.5% (n = 156). Median age for the whole cohort was 35 years; for children, was 6 years, for adults 40 and for the elderly 73. Results for ALL, anemia and ITP were comparable to high-income countries; NHL, HL and chronic myeloid leukemia presented a decade earlier. DISCUSSION: Complete, opportune reliable information on the number of cases, age and sex distribution with the potential to influence strategies for timely diagnosis and treatment options for important hematologic diseases can be accrued by regional centers. CONCLUSION: Information on hematology diseases derived of regional registries in low-middle income countries is a reasonable alternative to complement and update national registries.",,"['Jaime-Perez, Jose Carlos', 'Trevino-Reyna, Goel', 'Aguilar-Calderon, Patrizia', 'Cantu-Rodriguez, Olga G', 'Marfil-Rivera, Luis Javier', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Trevino-Reyna G', 'Aguilar-Calderon P', 'Cantu-Rodriguez OG', 'Marfil-Rivera LJ', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']","['a Department of Hematology, Internal Medicine Division , Dr. Jose E.

The sequential FLAMSA (fludarabine+Ara-C+amsacrine chemotherapy) protocol followed by either cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (FLAMSA-TBI) or cyclophosphamide and busulfan (FLAMSA-Bu) has shown remarkable activity in high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. Here we compare the outcomes of AML patients transplanted in first complete remission (CR1) or second complete remission (CR2) after conditioning with BuFlu or FLAMSA. Eligible patients had their first allogeneic stem cell transplantation for AML in CR1 or CR2 between January 2005 and June 2016. Donors were matched related or unrelated with up to 1 mismatch. Conditioning consisted of either BuFlu or FLAMSA. Propensity score matching was applied and comparisons were performed using weighted Cox regression. BuFlu conditioning was used in 1197 patients, whereas FLAMSA-TBI and FLAMSA-Bu were used in 258 and 141 patients, respectively. Median follow-up of survivors was 24.72 months. In univariate analysis, relapse incidence (RI) was 30.3%, 21.9%, and 23.1% in the BuFlu, FLAMSA-TBI, and FLAMSA-Bu groups, respectively (P < .01), and nonrelapse mortality at 2 years was 16.1%, 16.4%, and 26.7%, respectively (P < .01). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years was 53.6%, 61.6%, and 50.1%, respectively (P = .03). Weighted Cox regression revealed that FLAMSA-TBI compared with BuFlu was associated with lower RI (hazard ratio [HR], .64; 95% confidence interval [CI], .42 to .98; P = .04) and a trend for better LFS (HR, .72; 95% CI, .49 to 1.06; P = .09). These results suggest that compared with BuFlu, conditioning with FLAMSA-TBI leads to reduced RI at 2 years in AML patients transplanted in CR1 or CR2.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

Discovery of noval regulators amenable to leukemia could be of value to gain insight into the pathogenesis, diagnosis and prognosis of leukemia. Here, we conducted a large-scale shRNA library screening for functional regulators in the development of myeloid cells in primary cells. We identified eighteen candidate regulators in the primary screening. Those genes cover a wide range of cellular functions, including gene expression regulation, intracellular signaling transduction, nucleotide excision repair, cell cycle control and transcription regulation. In both primary screening and validation, shRNAs targeting Tcea1, encoding the transcription elongation factor A (SII) 1, exhibited the greatest influence on the proliferative potential of cells. Knocking down the expression of Tcea1 in the 32Dcl3 myeloid cell line led to enhanced proliferation of myeloid cells and blockage of myeloid differentiation induced by G-CSF. In addition, silence of Tcea1 inhibited apoptosis of myeloid cells. Thus, Tcea1 was identified as a gene which can influence the proliferative potential, survival and differentiation of myeloid cells. These findings have implications for how transcriptional elongation influences myeloid cell development and leukemic transformation.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The lack of randomized trials prompted this study to assess the role of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril) in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in children with hematological malignancies. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 84 patients with leukemia (41) and lymphoma (43) who received anthracyclines (doxorubicin and/or daunorubicin) at cumulative dose >/=200 mg/m(2) . The patients were randomized to receive either enalapril [group A (n = 44)] or placebo [group B (n = 40)] for 6 months. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac biomarkers (cardiac troponin I [cTnI], probrain natriuretic peptide [proBNP], and creatine kinase MB [CK-MB]) were assessed at baseline and 6 months. The primary outcome was a measured decrease in LVEF (>/=20%). Secondary outcome measures were changes in cardiac biomarkers and the development of heart failure or arrhythmias. RESULTS: LVEF decreased in both groups at 6 months, more so in group B (62.25 +/- 5.49 vs 56.15 +/- 4.79, P < 0.001). A >/=20% decrease was seen in 3 patients in group B but none in group A (P = 0.21). Cardiac biomarkers increased more in group B at 6 months, and the increase was significant for proBNP (49.60 +/- 35.97 vs 98.60 +/- 54.24, P < 0.001) and cTnI (0.01 +/- 0.00 vs 0.011 +/- 0.003, P = 0.035) but not significant for CK-MB (1.08 +/- 0.18 vs 1.21 +/- 0.44, P = 0.079). In group A, 9.1% of the patients showed an increase in proBNP level >/=100 compared with 37.5% in group B (P < 0.001). No patient developed heart failure or arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: Enalapril has a role in reducing cardiac toxicity after anthracycline administration.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gupta, Vineeta', 'Kumar Singh, Sunil', 'Agrawal, Vikas', 'Bali Singh, Tej']","['Gupta V', 'Kumar Singh S', 'Agrawal V', 'Bali Singh T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.', 'Department of Cardiology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Department of Community Medicine, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20180715,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '69PN84IO1A (Enalapril)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Cardiotoxicity/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects', 'Enalapril/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/*chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",2018/07/17 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/07/17 06:00'],"['2017/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27308 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Nov;65(11):e27308. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27308.

However, it is not clear if also in a real-life setting, the outcome is homogeneous in the different favorable molecular groups and which are the parameters significantly associated to an increased relapse risk, useful to suggest the need of an intensified approach. In order to clarify this point, we collected clinical data on consecutive unselected AML pts. assigned to favorable category (modified ELN 2010 due to the inclusion of double-mutated CEBPA-positive cases), diagnosed and treated in six centers of the Italian network Rete Ematologica Lombarda (REL) from 2007 to 2015. We assessed response (CR, mCR), relapse rate (CIR), and outcome (OS, DFS) after first-line treatment. A total of 201 pts. was studied and the analysis was performed globally and in each molecular group: t(8;21)(q22;q22)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (30 pts., 14.9%), inv. (16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13q22)/CBFB-MIH11 (35 pts., 17.4%), normal karyotype and mutated NPM1 and negative FLT3-ITD (116 pts., 57.7%) or double-mutated CEBPA (CEBPAdm) (20 pts., 10%). Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 188 pts. (93.5%), molecular CR (mCR) in 114 (67.5%); After a median follow-up of 2.4 years, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was documented in 78 of 188 responding pts. (41%) after a median time of 11.3 months. CIR was higher in the CBFB-MIH11 group, in pts. achieving only a hematological response without mCR (72.1 vs 28.1%, p < 0.001), in older pts. and it resulted independently associated with a lower median cytarabine cumulative dose (CCD). Median OS was not reached: after 5 years it was 66.3%, and median DFS was 5.3 years, both without difference among groups. Molecular CR reached at any time, during or after the end of first-line treatment, was significantly associated with better DFS, and in particular, mCR assessed at the end of treatment was confirmed in multivariate analysis as an independent prognostic factor both for DFS and OS. In conclusion, the present study confirms in a real-life context the overall good prognosis of favorable-risk AML; the achievement of any molecular negativity during first-line treatment, particularly when assessed at the end of treatment, is associated with lower relapse and better survival. Increasing age at diagnosis has a negative prognostic impact, while CCD higher than 18 g/sqm is associated with better outcome.",,"['Zappasodi, Patrizia', 'Marbello, Laura', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Fumagalli, Monica', 'Bernardi, Massimo', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola', 'Mancini, Valentina', 'Da Via, Matteo', 'Ravano, Emanuele', 'Cerqui, Elisa', 'Ferretti, Virginia Valeria', 'Rocca, Barbara', 'Calvello, Celeste', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Castagnola, Carlo', 'Rossi, Giuseppe']","['Zappasodi P', 'Marbello L', 'Borlenghi E', 'Fumagalli M', 'Bernardi M', 'Fracchiolla N', 'Mancini V', 'Da Via M', 'Ravano E', 'Cerqui E', 'Ferretti VV', 'Rocca B', 'Calvello C', 'Cazzola M', 'Castagnola C', 'Rossi G']","['Division of Hematology, Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. p.zappasodi@smatteo.pv.it.', ""Department of Hematology, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Hematology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', ""Department of Hematology, Foundation, IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Department of Hematology, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy."", 'Division of Hematology, Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', ""Department of Hematology, Niguarda Ca' Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Hematology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180715,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', '*Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",2018/07/17 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/07/17 06:00'],"['2018/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3424-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3424-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2018 Nov;97(11):2107-2115. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3424-4.

Several studies have reported a decreased expression of Per1, Per2 and Per3 genes in different types of cancer and cancer cell lines. Promoter methylation downregulates Per1, Per2 or Per3 expression in myeloid leukemia, breast, lung, and other cancer cells; whereas histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) upregulate Per1 or Per3 expression in certain cancer cell lines. However, the transcriptional regulation of Per1 and Per2 in cancer cells by chromatin modifications is not fully understood. The present study aimed to determine whether HDACi regulate Per1 and Per2 expression in gastric cancer cell lines, and to investigate changes in chromatin modifications in response to HDACi. Treatment of KATO III and NCI-N87 human gastric cancer cells with sodium butyrate (NaB) or Trichostatin A (TSA) induced Per1 and Per2 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitaion assays revealed that NaB and TSA decreased lysine 9 trimethylation on histone H3 (H3K9me3) at the Per1 promoter. TSA, but not NaB increased H3K9 acetylation at the Per2 promoter. It was also observed that binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the Per1 promoter decreased following NaB treatment, whereas Sp1 binding increased at the Per2 promoter of NaB- and TSA-treated cells. In addition, Per1 promoter is not methylated in KATO III cells, while Per2 promoter was methylated, although NaB, TSA, and 5-Azacytidine do not change the methylated CpGs analyzed. In conclusion, HDACi induce Per1 and Per2 expression, in part, through mechanisms involving chromatin remodeling at the proximal promoter of these genes; however, other indirect mechanisms triggered by these HDACi cannot be ruled out. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated regulatory pathway between silencing of Per1 gene by H3K9me3 and upregulation of Per2 by HDACi in cancer cells.",,"['Hernandez-Rosas, Fabiola', 'Hernandez-Oliveras, Andres', 'Flores-Peredo, Lucia', 'Rodriguez, Gabriela', 'Zarain-Herzberg, Angel', 'Caba, Mario', 'Santiago-Garcia, Juan']","['Hernandez-Rosas F', 'Hernandez-Oliveras A', 'Flores-Peredo L', 'Rodriguez G', 'Zarain-Herzberg A', 'Caba M', 'Santiago-Garcia J']","['Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidad Veracruzana, Xalapa, Veracruz 91190, Mexico.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas, Universidad Veracruzana, Xalapa, Veracruz 91190, Mexico.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas, Universidad Veracruzana, Xalapa, Veracruz 91190, Mexico.', 'Programa de Doctorado en Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Veracruzana, Xalapa, Veracruz 91190, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City 04510, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City 04510, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City 04510, Mexico.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad Veracruzana, Xalapa, Veracruz 91190, Mexico.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas, Universidad Veracruzana, Xalapa, Veracruz 91190, Mexico.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180531,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,2018/07/17 06:00,2018/07/17 06:01,['2018/07/17 06:00'],"['2017/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2018.8851 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-8851 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2018 Aug;16(2):1981-1990. doi: 10.3892/ol.2018.8851.

FA is a rare multi-system genetic disorder, characterized by congenital malformations and progressive BMF. Patients with FA usually present chromosomal aberrations when evolving to MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thus, the cytogenetic studies in the bone marrow (BM) of these patients have an important role in the therapeutic decision, mainly in the indication for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The most frequent chromosomal alterations in the BM of FA patients are gains of the chromosomal regions 1q and 3q, and partial or complete loss of chromosome 7. However, the significance and the predictive value of such clonal alterations, with respect to malignant progress, are not fully understood and data from molecular cytogenetic studies are very limited. Case presentation: A five-year-old boy presented recurrent infections and persistent anemia. The BM biopsy revealed hypocellularity. G-banding was performed on BM cells and showed a normal karyotype. The physical examination showed to be characteristic of FA, being the diagnosis confirmed by DEB test. Five years later, even with supportive treatment, the patient presented severe hypocellularity and BM evolution revealing megakaryocyte dysplasia, intense dyserythropoiesis, and 11% myeloblasts. G-banded analysis showed an abnormal karyotype involving a der(9)t(9;11)(p24;q?22). The FISH analysis showed the monoallelic loss of ATM and KMT2A genes. At this moment the diagnosis was MDS, refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB). Allogeneic HSCT was indicated early in the diagnosis, but no donor was found. Decitabine treatment was initiated and well tolerated, although progression to AML occurred 3 months later. Chemotherapy induction was initiated, but there was no response. The patient died due to disease progression and infection complications. Conclusions: Molecular cytogenetic analysis showed a yet unreported der(9)t(9;11)(p24;q?22),der(11)t(9;11)(p24;q?22) during the evolution from FA to MDS/AML. The FISH technique was important allowing the identification at the molecular level of the monoallelic deletion involving the KMT2A and ATM genes. Our results suggest that this chromosomal alteration conferred a poor prognosis, being associated with a rapid leukemic transformation and a poor treatment response.",,"['Lovatel, Viviane Lamim', 'de Souza, Daiane Correa', 'Alvarenga, Tatiana Fonseca', 'Capela de Matos, Roberto R', 'Diniz, Claudia', 'Schramm, Marcia Trindade', 'Llerena Junior, Juan Clinton', 'Silva, Maria Luiza Macedo', 'Abdelhay, Eliana', 'de Souza Fernandez, Teresa']","['Lovatel VL', 'de Souza DC', 'Alvarenga TF', 'Capela de Matos RR', 'Diniz C', 'Schramm MT', 'Llerena Junior JC', 'Silva MLM', 'Abdelhay E', 'de Souza Fernandez T']","['1Bone Marrow Transplatation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '5Post-Graduate Program in Oncology, National Cancer Institute Jose de Alencar Gomes da Silva (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '1Bone Marrow Transplatation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '2Pathology Department of National Cancer Institute (INCA) and Post-Graduation Program in Medical Sciences, Rio de Janeiro State University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.412211.5', '1Bone Marrow Transplatation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '5Post-Graduate Program in Oncology, National Cancer Institute Jose de Alencar Gomes da Silva (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '1Bone Marrow Transplatation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '3Hematology Department, National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '4Medical Genetic Departament, Fernandes Figueira National Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, RJ Brazil.0000 0001 0723 0931grid.418068.3', '1Bone Marrow Transplatation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '5Post-Graduate Program in Oncology, National Cancer Institute Jose de Alencar Gomes da Silva (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '1Bone Marrow Transplatation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '5Post-Graduate Program in Oncology, National Cancer Institute Jose de Alencar Gomes da Silva (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '1Bone Marrow Transplatation Center (CEMO), National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d', '5Post-Graduate Program in Oncology, National Cancer Institute Jose de Alencar Gomes da Silva (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.grid.419166.d']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180711,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,2018/07/17 06:00,2018/07/17 06:01,['2018/07/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-018-0389-x [doi]', '389 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2018 Jul 11;11:40. doi: 10.1186/s13039-018-0389-x. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['ATM', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Classical cytogenetics', 'FISH', 'Fanconi anemia', 'KMT2A', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'T(9;11)']",,,PMC6042331,,"['This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Brazilian National Cancer', 'Institute (CEP #088/07).

However, benefits are offset by high rates of non-relapse mortality (NRM) in patients undergoing myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens can extend this therapy to adults who are unfit for MAC, although at the cost of higher relapse rates. In this review, we discuss evidence to support the usage of RIC regimens, controversies, and potential strategies to improve transplant outcomes going forward. RECENT FINDINGS: Several novel therapies have recently been approved for the treatment of relapsed ALL and may play an important role in bridging adults with residual disease to RIC transplant. Assessing response to initial therapy via minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring may determine which patients will derive the most benefit from allogeneic HSCT. Reduced intensity allogeneic HSCT remains a potentially curative therapy that can be offered to older adults however challenges remain. Going forward, MRD testing and novel therapies may help better select which patients should proceed to transplant and assist in getting those patients to transplant with optimally controlled disease.",,"['Leonard, Jessica T', 'Hayes-Lattin, Brandon']","['Leonard JT', 'Hayes-Lattin B']","['Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, Mail Code L586, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. leonard@ohsu.edu.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, Mail Code L586, Portland, OR, 97239, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Allografts', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",2018/07/17 06:00,2019/03/02 06:00,['2018/07/16 06:00'],"['2018/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-018-0462-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-018-0462-x [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2018 Aug;13(4):329-340. doi: 10.1007/s11899-018-0462-x.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)', '*Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC)']",4,,PMC6097057,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compound 9b (2-chloro-3-ethyl-5,6,7-trimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) was the most potent toward HL-60 leukaemia cells. In mechanistic study for 9b, the protein levels of mtDNA-specific DNA polymerase gamma (poly-gamma) and mtDNA transcription factor A (mt-TFA) were decreased after the 24h treatment, showing the occurrence of mtDNA damage. And 9b triggered cell cycle arrest at S phase accompanied by a secondary block in G2/M phase which had a direct link to the process of mtDNA damage. The dissipations of mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP also proceeded. On the other hand, 9b promoted the generation of ROS and resulted in the oxidation of intracellular GSH to GSSG. This process was coupled to the formation of adduct between 9b and GSH, detected by the UV-Vis spectrum and HRMS analysis. Depletion of GSH by buthionine sulfoximine enhanced ROS level and produced higher cytotoxicity, suggesting GSH was involved in the anti-leukemic mechanism of 9b. Together, our results provide new insights on the molecular mechanism of the derivatives of 2-chloro-1,4-naphthoquinone and 9b might be useful for the further development into an anti-leukemia agent.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 2591 newly diagnosed ALL children were treated in Poland between the years 2005 and 2017. Of those, 44 were diagnosed with Ph(+) ALL. The patients were treated according to protocols: ALL IC-BFM 2002 and 2009 (26 patients), EsPhALL (12 patients), initially ALL IC-BFM and then EsPhALL (6 patients). RESULTS: The median of follow-up in the observed group was 3 years. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of Ph+ ALL group were 0.73 and 0.64. OS and EFS of patients after HSCT were 0.78 and 0.66, while without HSCT were 0.6 and 0.6, P = 0.27 and 0.63. OS was 0.8 for patients treated with chemotherapy plus imatinib and 0.61 for chemotherapy alone, P = 0.22, while EFS was 0.66 (imatinib therapy) and 0. 61 (without imatinib), P = 0.41. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that adding imatinib to intensive chemotherapy seems to improve outcome.

Its true incidence is difficult to assess, although improvements in chimerism studies contributed to a better diagnosis of DCL. We report two rare cases of donor cell-derived acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). To our knowledge, only two cases have been described in the literature. Here, we report one male and one female patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who developed an APL in donor cells after HSCT. The latency between HSCT and DCL was 279 and 43 months, respectively. Fluorescent in situ hybridation and chimerism monitoring analysis proved the donor origin of APL. Surprisingly, donor lymphocyte infusion provided a hematological response during 19 months in the female patient. The mechanisms associated with pathogenesis of DCL are unclear and seem to be multifactorial. Increasing worldwide allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation activity and potentially the age of donor could explain the increasing incidence of DCL in the future.

For better characterization of the T cell responses, we assessed frequency and diversity of leukemia-associated antigen (LAA)-specific cytotoxic T cells using ELISpot and pMHC multimer assays and analyzed the frequency of regulatory T cells (Treg) as well as cytokine profiles before/after DLI. The data were correlated to the clinical course of patients. Significantly more LAA-derived T cell epitopes (p = 0.02) were recognized in clinical responders (R) when compared to nonresponders (NR). In addition, pMHC multimer-based flow cytometry showed a significantly higher frequency of LAA-specific T cells in R versus NR. The frequency of Treg in R decreased significantly (p = 0.008) while keeping stable in NR. No differences in T cell subset analysis before/after DLI were revealed. Clinical responders were correlated to specific immune responses and all clinical responders showed an increase of specific immune responses after DLI. Cytokine assays using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed a significant increase of IL-4 after DLI. Taken together, an increase of specific CTL responses against several LAA after DLI was detected.

The general aim of the LBC ONC is to improve treatment of hematopoietic neoplasms by eradicating cancer-initiating and disease-propagating cells, also known as leukemic stem cells (LSC) in the context of leukemia. In a first phase, the LBC ONC characterized the phenotype and molecular aberration profiles of LSC in various malignancies. The LSC phenotypes were established in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, the concept of preleukemic (premalignant) neoplastic stem cells (pre-L-NSC) was coined by the LBC ONC and was tested in myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Phenotypic characterization of LSC provided a solid basis for their purification and for the characterization of specific target expression profiles. In a second phase, molecular markers and targets were validated. This second phase is ongoing and should result in the development of new diagnostics parameters and novel, more effective, LSC-eradicating, treatment strategies; however, many issues still remain to be solved, such as sub-clonal evolution, LSC niche interactions, immunologic control of LSC, and LSC resistance. In the forthcoming years, the LBC ONC will concentrate on developing LSC-eradicating strategies, with special focus on LSC resistance, precision medicine and translation of LSC-eradicating concepts

While this field of passive immunotherapy is continuously evolving, several breakthroughs will expand the treatment modalities to include more active immunotherapy. With the approval of immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies for Hodgkin lymphoma and bispecific antibodies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), activation of endogenous T cells already plays a role in several lymphoid malignancies. With the approval of cellular therapies with CAR-T cells for ALL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the impact of the manipulation of immune responses is taken even further. Vaccines are cellular therapies in the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of side effects, and while the big breakthrough is still to come, the prospect of a very low-toxic immunotherapy which could be applicable also in premalignant states or in frail patients drives a considerable research activity in the area.

Cancer can have a number of causes, such the activation of oncogenes, the inactivation of tumor-suppressing genes, mutagenesis provoked by external factors, and epigenetic modifications. The development of diagnostic tools and treatments using a molecular biological approach permits the use of sensitive, low-cost, noninvasive tests for cancer patients. Biomarkers can be used to provide rapid, personalized oncology, in particular the molecular diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia, and gastric, colon, and breast cancers. Molecular tests based on DNA methylation can also be used to direct treatments or evaluate the toxic effects of chemotherapy. The adequate diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of the response of cancer patients to treatment are essential to ensure the most effective therapy, reduce the damaging effects of treatment, and direct the therapy to specific targets, and in this context, molecular biology has become increasingly important in oncology. In this brief review, we will demonstrate the fundamental importance of molecular biology for the treatment of three types of cancer-chronic myeloid leukemia, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, and astrocytomas (sporadic tumors of the central nervous system). In each of these three models, distinct biological mechanisms are involved in the transformation of the cells, but in all cases, molecular biology is fundamental to the development of personalized analyses for each patient and each type of neoplasia, and to guarantee the success of the treatment.",,"[""de Castro Sant' Anna, Carla"", 'Junior, Alberto Gomes Ferreira', 'Soares, Paulo', 'Tuji, Fabricio', 'Paschoal, Eric', 'Chaves, Luiz Claudio', 'Burbano, Rommel Rodriguez']","[""de Castro Sant' Anna C"", 'Junior AGF', 'Soares P', 'Tuji F', 'Paschoal E', 'Chaves LC', 'Burbano RR']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Ophir Loyola Hospital, Av.

The choice between these treatments is a function of many patient-related and disease-related factors. We investigated how physicians' behavioral characteristics affect medical decision-making between intensive and non-intensive therapy in this setting. A nationwide cross-sectional online survey of hematologists collected data on medical decision-making for 6 clinical vignettes involving older acute myeloid leukemia patients that were representative of routine practice. Questionnaires elicited physicians' demographic and occupational characteristics along with their individual behavioral characteristics according to a decision theory framework. From the pattern of responses to the vignettes, a K-means clustering algorithm was used to distinguish those who were likely to prescribe more intensive therapy and those who were likely to prescribe less intensive or no therapy. Multivariate analyses were used to identify physician's characteristics predictive of medical decision-making. We obtained 230 assessable answers, which represented an adjusted response rate of 45.4%. A multivariate model (n=210) revealed that physicians averse to uncertainty recommend significantly more intensive chemotherapy: Odds Ratio (OR) [95% Confidence Interval (CI)]: 1.15 [1.01;1.30]; P=0.039. Male physicians who do not conform to the expected utility model (assumed as economically irrational) recommend more intensive chemotherapy [OR (95% CI) = 3.45 (1.34; 8.85); P=0.01]. Patient volume per physician also correlated with therapy intensity [OR (95% CI)=0.98 (0.96; 0.99); P=0.032]. The physicians' medical decision-making was not affected by their age, years of experience, or hospital facility. The significant association between medical decision and individual behavioral characteristics of the physician identifies a novel non-biological factor that may affect acute myeloid leukemia patients' outcomes and explain variations in clinical practice. It should also encourage the use of validated predictive models and the description of novel bio-markers to best select patients for intensive chemotherapy or low-intensity therapy.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Bories, Pierre', 'Lamy, Sebastien', 'Simand, Celestine', 'Bertoli, Sarah', 'Delpierre, Cyrille', 'Malak, Sandra', 'Fornecker, Luc', 'Moreau, Stephane', 'Recher, Christian', 'Nebout, Antoine']","['Bories P', 'Lamy S', 'Simand C', 'Bertoli S', 'Delpierre C', 'Malak S', 'Fornecker L', 'Moreau S', 'Recher C', 'Nebout A']","['Regional Cancer Network Onco-Occitanie, Toulouse University Institute of Cancer-Oncopole pierre.bories@onco-occitanie.fr.', 'Department of Hematology, Toulouse University Institute of Cancer-Oncopole.', 'INSERM Unit 1027, Faculty of Medicine, Toulouse.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Toulouse University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Strasbourg University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Toulouse University Institute of Cancer-Oncopole.', 'INSERM Unit 1027, Faculty of Medicine, Toulouse.', 'Department of Hematology, Rene Huguenin Hospital, Curie Institute, Saint-Cloud.', 'Department of Hematology, Strasbourg University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Limoges University Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Toulouse University Institute of Cancer-Oncopole.', 'INRA, UR 1303 ALISS, Ivry-sur-Seine, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180713,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', '*Clinical Decision-Making', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Physicians/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Uncertainty']",2018/07/15 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2018/07/15 06:00'],"['2018/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.192468 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.192468 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Dec;103(12):2040-2048. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.192468.

Aflatoxins alter the function of host cells by inducing multiple effects through genetic and non-genetic pathways. Epigenetic mechanisms drag major attention towards finding novel and new mechanisms involved in this process. Our present work intends to study the functional expression profile of multiple epigenetic regulators. AFB1 modulates multiple epigenetic regulators like DNA methyltransferases (DMNTs), histones modifying enzymes and polycomb proteins. AFB1 upregulates the expression of DNMTs at gene and protein level in a dose dependent manner. It reduced the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity significantly with a remarkable increase in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity along with an induction in expression of HDACs gene and protein in a dose dependent manner. The gene and protein expression of polycomb repressor proteins B cell specific moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1) and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was significantly over expressed with enhanced trimethylation of H3K27 and ubiquitination of H2AK119.

In a companion study we performed immunophenotypic analysis to determine the impact of ATLG on immune reconstitution (IR) and to correlate IR with clinical outcomes. The randomized study (n=254) included patients (aged 18 to 65 years) who underwent myeloablative transplants for acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia from HLA-matched unrelated donors. Ninety-one patients consented for the companion IR study (ATLG=44, placebo=47). Blood samples were collected on days 30, 100, 180, and 360 after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and multiparameter flow cytometry was performed in a blinded fashion. Reconstitution of CD3(+) and CD4(+) T cells was delayed up to 6 months post-HCT in the ATLG arm, whereas absolute regulatory T cell (Treg) (CD4(+)25(+)127-) numbers were lower only in the first 100 days. Analysis of the CD4(+) Treg and conventional T cells (Tconv) (CD4(+)25(-)127(+)) compartments showed a profound absence of naive Tregs and Tconv in the first 100 days post-HCT, with very slow recovery for 1 year. B cell and natural killer cell recovery were similar in each arm. Higher absolute counts of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) T, Tregs, and Tconv were associated with improved overall survival, progression-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality but not moderate/severe cGVHD. Although ATLG delays CD3(+) and CD4(+) T cell recovery post-transplant, it has a relative Treg sparing effect after the early post-HCT period, with possible implications for protection from cGVHD. ATLG severely compromises the generation of naive CD4(+) cells (Treg and Tconv), potentially affecting the diversity of the TCR repertoire and T cell responses against malignancy and infection.","['Copyright (c) 2018 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, little is known regarding hematological malignancies. In this manuscript, we investigated the effect of a novel and selective ChoKalpha inhibitor EB-3D in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The effect of EB-3D was evaluated in a panel of T-leukemia cell lines and ex-vivo primary cultures derived from pediatric T-ALL patients. We also evaluated in detail, using Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA), protein phosphorylation level changes in T-ALL cells upon treatment. The drug exhibits a potent antiproliferative activity in a panel of T-leukemia cell lines and primary cultures of pediatric patients. Moreover, the drug strongly induces apoptosis and more importantly it enhanced T-leukemia cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, such as dexamethasone and l-asparaginase. In addition, the compound induces an early activation of AMPK, the main regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, by its phosphorylation at residue T712 of catalytic subunit alpha, and thus repressing mTORC1 pathway, as shown by mTOR S2448 dephosphorylation. The inhibition of mTOR in turn affects the activity of several known downstream targets, such as 4E-BP1, p70S6K, S6 Ribosomal Protein and GSK3 that ultimately may lead to a reduction of protein synthesis and cell death. Taken together, our findings suggest that targeting ChoKalpha may be an interesting option for treating T-ALL and that EB-3D could represent a valuable therapeutic tool.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Among them, compound 1e possessing 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl terminal ring and 3`-methoxy-5`-chlorophenyl ring attached to the central pyrazole ring was the most potent. Its IC50 values were in sub-micromolar range against most of the tested cell lines. It showed superior potency than sorafenib, a reference diarylurea drug, over all the tested cell lines. It was also extremely selective towards cancer cells than non-cancerous cells (IC50 against RAW 264.7 macrophages was higher than 100muM). At molecular level, compound 1e selectively inhibited V600E mutated B-RAF kinase (IC50=0.39muM). It also stimulated caspase 3/7 enzymes in RPMI-8226 leukemia cells (2.79 fold increase at 10muM concentration, EC50=1.52muM). So compound 1e may kill cancer cells through induction of apoptosis.

While 90% are asymptomatic, 5% develop severe diseases including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoka (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). No vaccine against HTLV-1 exists, and screening programs are not universal. However, patients with chronic HTLV-1 infection have high frequencies of HTLV-1-activated CD8+ T cells, and the two main HLA alleles (A2, A24) are present in 88% of infected individuals. We thus utilized an immunoproteomics approach to characterize MHC-I restricted epitopes presented by HLA-A2+, A24+ MT-2 and SLB-1 cell lines. Unlike traditional motif prediction algorithms, this approach identifies epitopes associated with cytotoxic T-cell responses in their naturally processed forms, minimizing differences in antigen processing and protein expression levels. Out of nine identified peptides, we confirmed six novel MHC-I restricted epitopes that were capable of binding HLA-A2 and HLA-A24 alleles and used in vitro and in vivo methods to generate CD8+ T cells specific for each of these peptides. MagPix MILLIPLEX data showed that in vitro generated epitope-specific CD8+ T cells secreted IFN-, granzyme B, MIP-1alpha, TNF-alpha, perforin and IL-10 when cultured in the presence of MT-2 cell line. Degranulation assay confirmed cytotoxic response through surface expression of CD107 on CD8+ T cells when cultured with MT-2 cells. A CD8+ T-cell killing assay indicated significant antiviral activity of CD8+ T cells specific against all identified peptides. In vivo generated CD8+ T cells similarly demonstrated immunogenicity on ELISpot, CD107 degranulation assay, and MagPix MILLIPLEX analysis. These epitopes are thus candidates for a therapeutic peptide-based vaccine against HTLV-1, and our results provide preclinical data for the advancement of such a vaccine.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Although survival for pediatric B-ALL has approached 90%, variability in outcome among and within cytogenetically defined subgroups persists. While G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have been used to characterize leukemic clones, there is added value of chromosomal microarray and next generation sequencing in screening genome-wide for copy number aberrations, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity and nucleotide variations. Evaluation of novel genetic aberrations can provide information about the biologic mechanisms of cytogenetically defined subgroups associated with poor prognosis, explain heterogeneity in patient outcome and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention. The high risk B-ALL intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21, (iAMP21), subtype is characterized by amplification of a region of chromosome 21 that typically encompasses the RUNX1 gene and is associated with poor prognosis. Analysis of chromosomal microarray and FISH data revealed that deletions of SH2B3, encoding a negative regulator of multiple tyrosine kinase and cytokine signaling pathways, are enriched among leukemias harboring iAMP21. Enrichment of SH2B3 aberrations in the iAMP21 subtype may indicate that loss of SH2B3 contributes to disease progression and raises the possibility that these leukemias may be sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

The sources of germline DNA include peripheral blood (PB) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE). However, the source of normal can be problematic, especially in transplant setting. Herein, we report two cases of NGS-based molecular testing in a patient with mycosis fungoides treated with stem cell transplant [SCT] (Pt1) and a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who previously had acute leukemia cured by SCT. These cases highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate normal sample for excluding germline polymorphisms during somatic mutation testing. Initial analyses that included concurrent PB sample failed to filter known germline polymorphisms. Repeat analyses using pre-transplant PB/bone marrow allowed for the successful subtraction of germline variants. Somatic mutations in PTEN and ERBB4 (Pt1) and CDKN2A, KRAS, KDR, and TP53 (Pt2) were reported with confidence. Selection of an appropriate source of germline DNA for NGS-based somatic mutation testing for patients with SCT transplant can be challenging. Particular attention to the clinical history is crucial for accurate interpretation and reporting.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Because MCL cells are most vulnerable before their exposure to therapeutic agents, front-line therapy could eliminate MCL cells at the first strike, reduce the chance for secondary resistance, and cause long-term remissions. If optimized, it could become an alternative to cure MCL. The key is the intensity of front-line therapy. Both the Nordic 2 and the MD Anderson Cancer Center HCVAD trials, with follow-up times greater than 10 years, achieved long-term survivals exceeding 10 years. But the Achilles heel in both trials were the severe toxicities, such as secondary malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes /leukemia. Therefore, intensive therapies can act as a double-edged sword providing long term survival at the cost of severe toxicities. In our opinion, although intensive chemotherapy can cause detrimental side effects, it is indispensable given that we run the risk of sacrificing long-term survivals in these young and fit patients. We must seek for a powerful alternative at the front-line. Furthermore, minimal residual disease negativity should be the optimal therapeutic goal to achieve before and after autologous stem cell transplantation. Some novel therapeutic strategies have shown to improve outcomes, but it is not yet clear as to how these results translate in population. Of note, MCL patients need to be stratified at diagnosis and be provided with different intensities of front-line regimen.

METHODS: We investigated the anthraquinone compound mitoxantrone that is used for treating certain cancer types like leukemia and lymphoma with magnetic tweezers as a single molecule nanosensor. In order to study the association of mitoxantrone with dsDNA, we conducted force-extension and mechanical overwinding experiments with a sensitivity of 10(-14) N. RESULTS: Using this method, we were able to estimate an equilibrium constant of association Ka approximately 1 x 105 M(-1) as well as a binding site size of n approximately 2.5 base pairs for mitoxantrone. An unwinding angle of mitoxantrone-intercalation of vartheta approximately 16 degrees was determined.

As lymphoblasts have to overcome the physiological blood-CNS barriers to enter the CNS, we investigated the cellular interactions of lymphoblasts with the choroid plexus (CP) epithelium of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Both a precurser B cell ALL (pB-ALL) cell line (SD-1) and a T cell ALL (T-ALL) cell line (P12-Ishikawa) were able to actively cross the CP epithelium in a human in vitro model. We could illustrate a transcellular and (supposedly) paracellular transmigration by 3-dimensional immunofluorescence microscopy as well as electron microscopy. Chemotactic stimulation with CXCL12 during this process led to a significantly increased transmigration and blocking CXCL12/CXCR4-signaling by the CXCR4-inhibitor AMD3100 inhibited this effect. However, CXCR4 expression in primary ALL samples did not correlate to CNS disease, indicating that CXCR4-driven CNS invasion across the BCSFB might be a general property of pediatric ALL.

This study reports on the management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) and a subsequent diagnosis of melanoma. In the Wilmot Cancer Institute CLL cohort, which includes 470 patients followed for 2849 person-years, 18 patients (3.8%) developed 22 melanomas. Fourteen melanomas were invasive, a significantly higher rate as compared with the age and sex matched general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 6.32 (95% CI 3.45; 10.60). Melanomas were most often detected (n=15; 68.2%) through active surveillance in a dermatology clinic. Most melanomas (n=17; 77.3%) were detected at a non-advanced stage (pathological stage grouping<III). The most common management was wide local excision without sentinel lymph node biopsy (n=13, 59.1%). Management for the 4 (18.2%) patients with metastatic disease included the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab (n=1), systemic chemotherapy with dacarbazine (n=1), and palliative care (n=2). The patient treated with ICI is in sustained remission of her melanoma after 23 cycles of therapy while her TP53 disrupted CLL continues to respond to ibrutinib therapy. We conclude that patients with CLL may benefit from active surveillance for melanoma leading to early excision of locally-manageable disease.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with a prolonged inpatient length of stay LOS during induction chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: Data from patients (N=73) (age<21 years) was collected through a retrospective chart review. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to test for statistical significance. The overall survival and disease (leukemia)-free survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULTS: Of the 73 patients, 42 (57%) patients were discharged on day 4 of induction (short LOS, group A), while 31 (43%) patients (group B) experienced a prolonged LOS or an ICU stay (16+/-27.7 days, median hospital stay=8 days vs 4 days (group A), p=0.02) due to organ dysfunction, infectious or metabolic complications. Group B patients were more likely to have a lower platelet count, serum bicarbonate, and a higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on day 4 of treatment (OR=4.52, 8.21, and 3.02, respectively, p<0.05). Multivariable analysis identified low serum bicarbonate (p=0.002) and a platelet count<20,000/muL (p=0.02) on day 4 of induction to be predictive of a prolonged LOS. Twenty six (group A (n=16, 36%) and B (n=11, 35%), p=0.8) patients experienced unplanned admissions, within 30 days of discharge. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of newly diagnosed HR or VHR pediatric ALL patients experience a prolonged LOS and unplanned re-admissions. Aggressive discharge planning and close follow up is indicated in this cohort of patients.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Reports on analysis of bone marrow samples from patients have revealed a high incidence of mutations in splicing factors in early stem and progenitor cell clones, but the mechanisms underlying transformation of HSPCs harboring these mutations remain unknown. Using ex vivo cultures of primary human CD34(+) cells as a model, we find that mutations in splicing factors SRSF2 and U2AF1 exert distinct effects on proliferation and differentiation of HSPCs. SRSF2 mutations cause a dramatic inhibition of proliferation via a G2-M phase arrest and induction of apoptosis. U2AF1 mutations, conversely, do not significantly affect proliferation. Mutations in both SRSF2 and U2AF1 cause abnormal differentiation by skewing granulo-monocytic differentiation toward monocytes but elicit diverse effects on megakaryo-erythroid differentiation. The SRSF2 mutations skew differentiation toward megakaryocytes whereas U2AF1 mutations cause an increase in the erythroid cell populations. These distinct functional consequences indicate that SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations have cell context-specific effects and that the generation of myeloid disease phenotype by mutations in the genes coding these two proteins likely involves different intracellular mechanisms.

However, the dynamic adaptation of niche cells to changes in physiological stimulatory signals remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we have established a niche stimulation model induced by 5-fluorouracil. This model reveals a rapid and reversible conversion of mesenchymal cells into niche-like stromal cells, which exhibit a platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha(+) /leptin receptor(+) (PL) phenotype. These cells selectively induce the niche signaling molecule, Jagged-1, but not CXCL12, to initiate a stimulation-induced regeneration of HSCs in a Jagged-1 dependent manner. Conversion of mesenchymal cells into niche-like cells occurred independently of mitotic activation. The conversion was accompanied by the acquisition of primitive mesenchymal cell characteristics, including the rapid induction of stage specific embryonic antigen-3 and the acquisition of clonogenic potential. The stimulation-induced remodeling of the BM niche resulted in a positive stimulatory effect on the regeneration of normal HSC, but exerted inhibitory effects on leukemic cells, leading to a competitive advantage for normal HSCs in the BM niche and prolonged survival of mice engrafted with leukemic cells. Thus, the reactive conversion of mesenchymal stroma into niche-like cells reveals the adaptive changes of the BM microenvironment to stimuli, and provides insight on the remodeling of niche toward pronormal/antileukemic microenvironment, which can counteract the progressive proleukemic changes driven by the leukemic niche. Our study raises the potential for antileukemic niche targeting therapy.

The role of JAK2V617F mutation in increasing the thrombotic risk in CMPNs is yet unequivocal. Aims: : To clarify the contribution of JAK2V617F mutation in thrombosis in CMPN patients. Settings and Design: This retrospective study was done to evaluate role of JAK2V617F mutation in thrombosis in CMPNs. Materials and Methods: 65 CMPN patients (PV, ET and PMF) were analyzed for JAK2V617F mutation using ARMS-PCR and detailed history of thrombosis was recorded in these patients. Statistical Analysis: P values were 2 tailed, and statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Results: : 46/65 were males and 19/65 were females [M: F: 2.4:1] with median age 46 years [range, 14-80 years]. Patients had median Hb 15.6 g/dl [range, 5.1-20.3], median TLC 10.7 x 10(9)/l [range 2.4-216] and platelet count 360 x 10(9)/l [range, 20-1859]. 32 were JAK2V617F positive and 33 were negative for this mutation. On comparing the prevalence of thrombosis in JAK2V617F positive patients with JAK2V617F negative patients, we observed that 20/32 (62.5%) JAK2V617F positive patients had thrombosis as compared to 16/33 (48%) in JAK2V617F negative patients (P = 0.04). We observed significant association of JAK2V617F mutation with thrombosis, however no association of this mutation with thrombosis was observed among the JAK2V617F negative patients. Conclusion: Our study suggests that JAK2V617F mutation may increase the risk of thrombosis in CMPNs. This finding could lead to risk stratification, setting up the treatment strategy in CMPNs.",,"['Singh, Kanwaljeet', 'Sazawal, Sudha', 'Chhikara, Sunita', 'Mahapatra, Manoranjan', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Singh K', 'Sazawal S', 'Chhikara S', 'Mahapatra M', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Janus Kinase 2/blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/blood/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/epidemiology/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2018/07/14 06:00,2018/11/22 06:00,['2018/07/14 06:00'],"['2018/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/22 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2018_61_3_371_236630 [pii]', '10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_781_17 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2018 Jul-Sep;61(3):371-374. doi: 10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_781_17.,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'JAK2V617F mutation', 'thrombosis']",3,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim was to determine whether recent epidemiologic studies of low-LET radiation, particularly those at low doses and/or low dose rates (LD/LDR), broadly support the LNT model of carcinogenic risk or, on the contrary, demonstrate sufficient evidence that the LNT model is inappropriate for the purposes of radiation protection. An updated review was needed because a considerable number of reports of radiation epidemiologic studies based on new or updated data have been published since other major reviews were conducted by national and international scientific committees. The Commentary provides a critical review of the LD/LDR studies that are most directly applicable to current occupational, environmental and medical radiation exposure circumstances. This Memorandum summarises several of the more important LD/LDR studies that incorporate radiation dose responses for solid cancer and leukemia that were reviewed in Commentary No. 27. In addition, an overview is provided of radiation studies of breast and thyroid cancers, and cancer after childhood exposures. Non-cancers are briefly touched upon such as ischemic heart disease, cataracts, and heritable genetic effects. To assess the applicability and utility of the LNT model for radiation protection, the Commentary evaluated 29 epidemiologic studies or groups of studies, primarily of total solid cancer, in terms of strengths and weaknesses in their epidemiologic methods, dosimetry approaches, and statistical modelling, and the degree to which they supported a LNT model for continued use in radiation protection. Recommendations for how to make epidemiologic radiation studies more informative are outlined. The NCRP Committee recognises that the risks from LD/LDR exposures are small and uncertain. The Committee judged that the available epidemiologic data were broadly supportive of the LNT model and that at this time no alternative dose-response relationship appears more pragmatic or prudent for radiation protection purposes.",,"['Shore, R E', 'Beck, H L', 'Boice, J D', 'Caffrey, E A', 'Davis, S', 'Grogan, H A', 'Mettler, F A', 'Preston, R J', 'Till, J E', 'Wakeford, R', 'Walsh, L', 'Dauer, L T']","['Shore RE', 'Beck HL', 'Boice JD', 'Caffrey EA', 'Davis S', 'Grogan HA', 'Mettler FA', 'Preston RJ', 'Till JE', 'Wakeford R', 'Walsh L', 'Dauer LT']","['New York University School of Medicine, New York, United States of America.

As observed for beta-lapachone (3), the active naphthoquinones all induced apoptosis in a cell-cycle-independent fashion. In contrast to the pyran-fused beta-lapachone (3), however, the most potent furan-fused naphthoquinones were able to redox cycle and generate superoxide in cell-based assays, which was independent of NAD(P)H:quinone oxido-reductase 1. In a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assays with MDA-MB-231 cells, both napabucasin (6) and isonapabucasin (7) were identified as targeting STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, drug affinity responsive target stability assays were performed to validate a direct interaction of the naphthoquinones with STAT3. Isonapabucasin (7) turned out to be twice as potent against STAT3 as napabucasin (6) in the HTRF assay, with an EC50 in the submicromolar range, which was in excellent agreement with the potency of both agents to inhibit the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, molecular docking experiments predicted different binding modes to the STAT3 SH2 domain for the linearly anellated napabucasin (6) and its angularly anellated isomer (7).",,"['Locken, Hauke', 'Clamor, Cinzia', 'Muller, Klaus']","['Locken H', 'Clamor C', 'Muller K']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, PharmaCampus , Westphalian Wilhelms University , Corrensstrasse 48 , D-48149 Munster , Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, PharmaCampus , Westphalian Wilhelms University , Corrensstrasse 48 , D-48149 Munster , Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, PharmaCampus , Westphalian Wilhelms University , Corrensstrasse 48 , D-48149 Munster , Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180713,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (napabucasin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzofurans/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Naphthoquinones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2018/07/14 06:00,2019/11/20 06:00,['2018/07/14 06:00'],"['2018/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b00247 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2018 Jul 27;81(7):1636-1644. doi: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b00247.

CA has been shown to exhibit tremendous pharmacological properties which include, but are not limited to, anticancer, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The current study was designed to evaluate the anticancer effects of CA against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) which is one of the rare but deadly malignancies both in men and women. METHODS: CML KBM-7 cell line was used in this study. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected by DAPI and annexin V/PI staining, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry and cell invasion by Boyden chamber assay. The microRNA-780 expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Our results indicated that CA exhibits significant anticancer activity on CML KBM-7 cells with an IC50 of 25 muM. The anticancer activity was due to induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, it was observed that CA inhibits the proliferation and invasion of CML KBM-7 cells which could mainly be due to downregulation of microRNA- 780 expression as indicated by the quantitative RT-PCR analysis. CONCLUSION: Taken together, we propose that carnosic acid could prove a potential lead compound in the treatment of CML and deserves further in vitro as well as in vivo study.",,"['Liu, Deliang', 'Wang, Biao', 'Zhu, Yuandong', 'Yan, Feng', 'Dong, Weimin']","['Liu D', 'Wang B', 'Zhu Y', 'Yan F', 'Dong W']","[""Department of Hematology, the First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou 213000, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (MIRN708 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)']",,"['Abietanes/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics']",2018/07/14 06:00,2019/08/16 06:00,['2018/07/14 06:00'],"['2018/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2018 May-Jun;23(3):741-746.,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies suggest that cranial irradiation might impact on pineal melatonin secretion. Melatonin is an important regulator in human circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle. The objective of this study was to investigate melatonin secretion, subjective sleep parameters and their interplay in a cohort of cranially irradiated head and brain tumour and leukaemia survivors at least 3 years after radiotherapy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PATIENTS: Thirty-eight adults. MEASUREMENTS: Melatonin secretion was evaluated by measuring its metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin in collected overnight urine. Subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Beck Depression Inventory II was used to screen for depressive symptoms because of their impact on sleep. RESULTS: Patients irradiated in the brain midline had significantly lower melatonin secretion (P = 0.008). Subjects exhibited a high prevalence of sleeping difficulties, daytime sleepiness and depression, with females and overweight subjects particularly affected. Melatonin values and subjective sleep parameters did not correlate with each other or with treatment and most patient variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that radiation exposure to the pineal gland negatively affects melatonin secretion. This lack of pineal melatonin does not influence subjective sleep quality. As melatonin has important antioxidant and cancer-protective effects, further research is necessary to elucidate whether these patients have an increased risk of developing secondary neoplasms and other radiation late effects.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Rosenkranz, Esther', 'Thissen, Andrea', 'Siegel, Sonja', 'Piroth, Marc', 'Clusmann, Hans', 'Gebauer, Judith', 'Brabant, Georg', 'Kreitschmann-Andermahr, Ilonka']","['Rosenkranz E', 'Thissen A', 'Siegel S', 'Piroth M', 'Clusmann H', 'Gebauer J', 'Brabant G', 'Kreitschmann-Andermahr I']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology, Medical Clinic I, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology, Medical Clinic I, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180802,England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,['JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melatonin/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2018/07/14 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2018/07/14 06:00'],"['2018/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cen.13814 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2018 Dec;89(6):870-877. doi: 10.1111/cen.13814.

No randomized clinical trial comparing survival outcomes of a second allo-HCT (allo-HCT2) vs donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has been conducted to date. Objective: To compare overall survival (OS) after an allo-HCT2 or DLI in relapsed AML after a first allo-HCT. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective registry study from the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation involving 418 adults who received an allo-HCT2 (n = 137) or DLI (n = 281) for postallograft-relapsed AML. Analysis was assessed on the principle of intent-to-first received intervention. The data were collected from November 21, 2015, to May 15, 2017, and analysis was performed June 1, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of patients with relapsed AML who are alive after 2 years and 5 years from receiving an allo-HCT2 or DLI. Results: Of the 418 patients, 228 (54.5%) were men; mean age was 46.2 years (interquartile range, 36.5-56.9 years). There was no apparent difference in OS whether an allo-HCT2 or DLI was prescribed (2-year OS with allo-HCT2, 26%; 5-year OS with allo-HCT2, 19%; 2-year OS with DLI, 25%; 5-year OS with DLI, 15%; P = .86). Overall survival was better if either of these procedures was offered when the patient was in complete remission (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.41-0.74; P < .001). Conversely, OS was low for patients relapsing within less than 6 months after an allo-HCT1, regardless of the treatment prescribed (5-year OS: allo-HCT2, 9%; 95% CI, 1%-17% vs DLI, 4%; 95% CI, 1%-8%; P = .86).

Usually, Treg cells maintain the immune cell homeostasis. This small subset of T cells has been, in fact, considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and progression of acute and chronic leukemias. However, whether Treg dysregulation in CLL and ALL plays a key role or it rather represents a simple epiphenomenon is still a matter of debate. Treg cells have been proposed as a prognostic indicator of the clinical course of the disease and might also be used for targeted immune therapy. Our study revealed statistically higher percentage of Treg cells in the bone marrow than in peripheral blood in the group of 42 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. By analyzing Treg subpopulations, it was shown that only memory Tregs in contact with leukemic antigens showed statistically significant differences. We noticed a low negative correlation between Treg cells in the bone marrow and the percentage of blasts (R = -0.36) as well as a moderate correlation between Treg cells in the bone marrow and Hb level (R = +0.41) in peripheral blood before therapy. The number of peripheral blood blasts on day 8th correlates negatively (R = -0.36) with Tregs. Furthermore, statistical analysis revealed low negative correlation between the number of Tregs in the bone marrow and the minimal residual disease measured on day 15th, the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow and leukocytosis after 15 days of chemotherapy. These results indicate the influence of Tregs on the final therapeutic effect.",,"['Niedzwiecki, M', 'Budzilo, O', 'Zielinski, M', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, E', 'Maciejka-Kemblowska, L', 'Szczepanski, T', 'Trzonkowski, P']","['Niedzwiecki M', 'Budzilo O', 'Zielinski M', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E', 'Maciejka-Kemblowska L', 'Szczepanski T', 'Trzonkowski P']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Clinical Immunology and Transplantology Unit at the Department of Immunology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric, Hematology and Oncology, Zabrze Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Clinical Immunology and Transplantology Unit at the Department of Immunology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180529,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/blood/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'CD4 Antigens/blood/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/blood/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/blood/immunology', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/blood/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/pathology']",2018/07/14 06:00,2018/11/15 06:00,['2018/07/14 06:00'],"['2018/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/1292404 [doi]'],epublish,J Immunol Res. 2018 May 29;2018:1292404. doi: 10.1155/2018/1292404. eCollection 2018.,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7266-7694', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8366-5846']",PMC5996432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thrombocytopenia is common in MDS and is associated with bleeding complications, occasionally life-threatening. Low platelet count (PLT), as well declining PLT also serves as a prognostic marker. Understanding thrombopoiesis led to the cloning of thrombopoietin, resulting in the development of platelet stimulating agents, thrombomimetics, romiplostim and eltrombopag. Both agents have been shown to increase PLT, decrease the need for platelet transfusions and reduce the number of bleeding episodes, with a reasonable tolerance. They are already approved for immune thrombocytopenia and thrombocytopenia related to liver disease. Romiplostim and eltrombopag have proven efficacy in lower- and higher-risk MDS with thrombocytopenia, as monotherapy, as well as a part of a combination, either with lenalidomide, and mainly combined with hypomethylating agents. However, safety concerns have been raised: while several trials have been completed with no evidence of disease progression, others have been early terminated due to an increased number of BM blasts and possible leukemic transformation in treated-patients.

In this retrospective study, we aimed to determine the incidence, clinical symptoms, toxicities, and outcome of children with APL in our center. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children (age < 18 years) diagnosed with APL in our pediatric hematology department between January 2006-December 2016. Results: Pediatric APL represents 20.5% of AML cases in this cohort. Most of the cases presented as classical M3, albeit hypogranular variant was described in 12% of the cohort. Patients with hypogranular variant APL were differed from classical APL by co-expression of CD2 and CD34. About (3/4) of APL patients had hemorrhagic findings at admission or the induction treatment. Severe bleeding manifested as intracranial hemorrhage was present in three patients and intracranial arterial thrombosis was present in one. Six patients showed side effects of ATRA such as pseudotumor cerebri, differentiation syndrome resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary infiltrates. Five-year overall survival (OS) and early death rate were found to be 82.5% and 12% respectively. Conclusions: A high frequency (20.5%) of APL was noted among children with AML in this single-center study. The overall mortality rate was 17.5%.

The susceptibility to infections is due, in the absence of intensive chemotherapies, mainly to functional defects in the myeloid lineage with or without neutropenia. Furthermore, MDS includes a heterogeneous group of patients with very different prognosis, therapy and risk factors regarding survival and infections. You should distinguish risk factors related to the disease, like as neutrophils function impairment, neutropenia, unfavorable cytogenetics and bone marrow insufficiency; factors related to the patient, like as age and comorbidities, and factors related to the therapy. When the patients with MDS are submitted to intensive chemotherapy with and without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), they have a risk factor for infection very similar to that of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and mostly related to neutropenia. Patients with MDS treated with supportive therapy only or with demethylating agent or lenalidomide or immunosuppressive drugs should have a tailored approach. Most of the infections in MDS originate from bacteria, and the main risk factors are represented by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and unfavorable cytogenetics. Thus, it is reasonable to give antibacterial prophylaxis to patients who start the therapy with demethylating agents with a number of neutrophils <500 x 10(9)/L, or with thrombocytopenia and unfavorable cytogenetics. The antifungal prophylaxis is not considered cost/benefit adequate and should be taken into consideration only when there is an antecedent fungal infection or presence of filamentous fungi in the surveillance cultures. Subjects submitted to immunosuppression with ATG+CSA have a high rate of infections, and when severely neutropenic should ideally be nursed in isolation, should be given prophylactic antibiotics and antifungals, regular mouth care including an antiseptic mouthwash.",,"['Leone, Giuseppe', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Leone G', 'Pagano L']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180701,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,2018/07/14 06:00,2018/07/14 06:01,['2018/07/14 06:00'],"['2018/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2018.039 [doi]', 'mjhid-10-1-e2018039 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2018 Jul 1;10(1):e2018039. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2018.039. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['Azacitidine', 'Chemotherapy', 'Decitabine', 'Infections', 'Myelodysplastic Syndrome']",1,,PMC6039080,,['Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we revealed SOX30 methylation and its clinical implication in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Results: In the discovery stage, we identified that SOX30 methylation, a frequent event in AML, was negatively associated with SOX30 expression and correlated with overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in cytogenetically normal AML among SOX family members from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. In the validation stage, we verified that SOX30 methylation level was significantly higher in AML even in MDS-derived AML compared to controls, whereas SOX30 hypermethylation was not a frequent event in MDS. SOX30 methylation was inversely correlated with SOX30 expression in AML patients. Survival analysis showed that SOX30 hypermethylation was negatively associated with complete remission (CR), OS, and LFS in AML, where it only affected LFS in MDS. Notably, among MDS/AML paired patients, SOX30 methylation level was significantly increased in AML stage than in MDS stage. In addition, SOX30 methylation was found to be significantly decreased in AML achieved CR when compared to diagnosis time and markedly increased in relapsed AML when compared to the CR population. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that SOX30 methylation was associated with disease progression in MDS and acted as an independent prognostic and predictive biomarker in AML.",,"['Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Wang, Yu-Xin', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Li, Xi-Xi', 'Gu, Yu', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhou JD', 'Wang YX', 'Zhang TJ', 'Li XX', 'Gu Y', 'Zhang W', 'Ma JC', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""1Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002 Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""3Department of Nephrology and Endocrinology, Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital of Kunshan City, Kunshan, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""1Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002 Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""1Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002 Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""1Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002 Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""1Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002 Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""4Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002 Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""4Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., 212002 Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""1Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd, 212002 Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180705,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (SOX Transcription Factors)', '0 (SOX30 protein, human)', '0 (SRY protein, human)', '0 (Sex-Determining Region Y Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'SOX Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Sex-Determining Region Y Protein/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2018/07/14 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/07/14 06:00'],"['2018/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-018-0523-y [doi]', '523 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2018 Jul 5;10:92. doi: 10.1186/s13148-018-0523-y. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Biomarker', '*MDS', '*Methylation', '*SOX30']",,,PMC6034269,,"['The present study approved by the Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board', ""of the Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University.Written informed"", 'consents were obtained from all enrolled individuals prior to their', 'participation.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Springer', 'Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and', 'institutional affiliations.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the biologic mechanism underlying its development remains poorly understood. Thus, the objective of the present study is to discuss the effect of cytidine deaminase (CDA) gene silencing on the apoptosis and proliferation of CML K562 cells. Methods: CDA mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and enzymatic activity of CDA was measured by a nuclide liquid scintillation method. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were used to detect CDA mRNA and protein expression. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. The expression of proteins relevant to cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle was measured by Western blot analysis. Tumor xenografts were implanted in nude mice to verify the effect of CDA silencing on tumor growth in vivo. Results: CML and AL patients showed increased mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of CDA. Compared with the blank group, the mRNA and protein expression of CDA in the shRNA-1 and shRNA-2 groups decreased significantly. As a result, the proliferation of K562 cells was inhibited after CDA silencing and the cells were mainly arrested in S and G2 phases, while the apoptosis rate of these cells was increased. In addition, CDA gene silencing in K562 cells led to down-regulated p-ERK1/2, t-AKT, p-AKT and BCL-2 expression and up-regulated expression of P21, Bax, cleaved caspase-3/total caspase-3 and cleaved PARP/total PARP. Finally, CDA gene silencing inhibited tumor growth. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that CDA gene silencing could inhibit CML cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis. Therefore, CDA gene silencing may become an effective target for the treatment of leukemia.",,"['Wei, Xiao-Fang', 'Feng, You-Fan', 'Chen, Qiao-Lin', 'Zhang, Qi-Ke']","['Wei XF', 'Feng YF', 'Chen QL', 'Zhang QK']","[""Department of Hematology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, No. 204, Donggang West Road, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu People's Republic of China.grid.417234.7"", ""Department of Hematology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, No. 204, Donggang West Road, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu People's Republic of China.grid.417234.7"", ""Department of Hematology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, No. 204, Donggang West Road, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu People's Republic of China.grid.417234.7"", ""Department of Hematology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, No. 204, Donggang West Road, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu People's Republic of China.grid.417234.7""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180709,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2018/07/14 06:00,2018/07/14 06:01,['2018/07/14 06:00'],"['2017/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-018-0587-y [doi]', '587 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2018 Jul 9;18:96. doi: 10.1186/s12935-018-0587-y. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Cytidine deaminase', 'Gene silencing', 'K562 cells', 'Proliferation']",,,PMC6038203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present the crystal structure of the 53BP1 tandem Tudor domain (TTD) in complex with TIRR. Our results show that three loops from TIRR interact with 53BP1 TTD and mask the methylated lysine-binding pocket in TTD. Thus, TIRR competes with histone H4K20 methylation for 53BP1 binding. We map key interaction residues in 53BP1 TTD and TIRR, whose mutation abolishes complex formation. Moreover, TIRR suppresses the relocation of 53BP1 to DNA lesions and 53BP1-dependent DNA damage repair. Finally, despite the high-sequence homology between TIRR and NUDT16, NUDT16 does not directly interact with 53BP1 due to the absence of key residues required for binding.

Despite significant therapeutic effects of differentiation-inducing agents in some acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, the disease remains incurable in a large fraction of patients. Here we show that SK053, a thioredoxin inhibitor, induces differentiation and cell death of acute myeloid leukemia cells. Considering that thioredoxin knock-down with short hairpin RNA failed to exert antiproliferative effects in one of the acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, we used a biotin affinity probe-labeling approach to identify potential molecular targets for the effects of SK053. Mass spectrometry of proteins precipitated from acute myeloid leukemia cells incubated with biotinylated SK053 used as a bait revealed protein disulfide isomerase as a potential binding partner for the compound. Biochemical, enzymatic and functional assays using fluorescence lifetime imaging confirmed that SK053 binds to and inhibits the activity of protein disulfide isomerase. Protein disulfide isomerase knockdown with short hairpin RNA was associated with inhibition of cell growth, increased CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha levels, and induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells. Molecular dynamics simulation followed by the covalent docking indicated that SK053 binds to the fourth thioredoxin-like domain of protein disulfide isomerase. Differentiation of myeloid precursor cells requires the activity of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha, the function of which is impaired in acute myeloid leukemia cells through various mechanisms, including translational block by protein disulfide isomerase. SK053 increased the levels of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha and upregulated mRNA levels for differentiation-associated genes. Finally, SK053 decreased the survival of blasts and increased the percentage of cells expressing the maturation-associated CD11b marker in primary cells isolated from bone marrow or peripheral blood of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Collectively, these results provide a proof-of-concept that protein disulfide isomerase inhibition has potential as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and for the

Lirilumab is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that blocks KIR/HLA-C interaction. We designed a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lirilumab as a single agent and in combination with azacitidine in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with MDS who had not received previous hypomethylating agents were included. Lower-risk MDS patients received single-agent lirilumab (3 mg/kg); higher-risk patients received azacitidine (75 mg/m(2)/day for 7 days) in combination with lirilumab (3 mg/kg, on day 7), in a 28-day cycle. Responses were evaluated according to 2006 International Working Group criteria. RESULTS: A total of 10 patients including 8 with higher and 2 with lower-risk enrolled. The median age was 70 (range, 50-84) years and 4 (40%) had complex cytogenetics. Baseline molecular mutations included TP53 (n = 5), TET2 (n = 3), and NRAS (n = 2). Patients received a median of 4 (range, 2-13) and 9 (range, 5-14) cycles of treatment with azacitidine with lirilumab and single-agent lirilumab, respectively. Two patients achieved complete remission (CR), 5 marrow CR, and 3 had stable disease. The median event-free survival for the entire cohort was 8 months (95% confidence interval, 4 months to not reached), and the median overall survival has not yet been reached. Five patients experienced 8 episodes of Grade >/=3 adverse events attributable to study drug, with the most frequent being infection or neutropenic fever (75%). CONCLUSION: Lirilumab either as a single agent as well as used in combination with azacitidine has clinical activity in patients with MDS. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, an association between IgG4-RD and malignant tumors has been suggested and IgG4-RD is closely related to the occurrence of malignant hematologic diseases. In this report, we describe a rare complication of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a patient with IgG4-RD. An 81-year-old Chinese man was diagnosed with the lymphadenopathy associated with IgG4-related disease. The histopathological study revealed multiple plasma cells infiltration and immunostaining for IgG and IgG4 was performed on plasma cells and the IgG/IgG4 ratio was more than 40%. Eight months later, he developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It has been suggested that the incidence of malignant hematologic diseases may be high in patients with IgG4-RD and increased Th2 cells and Treg cells cytokines may result in the occurrence of hematologic malignancies. Therefore, the importance of accurate diagnosis and intense medical follow-up should be emphasized.

It was shown that non-infectious retroviral particles as well as retroviral or recombinant retroviral transmembrane envelope (TM) proteins demonstrated immunosuppressive properties. The same was shown for peptides corresponding to a highly conserved domain in the TM protein. This domain is called immunosuppressive (ISU) domain and it induces modulation of the cytokine release of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors. In addition, it changes the gene expression of these cells. Common indications for the immunosuppressive activity were tumour growth in vivo and interleukin-10 (IL-10) release from human PBMCs in vitro. Single mutations in the ISU domain abrogated the immunosuppressive activity. In order to develop a new model system for the expression of the ISU domain and presentation to PBMCs which is not prone to possible endotoxin contaminations, two expression systems were developed. In the first system, designated pOUT, retroviral proteins containing the ISU domain were expressed and released into the cell culture medium, and in the second system, tANCHOR, the ISU domain was presented by a tetraspanin-anchored sequence on the cell surface of human cells. Both systems were exploited to express the wild-type (wt) ISU domains of HIV-1, of the porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) and of the murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) as well as to express mutants (mut) of these ISU domains. PERV is of special interest in the context of virus safety of xenotransplantation using pig organs. Expression of the TM proteins was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy, ELISA and Western blot analyses using specific antibodies. However, when cells expressing and releasing the ISU were co-incubated with human PBMCs, no increased production of IL-10 was observed when compared with the mutants. Similar results were obtained when the released TM proteins were concentrated by immunoprecipitation and added to PBMCs. We suggest that the absence of IL-10 induction can be explained by a low amount of protein, by the lack of a biologically active conformation or the absence of additional factors.",,"['Ivanusic, Daniel', 'Pietsch, Heiko', 'Konig, Jasper', 'Denner, Joachim']","['Ivanusic D', 'Pietsch H', 'Konig J', 'Denner J']","['Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.', 'Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.', 'Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.', 'Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180712,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*immunology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Protein Domains', 'Swine']",2018/07/13 06:00,2019/01/09 06:00,['2018/07/13 06:00'],"['2018/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0200570 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-10762 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jul 12;13(7):e0200570. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200570. eCollection 2018.,,,7,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3244-6085'],PMC6042780,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the problems of carrier toxicity, specificity, and producibility create a bottleneck in the development of new nanomedical technologies. Copolymeric nanoparticles are an excellent platform for nanovector engineering due to their structural versatility; however, conventional fabrication processes rely upon harmful chemicals that necessitate purification. In engineering a more robust (copolymeric) nanovector platform, it is necessary to reconsider the entire process from copolymer synthesis through self-assembly and functionalization. To this end, a process is developed whereby biodegradable copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(trimethylene carbonate), synthesized via organocatalyzed ring-opening polymerization, undergo assembly into highly uniform, drug-loaded micelles without the use of harmful solvents or the need for purification. The direct hydration methodology, employing oligo(ethylene glycol) as a nontoxic dispersant, facilitates rapid preparation of pristine, drug-loaded nanovectors that require no further processing. This method is robust, fast, and scalable. Utilizing parthenolide, an exciting candidate for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), discrete nanovectors are generated that show strikingly low carrier toxicity and high levels of specific therapeutic efficacy against primary ALL cells (as compared to normal hematopoietic cells).","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

A diagnosis of myeloma is based on the criteria proposed by the International Myeloma Working Group and the pathological findings.Myeloma cells are classified into four types: mature, immature, pleomorphic, and plasmablastic. There are three patterns in which myeloma infiltrates bone marrow - nodular, interstitial, and diffuse. Dutcher bodies are highly specific to neoplastic myeloma cells. On immunohistochemical staining, the specificity of CD138 is high for plasma cells. As a clear image is often not obtained from the immunohistochemical staining of the immunoglobulin light chain, in situ hybridization is recommended. Abnormal expression of CD56 is seen in 70-80% of cases by flow cytometry analysis. CD56 expression definitively indicates myeloma, suggesting its high diagnostic value. Evaluation of the infiltration pattern, monoclonality, and abnormal antigen expression of plasma cells is more important than the plasmocytic ratio to determine whether a case is reactive or neoplastic.Multiple gene abnormalities function in the onset and progression of myeloma. In our department, we analyze CCND1, FGFR3, MAF, and del (17p13) by FISH for all myeloma cases. None of the cases with genetic abnormalities were recognized by G-banding.

In this regard, we have previously developed a vector suite that allows the evaluation of different promoters and solubility enhancer-proteins, through an easy and efficient cloning strategy. Nonetheless, the proper expression of many targets remains elusive, requiring, for example, the addition of complex post-translation modifications and/or passage through specialized compartments. In order to overcome the limitations found when working with a single subcellular localization and a single host type, we herein expanded our previously developed vector suite to include the evaluation of recombinant protein expression in different cell compartments and cell hosts.

Li Display Potent Activity Against Acute Myeloid Leukemia by Suppressing the RNF6/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway.,673,10.3389/fphar.2018.00673 [doi],"Saponins are amphipathic glycosides found in traditional Chinese medicines. In the present study, we isolated a panel of saponins from Paris forrestii (Takht.) H. Li, a unique plant found in Tibet and Yunnan provinces, China. By examining their activities in suppressing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell proliferation, total saponins from Paris forrestii (TSPf) displayed more potent activity than individual ones. TSPf induced more than 40% AML cell apoptosis and decreased the viability of all leukemia cell lines. TSPf-induced apoptosis was confirmed by both Annexin V staining and caspase-3 activation. In line with these findings, TSPf downregulated pro-survival proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 but upregulated the expression of tumor suppressor proteins p53, p27, Bax, and Beclin 1. The AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is frequently overactivated in various AML cells, and TSPf was found to suppress the activation of both AKT and mTOR, but had no effects on their total protein expression. This was further confirmed by the inactivation of 4EBP-1 and p70S6K, two typical downstream signal molecules in the AKT/mTOR pathway. Moreover, TSPf-inactivated AKT/mTOR signaling was found to be associated with downregulated RNF6, a recently identified oncogene in AML. RNF6 activated AKT/mTOR, and consistently, knockdown of RNF6 led to inactivation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, TSPf suppressed the growth of AML xenografts in nude mice models. Oral administration of TSPf almost fully suppressed tumor growth without gross toxicity. Consistent with the findings in cultured cell lines, TSPf also downregulated RNF6 expression along with inactivated AKT/mTOR signaling in tumor tissues. This study thus demonstrated that TSPf displays potent anti-AML activity by suppressing the RNF6/AKT/mTOR pathway. Given its low toxicity, TSPf could be developed for the treatment of AML.",,"['Lu, Qin', 'He, Yuanming', 'Wang, Yuehu', 'Gao, Li', 'Zheng, Yunjing', 'Zhang, Zubin', 'Cao, Biyin', 'Wang, Qi', 'Mao, Xinliang', 'Hu, Shaoyan']","['Lu Q', 'He Y', 'Wang Y', 'Gao L', 'Zheng Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Cao B', 'Wang Q', 'Mao X', 'Hu S']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Economic Plants and Biotechnology, and Yunnan Key Laboratory for Wild Plant Resources, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180626,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,2018/07/13 06:00,2018/07/13 06:01,['2018/07/13 06:00'],"['2018/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2018.00673 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2018 Jun 26;9:673. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00673. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['RNF6', 'RNF6/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway', 'TSPf', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell apoptosis', 'herbal medicine', 'saponins']",,,PMC6028905,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar approaches designed to target T cell malignancies have been hampered by the critical issue of T-on-T cytotoxicity, whereby fratricide or self-destruction of healthy T cells prohibits cell product manufacture. To date, there have been no reports of T cells engineered to target the definitive T cell marker, CD3 (3CAR). Recent improvements in gene editing now provide access to efficient disruption of such molecules on T cells, and this has provided a route to generation of 3CAR, CD3-specific CAR T cells. T cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector incorporating an anti-CD3epsilon CAR derived from OKT3, either before or after TALEN-mediated disruption of the endogenous TCRalphabeta/CD3 complex. Only transduction after disrupting assembly of TCRalphabeta/CD3 yielded viable 3CAR T cells, and these cultures were found to undergo self-enrichment for 3CAR+TCR-CD3- T cells without any further processing. Specific cytotoxicity against CD3epsilon was demonstrated against primary T cells and against childhood T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). 3CAR T cells mediated potent antileukemic effects in a human/murine chimeric model, supporting the application of cellular immunotherapy strategies against T cell malignancies. 3CAR provides a bridging strategy to achieve T cell eradication and leukemic remission ahead of conditioned allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",,"['Rasaiyaah, Jane', 'Georgiadis, Christos', 'Preece, Roland', 'Mock, Ulrike', 'Qasim, Waseem']","['Rasaiyaah J', 'Georgiadis C', 'Preece R', 'Mock U', 'Qasim W']","['Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College London (UCL) Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College London (UCL) Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College London (UCL) Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College London (UCL) Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College London (UCL) Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital BRC, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['RP-2014-05-007/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180712,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD3E protein, human)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Engineering', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Muromonab-CD3', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2018/07/13 06:00,2019/11/05 06:00,['2018/07/13 06:00'],"['2017/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['99442 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.99442 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2018 Jul 12;3(13). pii: 99442. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.99442.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell Biology', '*Gene therapy', '*Immunology', '*T cells']",13,,PMC6124532,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ph-like ALL is characterized by genetic alterations that activate cytokine receptor and kinase signaling and may be amenable to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The prevalence, outcome, and potential for targeted therapy of Ph-like ALL in standard-risk (SR) ALL is less clear. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 1023 SR childhood B-ALL consecutively enrolled in the Children's Oncology Group AALL0331 clinical trial. The Ph-like ALL gene expression profile was identified in 206 patients, and 67 patients with either BCR-ABL1 (n = 6) or ETV6-RUNX1 (n = 61) were excluded from downstream analysis, leaving 139 of 1023 (13.6%) as Ph-like. Targeted reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays and RNA-sequencing identified kinase-activating alterations in 38.8% of SR Ph-like cases, including CRLF2 rearrangements (29.5% of Ph-like), ABL-class fusions (1.4%), JAK2 fusions (1.4%), an NTRK3 fusion (0.7%), and other sequence mutations (IL7R, KRAS, NRAS; 5.6%). Patients with Ph-like ALL had inferior 7-year event-free survival compared with non-Ph-like ALL (82.4 +/- 3.6% vs 90.7 +/- 1.0%, P = .0022), with no difference in overall survival (93.2 +/- 2.4% vs 95.8 +/- 0.7%, P = .14). These findings illustrate the significant differences in the spectrum of kinase alterations and clinical outcome of Ph-like ALL based on presenting clinical features and establish that genomic alterations potentially targetable with approved kinase inhibitors are less frequent in SR than in HR ALL.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Reshmi, Shalini C', 'Harvey, Richard C', 'Chen, I-Ming', 'Patel, Kinnari', 'Stonerock, Eileen', 'Jenkins, Heather', 'Dai, Yunfeng', 'Valentine, Marc', 'Gu, Zhaohui', 'Zhao, Yaqi', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Payne-Turner, Debbie', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Mattano, Leonard A Jr', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Carroll, William L', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Hunger, Stephen P']","['Roberts KG', 'Reshmi SC', 'Harvey RC', 'Chen IM', 'Patel K', 'Stonerock E', 'Jenkins H', 'Dai Y', 'Valentine M', 'Gu Z', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang J', 'Payne-Turner D', 'Devidas M', 'Heerema NA', 'Carroll AJ', 'Raetz EA', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Wood BL', 'Mattano LA Jr', 'Maloney KW', 'Carroll WL', 'Loh ML', 'Willman CL', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Mullighan CG', 'Hunger SP']","[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Institute for Genomic Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."", 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', ""Institute for Genomic Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."", ""Institute for Genomic Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."", ""Institute for Genomic Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."", 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Cytogenetics and.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Pediatrics, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', ""Department of Pathology, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA."", 'HARP Pharma Consulting, Mystic, CT.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children's Hospital, Aurora CO."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY.', ""Department of Pediatrics, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital and Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; and."", 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', ""Institute for Genomic Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."", 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.""]",['eng'],"['R35 CA197695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA211542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180711,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'National Cancer Institute (U.S.)', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'United States']",2018/07/13 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/07/13 06:00'],"['2018/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)31967-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-04-841676 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Aug 23;132(8):815-824. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-04-841676.

With the availability of pathway inhibitors (PIs), such as kinase inhibitors and BCL2 antagonists, the outlook of CIT-resistant patients has dramatically improved. Here, we propose a revision of the concept of high-risk CLL, driven by TP53 abnormalities and response to treatment with PI. CLL high-risk-I, CIT-resistant is defined by clinically CIT-resistant disease with TP53 aberrations, but fully responsive to PI. This category is largely the domain of PI-based therapy, and cellular therapy (ie, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation) remains an option only in selected patients with low individual procedure-related risk. In CLL high-risk-II, CIT- and PI-resistant, characterized by increasing exhaustion of pharmacological treatment possibilities, cellular therapies (including chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T cells) should be considered in patients eligible for these procedures. Moreover, molecular and cellular therapies are not mutually exclusive and could be used synergistically to exploit their full potential.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Dreger, Peter', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'van Gelder, Michel', 'Kimby, Eva', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Dreger P', 'Ghia P', 'Schetelig J', 'van Gelder M', 'Kimby E', 'Michallet M', 'Moreno C', 'Robak T', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Montserrat E']","['Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department Medicine I, University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'German Bone Marrow Donor Registry, Tubingen, Germany.', 'European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department Internal Medicine/Hematology, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine/Center of Hematology at Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France."", 'Hematology Department, Hospital de laSanta Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180711,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Allografts', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/mortality/*therapy']",2018/07/13 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2018/07/13 06:00'],"['2018/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)31947-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-01-826008 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Aug 30;132(9):892-902. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-01-826008.

The chromatin tethering function of LEDGF/p75 is hijacked by HIV integrase to ensure viral integration at sites of active transcription. LEDGF/p75 is also important for the development of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL), where it tethers the MLL1 fusion complex at aberrant MLL targets, inducing malignant transformation. However, little is known about how the LEDGF/p75 protein interaction network is regulated. Here, we obtained solution structures of the complete interfaces between the LEDGF/p75 integrase binding domain (IBD) and its cellular binding partners and validated another binding partner, Mediator subunit 1 (MED1). We reveal that structurally conserved IBD-binding motifs (IBMs) on known LEDGF/p75 binding partners can be regulated by phosphorylation, permitting switching between low- and high-affinity states. Finally, we show that elimination of IBM phosphorylation sites on MLL1 disrupts the oncogenic potential of primary MLL1-rearranged leukemic cells. Our results demonstrate that kinase-dependent phosphorylation of MLL1 represents a previously unknown oncogenic dependency that may be harnessed in the treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemia.",,"['Sharma, Subhalakshmi', 'Cermakova, Katerina', 'De Rijck, Jan', 'Demeulemeester, Jonas', 'Fabry, Milan', 'El Ashkar, Sara', 'Van Belle, Siska', 'Lepsik, Martin', 'Tesina, Petr', 'Duchoslav, Vojtech', 'Novak, Petr', 'Hubalek, Martin', 'Srb, Pavel', 'Christ, Frauke', 'Rezacova, Pavlina', 'Hodges, H Courtney', 'Debyser, Zeger', 'Veverka, Vaclav']","['Sharma S', 'Cermakova K', 'De Rijck J', 'Demeulemeester J', 'Fabry M', 'El Ashkar S', 'Van Belle S', 'Lepsik M', 'Tesina P', 'Duchoslav V', 'Novak P', 'Hubalek M', 'Srb P', 'Christ F', 'Rezacova P', 'Hodges HC', 'Debyser Z', 'Veverka V']","['Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 166 10 Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Molecular & Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Center for Precision Environmental Health, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium;

Here, we used an shRNA screening approach to mimic miRNA activity on experimentally verified miR-196b targets to identify functionally important and therapeutically relevant pathways downstream of oncogenic miRNA in MLL-r AML. We found Cdkn1b (p27(Kip1)) is a direct miR-196b target whose repression enhanced an embryonic stem cell-like signature associated with decreased leukemia latency and increased numbers of leukemia stem cells in vivo. Conversely, elevation of p27(Kip1) significantly reduced MLL-r leukemia self-renewal, promoted monocytic differentiation of leukemic blasts, and induced cell death. Antagonism of miR-196b activity or pharmacologic inhibition of the Cks1-Skp2-containing SCF E3-ubiquitin ligase complex increased p27(Kip1) and inhibited human AML growth.

A new small molecular inhibitor, JQ1, targeting BRD4, which recognizes the acetylated lysine residues, has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest in different cancers by inhibiting MYC oncogene. However, the downstream signaling of MYC inhibition induced by BET inhibitor is not well understood. METHODS: In this study, we explored the more mechanisms of JQ1-induced cell death in acute myeloid lukemia and downstream signaling of JQ1. RESULTS: We found that JQ1 is able to reactivate the tumor suppressor gene, TXNIP, and induces apoptosis through the ASK1-MAPK pathway. Further studies confirmed that MYC could repress the expression of TXNIP through the miR-17-92 cluster. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide novel insight on how BET inhibitor can induce apoptosis in AML, and further support the development of BET inhibitors as a promising therapeutic strategy against AML.",,"['Zhou, Yafeng', 'Zhou, Jianbiao', 'Lu, Xiao', 'Tan, Tuan-Zea', 'Chng, Wee-Joo']","['Zhou Y', 'Zhou J', 'Lu X', 'Tan TZ', 'Chng WJ']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Centre for Translational Medicine, Singapore, 117599, Republic of Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Centre for Translational Medicine, Singapore, 117599, Republic of Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Centre for Translational Medicine, Singapore, 117599, Republic of Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Centre for Translational Medicine, Singapore, 117599, Republic of Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Centre for Translational Medicine, Singapore, 117599, Republic of Singapore. mdccwj@nus.edu.sg.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 119074, Republic of Singapore. mdccwj@nus.edu.sg.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, NUHS, 1E, Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119228, Republic of Singapore. mdccwj@nus.edu.sg.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180711,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TXNIP protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azepines/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5/*physiology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'MicroRNAs/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology']",2018/07/13 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2018/07/13 06:00'],"['2017/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-018-4661-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-018-4661-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2018 Jul 11;18(1):731. doi: 10.1186/s12885-018-4661-6.,,,1,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2578-8335'],PMC6042241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in chronic phase (CML-CP; N = 112) received nilotinib 300 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint, which was the cumulative rate of major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL1 </= 0.1% on the International Scale [BCR-ABL1(IS)]) by 12 months, was previously reported (66.1% [80% CI, 59.7%-72.0%]). ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01274351 Results: By 24 months, 83.0% of patients achieved MMR, and 50.9% achieved MR(4.5) (BCR-ABL1(IS) </=0.0032%). Safety results at 24 months were consistent with those at 12 months. No additional deaths or disease progressions to accelerated phase/blast crisis were observed between 12 and 24 months. DISCUSSION: Treatment with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily for 2 years provided high MMR with a good safety/tolerability profile in newly diagnosed CML-CP patients in Turkey. Assessment of MMR across time points showed increasing rates through 18 months, after which as lower rate of increase was observed. The safety profile of nilotinib 300 mg twice daily with 24 months of follow-up was similar to that observed at 12 months, and no new safety concerns were identified. These efficacy and safety findings are consistent with the results from the 12-month analysis of this study and from previous nilotinib studies. These findings support nilotinib as an option for frontline treatment of CML-CP. CONCLUSION: Frontline nilotinib treatment provided sustained efficacy, with good tolerability, over 24 months in newly diagnosed CML-CP patients.",,"['Saydam, Guray', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim Celalettin', 'Kaynar, Leylagul', 'Yavuz, Akif S', 'Ali, Ridvan', 'Guvenc, Birol', 'Akay, Olga M', 'Baslar, Zafer', 'Ozbek, Ugur', 'Sonmez, Mehmet', 'Aydin, Demet', 'Pehlivan, Mustafa', 'Undar, Bulent', 'Dagdas, Simten', 'Ayyildiz, Orhan', 'Akin, Gulnur', 'Dag, Ilkiz M', 'Ilhan, Osman']","['Saydam G', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Kaynar L', 'Yavuz AS', 'Ali R', 'Guvenc B', 'Akay OM', 'Baslar Z', 'Ozbek U', 'Sonmez M', 'Aydin D', 'Pehlivan M', 'Undar B', 'Dagdas S', 'Ayyildiz O', 'Akin G', 'Dag IM', 'Ilhan O']","['a Ege University Medical Faculty Hospital , Department of Internal Medicine , Izmir , Turkey.', 'b HacettepeUniversity Medical Faculty Hospital , Department of Internal Medicine , Ankara , Turkey.', 'c Erciyes University Medical Faculty Hospital , Hematology Division , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'd Istanbul University , Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Internal Medicine , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'e Uludag University Medical Faculty , Department of Internal Medicine , Bursa , Turkey.', 'f Cukurova University Medical Faculty Hospital , Department of Internal Medicine , Adana , Turkey.', 'g Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty Hospital , Department of Internal Medicine , Eskisehir , Turkey.', 'h Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty , Department of Internal Medicine , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'i Acibadem University Faculty of Medicine , Department of Medical Genetics , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'j Karadeniz Technical University Medical Faculty , Department of Internal Medicine , Trabzon , Turkey.', 'k Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital , Department of Hematology , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'l Gaziantep University Medical Faculty , Department of Internal Medicine , Gaziantep , Turkey.', 'm Dokuz Eylul University Medical Faculty , Department of Internal Medicine , Izmir , Turkey.', 'n Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital , Department of Internal Medicine , Ankara , Turkey.', 'o Dicle University Medical Faculty Hospital , Department of Internal Medicine , Diyarbakir , Turkey.', 'p Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'p Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'q Ankara University School of Medicine , Department of Hematology , Ankara , Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180711,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Turkey']",2018/07/13 06:00,2018/11/02 06:00,['2018/07/13 06:00'],"['2018/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2018.1498167 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Dec;23(10):771-777. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2018.1498167.

Methods A CLL genetic database (CLL_042017) was developed through a comprehensive CLL-gene relation data analysis, in which 753 CLL target genes were curated. Expression values for these genes were used for case-control classification of four CLL datasets, with a sparse representation-based variable selection (SRVS) approach employed for feature (gene) selection. Results were compared with outcomes obtained by using analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based gene selection approaches. Results For each of the four datasets, SRVS selected a subset of genes from the 753 CLL target genes, resulting in significantly higher classification accuracy, compared with randomly selected genes (100%, 100%, 93.94%, 89.39%). The SRVS method outperformed ANOVA in terms of classification accuracy. Conclusion Gene markers selected from the 753 CLL genes could enable significantly greater accuracy in the prediction of CLL.

The detection of P-gp is of vital significance and has attracted considerable concerns. In this study, we proposed a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) method for the evaluation of P-gp expression levels in leukemia cell lines. Basically, we utilized an aqueous phase sandwich-type immunoassay to analyze the expression of P-gp. First, anti-CD45-decorated magnetic beads (MBs) and P-gp antibody-decorated SERS probes were fabricated. CD45 is a common protein expressed in all leukemia cells. As a result, a sandwich immunocomplex can be formed by the MBs, P-gp-overexpressed leukemia cells, and SERS probes. The expression level of P-gp determines the amount of SERS probes that can be captured. Consequently, the SERS intensity of the immunocomplex can be used to evaluate the expression level of P-gp. In a typical procedure, we measured the P-gp expression of an MDR leukemia cell line (K562/ADM) as well as unprocessed whole-blood samples. The SERS intensity of K562/ADM cells was highly correlated with the extent of MDR or the incubation time of adriamycin (which is an MDR inducing drug). In addition, the SERS intensity of the refractory/relapsing group was about sixfolds of that of the control group ( P < 0.01).

Methods: Human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells were successfully induced to TAMs. With TAMs as target cells, they were co-cultured with the supernatant of Hep3B hepatoma cells or Hep3B hepatoma cells, and Western blot and RT-PCR were used to measure the change in the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in TAMs. The expression of TLR4 in TAMs was downregulated by transient plasmid transfection with shRNA. With Hep3B hepatoma cells as target cells, the supernatants of TAMs and TAMs transfected with shRNA TLR4 plasmid were used for intervention, and Western blot was used to measure the protein expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin. The two-sided t-test was used for comparison of the means of two independent samples. Results: THP-1 cells were successfully induced to TAMs. According to the results of Western blot, compared with the control-CM group, the TAM-CM group had a significant reduction in the protein expression of E-cadherin and significant increases in the protein expression of N-cadherin and vimentin in Hep3B cells. After the expression of TLR4 in TAMs was downregulated, the culture solution of TAMs was used for the intervention of Hep3B cells (shRNA group), and compared with the TAM-CM group, the shRNA group had a significant increase in the expression of E-cadherin and significant reductions in the protein expression of N-cadherin and vimentin in Hep3B cells. Western blot and RT-PCR showed that the expression of TLR4 in TAMs was influenced by Hep3B cells. Conclusion: TAMs can promote EMT of Hep3B hepatoma cells, and downregulation of the expression of TLR4 in TAMs may reduce EMT of Hep3B hepatoma cells, suggesting that TLR4 on the surface of TAMs may be a key molecule involved in the interaction between TAMs and Hep3B hepatoma cells.",,"['Yao, R R', 'Wang, M M', 'Wang, Y H']","['Yao RR', 'Wang MM', 'Wang YH']","['Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, Ministry of Education Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,9710009,['0 (Cadherins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cadherins/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/metabolism/*pathology']",2018/07/13 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2018/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.1007-3418.2018.04.014 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi. 2018 Apr 20;26(4):305-309. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1007-3418.2018.04.014.,['NOTNLM'],"['Carcinoma, hepatocellular', 'Epithelial mesenchymal transition', 'Toll-receptor 4', 'Tumor-associated macrophages']",4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Between May 2005 and December 2014, 1 497 newly diagnosed ALL patients were enrolled and treated in 5 hospitals of SCMC-ALL-2005 study group, using risk-stratified SCMC-ALL-2005 protocol. Risk group classification and treatment intensity were based on clinical features, genetic abnormalities, early response to treatment and levels of minimal residual disease (MRD). Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate overall survival (OS) and event-free survival(EFS) curves. Cox proportional hazards models were used for multivariate analyses. Results: The patients were followed up to December 31, 2016, the median follow-up time was 69 months (24-141 months). The 5-year and 10-year OS rates were (80.0+/-1.0)% and (76.0+/-2.0)%. The 5-year and 10-year EFS rates were (69.0+/-1.0)% and (66.0+/-2.0)%. The 5-year and 10-year relapse rates were (23.0+/-1.0)% and (25.0+/-2.0)%.

The work aimed to develop a method to predict time vs. concentration profile for humans based on preclinical pharmacokinetics using the assumption of superimposability of normalized time course profiles of animals and humans. Standard allometric equations with/without correction factors (CF) were also used in prediction. The Vss was predicted by simple allometry of 0.312W(0.871) (r(2)=0.987), where W is body weight; predicted Vss (19.71 L) was similar to the reported value (20.10 L). However, CL prediction involved both simple and CF allometry. Best proximity CL (543 vs. 598 mL/min) was obtained with maximum life span correction (MLP) [2.46W(1.215) (r(2)=0.988)]. Normalized curves were obtained by normalizing the time (with mean residence time) vs. concentration (with dose/Vss) in animal species. The concentration vs. time profile in humans after intravenous infusion was then simulated using normalized curve for each animal species and the values of CL and Vss were predicted for humans. In summary the findings indicate that normalized time course approach could predict the bendamustine human pharmacokinetics and such an approach could be prospectively applied for analog drugs of this class.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

The MIF-173G/C (rs755622) polymorphism is found in the promoter region and affects its activity. The present study investigated the MIF polymorphism as a risk factor for the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Egyptian children. METHODS: We analyzed the MIF-173G/C (rs755622) polymorphism in 180 ALL cases and 150 healthy control children by amplification of the gene using a polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction endonuclease digestion and running on an agarose gel for visualization of the product. RESULTS: We found a significant incidence of the homozygous polymorphic (CC) genotype and the combined polymorphic genotypes (GC + CC) in ALL patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively), whereas the wild-type genotype (GG) was more common in healthy controls (p = 0.006). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjustment for MIF different genotypes and other potential risk factors such as age, sex and parental smoking indicated that the CC genotype is the only significant risk factor for the test (p = 0.02). We also noted that, by increasing the C-allele representation within the gene [GC, CC], there was an increase in total leukocytic count (p = 0.09 and p = 0.001, respectively) that may reflect the bad prognostic impact of the polymorphic allele, although further studies are needed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate that the MIF-173G/C (rs755622) polymorphism is a risk factor for childhood ALL development with respect to both homozygous and combined polymorphic genotypes. In addition, the increased leukocytic count in synchronization with the increased representation of the polymorphic C-allele may reflect its bad prognostic impact.","['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Sharaf-Eldein, Mohamed', 'Elghannam, Doaa', 'Abdel-Malak, Camelia']","['Sharaf-Eldein M', 'Elghannam D', 'Abdel-Malak C']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Damietta University, New Damietta, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Damietta University, New Damietta, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180802,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,['0 (Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blacks/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/ethnology/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/*genetics', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",2018/07/12 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.3044 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2018 Sep;20(9):e3044. doi: 10.1002/jgm.3044.

Depletion of tetrahydrofolate causes cell death by suppressing DNA and RNA production(3). Although methotrexate is widely used as an anticancer agent and is the subject of over a thousand ongoing clinical trials(4), its high toxicity often leads to the premature termination of its use, which reduces its potential efficacy(5). To identify genes that modulate the response of cancer cells to methotrexate, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9-based screen(6,7). This screen yielded FTCD, which encodes an enzyme-formimidoyltransferase cyclodeaminase-that is required for the catabolism of the amino acid histidine(8), a process that has not previously been linked to methotrexate sensitivity. In cultured cancer cells, depletion of several genes in the histidine degradation pathway markedly decreased sensitivity to methotrexate. Mechanistically, histidine catabolism drains the cellular pool of tetrahydrofolate, which is particularly detrimental to methotrexate-treated cells. Moreover, expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in histidine catabolism is associated with methotrexate sensitivity in cancer cell lines and with survival rate in patients. In vivo dietary supplementation of histidine increased flux through the histidine degradation pathway and enhanced the sensitivity of leukaemia xenografts to methotrexate. The histidine degradation pathway markedly influences the sensitivity of cancer cells to methotrexate and may be exploited to improve methotrexate efficacy through a simple dietary intervention.",,"['Kanarek, Naama', 'Keys, Heather R', 'Cantor, Jason R', 'Lewis, Caroline A', 'Chan, Sze Ham', 'Kunchok, Tenzin', 'Abu-Remaileh, Monther', 'Freinkman, Elizaveta', 'Schweitzer,

Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), however, has rarely been connected with malignancy including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 65-year-old woman was diagnosed with AML and received regular chemotherapy. After the 5th cycle chemotherapy, she achieved complete remission but developed severe muscle weakness and myalgia with dramatic increasing creatine kinase (CK). DIAGNOSIS: The positivity of antinuclear matrix protein 2 antibody (anti-NXP2 Ab) and muscle biopsy in together confirmed the diagnosis of IMNM. INTERVENTION: Methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin was administered. OUTCOMES: This treatment resulted in a dramatic clinical and laboratory improvement within 1 month. CK and lactate dehydrogenase levels dropped sharply to normal. Anti-NXP2 Ab was shown to disappear in a repeated test afterwards. LESSONS: The IMNM is also closely related to malignancy. We here report a case of IMNM associated with AML for the first time. Anti-NXP2 Ab may be utilized as both diagnostic and prognostic markers of paraneoplastic IMNMs.",,"['Su, Lina', 'Yang, Yue', 'Jia, Yuan', 'Liu, Xu', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Yuan, Yun', 'Li, Zhanguo']","['Su L', 'Yang Y', 'Jia Y', 'Liu X', 'Zhang W', 'Yuan Y', 'Li Z']","[""Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Peking University People's Hospital Department of Neurology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (MORC3 protein, human)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aged', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Muscle, Skeletal/immunology/*pathology', 'Myositis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology']",2018/07/12 06:00,2018/07/28 06:00,['2018/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000011501 [doi]', '00005792-201807130-00067 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Jul;97(28):e11501. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011501.,,,28,,PMC6076171,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete response (CR) and OR rates were evaluated after the initial chemotherapy. Clinical characteristics and the risk factors associated with prognosis and overall survival (OS) were analyzed in all patients and the effects of allo-HSCT on OS were evaluated in patients who had achieved OR after initial chemotherapy.Forty-eight patients (81.4%) achieved OR by hyper-CVAD chemotherapy, among which, 22 patients (45.8%) further received allo-HSCT. The median follow-up was 31.5 months, ranging from 11 to 97 months. The 3-year OS and progression-free survival (PFS) were 45.7% and 45.0% for patients who achieved OR after chemotherapy and both 0 for patients who did not achieve OR (both P < .001). Three year OS and PFS were higher in patients who received chemotherapy + allo-HSCT than in patients who received chemotherapy alone (3-year OS: 72.8% vs 17.5%, P = .008; PFS: 65.1% vs 27.8%, P = 0.007). Shorter survival was independently associated with elevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), Ki-67>/=75%, pleural effusion and no OR (all P < .05) in all patients. But shorter survival was only associated with elevated LDH level, leukocytosis (>10 G/L), and chemotherapy alone in patients who achieved OR (all P < .05).The mid-term outcomes of adult patients with T-LBL are associated with response to chemotherapy (in all patients) and performance of allo-HSCT (in patients who achieved OR).

Duplex ultrasonography (US) has emerged as the first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of superficial pediatric masses. Without utilizing radiation, iodinated contrast material, or sedation and/or anesthesia, US provides a means for quick and cost-effective acquisition of information, including the location, size, shape, internal content, and vascularity of the mass. In this review, the US findings are described for a variety of common and uncommon pediatric head and neck masses diagnosed in our practice. Specifically, the entities covered include neonatal scalp hematoma, craniosynostosis, dermoid and epidermoid cysts, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymph nodes and their complications, fibromatosis colli, thyroglossal duct cyst, branchial cleft cyst, cervical thymus, congenital goiter, thyroid papillary carcinoma, parathyroid adenoma, hemangioma, lymphangioma, jugular vein phlebectasia, Lemierre syndrome, acute parotitis and parotid abscess, leukemia and/or lymphoma, neurogenic tumor, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Ultimately, in situations in which the head or neck mass is too large, deep, or hyperechoic to be fully assessed within the US field of view, or if malignancy or a high-flow vascular lesion is suspected, then further evaluation with cross-sectional imaging is warranted.

This finding prompted testing another G1 phase-active compound, palbociclib (PCB), a highly selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6), alone and in combination with VCR. PCB used alone caused G1 arrest in ALL cells with no effect on cell viability, and similar results were obtained for the retinoblastoma (RB)-proficient T98G glioblastoma cell line. In contrast, HeLa cells failed to arrest in the presence of PCB, consistent with their lack of dependence on the CDK4/6-RB pathway. When ALL cells were pretreated with PCB, they became refractory to death in G1 phase induced by VCR treatment, whereas HeLa cells retained VCR sensitivity after PCB pretreatment. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that PCB did not disrupt the microtubule network nor prevent VCR from doing so. Furthermore, ALL cells pretreated with PCB retained susceptibility to the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-263, indicating that downstream apoptotic signaling was unaffected. When released from PCB-enforced arrest, ALL cells reinitiated cycling and regained sensitivity to VCR. ALL cells treated with cycloheximide also arrested in G1 phase and became insensitive to VCR, independently reinforcing conclusions derived from PCB-imposed arrest. Thus, primary ALL cells advancing through G1 phase are strictly dependent on functional microtubules for survival whereas microtubules are dispensable for G1-arrested cells. These findings provide novel insight into interphase microtubule function and, from a therapy standpoint, strongly caution against combining microtubule targeting agents and CDK4/6 inhibitors for ALL.",,"['Delgado, Magdalena', 'Chambers, Timothy C']","['Delgado M', 'Chambers TC']","['a Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences , Little Rock , AR , USA.', 'a Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences , Little Rock , AR , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180731,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'G9ZF61LE7G (palbociclib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', '*G1 Phase/drug effects', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2018/07/12 06:00,2019/11/07 06:00,['2018/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384101.2018.1496746 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2018;17(14):1784-1796. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2018.1496746.

Longer time to treatment is associated with higher mortality. OBJECTIVES: To develop a multivariable risk prediction model for PjP diagnosis. METHODS: In a prospective multicenter cohort of ICU patients with hematological malignancies and acute respiratory failure, factors associated with documented PjP were identified. The risk prediction model was tested in an independent prospective multicenter cohort. We assessed discrimination (by areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves [AUCs]) and goodness of fit (by Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics). Model performance was assessed using 30 sets of imputed data sets. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the 1,330 patients, 134 of 1,092 (12.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.4-14.4%) had proven PjP in the derivation cohort, as did 15 of 238 (6.3%, 95% CI, 3.6-10.2%) in the validation cohort. The model included age, lymphoproliferative disease, anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis, the number of days between respiratory symptom onset and ICU admission, shock, chest radiograph pattern, and pleural effusion. The median (interquartile range) score was 3.5 (1.5-5.0) (range, -3.5 to 8.5) in the derivation cohort and 1.0 (0-2.0) (range, -3.5 to 6.0) in the validation cohort. The best threshold was defined on the validation sample as 3, allowing us to reach 86.7% sensitivity and 67.7% specificity for PjP, with a negative predictive value of 97.9% in the case of 10% prevalence. The score had good calibration (goodness of fit, -0.75) and discrimination in the derivation cohort (mean AUC, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.76-0.84) and validation cohort (mean AUC, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.93).

The 2-year leukemia-free survival and overall survival rate was 57.4 vs. 28.4% (P < 0.001) and 67.6 vs. 32.9% (P = 0.001), respectively. Among the 31 patients in the IFN-alpha group, 18 patients (58.1%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): 6 acute and 12 limited chronic GVHD. Patients who developed GVHD had higher treatment response rate than patients without GVHD (88.9 vs. 53.8%, P = 0.022). In conclusion, preemptive IFN-alpha therapy is a safe and effective treatment to prevent disease progression in high-risk patients with relapse tendency post-allo-HSCT.",,"['Lin, Xiao-Ji', 'Dai,

Medical images such as Mammogram, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and microscopic images are the common method for cancer diagnosis. Recently, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been used to help physicians in cancer diagnosis so that the diagnosis accuracy can be improved. CAD can help in decreasing missed cancer lesions due to physician fatigue, reducing the burden of workload and data overloading, and decreasing variability of inter- and intra-readers of images. In this research, a framework of CAD systems for cancer diagnosis based on medical images has been proposed. The proposed work helps physicians in detection of suspicion regions using different medical images modalities and in classifying the detected suspicious regions as normal or abnormal with the highest possible accuracy. The proposed framework of CAD system consists of four stages which are: preprocessing, segmentation of regions of interest, feature extraction and selection, and finally classification. In this research, the framework has been applied on blood smear images to diagnose the cases as normal or abnormal for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cases. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been used to select the subsets of features from the features extracted from segmented cell parts which can maximize the classification performance as possible. Different classifiers which are Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been applied. The framework has been yielding promising results which reached 96.25% accuracy, 97.3% sensitivity, and 95.35% specificity using decision tree classifier.",,"['El Houby, Enas M F']",['El Houby EMF'],"['Systems & Information Department, Engineering Research Division, National Research Centre, Dokki, Cairo, 12311, Egypt. enas_mfahmy@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180711,United States,J Med Syst,Journal of medical systems,7806056,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging', '*Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted', 'Humans', 'Mammography', 'Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging', '*Support Vector Machine', 'Ultrasonography']",2018/07/12 06:00,2018/10/30 06:00,['2018/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10916-018-1010-x [doi]', '10.1007/s10916-018-1010-x [pii]']",epublish,J Med Syst. 2018 Jul 11;42(8):157. doi: 10.1007/s10916-018-1010-x.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Classification', 'Computer-aided diagnosis', 'Machine learning techniques', 'Segmentation']",8,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6005-8787'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic alterations seem to be among the main mechanisms involved. OBJECTIVE: To determine if chronic occupational exposure to low level of benzene would be associated with DNA methylation. METHODS: Global DNA methylation and promoter-specific methylation of the two tumor suppressor genes, p14(ARF) and p15(INK4b), were assessed employing methylation-specific PCR using the DNA extracted from 40 petrochemical workers exposed to ambient benzene levels of <1 ppm, and 31 office workers not exposed to benzene or its derivatives. RESULTS: While an increase in global DNA methylation of 5% in p14(ARF) (p=0.501) and 28% in p15(INK4b) (p=0.02) genes was observed in the exposed group, no hypermethylation in either of the studied genes was observed in the unexposed group. No significant association was found between the frequency of aberrant methylation and either of age, work experience, and smoking habit in the exposed group. CONCLUSION: Chronic occupational exposure to lower than the permissible exposure limit of benzene may still result in DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes that may ultimately lead to development of cancer.",,"['Jamebozorgi, Iraj', 'Majidizadeh, Tayebeh', 'Pouryagoub, Gholamreza', 'Mahjoubi, Frouzandeh']","['Jamebozorgi I', 'Majidizadeh T', 'Pouryagoub G', 'Mahjoubi F']","['Petroleum Industry Health Organization, Assaluyeh, Bushehr, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, National Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran.', 'Center for Research on Occupational Diseases (CROD), School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, National Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran. frouz@nigeb.ac.ir.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Iran,Int J Occup Environ Med,The international journal of occupational and environmental medicine,101535763,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*poisoning', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*genetics', '*Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*genetics']",2018/07/12 06:00,2018/10/26 06:00,['2018/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.15171/ijoem.2018.1317 [doi]', '1317 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Occup Environ Med. 2018 Jul;9(3):145-151. doi: 10.15171/ijoem.2018.1317.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Benzene', '*Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15', '*DNA methylation', '*Genes, tumor suppressor', '*Neoplasms', '*Tumor suppressor protein p14ARF']",3,,PMC6466977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have attempted to explore some of the molecular features of pharmacological inhibition of autophagy in TF-1 cells (an acute erythroid leukemia model). Our findings indicated that ara-C induces autophagy (with alteration of LC3B, p62, and Beclin-1) in the cells; however, targeting autophagy by 3-methyladenine and chloroquine significantly increased caspase-dependent apoptosis and the sub-G1 compartment in ara-C-treated cells. Moreover, cell cycle analysis showed that 3-MA, as an early-stage autophagy inhibitor, could elevate the cell population in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase, which was associated with upregulation of p21 and p27 expressions. Interestingly, autophagy inhibition was also accompanied by downregulation of c-Myc gene and protein expression levels and upregulated levels of Bax and Bak gene expressions. In addition, following inhibition of autophagy, the levels of tumor-suppressive miRNA (i.e. miR-204) increased, whereas the values of oncogenic miRNAs (including miR-21, miR-221, miR-30a, and miR-17) decreased.

The dCor index provides a reliable dependence measure among random vectors of arbitrary dimension, without any assumption on their distribution. Moreover, it is sensitive to the presence of redundant terms. The proposed FS method is based on a probabilistic representation of the feature subset model, which is progressively refined by a repeated process of model extraction and evaluation. A key element of the approach is a distributed optimization scheme based on a vertical partitioning of the dataset, which alleviates the negative effects of its unbalanced dimensions.

We apply the technique to a mathematical model for treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. The in-host model includes leukemic cell and immune system dynamics during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunomodulatory compounds. The model is minimal (semi-mechanistic) with just enough detail that all relevant therapeutic effects can be represented. The regimens are optimized to yield the highest possible reduction in disease burden, taking into account dosing constraints and side effect risks due to drug exposure. We compare the following three types of regimens: (1) regimens that are restricted to certain discrete dose levels, which can only change every three months; (2) optimal regimens determined using optimal control; and (3) regimens that are piecewise-constant like the first type of regimen, but are obtained as approximations to the optimal control regimens.

METHODS: Twenty-one cases of CML following treatment for primary diseases were collected and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical presentation, pathologic features, and cytogenetic profile were similar to de novo CML. In particular, those with an isolated Philadelphia chromosome constituted 88.9% of our cases, and additional aberrations characteristic of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) were not identified in this study. The patients responded to imatinib/derivatives and survived with limited follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy-related CML has a clinical presentation, pathologic features, and cytogenetic profile akin to de novo CML. Absence of additional significant aberrations seems to suggest a pathogenesis different from therapy-related AML/MDS. Therapy-related CML exhibits a robust therapeutic response to imatinib/derivatives and favorable clinical outcomes similar to de novo CML.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2018.

In particular, the four PREs (PRE14, 29, 39 and 48) are the first set of, to our knowledge, bona fide vertebrate PREs ever discovered, while many previously reported Drosophila or vertebrate PREs are likely P/TREs.

Previous studies have indicated that SLC15A3 transcripts are mainly expressed in the lymphatic system, however, its regulation and biological role in innate immune responses and inflammatory diseases are as yet unknown. In this study, mouse peritoneal macrophages (PMs), mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and the human lung epithelial carcinoma cell line A549 were used to investigate the regulation and biological role of SLC15A3 in TLR-mediated inflammatory responses. Our results showed that SLC15A3 was upregulated by TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 ligands in macrophages at both the mRNA and protein levels via activation of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappa-B), MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3). Furthermore, knockdown or overexpression of SLC15A3 influenced the TLR4-triggered expression of proinflammatory cytokines. A reporter gene assay showed that the SLC15A3 promotor contained potential NF-kappaB binding sites, which were reasonable for regulating SLC15A3 by TLR-activation through NF-kappaB signaling. Additionally, SLC15A3 expression was increased and positively related to inflammation in mice with bacterial peritonitis. The collective findings suggest that SLC15A3 is regulated by various TLRs, and that it plays an important role in regulating TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses.",,"['Song, Feifeng', 'Yi, Yaodong', 'Li, Cui', 'Hu, Yongjun', 'Wang, Jinhai', 'Smith, David E', 'Jiang, Huidi']","['Song F', 'Yi Y', 'Li C', 'Hu Y', 'Wang J', 'Smith DE', 'Jiang H']","['Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, Zhejiang, China.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, Zhejiang, China.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, United States.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, United States.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, Zhejiang, China. hdjiang@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM115481/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '81573492/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', 'R01GM115481/Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (Foundation for the', 'National Institutes of Health, Inc.)/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180710,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-3)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern Molecules)', '0 (SLC15A3 protein, human)', '0 (SLC15A3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3/metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern Molecules/pharmacology', 'Peritonitis/metabolism/microbiology', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/agonists/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/agonists/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/agonists/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/agonists/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*metabolism']",2018/07/12 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2018/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-0809-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-0809-1 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 Jul 10;9(7):770. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-0809-1.,,,7,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1883-0868'],PMC6039463,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CUE domain-containing 2 (CUEDC2) was a novel interacting partner of SOCS1 and a positive correlation between the expression of CUEDC2 and SOCS1 was confirmed in primary AML cells and AML cell lines without SOCS1 promoter methylation. We aimed to explore roles of CUEDC2 in regulating ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SOCS1 in the leukaemogenesis of AML.According to in vitro experiments, CUEDC2 overexpression increased the level of SOCS1 protein, suppressed JAK1-STAT3 pathway activation. The suppression of this pathway inhibited AML cells' proliferation by causing G1 arrest and enhanced AML cells' sensitivity to cytarabine and idarubicin. Similarity, downregulation of CUEDC2 produced opposite results. Knockout or low expression of CUEDC2 in mouse or AML patients displayed lower overall survival and event-free survival rates, compared with these mouse and AML patients had high-CUEDC2 expression. Mechanistic studies revealed that CUEDC2 overexpression attenuated SOCS1 ubiquitination, facilitated its stabilisation by enhancing SOCS1, Elongin C and Cullin-2 (CUL2) interactions, thus inhibited JAK1-STAT3 pathway and leukaemogenesis of AML. Therefore, our novel findings indicated that CUEDC2 interacted with SOCS1 to suppress SOCS1's ubiquitin-mediated degradation, JAK1-STAT3 pathway activation and leukaemogenesis of AML.",,"['Wu, Qing-Yun', 'Zhu, Yuan-Yuan', 'Liu, Yang', 'Wei, Fang', 'Tong, Yu-Xue', 'Cao, Jiang', 'Zhou, Ping', 'Niu, Ming-Shan', 'Li, Zhen-Yu', 'Zeng, Ling-Yu', 'Li, Feng', 'Xu, Kai-Lin']","['Wu QY', 'Zhu YY', 'Liu Y', 'Wei F', 'Tong YX', 'Cao J', 'Zhou P', 'Niu MS', 'Li ZY', 'Zeng LY', 'Li F', 'Xu KL']","['Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Neurobiology, Xuzhou Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, 221002, China. lifeng1982315@163.com.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China. superstar8023@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China. superstar8023@163.com.']",['eng'],"['81770186, 81570136, 81200375/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '(National Science Foundation of China)/International', '81402073/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', 'BK20160054/Basic Research Program of Jiangsu Province/International', '15KJA320005/Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education (Department of Education', 'Jiangsu Province)/International', '17KJB310016/Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education (Department of Education', 'Jiangsu Province)/International', 'BRA2015395, BRA2017558/Government of Jiangsu Province (Jiangsu', 'Province)/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180710,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CUEDC2 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Survival/genetics/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2018/07/12 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2018/07/12 06:00'],"['2017/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-0812-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-0812-6 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 Jul 10;9(7):774. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-0812-6.,,,7,,PMC6039501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this question, we examined 2551 AML patients (1607 aged <60 years, and 944 aged >/=60 years) enrolled in Cancer and Leukemia Group B treatment protocols and the cytogenetics companion protocol 8461 between 1983 and 2004. At 10 years, 267 (16.6%) of patients aged <60 years and 23 (2.4%) of those aged >/=60 years were alive and disease-free. This disease-free AML group consisted predominantly of patients with core-binding factor AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) and those with a normal karyotype. Occurrences of AML beyond 10 years were infrequent and associated with cytogenetic findings different from those at diagnosis. These data provide evidence that the frequency of long-term cure of AML is low among younger and especially older patients in the absence of Allo-HCT in CR1.

The relationships between the receipt of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Anth-bC) and changes in LV mass and heart failure (HF) symptomatology are unknown, as is their relationship to LV ejection fraction (LVEF), a widely used measurement performed in surveillance strategies designed to avert symptomatic HF associated with cancer treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed blinded, serial assessments of body weight, LVEF and mass, LV-arterial coupling, aortic stiffness, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire measures before and 6 months after initiating Anth-bC (n=61) and non-Anth-bC (n=15), and in 24 cancer-free controls using paired t and chi(2) tests and multivariable linear models. Participants averaged 51+/-12 years, and 70% were women. Cancer diagnoses included breast cancer (53%), hematologic malignancy (42%), and soft tissue sarcoma (5%). We observed a 5% decline in both LVEF (P<0.0001) and LV mass (P=0.03) in the setting of increased aortic stiffness and disrupted ventricular-arterial coupling in those receiving Anth-bC but not other groups (P=0.11-0.92). A worsening of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire score in Anth-bC recipients was associated with myocardial mass declines (r=-0.27; P<0.01) but not with LVEF declines (r=0.11; P=0.45). Moreover, this finding was independent of LVEF changes and body weight. CONCLUSIONS: Early after Anth-bC, LV mass reductions associate with worsening HF symptomatology independent of LVEF.

The major producers of FVIII in the adult are liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and in a lesser degree bone marrow-derived cells, both of which have been shown to ameliorate the bleeding phenotype in adult HA mice after transplantation. We have previously shown that cells from the foetal liver (FL) and the aorta-gonads-mesonephros (AGM) haematopoietic locations possess higher LSEC engraftment potential in newborn mice compared with adult-derived LSECs, constituting likely therapeutic targets for the treatment of HA in neonates. However, less is known about the production of FVIII in embryonic locations. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were performed to assess the relative level of FVIII production in different embryonic tissues and at various developmental stages, identifying the FL and AGM region from day 12 (E12) as prominent sources of FVIII. Furthermore, FL-derived VE-cad(+)CD45(-)Lyve1(+/-) endothelial/endothelial progenitor cells, presenting vascular engraftment potential, produced high levels of F8 ribonucleic acid compared with CD45(+) blood progenitors or Dlk1(+) hepatoblasts. In addition, we show that the E11 AGM explant cultures expanded cells with LSEC repopulation activity, instrumental to further understand signals for in vitro generation of LSECs. Taking into account the capacity for FVIII expression, culture expansion and newborn engraftment potential, these results support the use of cells with foetal characteristics for correction of FVIII deficiency in young individuals.",['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Interferon type III (IFN-lambda), which includes IL28, IL29, and IL28R, and affects the outcome of viral infections, might be complicated in the progression of HAM/TSP. Here, we investigated the host-virus interactions in the manifestation of HAM/TSP, using IL28B, IL29, IL28R, HTLV-1 Tax, HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), and proviral load (PVL). The study groups consisted of 20 patients with HAM/TSP, 20 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs), and 20 healthy controls (HCs). The means of PVL, Tax, and HBZ gene expressions in the HAM/TSP group (p = 0.004, 0.006, and < 0.0001, respectively) were significantly higher than in the AC group. The comparison of IL28B, IL29, and IL28R expression in the HAM/TSP, AC, and HC groups revealed no significant difference between the first 2, but lower concentrations in the HCs (IL28B: p = 0.03, 0.01; IL29: p = 0.07, 0.01; and IL28R: p < 0.0001, respectively). In the HAM/TSP group, correlations were seen between Tax and HBZ (R = 0.61, p = 0.004) and between Tax and IL29 (R = 0.45, p = 0.04). Negative correlations were observed between Tax and IL28B (R = -0.49, p = 0.02) and between HBZ and IL28R (R = -0.43, p = 0.06). In the ACs, an inverse correlation was found between Tax and IL28B (R = -0.42, p = 0.06). These findings suggest that IL29, IL28B, and IL28R interfere in the infection of HAM/TSP, mainly via Tax activation.","['(c) 2018 S.

A novel 3',5'-diprenylated chalcone, (E)-1-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3,5-diprenyl) phenyl-3-(3- pyridinyl)-propene-1-one (C10) is a potential new anti-leukemia agent. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of the anti-leukemia effects of C10 on different leukemia cells in vitro. C10 showed strong inhibition of proliferation of the human erythroleukemia cell line HEL and human myeloid leukemia cell line K562, and several cell and flow cytometer assays showed that inhibition by C10 was due to the regulation of gene expression or phosphorylation in the apoptosis and autophagy pathways. The results showed that C10 regulated the expression of Bax, c-Myc, Bcl-2, P38/AMPK and ERK 1/2, activated the expression of Caspase-3, -8, and PARP at the protein level in the apoptosis pathway of the two leukemia cell types, and inhibited the expression of erythroleukemia carcinogene Fli-1 in the human erythroleukemia cell line HEL. Additionally,treatment with the compound induced a time-dependent increase in expression of LC 3A/B via inhibiting the AKT-mTOR pathway, which is associated with cell autophagy.

Our study investigated the effect of C-phycocyanin (C-PC) in three human erythroleukemia cell lines with or without the MDR phenotype: K562 (non-MDR; no overexpression of drug efflux proteins), K562-Lucena (MDR; overexpression of ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B/ABCB1), and FEPS (MDR; overexpression of ABCB1 and ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C/ABCC1). Using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, we showed that 20 and 200mug/mL C-PC decreased K562 viable cells after 24h and 200mug/mL C-PC decreased K562-Lucena cell proliferation after 48h. C-PC did not decrease viable cells of FEPS cells. On the other hand, the MTT assay showed that exposure of 2, 20, and 200mug/mL C-PC for 24 or 48h was not cytotoxic to peritoneal macrophages. At 72h, the trypan blue exclusion assay showed that 20mug/mL C-PC decreased K562 and K562-Lucena cell proliferation and in FEPS cells, only 200mug/mL C-PC decreased proliferation. In addition, protein-protein docking showed differences in energy and binding sites of ABCB1 and ABCC1 for C-PC, and these results were confirmed by the efflux protein activity assay. Only ABCC1 activity was altered in the presence of C-PC and FEPS cells showed lower C-PC accumulation, suggesting C-PC extrusion by ABCC1, conferring C-PC resistance. In combination with chemotherapy (vincristine [VCR] and daunorubicin [DNR]), the sensitivity of K562-Lucena cells for C-PC+VCR did not increase, whereas FEPS cell sensitivity for C-PC+DNR was increased. In molecular docking experiments, the estimated free energies of binding for C-PC associated with chemotherapy were similar (VCR: -6.9kcal/mol and DNR: -7.2kcal/mol) and these drugs were located within the C-PC cavity. However, C-PC exhibited specificity for tumor cells and K562 cells were more sensitive than K562-Lucena cells, followed by FEPS cells. Thus, C-PC is a possible chemotherapeutic agent for cells with the MDR phenotype, both alone in K562-Lucena cells (resistance due to ABCB1), or in combination with other drugs for cells similar to FEPS (resistance due to ABCC1). Moreover, C-PC did not damage healthy cells (peritoneal macrophages of Mus musculus).",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, methotrexate administration is also associated with persistent cognitive deficits among long-term childhood cancer survivors. Animal models of methotrexate-induced cognitive deficits have primarily utilized adult animals. The purpose of present study is to investigate the neurotoxicity of methotrexate in juvenile rats and its relevant mechanisms. The doses and schedule of systemic and intrathecal methotrexate, given from post-natal age 3-7 weeks, were chosen to model the effects of repeated methotrexate dosing on the developing brains of young children with ALL. This methotrexate regimen had no visible acute toxicity and no effect on growth. At 15 weeks of age (8 weeks after the last methotrexate dose) both spatial pattern memory and visual recognition memory were impaired. In addition, methotrexate-treated animals demonstrated impaired performance in the set-shifting assay, indicating decreased cognitive flexibility. Histopathological analysis demonstrated decreased cell proliferation in methotrexate-treated animals compared to controls, as well as changes in length and thickness of the corpus callosum. Moreover, methotrexate suppressed microglia activation and RANTES production. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that a clinically relevant regimen of systemic and intrathecal methotrexate induces persistent deficits in spatial pattern memory, visual recognition memory and executive function, lasting at least 8 weeks after the last injection. The mechanisms behind methotrexate-induced deficits are likely multifactorial and may relate to suppression of neurogenesis, alterations in neuroinflammation and microglial activation, and structural changes in the corpus callosum.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Models of both tweezers-bead and bead-cell interactions are investigated. A dual closed-loop control strategy is proposed, which includes an inner tweezers-bead control loop and an outer bead-cell control loop. A proportional-integral feedback plus feedforward controller is used to control the inner loop, and an active disturbance rejection controller is used for the outer loop, which can address the cell migration modeling errors and unknown external disturbances. A traffic rule based on interference-clearing mechanism is also proposed to reduce external disturbances on the system by preventing other particles from interfering with the migration process.

We observed that SAL inhibited cell proliferation, as determined by performing Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, promoted cell apoptosis, as determined based on morphological changes, and increased Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI)-positive apoptotic cell percentage. Treatment with SAL increased Bax/Bcl-2 and cytochrome c expression and activated caspase-3 and -9, thus leading to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and resulting in cell apoptosis. These results revealed that SAL induced cell apoptosis through activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The present study is the first to show that SAL induced the differentiation of APL cells, as determined based on mature morphological changes, increased NBT-positive cell and CD11b-positive cell percentages and increased CD11b and C/EBPbeta levels. Furthermore, SAL decreased the expression of beta-catenin and its targets cyclin D1 and C-myc. Results of immunofluorescence analysis revealed that SAL markedly decreased the beta-catenin level in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Combination treatment with SAL and IWR-1, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, synergistically triggered SAL-induced differentiation of APL cells. These findings demonstrated that SAL effectively inhibited cell proliferation accompanied by induction of apoptosis and promotion of cell differentiation by inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Collectively, these data revealed that SAL is a potential drug for treatment of APL.",,"['Zhao, Yi', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Liu, Lu', 'Yao, Shi-Fei', 'Chen, Min', 'Li, Lian-Wen', 'Shan, Zhi-Ling', 'Xiao, Chun-Lan', 'Gan, Liu-Gen', 'Xu, Ting', 'Liu, Bei-Zhong']","['Zhao Y', 'Zhong L', 'Liu L', 'Yao SF', 'Chen M', 'Li LW', 'Shan ZL', 'Xiao CL', 'Gan LG', 'Xu T', 'Liu BZ']","['Central Laboratory of Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, P.R.

However, there remains concern for the development of significant toxicities in heavily pretreated patients. In this study, the authors present their local experience, with respect to efficacy and toxicity, of 22 consecutive patients treated with lutetium-177-DOTAGA-(I-y)fk(Sub-KuE) or (177)Lu-PSMA I&T radioimmunotherapy for progressive mCRPC, followed up over 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients had progressive mCRPC, an European Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) </=2 with adequate bone marrow and liver function. (177)Lu-PSMA I&T therapy was administered at 8-week intervals with a mean prescribed activity of 5.5 GBq (gigabecquerel) per patient. RESULTS: Twenty patients had evaluable results, median age of 71 years, and median duration of follow-up of 17 months. Three patients (15%) experienced a G1/2 myelotoxicity and four (20%) G3/4. No incidences of myelodysplasia/acute leukemia have been identified. All toxicities were self-limiting. Baseline cytopenia was predictive of the development of subsequent G3/4 myelotoxicity (p = 0.0035). Eight patients (40%) experienced an objective PSA response, with a median time to response of 15 weeks. The median time to PSA progression was not reached. Patients receiving three cycles of therapy were statistically more likely to experience a disease response when compared to those treated with one, two, or four cycles (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: (177)Lu-PSMA I&T radioimmunotherapy of progressive mCRPC is safe and effective with three cycles being the potential optimal number for determining long-term disease response.",,"['Kesavan, Murali', 'Turner, J Harvey', 'Meyrick, Danielle', 'Yeo, Sharon', 'Cardaci, Giuseppe', 'Lenzo, Nat P']","['Kesavan M', 'Turner JH', 'Meyrick D', 'Yeo S', 'Cardaci G', 'Lenzo NP']","['1 Department of Haematology, The University of Western Australia , School of Medicine, Perth, Australia .', '2 Department of Nuclear Medicine, The University of Western Australia , School of Medicine, Perth, Australia .', '1 Department of Haematology, The University of Western Australia , School of Medicine, Perth, Australia .', '2 Department of Nuclear Medicine, The University of Western Australia , School of Medicine, Perth, Australia .', '1 Department of Haematology, The University of Western Australia , School of Medicine, Perth, Australia .', '2 Department of Nuclear Medicine, The University of Western Australia , School of Medicine, Perth, Australia .', '1 Department of Haematology, The University of Western Australia , School of Medicine, Perth, Australia .', '2 Department of Nuclear Medicine, The University of Western Australia , School of Medicine, Perth, Australia .', '3 Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, The University of Notre Dame , Fremantle, Australia .', '1 Department of Haematology, The University of Western Australia , School of Medicine, Perth, Australia .', '2 Department of Nuclear Medicine, The University of Western Australia , School of Medicine, Perth, Australia .', '4 Theranostics Australia , East Fremantle, Australia .']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180710,United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '5H0DOZ21UJ (Lutetium)', 'BRH40Y9V1Q (Lutetium-177)', 'EC 3.4.17.21 (FOLH1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.17.21 (Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (KLK3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Kallikreins)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Surface/chemistry/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II/chemistry/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kallikreins/blood', 'Lutetium/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood', 'Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant/blood/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2018/07/11 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/07/11 06:00'],"['2018/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cbr.2017.2403 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2018 Sep;33(7):274-281. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2017.2403.

Although a tablet formulation with better oral bioavailability is available, some patients have to rely on the oral suspension in clinical routine. Therefore, effectiveness of posaconazole oral suspension under real-life clinical conditions and impact of patient education about the correct intake on its plasma concentrations were assessed in this study. Altogether 96 patients receiving 160 cycles of induction chemotherapy were retrospectively (40 patients) and prospectively (56 patients) analysed. Patients were assigned into two groups for each chemotherapy cycle according to the application of antifungal prophylaxis (A: posaconazole oral suspension, 200 mg three times a day >/=7 days; B: intake <7 days, fluconazole or no prophylaxis). Antifungal prophylaxis and therapy were analysed for each cycle. Additionally, plasma concentrations were determined from prospectively included subjects of group A who were intensively educated to perform a correct drug intake. Systemic antifungal therapy was statistically started less often in group A (26% vs 53%; P = 0.002). Posaconazole prophylaxis was associated with a lower risk of proven invasive fungal infection (P = 0.003). Median plasma concentration apparently increased between the first and second time of determination effected by an initial intensive on-site patient education. The clinical effectiveness of posaconazole oral suspension was confirmed. A detailed patient education at the beginning of the treatment with posaconazole oral suspensions seems to be of primary importance for efficient plasma concentrations.","['(c) 2018 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic', 'Pharmacological Society).']","['Geist, Marcus J P', 'Egerer, Gerlinde', 'Mikus, Gerd', 'Blank, Antje', 'Hohmann, Nicolas', 'Heinz, Werner J', 'Carls, Alexandra']","['Geist MJP', 'Egerer G', 'Mikus G', 'Blank A', 'Hohmann N', 'Heinz WJ', 'Carls A']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacoepidemiology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacoepidemiology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacoepidemiology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University of Wuerzburg Medical Center, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacoepidemiology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20180802,England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Suspensions)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Antifungal Agents/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/epidemiology/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Education as Topic', 'Program Evaluation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Suspensions', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2018/07/11 06:00,2019/04/17 06:00,['2018/07/11 06:00'],"['2018/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcpt.13093 [doi]'],ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2019 Jan;124(1):56-61. doi: 10.1111/bcpt.13093.

At diagnosis, accurate staging is crucial for appropriate therapy selection: FDG-PET/CT can identify areas of lymphoma missed by CT alone and avoid under-treatment of patients with advanced disease stage who would have been misclassified as having limited stage disease by CT. Particularly in Hodgkin lymphoma, positive interim FDG-PET/CT scans are adversely prognostic for clinical outcomes and can inform PET-adapted treatment strategies, but such data are less consistent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The use of quantitative FDG-PET/CT metrics using metabolic tumour volume, possibly in combination with other biomarkers, may better define prognostic subgroups and thus facilitate better treatment selection. After chemotherapy, FDG-PET/CT response is predictive of outcome and may identify a subgroup who benefit from consolidative radiotherapy. Novel therapies, in particular immunotherapies, exhibit different response patterns than conventional chemotherapy, which has led to modified response criteria that take into account the risk of transient pseudo-progression. In relapsed lymphoma, FDG-PET/CT after second-line therapy and prior to high-dose therapy is also strongly associated with outcome and may be used to guide intensity of salvage therapy in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma. Currently, FDG-PET/CT has no role in the routine follow-up after complete metabolic response to therapy, but it remains a powerful tool for excluding relapse if patients develop clinical features suggestive of disease relapse. In conclusion, FDG-PET/CT plays major roles in the various phases of management of lymphoma and constitutes a step towards the pursuit of personalized treatment.",['(c) 2018 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.'],"['El-Galaly, T C', 'Villa, D', 'Gormsen, L C', 'Baech, J', 'Lo, A', 'Cheah, C Y']","['El-Galaly TC', 'Villa D', 'Gormsen LC', 'Baech J', 'Lo A', 'Cheah CY']","['Department of Hematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Clinical Cancer Research Center, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine and PET Centre, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Clinical Cancer Research Center, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Division of Radiation Oncology, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Haematology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and Pathwest Laboratory Medicine, Nedlands, WA, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180724,England,J Intern Med,Journal of internal medicine,8904841,['0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)'],IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Disease Progression', '*Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden/physiology']",2018/07/11 06:00,2019/09/27 06:00,['2018/07/11 06:00'],"['2018/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/joim.12813 [doi]'],ppublish,J Intern Med. 2018 Oct;284(4):358-376. doi: 10.1111/joim.12813.

In this study, the distribution of mast cells in vivo was observed, and mechanical clues for understanding their distribution based on mechanical niches were explored. By toluidine blue staining and immunohistochemical staining, we examined the distribution and location of mast cells in rat skin and found that mast cells are distributed in a spatially nonuniform manner, preferring to locate at regions in the tissue and extracellular matrix with stiffness changes. In vitro experiments for studying the distribution of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cell line on poly-di-methyl-siloxane (PDMS) substrates with stiffness variations were performed. It was found that RBL-2H3 cells migrate and tend to remain in the areas with stiffness variations. The present research suggests that changing the stiffness of local tissues may stimulate mast cell recruitment, which may be the method by which some traditional Chinese medicine treatments, such as acupuncture.

BRAF(V600E) mutation, detected in more than 80% of the cases, is described as a driver mutation, but additional genetic abnormalities appear to be necessary for the disease progression. For cases of HCL-c harboring a wild-type BRAF gene, the differential diagnosis of the variant form of HCL (HCL-v) or splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (SDRPL) is complex. We selected a panel of 21 relevant genes based on a literature review of whole exome sequencing studies (BRAF, MAP2K1, DUSP2, MAPK15, ARID1A, ARID1B, EZH2, KDM6A, CREBBP, TP53, CDKN1B, XPO1, KLF2, CXCR4, NOTH1, NOTCH2, MYD88, ANXA1, U2AF1, BCOR, and ABCA8). We analyzed 20 HCL-c and 4 HCL-v patients. The analysis of diagnostic samples mutations in BRAF (n = 18), KLF2 (n = 4), MAP2K1 (n = 3), KDM6A (n = 2), CDKN1B (n = 2), ARID1A (n = 2), CREBBP (n = 2) NOTCH1 (n = 1) and ARID1B (n = 1). BRAF(V600E) was found in 90% (18/20) of HCL-c patients. In HCL-c patients with BRAF(V600E) , other mutations were found in 33% (6/18) of cases. All 4 HCL-v patients had mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes: KDM6A (n = 2), CREBBP (n = 1) or ARID1A (n = 1).

Despite recent advances in understanding AML pathogenesis and identifying their molecular subtypes based on somatic mutations, AML is still characterized by poor outcomes, with a 5-year survival rate of only 30%-40%, the majority of the patients dying due to AML relapse. Leukemia stem cells (LSC) are considered to be at the root of chemotherapeutic resistance and AML relapse. Although numerous studies have tried to better characterize LSCs in terms of surface and molecular markers, a specific marker of LSC has not been found, and still the most universally accepted phenotypic signature remains the surface antigens CD34+CD38- that is shared with normal hematopoietic stem cells. Animal models provides the means to investigate the factors responsible for leukemic transformation, the intrinsic differences between secondary post-myeloproliferative neoplasm AML and de novo AML, especially the signaling pathways involved in inflammation and hematopoiesis. However, AML proved to be one of the hematological malignancies that is difficult to engraft even in the most immunodeficient mice strains, and numerous ongoing attempts are focused to develop ""humanized mice"" that can support the engraftment of LSC.

Most cases arise without any detectable early symptoms and patients usually present with the acute complications of bone marrow failure(1). The onset of such de novo AML cases is typically preceded by the accumulation of somatic mutations in preleukaemic haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that undergo clonal expansion(2,3). However, recurrent AML mutations also accumulate in HSPCs during ageing of healthy individuals who do not develop AML, a phenomenon referred to as age-related clonal haematopoiesis (ARCH)(4-8). Here we use deep sequencing to analyse genes that are recurrently mutated in AML to distinguish between individuals who have a high risk of developing AML and those with benign ARCH. We analysed peripheral blood cells from 95 individuals that were obtained on average 6.3 years before AML diagnosis (pre-AML group), together with 414 unselected age- and gender-matched individuals (control group). Pre-AML cases were distinct from controls and had more mutations per sample, higher variant allele frequencies, indicating greater clonal expansion, and showed enrichment of mutations in specific genes. Genetic parameters were used to derive a model that accurately predicted AML-free survival; this model was validated in an independent cohort of 29 pre-AML cases and 262 controls. Because AML is rare, we also developed an AML predictive model using a large electronic health record database that identified individuals at greater risk. Collectively our findings provide proof-of-concept that it is possible to discriminate ARCH from pre-AML many years before malignant transformation. This could in future enable earlier detection and monitoring, and may help to inform intervention.",,"['Abelson, Sagi', 'Collord, Grace', 'Ng, Stanley W K', 'Weissbrod, Omer', 'Mendelson Cohen,

It was diagnosed based on histopathological features of bone marrow (BM) biopsy specimens together with clinical parameters [leukocytosis, anemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values, and splenomegaly]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of early/prefibrotic PMF in patients who were previously diagnosed with ET, and to compare clinical features at diagnosis and outcomes between early/prefibrotic PMF and essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients. BM biopsy samples obtained at the time of ET diagnosis were available in 42 patients. Sample reevaluation according to the 2016 revised WHO criteria revealed that early/prefibrotic PMF accounted for 14% of patients who were previously diagnosed with ET, which was comparable to the rates in previous reports. Compared to patients with ET, patients with early/prefibrotic PMF had higher LDH values and higher frequencies of splenomegaly. Overall, myelofibrosis-free and acute myeloid leukemia-free survivals were comparable between the 2 groups.

The diseases are characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system as both the cytokine milieu, immune phenotype, immune regulation, and expression of genes related to immune cell functions are deregulated. Several treatment strategies try to circumvent this deregulation, and several clinical and preclinical trials have shown promising results, albeit not in the same scale as chimeric antigen receptor T cells have had in the treatment of refractory lymphoid malignancies. The use of immune checkpoint blocking antibodies especially in combination with hypomethylating agents has had some success-a success that will likely be enhanced by therapeutic cancer vaccination with tumor-specific antigens. In the chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, the recent identification of immune responses against the Januskinase-2 and calreticulin exon 9 driver mutations could also be used in the vaccination setting to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. This immune response could probably be enhanced by the concurrent use of immune checkpoint inhibitors or by vaccination with epitopes from immune regulatory proteins such as arginase-1 and programmed death ligand-1.

Here, we show that proteolytic destruction of the key regulator Mcl-1 during an extended mitosis requires the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) and is independent of another ubiquitin E3 ligase, SCF(Fbw7) Using live-cell imaging, we show that the loss of Mcl-1 during mitosis is dependent on a D box motif found in other APC/C substrates, while an isoleucine-arginine (IR) C-terminal tail regulates the manner in which Mcl-1 engages with the APC/C, converting Mcl-1 from a Cdc20-dependent and checkpoint-controlled substrate to one that is degraded independently of checkpoint strength. This mechanism ensures a relatively slow but steady rate of Mcl-1 degradation during mitosis and avoids its catastrophic destruction when the mitotic checkpoint is satisfied, providing an apoptotic timer that can distinguish a prolonged mitotic delay from normal mitosis. Importantly, we also show that inhibition of Cdc20 promotes mitotic cell death more effectively than loss of APC/C activity through differential effects on Mcl-1 degradation, providing an improved strategy to kill cancer cells.",['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Clinical trials show progression-free survival (PFS) benefits, with some studies (Cancer and Leukemia Group [CALGB] trial and meta-analysis) also showing overall survival (OS) benefits, but applicability to real-world clinical settings is unclear. Using data from Connect MM, the largest US-based observational registry of NDMM patients, we analyzed effects of maintenance therapy on long-term outcomes in 1450 treated patients enrolled from 2009 to 2011. Patients who received induction therapy and ASCT (n = 432) were analyzed from 100 days post-ASCT (data cut 7 January 2016): 267 received maintenance (80% lenalidomide-based [of whom 88% received lenalidomide monotherapy]); 165 did not. Lenalidomide maintenance improved median PFS and 3-year PFS rate vs no maintenance (50.3 vs 30.8 months [hazard ratio (HR), 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.46-0.82; P < .001] and 56% vs 42%, respectively).

Previously, we reported that 20% of patients receiving high-dose MTX developed oral mucositis. MTX inhibits folate metabolism, which is essential for DNA methylation. We hypothesize that MTX inhibits DNA methylation, which results into adverse effects. We studied DNA methylation markers during high-dose methotrexate treatment in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in relation to developing oral mucositis. MATERIALS & METHODS: S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM) and S-Adenosyl-Homocysteine (SAH) levels and LINE1 DNA methylation were measured prospectively before and after high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX 4 x 5g/m2) therapy in 82 children with ALL. Methotrexate-induced oral mucositis was registered prospectively. Oral mucositis (grade >/= 3 National Cancer Institute Criteria) was used as clinical endpoint. RESULTS: SAM levels decreased significantly during methotrexate therapy (-16.1 nmol/L (-144.0 -+46.0), p<0.001), while SAH levels and the SAM:SAH ratio did not change significantly. LINE1 DNA methylation (+1.4% (-1.1 -+6.5), p<0.001) increased during therapy. SAM and SAH levels were not correlated to LINE1 DNA methylation status.

Despite the tremendous progress achieved in the last decade, development of such bsAbs still faces many challenges. This work aimed to develop a mechanism-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling framework that can be used to assist the development of T-cell redirecting bsAbs. A Target cell-Biologics-Effector cell (TBE) complex-based cell killing model was developed using in vitro and in vivo data, which incorporates information on binding affinities of bsAbs to CD3 and target receptors, expression levels of CD3 and target receptors, concentrations of effector and target cells, as well as respective physiological parameters. This TBE model can simultaneously evaluate the effect of multiple system-specific and drug-specific factors on the T-cell redirecting bsAb exposure-response relationship on a physiological basis; it reasonably captured multiple reported in vitro cytotoxicity data, and successfully predicted the effect of some key factors on in vitro cytotoxicity assays and the efficacious dose of blinatumomab in humans. The mechanistic nature of this model uniquely positions it as a knowledge-based platform that can be readily expanded to guide target selection, drug design, candidate selection and clinical dosing regimen projection, and thus support the overall discovery and development of T-cell redirecting bsAbs.",,"['Jiang, Xiling', 'Chen, Xi', 'Carpenter, Thomas J', 'Wang, Jun', 'Zhou, Rebecca', 'Davis, Hugh M', 'Heald, Donald L', 'Wang, Weirong']","['Jiang X', 'Chen X', 'Carpenter TJ', 'Wang J', 'Zhou R', 'Davis HM', 'Heald DL', 'Wang W']","['a Biologics Development Sciences , Janssen Biotherapeutics, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'a Biologics Development Sciences , Janssen Biotherapeutics, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'a Biologics Development Sciences , Janssen Biotherapeutics, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'a Biologics Development Sciences , Janssen Biotherapeutics, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'b Biology Department , Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, PA, USA.', 'a Biologics Development Sciences , Janssen Biotherapeutics, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'a Biologics Development Sciences , Janssen Biotherapeutics, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'a Biologics Development Sciences , Janssen Biotherapeutics, Janssen Research & Development, LLC, Spring House, PA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180821,United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/administration & dosage/*immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects/*immunology', 'Biological Products/administration & dosage/*immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Models, Immunological', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2018/07/10 06:00,2019/02/26 06:00,['2018/07/10 06:00'],"['2018/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/19420862.2018.1480299 [doi]'],ppublish,MAbs. 2018 Aug/Sep;10(6):876-889. doi: 10.1080/19420862.2018.1480299.

METHODS: A modified validated survey was used to ask two questions: (1) rate on a 10-point Likert scale their level of satisfaction with the information provided to them by their POP and (2) did the AYA consult provide added value on top of their POP. Young people at PM were recruited over two separate time points spaced 1 year apart. Descriptive statistics was used to report demographics and survey responses. Differences in demographics between cohorts 1 and 2 were compared using Student's t-tests. RESULTS: Participants were an average of 31 years (range 15-39) of age; (Cohort 1 = 137; Cohort 2 = 130) and were dominated by diagnoses of leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer. More patients had a consultation with the AYA program in 2016 (Cohort 2 = 55/130, 42%) compared to 2015 (Cohort 1 = 34/137, 25%, p = 0.026). Mean satisfaction scores (+/-SD) with information provided by POP in AYA domains in both cohorts combined were highest among (1) cancer information (8.09 +/- 2.22), (2) social supports (7.45 +/- 2.52), and (3) school/work (7.42 +/- 2.88). When evaluating the incremental benefit of the AYA-dedicated team, statistically significant added value was perceived in 5/10 domains, including school/work (p < 0.001), social supports (p < 0.001), physical appearance (p = 0.009), sexual health (p = 0.01), and fertility (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Participants were satisfied with the information provided by their POP and still declared incremental added benefit of the AYA program.

A leukemia patient infected with CRKP was subjected to follow-up analysis of variation in phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of CRKP strains isolated from various specimens at different stages of treatment over a period of 3 years. Our data showed that (1) carbapenem treatment led to the emergence of CRKP in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of the patient, which subsequently caused infections at other body sites as well as septicemia; (2) treatment with tigecycline led to the emergence of tigecycline-resistant CRKP, possibly through induction of the expression of a variant tet(A) gene located in a conjugative plasmid; (3) colistin treatment was effective in clearing CRKP from the bloodstream but led to the emergence of mcr-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae strains as well as colistin-resistant CRKP in the GI tract due to inactivation of the mgrB gene; and (4) tigecycline- and colistin-resistant CRKP could persist in the human GI tract for a prolonged period even without antibiotic selection pressure.

METHODS: Iterative searches identified 36 studies for the 11 cancer sites. Statistical heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed to enhance interpretation of meta-relative risks. RESULTS: Statistical heterogeneity was marked for mesothelioma, but was largely due to study quality. Higher quality studies showed a meta-relative risk (RR) of 3.22, (95% prediction interval 1.45 to 7.23). Melanoma (meta-RR = 1.23) and acute lymphoid leukemia (meta-RR = 1.51), showed results consistent with higher risk, but both were driven by one or two studies. Eight other cancer outcomes showed summary meta-RR's consistent with unity. CONCLUSIONS: Most cancer outcomes are consistent with background risk in refinery workers. This work has clarified an excess mesothelioma risk, conditional on study quality stratification.

His heart rate partially recovered, and ATRA was rechallenged with a half dose. However, complete AV block as well as differentiation syndrome recurred on the next day. ATRA was immediately discontinued, and a temporary pacemaker was inserted. Two days after discontinuing ATRA, AV block gradually improved, and ATRA was uneventfully rechallenged again. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale was 7 for ATRA, suggesting it was the probable cause of arrhythmia. A literature search identified 6 other cases of bradycardia during ATRA therapy, and all of them occurred during APL induction therapy, with onset ranging from 4 days to 25 days. Therefore, monitoring vital signs and performing electrocardiogram are highly recommended during the first month of induction therapy with ATRA.

Recently, the levels of extracellular heat shock protein 72 (eHSP72) were found to be elevated in ALL, and its elevation associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, considering the possible role of eHSP72 as a modulator of the immunological system and metabolism, the aim of this study was to describe the response of eHSP72 to the induction phase of chemotherapy, along with metabolic, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, in children and adolescents newly diagnosed with ALL. Methods: Nineteen patients were recruited and analysed before and after the induction phase of chemotherapy (with 28 days of duration). Blood samples were taken for the analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP), levels of lipoperoxidation, insulin (and HOMA-IR), cortisol, glucose, lipid profile and eHSP72. Results: We found that induction phase of chemotherapy leads to a drop in glucose levels (from 101.79+/-19 to 75.8+/-9.7 mg/dL), improvements on inflammation (CRP levels, p<0.01) and oxidative stress (TBARS levels, p<0.01), reduction on eHSP72 (p=0.03) and improved insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, p=0.02).

BMI-1 is required for the self-renewal and maintenance of MCL-initiating stem cells. Upregulation of BMI-1 has been reported in MCL patients, especially in those with refractory/relapsed disease. We studied the effects of a novel small-molecule selective inhibitor of BMI1 expression, PTC596, in MCL cells. Eight MCL cell lines and patient-derived samples were exposed to PTC596. PTC596 induced mitochondrial apoptosis, as evidenced by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 cleavage, BAX activation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. There was a positive correlation between baseline BMI-1 protein levels and PTC596-induced apoptosis. p53 status did not affect sensitivity to PTC596. PTC596 effectively decreased BMI-1-expressing and tumor-initiating side population MCL cells (IC50: 138 nM) compared with ibrutinib, which modestly decreased side population cells. Interestingly, PTC596, reported to target cancer stem cells, decreased MCL-1 expression levels and antagonized ibrutinib-induced increase in MCL-1 expression, leading to synergistic apoptosis induction in MCL cells. There are currently no drugs that specifically target cancer stem cell fractions, and a reduction in BMI-1 protein by PTC596 may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for MCL.",,"['Maeda, Aya', 'Nishida, Yuki', 'Weetall, Marla', 'Cao, Liangxian', 'Branstrom, Arthur', 'Ishizawa, Jo', 'Nii, Takenobu', 'Schober, Wendy D', 'Abe, Yoshiaki', 'Matsue, Kosei', 'Yoshimura, Mariko', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Kojima, Kensuke']","['Maeda A', 'Nishida Y', 'Weetall M', 'Cao L', 'Branstrom A', 'Ishizawa J', 'Nii T', 'Schober WD', 'Abe Y', 'Matsue K', 'Yoshimura M', 'Kimura S', 'Kojima K']","['Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'PTC Therapeutics, South Plainfield, NJ, USA.', 'PTC Therapeutics, South Plainfield, NJ, USA.', 'PTC Therapeutics, South Plainfield, NJ, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kameda Medical Center, Kamogawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kameda Medical Center, Kamogawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180619,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,2018/07/10 06:00,2018/07/10 06:01,['2018/07/10 06:00'],"['2017/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25558 [doi]', '25558 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Jun 19;9(47):28547-28560. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25558. eCollection 2018 Jun 19.,['NOTNLM'],"['BMI-1', 'mantle cell lymphoma']",47,,PMC6033370,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Kensuke Kojima received research support as an unrestricted', 'gift from PTC Therapeutics.

Although positive results have been obtained with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as sorafenib, especially in patients with Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-positive AML, the success of chemotherapy is very heterogeneous. Here we have investigated in vitro whether the transportome (set of expressed plasma membrane transporters) is involved in the differential response of AML to sorafenib. Methods: The sensitivity to sorafenib-induced cell death (MTT test and anexin V/7-AAD method) was evaluated in five different cell lines: MOLM-13, OCI-AML2, HL-60, HEL and K-562. The transportome was characterized by measuring mRNA using RT-qPCR. Drug uptake/efflux was determined by flow cytometry using specific substrates and inhibitors. Results: The cytostatic response to sorafenib was: MOLM-13>>OCI-AML2>HL-60>HEL approximately K-562. Regarding efflux pumps, MDR1 was highly expressed in HEL>K-562 approximately MOLM-13, but not in OCI-AML2 and HL-60. BCRP and MPR3 expression was low in all cell lines, whereas MRP4 and MRP5 expression was from moderate to high. Flow cytometry studies demonstrated that MRP4, but not MRP5, was functional. The expression of the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), involved in sorafenib uptake, was MOLM-13>OCI-AML2 approximately HL-60 and non detectable in HEL and K-562. Transfection of HEL cells with OCT1 increased the sensitivity of these cells to sorafenib, whereas inactive genetic variants failed to induce this change. Conclusion: Together with changes in the expression/function of receptors targeted by TKIs, the expression of plasma membrane transporters involved in sorafenib uptake/efflux may affect the response of leukemia cells to this drug.",,"['Macias, Rocio I R', 'Sanchez-Martin, Anabel', 'Rodriguez-Macias, Gabriela', 'Sanchez-Abarca, Luis I', 'Lozano, Elisa', 'Herraez, Elisa', 'Odero, Maria D', 'Diez-Martin, Jose L', 'Marin, Jose J G', 'Briz, Oscar']","['Macias RIR', 'Sanchez-Martin A', 'Rodriguez-Macias G', 'Sanchez-Abarca LI', 'Lozano E', 'Herraez E', 'Odero MD', 'Diez-Martin JL', 'Marin JJG', 'Briz O']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hepatology and Drug Targeting (HEVEFARM), University of Salamanca, IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'National Institute for the Study of Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases (CIBERehd), Madrid, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hepatology and Drug Targeting (HEVEFARM), University of Salamanca, IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hepatology and Drug Targeting (HEVEFARM), University of Salamanca, IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology-BMT Unit, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hepatology and Drug Targeting (HEVEFARM), University of Salamanca, IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'National Institute for the Study of Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases (CIBERehd), Madrid, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hepatology and Drug Targeting (HEVEFARM), University of Salamanca, IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'National Institute for the Study of Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases (CIBERehd), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Genetics and CIMA, University of Navarra, Pamplona, CIBERONC, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology-BMT Unit, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Gregorio Maranon Institute for Health Research (IISGM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hepatology and Drug Targeting (HEVEFARM), University of Salamanca, IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'National Institute for the Study of Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases (CIBERehd), Madrid, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hepatology and Drug Targeting (HEVEFARM), University of Salamanca, IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'National Institute for the Study of Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases (CIBERehd), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180619,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,2018/07/10 06:00,2018/07/10 06:01,['2018/07/10 06:00'],"['2017/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25494 [doi]', '25494 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Jun 19;9(47):28474-28485. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25494. eCollection 2018 Jun 19.,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'cancer', 'chemoresistance', 'chemotherapy', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",47,,PMC6033373,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though the discovery of Imatinib Mesylate (IM) has brought a paradigm shift in CML treatment, 20% patients show resistance to this tyrosine kinase inhibiter (TKI). Therefore, it is important to identify markers, which can predict the occurrence and prognosis of CML. Clinical Exome Sequencing, panel of more than 4800 genes, was performed in CML patients to identify prognostic and susceptibility markers in CML. Methods: Enrolled CML patients (n=18) were segregated as IM responders (n=10) and IM failures (n=8) as per European Leukemia Net (ELN), 2013 guidelines. Healthy controls (n=5) were also enrolled. DNA from blood of subjects was subjected to Next Generation Sequencing. Rare mutations present in one patient group and absent in another group were considered as prognostic markers, whereas mutations present in more than 50% patients were considered as susceptibility markers. Result: Mutations in genes associated with cancer related functions were found in different patient groups. Four variants: rs116201358, rs4014596, rs52897880 and rs2274329 in C8A, UNC93B1, APOH and CA6 genes, respectively, were present in IM responders; whereas rs4945 in MFGE8 was present in IM failures. Mutations in HLA-DRB1 (rs17878951), HLA-DRB5 (rs137863146), RPHN2 (rs193179333), CYP2F1 (rs116958555), KCNJ12 (rs76684759) and FUT3 (rs151218854) were present as susceptibility markers. Conclusion: The potential genetic markers discovered in this study can help in predicting response to IM as frontline therapy. Susceptibility markers may also be used as panel for individuals prone to have CML.",,"['Shokeen, Yogender', 'Sharma, Neeta Raj', 'Vats, Abhishek', 'Taneja, Vibha', 'Minhas, Sachin', 'Jauhri, Mayank', 'Sankaran, Satish', 'Aggarwal, Shyam']","['Shokeen Y', 'Sharma NR', 'Vats A', 'Taneja V', 'Minhas S', 'Jauhri M', 'Sankaran S', 'Aggarwal S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Rajinder Nagar, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health and Pediatric Emergency Consultant, School of Medicine, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia; School of Bio-Engineering and Biosciences, Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar, Punjab, India.', 'Department of Research, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Rajinder Nagar, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Research, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Rajinder Nagar, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Rajinder Nagar, Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Rajinder Nagar, Delhi, India.', 'Strand Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine.

The Population Registries of Cancer are fundamental in order to know the territorial profiles of cancer, and to evaluate the impact of their control programs. Objective: To estimate the incidence and mortality from cancer in the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga in the period 2008-2012. Methods: A descriptive population study of cancer incidence and mortality in the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga was conducted. Primary invasive cancer cases from the 2008-2012 period was obtained from the RPC-AMB base. Population and death data were provided by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE, for its initials in Spanish). Crude rates of global and specific incidence and mortality were estimated by sex, and standardized incidence and mortality rates. Results: During the five-year period, 8,775 incidents of cancer were recorded (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer). The global standardized incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were 151.7 in men and 157.2 in women. The main locations were prostate, stomach and colorectal, in men; breast, thyroid and colorectal in women. The standardized mortality rate per 100,000 person-years was 94.8 in men and 78.0 in women.

Coexpression of MYC and BCL-2 is considered a prognostic marker portending poor outcomes. However, the prognostic effect of BCL-2 and BCL-6 expression in DLBCL remains controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect MYC, BCL-2 and BCL-6 expression in 212 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL and assess the prognostic effects of BCL-2 and BCL-6 expression. The DLBCL patients were treated with R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine [Oncovin], prednisone)-like regimens. RESULTS: Retrospective analysis revealed that BCL-2(+) and BCL-2(+)/MYC(+) were prognostic factors indicative of poor outcomes. Patients with BCL-2(+) and/or MYC(+) expression had a poorer prognosis than that of patients with BCL-2(-) and/or MYC(-) expression. Patients with BCL-2(+)/MYC(-) expression showed a trend toward poorer survival than those with BCL-2(-)/MYC(+) expression, suggesting that BCL-2 plays a more important role than MYC. Also, patients with BCL-6(-)/MYC(+) expression had poorer progression-free survival than those with BCL-6(+)/MYC(+) expression. In addition, patients with BCL-2(+)/MYC(+)/BCL-6(-) expression had the worst prognosis, suggesting that BCL-6(-) is a prognostic factor for poor outcomes for MYC(+) DLBCL patients. Altogether, our findings have shown that BCL-2 is an independent prognostic factor and possibly plays a more important role than MYC in MYC(+) DLBCL patients. Furthermore, we found that BCL-6(-) expression could also be a prognostic factor portending poor outcomes for MYC(+) DLBCL patients.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The absolute configuration of the subunits was determined by the advanced Marfey's method and the chiral LC-MS analysis. Compound 1 exhibited the activity of maintaining colony formation of murine embryonic stem (mES) cells without leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Down regulation of the gene expression of Kruppel-like transcription factor 4 (Klf4) indicated that 1 itself was not able to maintain the undifferentiated state of the mES cells.

The aim of this review is to summarize the relevant literature on the economic impact of oral novel therapies for the treatment of CLL and discuss the underlying factors and suggested solutions for high drug prices. RECENT FINDINGS: The cost of therapy for CLL has increased substantially since the introduction of oral therapies. This increase in cost is caused by multiple factors including cost of drug development, alternate reimbursement patterns, lack of transparency, and lack of free market competition. Oral therapies for CLL have dramatically increased costs for both patients and payers.

B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) is an inhibitor of apoptosis which stabilizes the mitochondria, resulting in the prevention of activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins. In addition, BCL-2 is overexpressed in the leukemic stem cell (LSC) population, and its inhibition may lead to selective LSC eradication. Herein, we will discuss the mechanism and rationale of BCL-2 inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with an overview of the selective BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. RECENT FINDINGS: Venetoclax has activity against AML and has displayed synergistic activity with hypomethylating agents in the preclinical setting. In the clinical setting, although it has only modest activity as a single agent in relapsed and refractory AML, in the older, treatment-naive population, in combination with either a hypomethylator or low-dose cytarabine, it is well tolerated with impressive efficacy. In addition, BCL-2 inhibition may also have activity in MDS, and although clinical trials are in their early phases, this may be an effective strategy in both the up-front and relapsed setting. BCL-2 inhibition with venetoclax is well tolerated and active in older patients with newly diagnosed AML and in the relapsed setting has activity that may be improved in combination with other therapies.

We compared intellectual performance (WAIS IV), memory (AVLT), and executive functioning (ANT) between adult leukemia survivors (n = 31) and control individuals (n = 35). In survivors, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) during treatment and total intrathecal methotrexate dose correlated with adult intellectual performance (Pearson's and Spearman's coefficients, respectively). Long-term memory and attentional control, both maturing before survivors' mean age at diagnosis, were unaffected (P > .05 on all four subtests), in contrast to cognitive flexibility and information processing (P < .05 for eight of the subtests), which mature during adolescence. CSF p-Tau and methotrexate dose negatively correlated with intellectual performance (r = -0.414, P = .04 and r = -0.484, P = .007, respectively), but not with each other (r = 0.219, P = .29).

Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of plasma EBV load as biomarker and prognostic factor in HIV-positive patients with lymphomas. METHODS: EBV loads were measured by polymerase chain reaction in plasma samples of 81 HIV-positive patients' lymphomas at different moments: within 1 year before lymphoma diagnosis, at diagnosis, and at complete response (CR). Control samples included HIV-negative patients with lymphomas and HIV-positive patients without neoplasia or opportunistic infections. RESULTS: HIV-positive patients with lymphomas had more frequently-detectable EBV load at lymphoma diagnosis (53%) than either HIV-negative patients with the same lymphoma type (16%; P < .001) or HIV-positive individuals without neoplasia or opportunistic infection (1.2%; P < .001). HIV-positive lymphoma patients with detectable EBV load in plasma at lymphoma diagnosis had statistically significant decrease of EBV load at CR. High EBV load (>5000 copies/mL) at lymphoma diagnosis was an independent negative prognostic factor for overall survival and progression-free survival in HIV-positive patients with lymphomas. Detectable plasma EBV loads identified HIV-positive subjects that would eventually develop lymphoma (area under the curve, 82%; 95% CI: 0.67-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma EBV load can be used as a biomarker and as a prognostic factor in HIV-positive patients with lymphomas. The presence of the EBV load in the plasma of an HIV-positive patient can be an early predictor of lymphoma development.","['(c) The Author(s) 2018.

Methods: Monocyte subset screening (CD14/CD16 expression) was performed on 68 blood and 25 bone marrow specimens with a monocytosis and/or flagged as possible CMML. Fifty thousand total events were obtained per case. Cases were categorized as CMML, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), or non-CMML + non-aCML by clinicopathologic diagnosis. Results: The methodology differentiated blood and bone marrow CMML cases from non-CMML + non-aCML but not three aCML cases in the clinical setting. Furthermore, a decreased percentage of nonclassical monocytes (CD14dimCD16+) showed better sensitivity than the previously described approach that relied on increased percentage of classical monocytes (CD14brightCD16-).

Sepsis was identified using inpatient Medicare claims. Associations with sepsis were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: After correction for multiple comparisons, sepsis was significantly associated with increased risk for cancers of the colon (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.12), rectum (1.13), liver (1.47), lung (1.17), and cervix (1.52), as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 1.19), chronic myeloid leukemia (1.54), and myelodysplastic syndrome (1.30). Inverse associations were observed for cancers of the breast (aOR = 0.86), prostate (0.75), kidney (0.90), and thyroid (0.68) and for melanoma (0.83), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (0.89), and follicular lymphoma (0.65). Sepsis was significantly associated with the following 9 types of cancer in the period >5 years following sepsis diagnosis: thyroid, prostate, colon, rectum, lung, and liver and follicular lymphoma, melanoma, and AML. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis is associated with increased or decreased risks for a small group of cancers. Factors that may explain these associations include etiologic effects. Other associations may reflect the presence of precursor conditions or patterns in ascertainment of cancer and screening.","['Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of', 'America 2018.']","['Liu, Zhiwei', 'Mahale, Parag', 'Engels, Eric A']","['Liu Z', 'Mahale P', 'Engels EA']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Sepsis/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2018/07/10 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2018/07/09 06:00'],"['2018/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['5049133 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciy530 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2019 Feb 15;68(5):717-724. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciy530.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Surveillance Epidemiology End Results (SEER)-Medicare', '*cancers', '*elderly', '*sepsis']",5,,PMC6376110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of the balance in HSC self-renewal, death, and differentiation can have serious consequences such as myelodysplastic syndromes or leukemia. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the biologically active metabolite of vitamin A/RA, has been shown to have pleiotropic effects on hematopoietic cells, enhancing HSC self-renewal while also increasing differentiation of more mature progenitors. Furthermore, ATRA has been shown to have key roles in regulating the specification and formation of hematopoietic cells from pluripotent stem cells including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here, we summarize the known roles of vitamin A and RA receptors in the regulation of hematopoiesis from HSCs, ES, and iPSCs.","['Copyright (c) 2018 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

We assessed interactions of MRD status with HCT conditioning regimen intensity in patients aged <50 years (y) or >/=50y. This was a retrospective study by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry. Patients were >18y with AML CR1 MRD NEG/POS and recipients of HCT in 2000-2015. Conditioning regimens were myeloablative (MAC), reduced intensity (RIC) or non-myeloablative (NMA). Outcomes included leukemia free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), chronic graft-vs-host (cGVHD), and GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS). The 2292 eligible patients were categorized into four paired groups: <50y MRD POS MAC (N = 240) vs RIC/NMA (N = 58); <50y MRD NEG MAC (N = 665) vs RIC/NMA (N = 195); >/=50y MRD POS MAC (N = 126) vs RIC/NMA (N = 230), and >/=50y MRD NEG MAC (N = 223) vs RIC/NMA (N = 555). In multivariate analysis RIC/NMA was only inferior to MAC for patients in the <50y MRD POS group, with worse RI (HR 1.71) and LFS (HR 1.554). Patients <50Y MRD NEG had less cGVHD after RIC/NMA HCT (HR 0.714). GRFS was not significantly affected by conditioning intensity in any group. Patients aged <50y with AML CR1 MRD POS status should preferentially be offered MAC allo-HCT.

As a result, survival is poor, even for cancers considered 'curable'. With limited population-level data, understanding the actual burden and survival from childhood cancers in Africa is difficult. In this study, we aimed at providing survival estimates for the most common types of cancers affecting children aged 0-14 years, in three population-based Eastern African registries; Harare, Zimbabwe (Kaposi sarcoma, Wilms tumour (WT), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), retinoblastoma, and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL)), Kampala, Uganda (Burkitt lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, WT, and retinoblastoma), and Nairobi, Kenya (ALL, retinoblastoma, WT, Burkitt lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma). We included cases diagnosed within the years 1998-2009 and followed up till the end of 2011. We estimated the observed and relative survival at 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis. We studied 627 individual patient records. Median follow-up ranged from 2.2 months for children with Kaposi sarcoma in Harare to 30.2 months for children with ALL in Nairobi. The proportion of children lost to follow-up was highest in the first year after diagnosis. In Harare and Kampala, the 5-year relative survival was <46% for all cancer types. The 5-year relative survival was best for children in Nairobi, though with wider confidence intervals.

METHODS: Responses from persons aged 25 and older to the 1991 Long Form Census were linked to national mortality and cancer databases. First Nations- and non-Aboriginal-specific incidence rates were age-standardized to the world standard population. The sex- and site-specific relative risks (RR) of cancer in First Nations compared to those in non-Aboriginal adults were estimated with Poisson regression. Results were stratified by residence on-reserve (all cancers combined) and region of Canada (four most common cancer sites). RESULTS: Compared to non-Aboriginal adults, First Nations had higher incidence of colon and rectum, kidney, cervix, and liver cancers and lower incidence of prostate, breast, bladder, uterus, ovary, and brain cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and melanoma. First Nations women additionally had higher incidence of stomach, gallbladder, and laryngeal cancers and lower incidence of thyroid cancers compared to non-Aboriginal women. The higher relative incidence of stomach and gallbladder cancers was observed only among First Nations adults who reported living on-reserve. Incidence of lung cancer was similar for First Nations and non-Aboriginal adults nationally, though variation by region of Canada was observed. CONCLUSION: First Nations people in Canada have disproportionately high rates of certain cancers, providing evidence to support public health policy and programming. More research is needed to identify factors contributing to the significantly lower incidence observed for various cancer types. Novel methods for studying disparities in cancer incidence among First Nations people are required to support ongoing cancer control planning and advocacy.",,"['Mazereeuw, Maegan V', 'Withrow, Diana R', 'Diane Nishri, E', 'Tjepkema, Michael', 'Marrett, Loraine D']","['Mazereeuw MV', 'Withrow DR', 'Diane Nishri E', 'Tjepkema M', 'Marrett LD']","['Prevention and Cancer Control, Cancer Care Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

However, due to considerable genetic interindividual variability, TL varies substantially between individuals, limiting its use as a robust prognostic marker in individual patients. Here, we compared TL of BCR-ABL(-), nonleukemic CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow of CML patients at diagnosis to their individual BCR-ABL(+) leukemic stem cell (LSC) counterparts. We observed significantly accelerated telomere shortening in LSC compared with nonleukemic HSC. Interestingly, the degree of LSC telomere shortening was found to correlate significantly with the leukemic clone size. To validate the diagnostic value of nonleukemic cells as internal controls and to rule out effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment on these nontarget cells, we prospectively assessed TL in 134 PB samples collected in deep molecular remission after TKI treatment within the EURO-SKI study (NCT01596114). Here, no significant telomere shortening was observed in granulocytes compared with an age-adjusted control cohort. In conclusion, this study provides proof of principle for accelerated telomere shortening in LSC as opposed to HSC in CML patients at diagnosis. The fact that the degree of telomere shortening correlates with leukemic clone's size supports the use of TL in leukemic cells as a prognostic parameter pending prospective validation. TL in nonleukemic myeloid cells seems unaffected even by long-term TKI treatment arguing against a reduction of telomere-mediated replicative reserve in normal hematopoiesis under TKI treatment.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Bouillon, Anne-Sophie', 'Ventura Ferreira, Monica S', 'Awad, Shady Adnan', 'Richter, Johan', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Kunzmann, Volker', 'Dengler, Jolanta', 'Janssen, Jeroen', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert', 'Westerweel, Peter E', 'Te Boekhorst, Peter A W', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Hjorth-Hansen, Henrik', 'Isfort, Susanne', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Hummel, Sebastian', 'Schemionek, Mirle', 'Wilop, Stefan', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Beier, Fabian', 'Brummendorf, Tim H']","['Bouillon AS', 'Ventura Ferreira MS', 'Awad SA', 'Richter J', 'Hochhaus A', 'Kunzmann V', 'Dengler J', 'Janssen J', 'Ossenkoppele G', 'Westerweel PE', 'Te Boekhorst PAW', 'Mahon FX', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Isfort S', 'Fioretos T', 'Hummel S', 'Schemionek M', 'Wilop S', 'Koschmieder S', 'Saussele S', 'Mustjoki S', 'Beier F', 'Brummendorf TH']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Hematology Research Unit, Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Radiation Physics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Onkologische Schwerpunktpraxis, Heilbronn, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Haut-Leveque Hospital, Bordeaux University Hospital, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Hematology, St. Olavs Hospital, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden; and.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine III, University of Heidelberg at Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Hematology Research Unit, Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', '*Telomere Homeostasis']",2018/07/08 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/07/08 06:00'],"['2018/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018017772 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018017772 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Jul 10;2(13):1572-1579. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018017772.,,,13,,PMC6039661,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01596114'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify possible new monoclonal antibody (mAb) drugs and targets for CLL, we previously developed a phage display-based human mAb platform to mine the antibody repertoire of patients who responded to alloHSCT. We had selected a group of highly homologous post-alloHSCT mAbs that bound to an unknown CLL cell surface antigen. Here, we show through next-generation sequencing of cDNAs encoding variable heavy-chain domains that these mAbs had a relative abundance of approximately 0.1% in the post-alloHSCT antibody repertoire and were enriched approximately 1,000-fold after three rounds of selection on primary CLL cells. Based on differential RNA-seq and a cell microarray screening technology for discovering human cell surface antigens, we now identify their antigen as Siglec-6. We verified this finding by flow cytometry, ELISA, siRNA knockdown, and surface plasmon resonance. Siglec-6 was broadly expressed in CLL and could be a potential target for antibody-based therapeutic interventions.

The CMV-induced generation of highly differentiated adaptive-like NK cells has been proposed to affect favorably on the maintenance of remission in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). The impact of CMV infection and adaptive-like NK cells on relapse and survival of patients with AML not receiving allo-SCT remains unknown. We assayed CMV IgG serostatus to determine past CMV infection in 81 nontransplanted AML patients who were receiving relapse-prevention immunotherapy comprising histamine dihydrochloride and low-dose interleukin-2 (HDC/IL2; NCT01347996). CMV seropositivity correlated negatively with leukemia-free and overall survival of patients receiving HDC/IL2, but did not correlate with outcomes in a contemporary control cohort. Analysis of outcome after stratification of patients based on concordant or discordant killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and HLA genotypes implied that the negative impact of CMV seropositivity was restricted to patients lacking a ligand to inhibitory KIRs (iKIR). Previous CMV infection was also associated with fewer NK cells expressing only nonself iKIRs (NS-iKIR). We propose that CMV-driven NK cell education depletes the population of NS-iKIR NK cells, which in turn reduces the clinical benefit of relapse-preventive immunotherapy in AML.

AMG 211 was labeled with zirconium-89 ((89)Zr) or fluorescent dye to evaluate the tumor-targeting properties.Experimental Design: (89)Zr-AMG211 was administered to mice bearing CEA-positive xenograft tumors of LS174T colorectal adenocarcinoma or BT474 breast cancer cells, as well as CEA-negative HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia xenografts. Biodistribution studies with 2- to 10-mug (89)Zr-AMG211 supplemented with unlabeled AMG 211 up to 500-mug protein dose were performed. A BiTE that does not bind CEA, (89)Zr-Mec14, served as a negative control. (89)Zr-AMG211 integrity was determined in tumor lysates ex vivo Intratumoral distribution was studied with IRDye800CW-AMG211. Moreover, (89)Zr-AMG211 was manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines for clinical trial NCT02760199Results: (89)Zr-AMG211 demonstrated dose-dependent tumor uptake at 6 hours. The highest tumor uptake was observed with a 2-mug dose, and the lowest tumor uptake was observed with a 500-mug dose. After 24 hours, higher uptake of 10-mug (89)Zr-AMG211 occurred in CEA-positive xenografts, compared with CEA-negative xenografts. Although the blood half-life of (89)Zr-AMG211 was approximately 1 hour, tumor retention persisted for at least 24 hours. (89)Zr-Mec14 showed no tumor accumulation beyond background level. Ex vivo autoradiography revealed time-dependent disintegration of (89)Zr-AMG211. 800CW-AMG211 was specifically localized in CEA-expressing viable tumor tissue. GMP-manufactured (89)Zr-AMG211 fulfilled release specifications.Conclusions: (89)Zr-AMG211 showed dose-dependent CEA-specific tumor targeting and localization in viable tumor tissue.

The pattern of overexpression suggests that inhibition may be useful therapeutically. Inhibition of HOX protein binding to PBX cofactors by the use of synthetic peptides, such as HXR9, results in apoptosis in multiple cancers. METHODS: Activity of the HOX-PBX inhibiting peptide HXR9 was tested in immortalised normal oral (NOK), potentially-malignant (PMOL) and squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells, compared to the inactive peptide CXR9. Cytotoxicity was assessed by LDH assay. Expression of PBX1/2 and c-Fos was assessed by qPCR and western blotting. Apoptosis was assessed by Annexin-V assay. RESULTS: PMOL and OSCC cells expressed PBX1/2. HOX-PBX inhibition by HXR9 caused death of PMOL and OSCC cells, but not NOKs. HXR9 treatment resulted in apoptosis and increased expression of c-Fos in some cells, whereas CXR9 did not. A correlation was observed between HOX expression and resistance to HXR9. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of HOX-PBX interactions causes selective apoptosis of OSCC/PMOL, indicating selective toxicity that may be useful clinically.",,"['Platais, Christopher', 'Radhakrishnan, Raghu', 'Niklander Ebensperger, Sven', 'Morgan, Richard', 'Lambert, Daniel W', 'Hunter, Keith D']","['Platais C', 'Radhakrishnan R', 'Niklander Ebensperger S', 'Morgan R', 'Lambert DW', 'Hunter KD']","['Integrated Biosciences, School of Clinical Dentistry, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.', 'Integrated Biosciences, School of Clinical Dentistry, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.', 'Integrated Biosciences, School of Clinical Dentistry, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.', 'Facultad de Odontologia, Universidad Andres Bello, av.

We considered acute stress disorder as the prototype for psychological disturbances following the acute onset of life-threatening disorders, showing that it occurred in one-third of patients after the diagnosis of acute leukemia. To treat and prevent these symptoms, we developed Emotion and Symptom-focused Engagement (EASE), an integrated psychotherapeutic and early palliative intervention. We showed that EASE reduced both traumatic stress and physical suffering in these patients and a large multi-center trial is now underway. We also identified symptoms of depression and hopelessness n one quarter of patients with metastatic and advanced cancer, with worsening toward the end of life. To alleviate this distress, we developed a brief supportive-expressive therapy, referred to as Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM). We showed in a large RCT that CALM improves depression, distress related to dying and death, and preparation for the end of life. We have now launched a global initiative involving 20 sites to date across North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia to have CALM implemented routinely in cancer care. Such initiatives are needed to move psychosocial care in cancer from evidence to implementation and to fulfill the dream of Jimmie Holland that cancer care be as humanistic as it is effective.","['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Rodin, Gary']",['Rodin G'],"['Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180904,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Australia', 'Depression/complications/*therapy', '*Emotions', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/psychology/*therapy', 'Netherlands', 'Pain/*psychology', 'Pain Management', '*Psycho-Oncology', 'Psychotherapy/*methods', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Traumatic, Acute/psychology/*therapy', 'Stress, Psychological/etiology']",2018/07/07 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.4837 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2018 Oct;27(10):2310-2316. doi: 10.1002/pon.4837.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a master at manipulating of cellular processes, which enables life-long infection but can also lead to the induction of a variety of EBV-associated cancers. To identify new mechanisms by which EBV proteins alter cells, we screened a library of 51 EBV proteins for global effects on cellular SUMO1 and SUMO2 modifications (SUMOylation), identifying several proteins not previously known to manipulate this pathway. One EBV protein (BRLF1) globally induced the loss of SUMOylated proteins, in a proteasome-dependent manner, as well as the loss of promeylocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. However, unlike its homologue (Rta) in Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus, it did not appear to have ubiquitin ligase activity. In addition we identified the EBV SM protein as globally upregulating SUMOylation and showed that this activity was conserved in its homologues in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1 UL54/ICP27) and cytomegalovirus (CMV UL69). All three viral homologues were shown to bind SUMO and Ubc9 and to have E3 SUMO ligase activity in a purified system. These are the first SUMO E3 ligases discovered for EBV, HSV1 and CMV. Interestingly the homologues had different specificities for SUMO1 and SUMO2, with SM and UL69 preferentially binding SUMO1 and inducing SUMO1 modifications, and UL54 preferentially binding SUMO2 and inducing SUMO2 modifications. The results provide new insights into the function of this family of conserved herpesvirus proteins, and the conservation of this SUMO E3 ligase activity across diverse herpesviruses suggests the importance of this activity for herpesvirus infections.",,"['De La Cruz-Herrera, Carlos F', 'Shire, Kathy', 'Siddiqi, Umama Z', 'Frappier, Lori']","['De La Cruz-Herrera CF', 'Shire K', 'Siddiqi UZ', 'Frappier L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['153014/Canadian Institutes of Health Research /International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180706,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/*enzymology', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*enzymology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Sumoylation', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",2018/07/07 06:00,2019/01/15 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1007176 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-18-00329 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2018 Jul 6;14(7):e1007176. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1007176. eCollection 2018 Jul.,,,7,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0110-5472'],PMC6051671,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ET has a low frequency of leukemic transformation. Both secondary AML (sAML) from ET and AML with JAK2 V617F mutation have poor prognoses. Because of the low incidence of JAK2 mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the clinical features of AML with JAK2 mutation are rarely reported so far, either transformed from essential thrombocythemia (ET) or de novo AML. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this article, we present a pediatric AML patient with the JAK2 V617F mutation. DIAGNOSES: A diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia was made and sAML was ruled out. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent chemotherapy. OUTCOMES: In the first two complete remission periods, we found significantly increased numbers of platelets and bone marrow megakaryocytes, which are characteristic of ET. After the third chemotherapy phase, the disease relapsed; the platelet count was reduced and continued to decrease. When disease relapsed, her family abandoned treatment. LESSONS: These observations of our case raise two possibilities: either transient posttreatment thrombocythemia is a feature of AML with JAK2 V617F mutation, or this was a case of secondary AML.

Ibrutinib and idelalisib, which inhibit Bruton Tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phosphoinositol-3 (PI3) kinase-delta respectively, have become important treatment options for the disease and demonstrate the potential of targeting components of the B-cell receptor-signalling pathway. IBL-202 is a dual inhibitor of the PIM and PI3 kinases. Synergy between the pan-PIM inhibitor, pPIMi, and idelalisib against a range of haematological cell lines and primary CLL cells supports the rationale for preclinical studies of IBL-202 in CLL. Importantly, IBL-202, but not idelalisib, was cytotoxic against CLL cells under in vitro conditions that mimic the hypoxic tumour microenvironment. The significant effects of IBL-202 on CD49d and CXCR4 expression and migration, cycle and proliferation of CLL cells suggest the drug may also interfere with the migratory and proliferative capacity of the leukaemic cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that dual inhibition of the PIM and PI3 kinases by IBL-202 may be an effective strategy for targeting CLL cells, particularly within the environmental niches known to confer drug-resistance.",['(c) 2018 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Crassini, Kyle', 'Shen, Yandong', ""O'Dwyer, Michael"", ""O'Neill, Michael"", 'Christopherson, Richard', 'Mulligan, Stephen', 'Best, O Giles']","['Crassini K', 'Shen Y', ""O'Dwyer M"", ""O'Neill M"", 'Christopherson R', 'Mulligan S', 'Best OG']","['Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Molecular Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'National University of Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Inflection Biosciences Ltd, Dublin, Ireland.', 'School of Molecular Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Molecular Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Molecular Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180705,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Purines/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",2018/07/07 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15447 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Sep;182(5):654-669. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15447.

Therefore, there is a need to elucidate the role of HDACs in specific settings. The study of HDAC expression in childhood leukaemia could help to choose more specific HDACi for selected candidates in a personalized approach. We analysed HDAC1-11, SIRT1, SIRT7, MEF2C and MEF2D mRNA expression in 211 paediatric patients diagnosed with acute leukaemia. There was a global overexpression of HDACs, while specific HDACs correlated with clinical and biological features, and some even predicted outcome. Thus, some HDAC and MEF2C profiles probably reflected the lineage and the maturation of the blasts and some profiles identified specific oncogenic pathways active in the leukaemic cells. Specifically, we identified a distinctive signature for patients with KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement, with high HDAC9 and MEF2D expression, regardless of age, KMT2A partner and lineage. Moreover, we observed an adverse prognostic value of HDAC9 overexpression, regardless of KMT2A rearrangement.

The Wnt signaling pathway can be broadly divided into canonical and non-canonical pathways. In the present study, we investigated the pathobiology of leukemia by studying the expression profile of Wnt proteins, receptors, key signaling intermediates and endogenous Wnt antagonist involved in canonical and non-canonical pathways in the bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment of experimental leukemic mice. Cell adhesion molecule N-Cadherin and leukemic BM microenvironment with reference to Wnt were also studied. We used ENU, a potent carcinogen, to induce leukemia in wild type Swiss albino mice and malignant transformation was cofirmed by peripheral blood and BM studies. Flow cytometric expression analysis revealed profound up-regulation of canonical Wnt3a/beta-catenin/CyclinD1 signaling axis along with N-Cadherin whereas down-regulation of non-canonical Wnt5a/Ca(2+)/CaMKII signaling axis in the leukemic HSPC compartment. Subsequent use of anti-Wnt3a antibody in the in vitro clonogenicity assay uncovered that anti-Wnt3a antibody preferentially inhibited the growth and number of the primitive leukemic hematopoietic CFU-GEMM and BFU-E colonies. Stromal cells derived from the leukemic BM also exhibited aberrant Wnt3a and Wnt5a protein expression. Taken together, alteration of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways in the HSPC compartment along with classical Wnt protein expression pattern in the leukemic stromal microenvironment resulted in progression of leukemia.",,"['Chattopadhyay, Sukalpa', 'Chaklader, Malay', 'Law, Sujata']","['Chattopadhyay S', 'Chaklader M', 'Law S']","['Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, 108, C.R.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, course, and outcome of CDI in children treated for malignancy or undergoing HSCT. Between 2012 and 2015, a total number of 1846 patients were treated for malignancy in Polish pediatric oncological centers (PHO group) and 342 underwent transplantation (HSCT group). In PHO group, episodes of CDI occurred in 210 patients (14%). The incidence of CDI was higher in patients with hematological malignancies in comparison to that with solid tumors. Patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia had shorter time to episode of CDI than those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients over 5 years and treated for acute leukemia had more severe clinical course of disease in PHO group. In HSCT group, CDI occurred in 29 (8%) patients. The incidence of CDI was higher in patients transplanted for acute leukemia. The recurrence rate was 14.7% in PHO and 20.7% in HSCT patients.

In total, the disease status at HCT was first complete remission (CR1) in 159 (49%) patients. The probability of overall survival and the cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years were 44 and 44%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, disease status beyond CR1 at the time of HCT was significantly associated with a higher overall mortality and relapse. The 11q23 fusion partner did not have a significant impact on survival. We also evaluated the prognostic value of minimal residual disease (MRD) status at HCT on transplant outcomes among hematological CR patients. MRD status at HCT was the significant prognostic indicator for hematological relapse and survival. These data suggested that allo-HCT offered a curative option for adult AML with 11q23 abnormality.

Methods: Ninety-two AL patients with EBSI from 2010 to 2015 were included. Enterococcal bloodstream infection was defined by 31 positive blood cultures for Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis and fever, hypotension, or chills. Clearance was defined by 31 negative cultures 324 hours after last positive culture and defervescence. Recurrent enterococcal bloodstream infection was defined by a positive blood culture for Enterococcus 324 hours after clearance. Categorical variables were reported as proportions and compared by the chi(2) test. Continuous variables were summarized by median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test. P values <.05 were considered significant. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on available paired BSI isolates from 7 patients. Results: Twenty-four patients (26%) had 31 episodes of R-EBSI. Median time to R-EBSI (IQR) was 26 (13-50) days. Patients with R-EBSI had significantly longer durations of fever and metronidazole exposure during their index EBSI. Thirty-nine percent of E. faecium R-EBSI isolates became daptomycin-nonsusceptible Enterococcus (DNSE) following daptomycin therapy for index EBSI. Whole-genome sequencing analysis confirmed high probability of genetic relatedness of index EBSI and R-EBSI isolates for 4/7 patients. Conclusions: Recurrent enterococcal bloodstream infection and DNSE are common in patients with AL and tend to occur within the first 30 days of index EBSI. Duration of fever and metronidazole exposure may be useful in determining risk for R-EBSI. Whole-genome sequencing analysis demonstrates that the same strain causes both EBSI and R-EBSI in some patients.",,"['Messina, Julia A', 'Sinha, Rohita', 'Starr, Kimberly', 'Arshad, Mehreen', 'Alexander, Barbara D', 'Chao, Nelson J', 'Sung, Anthony D']","['Messina JA', 'Sinha R', 'Starr K', 'Arshad M', 'Alexander BD', 'Chao NJ', 'Sung AD']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapies, Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Department of Food Science and Technology, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Nebraska, Nebraska.', 'Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['KL2 TR001115/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG028716/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD018164/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI100851/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20180505,United States,Open Forum Infect Dis,Open forum infectious diseases,101637045,,,,2018/07/07 06:00,2018/07/07 06:01,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/ofid/ofy107 [doi]', 'ofy107 [pii]']",epublish,Open Forum Infect Dis. 2018 May 5;5(6):ofy107. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofy107. eCollection 2018 Jun.,['NOTNLM'],"['Enterococcus', 'acute leukemia', 'daptomycin-nonsusceptible Enterococcus', 'recurrent bloodstream infection', 'whole-genome sequencing']",6,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6411-198X'],PMC6016419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ewing sarcoma is a highly aggressive cancer, with a survival of 70-80% for patients with standard-risk and localized disease and ~30% for those with metastatic disease. Treatment comprises local surgery, radiotherapy and polychemotherapy, which are associated with acute and chronic adverse effects that may compromise quality of life in survivors. Histologically, Ewing sarcomas are composed of small round cells expressing high levels of CD99. Genetically, they are characterized by balanced chromosomal translocations in which a member of the FET gene family is fused with an ETS transcription factor, with the most common fusion being EWSR1-FLI1 (85% of cases). Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 protein (EWSR1)-Friend leukaemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI1) is a tumour-specific chimeric transcription factor (EWSR1-FLI1) with neomorphic effects that massively rewires the transcriptome. Additionally, EWSR1-FLI1 reprogrammes the epigenome by inducing de novo enhancers at GGAA microsatellites and by altering the state of gene regulatory elements, creating a unique epigenetic signature. Additional mutations at diagnosis are rare and mainly involve STAG2, TP53 and CDKN2A deletions. Emerging studies on the molecular mechanisms of Ewing sarcoma hold promise for improvements in early detection, disease monitoring, lower treatment-related toxicity, overall survival and quality of life.",,"['Grunewald, Thomas G P', 'Cidre-Aranaz, Florencia', 'Surdez, Didier', 'Tomazou, Eleni M', 'de Alava, Enrique', 'Kovar, Heinrich', 'Sorensen, Poul H', 'Delattre, Olivier', 'Dirksen, Uta']","['Grunewald TGP', 'Cidre-Aranaz F', 'Surdez D', 'Tomazou EM', 'de Alava E', 'Kovar H', 'Sorensen PH', 'Delattre O', 'Dirksen U']","['Max-Eder Research Group for Pediatric Sarcoma Biology, Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany. thomas.gruenewald@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany. thomas.gruenewald@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium, partner site Munich, Munich, Germany. thomas.gruenewald@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. thomas.gruenewald@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Max-Eder Research Group for Pediatric Sarcoma Biology, Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany. florencia.cidre_aranaz@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany. florencia.cidre_aranaz@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium, partner site Munich, Munich, Germany. florencia.cidre_aranaz@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. florencia.cidre_aranaz@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'INSERM U830, Equipe Labellise LNCC, PSL Universite, SIREDO Oncology Centre, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", 'Institute of Biomedicine of Seville, Virgen del Rocio University Hospital/CSIC/University of Seville/CIBERONC, Seville, Spain.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'British Columbia Cancer Research Centre and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'INSERM U830, Equipe Labellise LNCC, PSL Universite, SIREDO Oncology Centre, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cooperative Ewing Sarcoma Study group, Essen University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, partner site Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],['V 506/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180705,England,Nat Rev Dis Primers,Nature reviews.

Genome-wide association studies have shown variation at 14q11.2 influences ALL risk. We sought to decipher causal variant(s) at 14q11.2 and the mechanism of tumorigenesis. We show rs2239630 G>A resides in the promoter of the CCAT enhancer-binding protein epsilon (CEBPE) gene. The rs2239630-A risk allele is associated with increased promotor activity and CEBPE expression. Depletion of CEBPE in ALL cells reduces cell growth, correspondingly CEBPE binds to the promoters of electron transport and energy generation genes. RNA-seq in CEBPE depleted cells demonstrates CEBPE regulates the expression of genes involved in B-cell development (IL7R), apoptosis (BCL2), and methotrexate resistance (RASS4L). CEBPE regulated genes significantly overlapped in CEBPE depleted cells, ALL blasts and IGH-CEBPE translocated ALL. This suggests CEBPE regulates a similar set of genes in each, consistent with a common biological mechanism of leukemogenesis for rs2239630 associated and CEBPE translocated ALL.

Mutations in CSF3R (encoding G-CSFR) have been reported in patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, despite years of research, the malignant downstream signaling of the mutated G-CSFRs is not well understood. Here, we used a quantitative phospho-tyrosine analysis to generate a comprehensive signaling map of G-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation in the normal versus mutated (proximal: T618I and truncated: Q741x) G-CSFRs. Unbiased clustering and kinase enrichment analysis identified rapid induction of phospho-proteins associated with endocytosis by the wild type G-CSFR only; while G-CSFR mutants showed abnormal kinetics of canonical Stat3, Stat5, and Mapk phosphorylation, and aberrant activation of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (Btk). Mutant-G-CSFR-expressing cells displayed enhanced sensitivity (3-5-fold lower IC50) for ibrutinib-based chemical inhibition of Btk. Primary murine progenitor cells from G-CSFR-Q741x knock-in mice validated activation of Btk by the mutant receptor and retrovirally transduced human CD34(+) umbilical cord blood cells expressing mutant receptors displayed enhanced sensitivity to Ibrutinib. A significantly lower clonogenic potential was displayed by both murine and human primary cells expressing mutated receptors upon ibrutinib treatment.

Although they were once considered ""undruggable,"" the recent advances in screening strategies, structure-based design, and elucidating the nature of hot spots on PPI interfaces, have led to the discovery and development of successful small-molecule inhibitors. In this report, we are describing an integrated high-throughput and computational screening approach to enable the discovery of small-molecule PPI inhibitors of the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1. Applying this strategy, followed by biochemical, biophysical, and biological characterization, nineteen new chemical scaffolds were discovered and validated as Mcl-1 inhibitors. A novel series of Mcl-1 inhibitors was designed and synthesized based on the identified difuryl-triazine core scaffold and structure-activity studies were undertaken to improve the binding affinity to Mcl-1. Compounds with improved in vitro binding potency demonstrated on-target activity in cell-based studies. The obtained results demonstrate that structure-based analysis complements the experimental high-throughput screening in identifying novel PPI inhibitor scaffolds and guides follow-up medicinal chemistry efforts. Furthermore, our work provides an example that can be applied to the analysis of available screening data against numerous targets in the PubChem BioAssay Database, leading to the identification of promising lead compounds, fuelling drug discovery pipelines.",,"['Mady, Ahmed S A', 'Liao, Chenzhong', 'Bajwa, Naval', 'Kump, Karson J', 'Abulwerdi, Fardokht A', 'Lev, Katherine L', 'Miao, Lei', 'Grigsby, Sierrah M', 'Perdih, Andrej', 'Stuckey, Jeanne A', 'Du, Yuhong', 'Fu, Haian', 'Nikolovska-Coleska, Zaneta']","['Mady ASA', 'Liao C', 'Bajwa N', 'Kump KJ', 'Abulwerdi FA', 'Lev KL', 'Miao L', 'Grigsby SM', 'Perdih A', 'Stuckey JA', 'Du Y', 'Fu H', 'Nikolovska-Coleska Z']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Interdepartmental Graduate Program in Medicinal Chemistry, University of Michigan, College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'School of Medical Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, Anhui, 230009, China.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, Lake Forest, IL, 60045, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Program in Chemical Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Interdepartmental Graduate Program in Medicinal Chemistry, University of Michigan, College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, 21702, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Molecular and Cellular Pathology Graduate Program, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'National Institute of Chemistry, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. zanetan@med.umich.edu.', 'Molecular and Cellular Pathology Graduate Program, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. zanetan@med.umich.edu.', 'Interdepartmental Graduate Program in Medicinal Chemistry, University of Michigan, College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. zanetan@med.umich.edu.', 'Program in Chemical Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. zanetan@med.umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['DGE1256260/NSF | EHR | Division of Graduate Education (DGE)/International', 'R01 CA149442/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM113900/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NS056915/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA217141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA140044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180705,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2018/07/07 06:00,2019/10/18 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-27899-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-27899-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jul 5;8(1):10210. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-27899-9.,,,1,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5669-9573', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5031-5698', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2362-7979']",PMC6033896,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural killer (NK) cell-based therapeutic strategies for AML show promise and we explore the NK cell lines, NK-92 and CD16(+) NK-92, as a treatment for AML. NK-92 has been tested in phase I clinical trials with minimal toxicity; irradiation prior to infusion prevents risk of engraftment. The CD16 negative NK-92 parental line was genetically modified to express the high affinity Fc gamma receptor, enabling antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which we utilized in combination with an anti-CD123 antibody to target leukemic stem cells. NK-92 was preferentially cytotoxic against leukemic stem and progenitor cells compared with bulk leukemia in in vitro assays, while CD16(+) NK-92 in combination with an anti-CD123 mAb mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against CD123(+) leukemic targets. Furthermore, NK-92 infusions (with or without prior irradiation) improved survival in a primary AML xenograft model. Mice xenografted with primary human AML cells had a superior survival when treated with irradiated CD16(+)NK-92 cells and an anti-CD123 monoclonal antibody (7G3) versus treatment with irradiated CD16(+)NK-92 cells combined with an isotype control antibody. In this proof-of-principle study, we show for the first time that a CD16(+)NK-92 cell line combined with an antibody that targets a leukemic stem cell antigen can lead to improved survival in a relevant pre-clinical model of AML.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Williams, Brent A', 'Wang, Xing-Hua', 'Leyton, Jeffrey V', 'Maghera, Sonam', 'Deif, Bishoy', 'Reilly, Raymond M', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Keating, Armand']","['Williams BA', 'Wang XH', 'Leyton JV', 'Maghera S', 'Deif B', 'Reilly RM', 'Minden MD', 'Keating A']","['Cell Therapy Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada brentw@uhnres.utoronto.ca brentwilliams.brent@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Cell Therapy Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiobiology, Universite de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.', 'Cell Therapy Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Cell Therapy Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Cell Therapy Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada.', 'Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180705,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (FCGR3B protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2018/07/07 06:00,2019/10/09 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.187385 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.187385 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Oct;103(10):1720-1729. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.187385.

The combined use of compounds targeting both the mutated FLT3 receptor and cellular p53 inhibitors might be a promising treatment option for this poor risk leukemia subset. We therefore assessed MDM2 and FLT3 inhibitors as well as cytotoxic compounds used for conventional induction treatment as single agents and in combination for their ability to induce apoptosis and cell death in leukemic cells. Acute myeloid leukemia cells represented all major morphologic and molecular subtypes with normal karyotype, including FLT3-ITD (>0.5) and FLT3 wild type, NPM1 mutant and NPM1 wild type, as well as TP53 mutant and TP53 wild type cell lines. Acute myeloid leukemia cells with mutated or deleted TP53 were resistant to MDM2- and FLT3-inhibitors. FLT3-ITD positive TP53 wild type acute myeloid leukemia cells were significantly more susceptible to FLT3-inhibitors than FLT3-ITD negative TP53 wild type cells. The presence of a NPM1 mutation reduced the susceptibility of TP53 wild type acute myeloid leukemia cells to the MDM2 inhibitor NVP-HDM201. Moreover, the combined use of MDM2- and FLT3-inhibitors was superior to single agent treatment, and the combination of midostaurin and NVP-HDM201 was as specific and effective against FLT3-ITD positive TP53 wild type cells as the combination of midostaurin with conventional induction therapy. In summary, the combined use of the MDM2 inhibitor NVP-HDM201 and the FLT3 inhibitor midostaurin was a most effective and specific treatment to target TP53 and NPM1 wild type acute myeloid leukemia cells with high allelic FLT3-ITD ratio. These data suggest that the combined use of NVP-HDM201 and midostaurin might be a promising treatment option particularly in FLT3-ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia relapsed or refractory to conventional therapy.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Seipel, Katja', 'Marques, Miguel A T', 'Sidler, Corinne', 'Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Seipel K', 'Marques MAT', 'Sidler C', 'Mueller BU', 'Pabst T']","['Department for Biomedical Research, University of Bern.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Switzerland.', 'Department for Biomedical Research, University of Bern.', 'Department for Biomedical Research, University of Bern.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Switzerland thomas.pabst@insel.ch.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180705,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Nucleophosmin', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2018/07/07 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.191650 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.191650 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Nov;103(11):1862-1872. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.191650.

BCR-ABL1 DNA PCR and RQ-PCR were monitored up to 24 months in 516 paired samples from 59 newly-diagnosed patients treated with first-line imatinib in the TIDEL-II study. In the first three months of treatment, BCR-ABL1 mRNA values declined more rapidly than DNA. By six months, the two measures aligned closely. The expression of BCR-ABL1 mRNA was normalized to cell number to generate an expression ratio. The expression of e13a2 BCR-ABL1 was lower than that of e14a2 transcripts at multiple time points during treatment. BCR-ABL1 DNA was quantifiable in 48% of samples with undetectable BCR-ABL1 mRNA, resulting in MRD being quantifiable for an additional 5-18 months (median 12 months). These parallel studies show for the first time that the rapid decline in BCR-ABL1 mRNA over the first three months of treatment is due to a reduction in both cell number and transcript level per cell, whereas beyond three months, falling levels of BCR-ABL1 mRNA are proportional to the depletion of leukemic cells.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Pagani, Ilaria S', 'Dang, Phuong', 'Kommers, Ivar O', 'Goyne, Jarrad M', 'Nicola, Mario', 'Saunders, Verity A', 'Braley, Jodi', 'White, Deborah L', 'Yeung, David T', 'Branford, Susan', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Ross, David M']","['Pagani IS', 'Dang P', 'Kommers IO', 'Goyne JM', 'Nicola M', 'Saunders VA', 'Braley J', 'White DL', 'Yeung DT', 'Branford S', 'Hughes TP', 'Ross DM']","['Cancer Theme, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Genetic and Molecular Pathology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Genetic and Molecular Pathology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Paediatrics, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'Health Sciences UniSA, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital and SA Pathology, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'Genetic and Molecular Pathology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Paediatrics, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital and SA Pathology, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia David.Ross@sa.gov.au.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia.', 'Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital and SA Pathology, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Flinders University and Medical Centre, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180705,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2018/07/07 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.189787 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.189787 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Dec;103(12):2026-2032. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.189787.

Patients received obinutuzumab 1000 mg alone or with chemotherapy (investigator's choice of fludarabine-cyclophosphamide for fit patients, chlorambucil for unfit patients, or bendamustine for any patient) on days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1, and day 1 of cycles 2-6 (28-day cycles), with the cycle 1/day 1 dose administered over two days. The primary end point was safety/tolerability. Between October 2013 and March 2016, 972 patients were enrolled and 971 treated (126 with obinutuzumab monotherapy, 193 with obinutuzumab-fludarabine-cyclophosphamide, 114 with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil, and 538 with obinutuzumab-bendamustine).

Using expanded definitions, infusion-related reactions were observed in 65.4% of patients (grade >/=3, 19.9%; mainly seen during the first obinutuzumab infusion), tumor lysis syndrome in 6.4% [clinical and laboratory; highest incidence with obinutuzumab-bendamustine (9.3%)], and infections in 53.7% (grade >/=3, 20.1%). Serious and fatal adverse events were seen in 53.1% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. In first-line patients, overall response rates at three months post treatment exceeded 80% for all obinutuzumab-chemotherapy combinations.

These cases often demonstrate atypical morphological and immunophenotypic features, high proliferative rates, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes, and a high frequency of NOTCH1 mutation. Patients with +12 CLL have an intermediate prognosis, and show higher incidences of thrombocytopenia, Richter transformation, and other secondary cancers. Despite these important differences, relatively few transcriptional profiling studies have focused on identifying dysregulated pathways that characterize +12 CLL, and most have used a hierarchical cytogenetic classification in which cases with more than one recurrent abnormality are categorized according to the abnormality with the poorest prognosis. In this study, we sought to identify protein-coding genes whose expression contributes to the unique pathophysiology of +12 CLL. To exclude the likely confounding effects of multiple cytogenetic abnormalities on gene expression, our +12 patient cohort had +12 as the sole abnormality. We profiled samples obtained from 147 treatment-naive patients. We compared cases with +12 as the only cytogenetic abnormality to cases with only del(13q), del(11q), or diploid cytogenetics using independent discovery (n=97) and validation (n=50) sets. We demonstrate that CLL cases with +12 as the sole abnormality express a unique set of activated pathways compared to other cytogenetic subtypes.

Computerized tomography is a common source of low-dose radiation. In this study, we examined the magnitude of the risk of childhood leukemia after pediatric computed tomography examinations. We evaluated the association of computed tomography scans with risk of childhood leukemia in a nationwide register-based case-control study. Cases (n=1,093) were identified from the population-based Finnish Cancer Registry and three controls, matched by gender and age, were randomly selected for each case from the Population Registry. Information was also obtained on birth weight, maternal smoking, parental socioeconomic status and background gamma radiation. Data on computed tomography scans were collected from the ten largest hospitals in Finland, covering approximately 87% of all pediatric computed tomography scans. Red bone marrow doses were estimated with NCICT dose calculation software. The data were analyzed using exact conditional logistic regression analysis. A total of 15 cases (1.4%) and ten controls (0.3%) had undergone one or more computed tomography scans, excluding a 2-year latency period. For one or more computed tomography scans, we observed an odds ratio of 2.82 (95% confidence interval: 1.05 - 7.56). Cumulative red bone marrow dose from computed tomography scans showed an excess odds ratio of 0.13 (95% confidence interval: 0.02 - 0.26) per mGy. Our results are consistent with the notion that even low doses of ionizing radiation observably increase the risk of childhood leukemia.

While some of these cell lines (LAD1/2, LUVA, ROSA(KIT WT) and MCPV-1) do not harbor KIT mutations, HMC-1 and ROSA(KIT D816V) cells exhibit activating KIT mutations found in mastocytosis and have thus been used to study disease pathogenesis. In addition, these cell lines are increasingly employed to validate new therapeutic targets and to screen for effects of new targeted drugs. Recently, the ROSA(KIT D816V) subclone has been successfully used to generate a unique in vivo model of advanced mastocytosis by injection into immunocompromised mice. Such a model may allow in vivo validation of data obtained in vitro with targeted drugs directed against mastocytosis. In this review, we discuss the major characteristics of all available human mast cell lines, with particular emphasis on the use of HMC-1 and ROSA(KIT D816V) cells in preclinical therapeutic research in mastocytosis.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Arock, Michel', 'Wedeh, Ghaith', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Bibi, Siham', 'Akin, Cem', 'Peter, Barbara', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Hartmann, Karin', 'Butterfield, Joseph H', 'Metcalfe, Dean D', 'Valent, Peter']","['Arock M', 'Wedeh G', 'Hoermann G', 'Bibi S', 'Akin C', 'Peter B', 'Gleixner KV', 'Hartmann K', 'Butterfield JH', 'Metcalfe DD', 'Valent P']","['LBPA CNRS UMR8113, Ecole Normale Superieure Paris-Saclay, Cachan, France arock@ens-cachan.fr.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.', 'LBPA CNRS UMR8113, Ecole Normale Superieure Paris-Saclay, Cachan, France.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'LBPA CNRS UMR8113, Ecole Normale Superieure Paris-Saclay, Cachan, France.', 'Michigan Medicine Allergy Clinic, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Luebeck, Germany.', 'Mayo Clinic, Division of Allergic Diseases, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180705,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Mast Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Mastocytosis, Systemic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Models, Biological']",2018/07/07 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.195867 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.195867 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Nov;103(11):1760-1771. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.195867.

Successful treatment-free remission was defined as no confirmed loss of deep molecular response. We recruited 96 Japanese patients, of whom 78 sustained a deep molecular response during the consolidation phase and were therefore eligible to discontinue nilotinib in the treatment-free remission phase; of these, 53 patients (67.9%; 95% confidence interval: 56.4-78.1%) remained free from molecular recurrence in the first 12 months. The estimated 3-year treatment-free survival was 62.8%. Nilotinib was readministered to all patients (n=29) who experienced a molecular recurrence during the treatment-free remission phase. After restarting treatment, rapid deep molecular response returned in 25 patients (86.2%), with 50% of patients achieving a deep molecular response within 3.5 months. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor withdrawal syndrome was reported in 11/78 patients during the early treatment-free remission phase. The treatment-free survival curve was significantly better in patients with undetectable molecular residual disease than in patients without (3-year treatment-free survival, 75.6 versus 48.6%, respectively; P=0.0126 by the log-rank test). There were no significant differences in treatment-free survival between subgroups based on tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment before the nilotinib consolidation phase, tyrosine kinase inhibitor-withdrawal syndrome, or absolute number of natural killer cells. The results of this study indicate that it is safe and feasible to stop tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who have achieved a sustained deep molecular response with 2 years of treatment with nilotinib.

Endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) is a replication-defective provirus found in species belonging to the Felis genus, which includes the domestic cat (Felis catus). There have been few studies examining interaction between enFeLV genotype and FeLV progression. We examined point-in-time enFeLV and FeLV viral loads, as well as occurrence of FeLV/enFeLV recombinants (FeLV-B), to determine factors relating to clinical disease in a closed breeding colony of cats during a natural infection of FeLV. Coinfections with feline foamy virus (FFV), feline gammaherpesvirus 1 (FcaGHV-1), and feline coronavirus (FCoV) were also documented and analyzed for impact on cat health and FeLV disease. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling techniques were used to measure interactions among disease parameters. Progressive FeLV disease and FeLV-B presence were associated with higher FeLV proviral and plasma viral loads. Female cats were more likely to have progressive disease and FeLV-B. Conversely, enFeLV copy number was higher in male cats and negatively associated with progressive FeLV disease. Males were more likely to have abortive FeLV disease. FFV proviral load was found to correlate positively with higher FeLV proviral and plasma viral load, detection of FeLV-B, and FCoV status. Male cats were much more likely to be infected with FcaGHV-1 than female cats. This analysis provides insights into the interplay between endogenous and exogenous FeLV during naturally occurring disease and reveals striking variation in the infection patterns among four chronic viral infections of domestic cats.IMPORTANCE Endogenous retroviruses are harbored by many animals, and their interactions with exogenous retroviral infections have not been widely studied. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a relevant model system to examine this question, as endogenous and exogenous forms of the virus exist. In this analysis of a large domestic cat breeding colony naturally infected with FeLV, we documented that enFeLV copy number was higher in males and inversely related to FeLV viral load and associated with better FeLV disease outcomes. Females had lower enFeLV copy numbers and were more likely to have progressive FeLV disease and FeLV-B subtypes. FFV viral load was correlated with FeLV progression. FFV, FcaGHV-1, and FeLV displayed markedly different patterns of infection with respect to host demographics. This investigation revealed complex coinfection outcomes and viral ecology of chronic infections in a closed population.",['Copyright (c) 2018 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Powers, Jordan A', 'Chiu, Elliott S', 'Kraberger, Simona J', 'Roelke-Parker, Melody', 'Lowery, Isabella', 'Erbeck, Katelyn', 'Troyer, Ryan', 'Carver, Scott', 'VandeWoude, Sue']","['Powers JA', 'Chiu ES', 'Kraberger SJ', 'Roelke-Parker M', 'Lowery I', 'Erbeck K', 'Troyer R', 'Carver S', 'VandeWoude S']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.', 'Frederick National Laboratory of Cancer Research, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Tasmania, Sandy Bay, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA sue.vandewoude@colostate.edu.']",['eng'],"['F30 OD023386/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 OD012201/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180829,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Breeding', 'Cats', 'Chronic Disease/veterinary', 'Coinfection/*veterinary/virology', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Feline/*virology', 'Male', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*veterinary', 'Viral Load']",2018/07/07 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00649-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00649-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Aug 29;92(18). pii: JVI.00649-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00649-18.

The EBV genome persists in infected host cells as a chromatinized episome and is subject to chromatin-mediated regulation. Binding of the host insulator protein CTCF to the EBV genome has an established role in maintaining viral latency type. CTCF is posttranslationally modified by the host enzyme PARP1. PARP1, or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, catalyzes the transfer of a poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) moiety from NAD(+) onto acceptor proteins, including itself, histone proteins, and CTCF. PARylation of CTCF by PARP1 can affect CTCF's insulator activity, DNA binding capacity, and ability to form chromatin loops. Both PARP1 and CTCF have been implicated in the regulation of EBV latency and lytic reactivation. Thus, we predicted that pharmacological inhibition with PARP1 inhibitors would affect EBV latency type through a chromatin-specific mechanism. Here, we show that PARP1 and CTCF colocalize at specific sites throughout the EBV genome and provide evidence to suggest that PARP1 acts to stabilize CTCF binding and maintain the open chromatin landscape at the active Cp promoter during type III latency. Further, PARP1 activity is important in maintaining latency type-specific viral gene expression. The data presented here provide a rationale for the use of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of EBV-associated cancers exhibiting type III latency and ultimately could contribute to an EBV-specific treatment strategy for AIDS-related or posttransplant lymphomas.IMPORTANCE EBV is a human gammaherpesvirus that infects more than 95% of individuals worldwide. Upon infection, EBV circularizes as an episome and establishes a chronic, latent infection in B cells. In doing so, the virus utilizes host cell machinery to regulate and maintain the viral genome. In otherwise healthy individuals, EBV infection is typically nonpathological; however, latent infection is potentially oncogenic and is responsible for 1% of human cancers. During latent infection, EBV expresses specific sets of proteins according to the given latency type, each of which is associated with specific types of cancers. For example, type III latency, in which the virus expresses its full repertoire of latent proteins, is characteristic of AIDS-associated and posttransplant lymphomas associated with EBV infection. Understanding how viral latency type is regulated at the chromatin level may reveal potential targets for EBV-specific pharmacological intervention in EBV-associated cancers.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Lupey-Green et al.'],"['Lupey-Green, Lena N', 'Caruso, Lisa B', 'Madzo, Jozef', 'Martin, Kayla A', 'Tan, Yinfei', 'Hulse, Michael', 'Tempera, Italo']","['Lupey-Green LN', 'Caruso LB', 'Madzo J', 'Martin KA', 'Tan Y', 'Hulse M', 'Tempera I']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA tempera@temple.edu.']",['eng'],['R01 AI130209/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180829,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)']",IM,"['CCCTC-Binding Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genome, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/virology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Latency/drug effects/*genetics']",2018/07/07 06:00,2018/09/11 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00755-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00755-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2018 Aug 29;92(18). pii: JVI.00755-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00755-18.

Sequence similarity between Fv1 and the gag protein of the murine endogenous retrovirus L (MuERV-L) family of ERVs suggests that Fv1 was coopted from an ancient provirus. Previous evolutionary studies found Fv1 orthologs only in the genus Mus Here, we describe identification of orthologous Fv1 sequences in several species belonging to multiple families of rodents outside the genus Mus We show that these Fv1 orthologs are in the same region of conserved synteny, between the genes Miip and Mfn2, suggesting a minimum insertion time of 45 million years for the ancient progenitor of Fv1 Our analysis also revealed that Fv1 was not detectable or heavily mutated in some lineages in the superfamily Muroidea, while, in concert with previous findings in the genus Mus, we found strong evidence of positive selection of Fv1 in the African clade in the subfamily Muridae Residues identified as evolving under positive selection include those that have been previously found to be important for restriction of multiple retroviral lineages. Taken together, these findings suggest that the evolutionary origin of Fv1 substantially predates Mus evolution, that the rodent Fv1 has been shaped by lineage-specific differential selection pressures, and that Fv1 has long been evolving under positive selection in the rodent family Muridae, supporting a defensive role that significantly antedates exposure to MLVs.IMPORTANCE Retroviruses have adapted to living in concert with their hosts throughout vertebrate evolution. Over the years, the study of these relationships revealed the presence of host proteins called restriction factors that inhibit retroviral replication in host cells. The first of these restriction factors to be identified, encoded by the Fv1 gene found in mice, was thought to have originated in the genus Mus In this study, we utilized genome database searches and DNA sequencing to identify Fv1 copies in multiple rodent lineages. Our findings suggest a minimum time of insertion into the genome of rodents of 45 million years for the ancestral progenitor of Fv1 While Fv1 is not detectable in some lineages, we also identified full-length orthologs showing signatures of a molecular ""arms race"" in a family of rodent species indigenous to Africa.

Here, a newly developed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-based method was evaluated regarding its ability to quantify such heterogeneously methylated epialleles with sufficient analytical sensitivity and specificity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA from blood leukocytes and bone marrow aspirate of an 8-year old male with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and from normal and malignant prostate cell lines were analysed using ddPCR. RESULTS: By using these DNA samples, the specificity of an applied set of fluorescence-labeled probes was demonstrated as a proof of concept. CONCLUSION: All individual heterogeneously-methylated epialleles were quantifiable by a set of fluorescence-labeled probes with complementary sequences to epialleles in a closed-tube and high-throughput manner. The new method named epiallele-sensitive droplet digital PCR (EAST-ddPCR) may give new insights in the generation and regulation of epialleles and may help in finding new biomarkers for the diagnosis of benign und malignant diseases.","['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Menschikowski, Mario', 'Jandeck, Carsten', 'Friedemann, Markus', 'Richter, Susan', 'Thiem, Dana', 'Lange, Bjorn Sonke', 'Suttorp, Meinolf']","['Menschikowski M', 'Jandeck C', 'Friedemann M', 'Richter S', 'Thiem D', 'Lange BS', 'Suttorp M']","['Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital ""Carl Gustav Carus"", Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany Mario.Menschikowski@uniklinikum-dresden.de.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital ""Carl Gustav Carus"", Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital ""Carl Gustav Carus"", Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital ""Carl Gustav Carus"", Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital ""Carl Gustav Carus"", Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital ""Carl Gustav Carus"", Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital ""Carl Gustav Carus"", Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PLA2R1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Phospholipase A2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'DNA/analysis/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prostate/*metabolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Phospholipase A2/genetics']",2018/07/07 06:00,2018/11/13 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['15/4/299 [pii]', '10.21873/cgp.20088 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2018 Jul-Aug;15(4):299-312. doi: 10.21873/cgp.20088.,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Digital PCR', 'heterogeneously methylated epialleles', 'leukemia', 'prostate cancer cells']",4,,PMC6070704,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulated miRNAs may be overlapping in different cells and can be secreted to circulation. We chose miRNAs which were previously reported to be differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with GD with different disease stage, detected the expression of those miRNAs in serum, corroborated the findings in thyroid tissue, and validated the target gene in vitro to investigate the possible role of circulating miRNAs in GD. METHODS: A total of 54 individuals with untreated GD, 12 individuals with GD in remission and 14 disease-free controls were enrolled. The expression of miR-142-3p, miR-154-3p, miR-431-3p, miR-590-5p, and let-7b was detected in the serum. Ten thyroid tissue samples from patients with GD and six disease-free thyroid samples were used for further validation. The potential target genes were identified and validated in vitro. RESULTS: miR-142-3p, miR-154-3p, miR-431-3p, miR-590-5p, and let-7b were present in serum and two of them (miR-142-3p and let-7b) were significantly increased in serum of patients with untreated GD (for serum miR-142-3p, P = 0.033, for serum let-7b, P = 0.026) and gradually decreased to normal levels in patients with GD in remission. Correlation analysis showed that let-7b level was strongly correlated with TRAb level (r = 0.305, P = 0.001). let-7b directly inhibited promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) expression and increased the expression of TSHR in thyroid cells in vitro. Furthermore, let-7b levels in GD thyroid tissue were found to be inversely correlated with PLZF levels (r = - 0.849, P = 0.033). Decreased PLZF and increased TSHR was validated in thyroid tissue in patients with GD. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirmed that a portion of miRNAs in PBMCs were also presented and differentially expressed in serum and thyroid tissue. Upregulated in all these three compartments, let-7b may be used as a disease biomarker and therapeutic targets in patients with GD. Circulating let-7b had a strong correlation with disease severity and let-7b may participate in the production of TRAb via targeting PLZF in patients with GD.",,"['Chen, Xinxin', 'Huang, Fengjiao', 'Qi, Yicheng', 'Zhou, Mengxi', 'Yin, Qinglei', 'Peng, Ying', 'Zhou, Yulin', 'Ning, Guang', 'Wang, Shu']","['Chen X', 'Huang F', 'Qi Y', 'Zhou M', 'Yin Q', 'Peng Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Ning G', 'Wang S']","[""Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School, 197 Ruijin 2nd Road, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School, 197 Ruijin 2nd Road, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School, 197 Ruijin 2nd Road, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School, 197 Ruijin 2nd Road, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School, 197 Ruijin 2nd Road, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School, 197 Ruijin 2nd Road, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School, 197 Ruijin 2nd Road, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School, 197 Ruijin 2nd Road, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School, 197 Ruijin 2nd Road, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China. shuwang999@hotmail.com.""]",['eng'],['81570707/the National Natural Science Foundation of China/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180705,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Thyrotropin)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Graves Disease/*blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thyrotropin/*immunology', 'Thyroid Gland/*metabolism']",2018/07/07 06:00,2019/06/15 06:00,['2018/07/07 06:00'],"['2018/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-018-1565-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-018-1565-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2018 Jul 5;16(1):188. doi: 10.1186/s12967-018-1565-9.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Circulating miRNAs', ""*Graves' disease"", '*Let-7b', '*Thyrotropin receptor antibody']",1,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1109-2073'],PMC6034229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to evaluate the effect of thalidomide plus chemotherapy on elderly patients with AML. METHODS: 70 elderly AML patients (median age 71 years) were enrolled into this prospective study and randomly assigned to either the control arm (PC, n = 35) or the investigational arm (TPC, n = 35). Patients in the PC arm received a non-intensive regimen composed of cytarabine, aclarubicin and G-CSF (CAG) chemotherapy for induction of remission, and patients in the TPC arm received in addition thalidomide at a maximum dose of 200 mg/day. RESULTS: After 2 courses of induction therapy, complete response rate of TPC and PC arms was 54.3% and 57.1%, respectively (p = 0.810). At the last follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimate showed that the median overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in patients in the PC arm was inferior to those of patients in the TPC arm. Using a stratified Cox model adjusted for randomized treatment, patients receiving thalidomide plus chemotherapy were shown to derive some survival benefit in both OS and EFS. Overall, the hematological and non-hematological toxicity were similar between the 2 treatment arms.

The aim of this study is to unravel the miR-137-mediated regulatory mechanism of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) in TNBC. METHODS: A corhort of 34 TNBC tumor tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues, as well as 25 non-TNBC tumor tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues were collected post-operatively from patients with breast cancer. Q-PCR was performed to determine the mRNA levels of miR-137 and BCL11A in breast tissues and cell lines. Bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter assay were used to verify the direct interaction between miR-137 and BCL11A. After up-/down-regulation of BCL11A, miR-137, or DNMT1 via lentiviral transduction in TNBC cell lines SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells, Q-PCR and Western blot assays were used to detect the expression levels of BCL11A, DNA methyltransferases 1 (DNMT1), and Islet-1 (ISL1). Mammosphere assay was conducted to assess tumorosphere formation ability of cells, coupled with flow cytometry to determine the percentage of breast cancer stem cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to determine the interaction between BCL11A and DNMT1. Xenograft tumorigenesis assay was performed to monitor tumor formation in vivo. RESULTS: BCL11A was highly expressed in TNBC, whereas miR-137 was significantly lower in both TNBC tissues and cell lines. miR-137 suppressed BCL11A expression at both mRNA and protein levels by directly targeting its 3'UTR. In both SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells, overexpression of miR-137 or knockdown of BCL11A reduced the number of tumoroshperes and the percentage of cancer stem cells in vitro, and inhibited tumor development in vivo. Furthermore, BCL11A interacted with DNMT1 in TNBC cells. Silencing of either BCL11A or DNMT1 impaired cancer stemness and tumorigenesis of TNBC via suppressing ISL1 expression both in vitro, and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: By perturbing BCL11A-DNMT1 interaction, miR-137 impairs cancer stemness and suppresses tumor development in TNBC.","['(c) 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center cohort study in HSCT recipients. Primary outcomes were adjusted cost and all-cause mortality. Secondary analyses investigated CMV risk factors and the effect of serostatus. RESULTS: Overall, 690 transplant episodes were included (allogeneic [n = 310]; autologous [n = 380]). All received preemptive CMV antiviral therapy at first detectable DNAemia. CMV-I occurred in 34.8% of allogeneic and 2.1% of autologous transplants; median time to onset was 45 days. In allogeneic HSCT recipients, the primary risk factor for CMV-I was CMV donor/recipient (D/R) serostatus. In a Markov multi-state model for allogeneic HSCT recipients, the hazard ratio for CMV-I and relapse was 1.5 (95% CI 0.8-2.8) and for CMV-I and mortality 2.4 (95% CI 0.9-6.5). In a multivariable model for all patients, CMV-I was associated with increased total cost (coefficient = 0.21, estimated incremental daily cost USD $500; P = 0.02). Cost was attenuated in allogeneic HSCT recipients (coefficient = 0.13, USD $699 vs $613, or $24 892 per transplant episode; P = 0.23). CMV disease (CMV-D) complicated 29.6% of CMV-I events in allogeneic HSCT recipients, but was not associated with an incrementally increased adjusted risk of mortality compared with CMV-I alone.

METHODS: The study population included adult patients with haematological malignancies who received posaconazole delayed-release tablets for prophylaxis of IFIs after induction chemotherapy for acute leukaemia or graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) complicating hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the period January 2016-December 2017. RESULTS: Sixty-six consecutive patients with 176 posaconazole Cmin were included for evaluation in the study. Subtherapeutic posaconazole concentrations (< 0.7 mg l(-1) ) were observed at least once in 33.3% of patients (22/66), and overall in 17.0% of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) episodes (30/176). At multilevel linear regression, use of PPIs (P = 0.008), use of intermediate or high dose steroids (>0.7 mg kg(-1) daily) (P = 0.022) and male gender (P = 0.025) were significantly associated with decreased Cmin , whereas time from starting therapy (P = 0.032) was associated with increased Cmin in our patient population.

In this study, we evaluate the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream signalling pathway in LMMHA-induced lung inflammatory responses. Our results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of PI3K or genetic deletion of Akt1 enhances neutrophil apoptosis, attenuates neutrophil influx into the lungs of mice and diminishes the expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as interleukin-6, keratinocyte cell-derived chemokine and pro-matrix metalloproteinase-9 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after intratracheal administration of LMMHA. More importantly, we found that PI3K/Akt1 participates in LMMHA-induced inflammatory responses, which are mainly mediated by the myeloid leukaemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1). Our study suggests that LMMHA induced significantly increased levels of inflammatory factors in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and activation of the PI3K/Akt1 pathway, which up-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and inhibits the activation of caspase-3, thereby suppressing neutrophil apoptosis to trigger lung inflammation.

Most people acquire HHV-6 primary infection early in life and reactivation may occur, most often in immunocompromised individuals, leading to various clinical manifestations. HHV-6 infected cells may be identified in lymph nodes in both reactive and neoplastic conditions. Cases were retrieved from the hematopathology consultation service archives at National Institutes of Health from 2003 to 2017 in which infection by HHV-6 had been documented by immunohistochemical stains to HHV-6 gp60/110 envelope glycoprotein. Five cases of reactive lymphadenitis and 3 cases of lymphoma; 2 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and 1 classic Hodgkin lymphoma, positive for HHV-6 were identified. The reactive lymph nodes showed marked paracortical hyperplasia and admixed large atypical lymphoid cells exhibiting pleomorphic nuclei, vesicular chromatin, and prominent eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions. Vascular proliferation and necrosis were also present, raising suspicion of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The 3 cases of lymphoma showed similar viral inclusions, in addition to the characteristic features diagnostic of the lymphoma. Staining for HHV-6 was positive with a membranous and Golgi pattern and was restricted to cells with evident inclusions on hematoxylin and eosin. HHV-6 infected cells were positive for CD3 and CD4. HHV-6 lymphadenitis can present with morphologic atypia creating a diagnostic pitfall for lymphoma. In such cases, careful attention to the characteristic viral inclusions can lead to immunohistochemical analysis highlighting the replicating virus.

Sequencing serial bone marrow samples of eight patients, we observed that MDS featured a median of 3 mutations. Mutations in genes involved in RNA-splicing or epigenetic regulation were most frequent, and exclusively present in the major clone. Minor subclones were distinguishable in three patients. As the MDS progressed, a median of one mutation was gained, leading to clonal outgrowth. No AML developed genetically independent of a pre-existing clone. The gained mutation mostly affected genes encoding signalling proteins. Additional acquisition of genomic aberrations frequently occurred. Upon treatment, emergence of new clones could be observed. As confirmed by single-cell sequencing, multiple mutations in identical genes in different clones were present within individual patients. DNA-methylation profiling in patients without identification of novel mutations in AML revealed methylation changes in individual genes.

OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study is to determine the concordance between the measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE) by indirect calorimetry in pediatric oncology patients versus the World Health Organization (WHO) and Schofield predictive equations. METHOD: cross-sectional study in children aged 5-15 years receiving chemotherapy, in outpatient Clinica Las Condes and Hospital Dr. Sotero del Rio, from July 2013 to July 2015. REE measurement was performed by indirect calorimetry and WHO and Schofield equations. Concordance analysis, with clinically relevant cut-off point and concordance coefficient of 90%. RESULTS: twenty-seven children were included and 27 calorimetries were performed; 66% of these children were diagnosed with leukemia, 15% with central nervous system tumor and 81% were in the maintenance stage of their treatment. There is no significant difference between indirect calorimetry measurement versus WHO (p 0.18) or Schofield (p 0.07), neither when stratifying by nutritional status or type of cancer diagnosis. Concordance was calculated between calorimetry and Schofield, with a concordance coefficient of Lin = 79.4% (95% CI = 65.2-93.6) and versus WHO = 78% (95% CI = 62.9-93.2). CONCLUSION: this level of agreement, less than 80% in both cases, is insufficient. With both equations for estimating REE, there is overestimation or underestimation of energy requirements in more than 20% of cases. There is no agreement between the measurement of REE measured with indirect calorimetry versus its estimation with Schofield's and the WHO equations. Consequently, indirect calorimetry is required as part of the nutritional assessment in a nutritionally at-risk population such as pediatric patients with oncological pathology.",,"['Munoz Benavides, Eliana', 'Cordero, Maria Luisa', 'Castro, Magdalena', 'Derado, Macareba']","['Munoz Benavides E', 'Cordero ML', 'Castro M', 'Derado M']",['clinica las condes. elianamunozb@gmail.com.'],['spa'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20180604,Spain,Nutr Hosp,Nutricion hospitalaria,9100365,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Calorimetry, Indirect', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Nutritional Status', '*Rest']",2018/07/06 06:00,2018/11/28 06:00,['2018/07/06 06:00'],"['2017/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.20960/nh.1457 [doi]'],epublish,Nutr Hosp. 2018 Jun 4;35(3):538-542. doi: 10.20960/nh.1457.,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medicion del gasto energetico de reposo en pacientes oncologicos pediatricos: concordancia entre calorimetria indirecta y ecuaciones predictivas.,,,,,,,,,,,

Associations with other cancers are not established. We systematically assessed associations between HBV infection and cancers in the US elderly population. We conducted a case-control study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database in US adults aged >/=66 years. Cases (N = 1,825,316) were people with first cancers diagnosed in SEER registries (1993-2013). Controls (N = 200,000) were randomly selected, cancer-free individuals who were frequency-matched to cases on age, sex, race and calendar year. Associations with HBV infection (ascertained by Medicare claims) were assessed by logistic regression. HBV prevalence was higher in cases than controls (0.6% vs. 0.5%). HBV was positively associated with cancers of the stomach (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.19; 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.03-1.37), anus (1.66; 1.17-2.33), liver (10.6; 9.66-11.6), intrahepatic bile ducts (1.67; 1.18-2.37), nasopharynx (2.08; 1.33-3.25), as well as myelodysplastic syndrome (1.26; 1.07-1.49) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1.24; 1.06-1.46). Inverse associations were observed with female breast (aOR = 0.86; 95%CI = 0.76-0.98) and prostate (0.81; 0.73-0.91) cancers and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (0.77; 0.62-0.96). Associations were maintained in sensitivity analyses conducted in people without claims for cirrhosis or hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus infections. HBV infection is associated with increased risk of cancers other than HCC, such as bile duct cancers and DLBCL. The biological mechanisms by which HBV may lead to these cancers need to be explored.","['Published 2018.

METHOD: This review article summarizes the outcome of a discussion that took place during an expert meeting on the subject of pulmonary infiltrates. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The most common causes of pulmonary infiltrates in haematologic patients are bacterial infections. Viral infections are subject to relevant seasonal variations, but they may also cause an important proportion of pulmonary infiltrates. Microbiological examination of respiratory tract material (if possible, bronchoalveolar lavage, BAL) is the most important diagnostic procedure. Particularly in the case of prolonged (> 7 days) neutropenia, the likelihood of infiltrates being caused by fungal infections increases. For a differential diagnosis, however, also non-infectious causes, e.g. drug-induced infiltrates, have to be taken into consideration. The diagnostic workup, however, should not delay a timely start of an adequate antimicrobial therapy.",,"['Blau, Igor-Wolfgang', 'Heinz, Werner J', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Lipp, Hans-Peter', 'Schafhausen, Philippe', 'Maschmeyer, Georg']","['Blau IW', 'Heinz WJ', 'Schwartz S', 'Lipp HP', 'Schafhausen P', 'Maschmeyer G']","['Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Tumorimmunologie, Leitender Oberarzt Knochenmarktransplantation, Campus Virchow Klinikum der Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland. igor.blau@charite.de.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Tumorimmunologie, Campus Virchow Klinikum der Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augustenburgerplatz 1, D-13353, Berlin, Deutschland. igor.blau@charite.de.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Deutschland.', 'Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Tumorimmunologie, Campus Benjamin Franklin der Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland.', 'Universitatsklinikum Tubingen, Tubingen, Deutschland.', 'Zentrum fur Onkologie, II.

This approach requires covalent protein modification, creating a new entity. An alternative approach is stabilization by encapsulation into polymersomes; however this typically requires multiple steps, and the segregation requires the vesicles to be permeable to retain function. Herein, we demonstrate the one-pot synthesis of therapeutic enzyme-loaded vesicles with size-selective permeability using polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) enabling the encapsulated enzyme to function from within a confined domain. This strategy increased the proteolytic stability and reduced antibody recognition compared to the free protein or a PEGylated conjugate, thereby reducing potential dose frequency and the risk of immune response. Finally, the efficacy of encapsulated l-asparaginase (clinically used for leukemia treatment) against a cancer line was demonstrated, and its biodistribution and circulation behavior in vivo was compared to the free enzyme, highlighting this methodology as an attractive alternative to the covalent PEGylation of enzymes.",,"['Blackman, Lewis D', 'Varlas, Spyridon', 'Arno, Maria C', 'Houston, Zachary H', 'Fletcher, Nicholas L', 'Thurecht, Kristofer J', 'Hasan, Muhammad', 'Gibson, Matthew I', ""O'Reilly, Rachel K""]","['Blackman LD', 'Varlas S', 'Arno MC', 'Houston ZH', 'Fletcher NL', 'Thurecht KJ', 'Hasan M', 'Gibson MI', ""O'Reilly RK""]","['Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, CV4 7AL Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, CV4 7AL Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, CV4 7AL Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom.', 'Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Centre for Advanced Imaging, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Centre for Advanced Imaging, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Centre for Advanced Imaging, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, CV4 7AL Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, CV4 7AL Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, CV4 7AL Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, CV4 7AL Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, CV4 7AL Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['638661/European Research Council/International', 'BB/M017982/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],20180516,United States,ACS Cent Sci,ACS central science,101660035,,,,2018/07/06 06:00,2018/07/06 06:01,['2018/07/06 06:00'],"['2018/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/acscentsci.8b00168 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Cent Sci. 2018 Jun 27;4(6):718-723. doi: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00168.

Case presentation: We report the case of a 57-year-old man presenting with concomitant acute myeloid leukemia and type B LA with asymptomatic hypoglycemia. We did not find arguments for a septic state, liver dysfunction, or acute mesenteric ischemia. The WE was suspected, and chemotherapy was immediately undertaken. We observed a rapid and sustained decrease in lactate level and normalization of blood glucose. Unfortunately, we noted a relapse of acute leukemia associated with WE soon after treatment initiation and the patient died in the Intensive Care unit. Discussion: Some patients may present complications directly related to an underlying hematological malignancy. The WE is one of these complications and should be suspected in patients with both hypoglycemia and LA. We propose a checklist in order to help clinicians manage this life-threatening complication. Before considering WE, clinicians should eliminate diagnoses such as septic shock or mesenteric ischemia, which require urgent and specific management. Conclusion: The diagnosis of WE can be challenging for clinicians in the Hematology department and the Intensive Care unit. Prompt diagnosis and rapid, adapted chemotherapy initiation may benefit patient survival.",,"['Brault, Clement', 'Zerbib, Yoann', 'Delette, Caroline', 'Marc, Julien', 'Gruson, Berengere', 'Marolleau, Jean P', 'Maizel, Julien']","['Brault C', 'Zerbib Y', 'Delette C', 'Marc J', 'Gruson B', 'Marolleau JP', 'Maizel J']","['Reanimation Medicale, CHU Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France.', 'Reanimation Medicale, CHU Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France.', 'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France.', 'Reanimation Medicale, CHU Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France.', 'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France.', 'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France.', 'Reanimation Medicale, CHU Amiens-Picardie, Amiens, France.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180620,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2018/07/06 06:00,2018/07/06 06:01,['2018/07/06 06:00'],"['2018/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00232 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Jun 20;8:232. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00232. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'hypoglycemia', 'intensive care unit', 'lactic acidosis', 'the Warburg effect']",,,PMC6019439,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors depends on PARP trapping, the formation of non-covalent protein-DNA adducts composed of inhibited PARP1 bound to DNA lesions of unclear origins(1-4). To address the nature of such lesions and the cellular consequences of PARP trapping, we undertook three CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats) screens to identify genes and pathways that mediate cellular resistance to olaparib, a clinically approved PARP inhibitor(1). Here we present a high-confidence set of 73 genes, which when mutated cause increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. In addition to an expected enrichment for genes related to homologous recombination, we discovered that mutations in all three genes encoding ribonuclease H2 sensitized cells to PARP inhibition. We establish that the underlying cause of the PARP-inhibitor hypersensitivity of cells deficient in ribonuclease H2 is impaired ribonucleotide excision repair(5). Embedded ribonucleotides, which are abundant in the genome of cells deficient in ribonucleotide excision repair, are substrates for cleavage by topoisomerase 1, resulting in PARP-trapping lesions that impede DNA replication and endanger genome integrity. We conclude that genomic ribonucleotides are a hitherto unappreciated source of PARP-trapping DNA lesions, and that the frequent deletion of RNASEH2B in metastatic prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia could provide an opportunity to exploit these findings therapeutically.",,"['Zimmermann, Michal', 'Murina, Olga', 'Reijns, Martin A M', 'Agathanggelou, Angelo', 'Challis,

As these molecules are well tolerated, it would be interesting to investigate the potential benefit of newly synthesized compounds, binding cannabinoid receptors (CBRs). In this study, we describe the synthesis and biological effect of 2-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxamide derivative LV50, a new compound with high CB2 receptor (CB2R) affinity. We demonstrated that it decreases viability of Jurkat leukemia cells, evaluated by Trypan Blue and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), but mainly induces a proapoptotic effect. We observed an increase of a hypodiploid peak by propidium iodide staining and changes in nuclear morphology by Hoechst 33258. These data were confirmed by a significant increase of Annexin V staining, cleavage of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP), and caspases activation. In addition, in order to exclude that LV50 non-specifically triggers death of all normal leukocytes, we tested the new compound on normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, excluding the idea of general cytotoxicity. To characterize the involvement of CB2R in the anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effect of LV50, cells were pretreated with a specific CB2R antagonist and the obtained data showed reverse results.

Three BALB/c mice were immunized with the human CD123 antigen, and the immune spleen cells were fused with the SP2/0 myeloma cell line. Hybridomas were screened by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the positive hybrids were cloned by limiting dilution. The mAb isotype was determined, ascitic fluids were produced, and antibodies were purified using Fast protein liquid chromatography (Sephacryl S-200). The specificity of the hybridomas was examined by ELISA, cell-based ELISA, and flow cytometry. After three rounds of cell cloning, four anti-CD123 secreting hybridomas were obtained with the IgM isotype. Among them, one stable hybrid, designated sC1, exhibited the higher ability to recognize the CD123 antigen, as compared with the other hybridomas.

There was a predominance of males (8:2), and the median age at MS diagnosis was 4 years. Sites of involvement varied and included skin (n = 3), head and/or neck (n = 2), and multiple sites (n = 2). Karyotypes were evaluated in seven patients, with one individual carrying t(8;21) and t(9;11). Four patients developed bone marrow involvement 2-55 months after diagnosis of MS.

The aim of the study was to describe the echocardiographic features in concordance with cardiac and pericardial (18)F-FDG uptake on whole-body oncology PET/CT. METHODS: We enrolled 43 consecutive patients (34 solid tumors, 8 lymphomas and 1 leukemia) who were newly diagnosed with non-cardiac malignancy showing incidental cardiac or pericardial (18)F-FDG uptake on PET/CT and underwent transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTE) within 1 month of PET/CT. The maximum standardized uptake (SUVmax) of all lesions was measured. RESULTS: Fifty-six (18)F-FDG uptake lesions (32 pericardium, 7 myocardium, 9 cardiac chambers and 8 great vessels) were found, and pericardial effusion was the most common echocardiographic finding (22/43, 51.2%) among study population. Pericardial FDG uptake was shown as pericardial effusion (68.8%), intrapericardial echogenic materials (31.3%), pericardial thickening (28.1%), hyperechogenicity of myopericardium (18.8%), and restricted sliding movement or constrictive pericarditis (15.6%) on TTE. Lesions with regional wall motion abnormality (p = 0.004) or constrictive pericarditis (p = 0.021) had significantly higher mean SUVmax than those without. Myocardial FDG uptake demonstrated pericardial effusion (57.1%), regional wall motion abnormality (57.1%), and increased myocardial wall thickness (42.9%). All cardiac chamber FDG uptakes showed intracardiac mass on TTE. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac or pericardial (18)F-FDG uptake on oncology PET/CT shows characteristic echocardiographic features according to which heart sites are involved.",,"['Yi, Jeong-Eun', 'Yoon, Hyuk Jin', 'O, Joo Hyun', 'Youn, Ho-Joong']","['Yi JE', 'Yoon HJ', 'O JH', 'Youn HJ']","['Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul, St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."", ""Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."", ""Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."", ""Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul, St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180625,Korea (South),J Cardiovasc Imaging,Journal of cardiovascular imaging,101728106,,,,2018/07/05 06:00,2018/07/05 06:01,['2018/07/05 06:00'],"['2018/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4250/jcvi.2018.26.e10 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cardiovasc Imaging. 2018 Jun;26(2):93-102. doi: 10.4250/jcvi.2018.26.e10.

Multiple recurrent chromosomal aberrations have been identified by conventional cytogenetic analysis, which is now widely recognized as one of the most important diagnostic and prognostic determinants in these patients. Though rarer, complex karyotype has been associated with worst prognosis. Materials and Methods: A total of 1185 bone marrow or peripheral blood cytogenetics samples were taken with different hematological diseases. They included both benign and malignant disease entities. In each case, cells were cultured and conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed. Results: Among 1185 subjects, 41 (3.4%) patients possessed complex cytogenetic abnormalities. Out of these 41, 33 (80%) were males. The mean age was 37 years (median age 39 years). Myelodysplastic syndromes had the most numbers of complex karyotypes (8%), followed by acute myeloid leukemia (7%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4%). Also we found few patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, aplastic anemia , chronic myeloid leukemia, and diffuse large B cell Lymphoma possessing complex karyotype. Frequencies of different cytogenetic abnormalities were assessed with respect to disease as well as independently. Trisomy 21 was the most common chromosomal abnormality found in 28% of patients. Conclusion: Complex karyotype was most frequently associated with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Trisomy 21 and deletion 5q were the commonest cytogenetic abnormalities found. We also assessed complex karyotype in benign diseases and detected one patient of aplastic anemia with complex karyotype. This is the first study highlighting the presence of complex karyotypes in hematological disorders in our region.",,"['Waheed, Samra', 'Hassan, Jawad', 'Naz, Maliha', 'Maqsood, Sidra', 'Abid, Madiha', 'Shan, Saira', 'Nadeem, Muhammad', 'Shamsi, Tahir S']","['Waheed S', 'Hassan J', 'Naz M', 'Maqsood S', 'Abid M', 'Shan S', 'Nadeem M', 'Shamsi TS']","['National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180603,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,2018/07/05 06:00,2018/07/05 06:01,['2018/07/05 06:00'],"['2017/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/2019239 [doi]'],epublish,J Oncol. 2018 Jun 3;2018:2019239. doi: 10.1155/2018/2019239. eCollection 2018.,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4842-8976'],PMC6008829,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we present the case of a patient with CML who experienced blast crisis and development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 10 years after presentation. The CML was characterized by the gene fusion of breakpoint cluster region BCR and tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1. During treatment different therapeutic protocols including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib and ponatinib were applied due to development of resistance or non-response. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were used to describe cytogenetic and molecular aberrations elucidating the development into AML: A loss of chromosome 7, as well as an arising frequency of variants in the gene met proto-oncogene MET (p.T110I) and tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 PTPN11 (p.Q510L) was observed.

This study aimed to identify these possibilities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human CML cell line-derived exosomes and CML-patients-derived exosomes were isolated with a size-exclusion chromatography column and ExoQuick exosome precipitation solution, respectively. Isolated exosomes were analysed by nested PCR to detect the BCR-ABL transcript. RESULTS: Exosomes derived from the two human CML cell lines yielded a 250-bp band. RNA sequence analysis revealed 99% sequence homology with the partial mRNA for the human BCR-ABL chimeric protein. This ~250-bp band was also observed in the exosomes derived from patients with CML. However, only patients at the blast and accelerated phases showed the exosomal BCR-ABL transcript. CONCLUSION: CML-derived exosomes could act as novel targets for the detection of the BCR-ABL transcript.","['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Kang, Ka-Won', 'Jung, Jik-Han', 'Hur, Woojune', 'Park, Jaena', 'Shin, Hyunku', 'Choi, Byeonghyeon', 'Jeong, Hyesun', 'Kim, Dae Sik', 'Yu, Eun Sang', 'Lee, Se Ryeon', 'Sung, Hwa Jung', 'Kim, Seok Jin', 'Choi, Chul Won', 'Kim, Hyun Koo', 'Hong, Sunghoi', 'Park, Ji-Ho', 'Choi, Yeonho', 'Park, Yong', 'Kim, Byung Soo']","['Kang KW', 'Jung JH', 'Hur W', 'Park J', 'Shin H', 'Choi B', 'Jeong H', 'Kim DS', 'Yu ES', 'Lee SR', 'Sung HJ', 'Kim SJ', 'Choi CW', 'Kim HK', 'Hong S', 'Park JH', 'Choi Y', 'Park Y', 'Kim BS']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bio and Brain Bioengineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bio-convergence Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bio-convergence Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biosystem and Biomedical Science, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Biosystem and Biomedical Science, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bio and Brain Bioengineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bio-convergence Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea paark76@hanmail.net.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Exosomes', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",2018/07/05 06:00,2018/08/01 06:00,['2018/07/05 06:00'],"['2018/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['38/7/3935 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.12679 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2018 Jul;38(7):3935-3942. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.12679.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Chronic myelogenous leukaemia', 'biomarker', 'exosome']",7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High CD38 levels in CLL cells are linked to increased cell migration, but the molecular basis is unknown. CD38 produces nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate and adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose, both of which can act to increase intracellular Ca(2+) levels. Here we show that CD38 expression increases basal intracellular Ca(2+) levels and stimulates CLL cell migration both with and without chemokine stimulation. We find that CD38 acts via intracellular Ca(2+) to increase the activity of the Ras family GTPase Rap1, which is in turn regulated by the Ca(2+)-sensitive Rap1 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP2. Both Rap1 and RasGRP2 are required for CLL cell migration, and RasGRP2 is polarized in primary CLL cells with high CD38 levels. These results indicate that CD38 promotes RasGRP2/Rap1-mediated CLL cell adhesion and migration by increasing intracellular Ca(2+) levels.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Mele, Silvia', 'Devereux, Stephen', 'Pepper, Andrea G', 'Infante, Elvira', 'Ridley, Anne J']","['Mele S', 'Devereux S', 'Pepper AG', 'Infante E', 'Ridley AJ']","['Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, and.', ""School of Cancer Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""School of Cancer Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""School of Cancer Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom; and.', 'Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, and.', 'Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics, and.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'Department of Health/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RASGRP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*physiology', 'Calcium Signaling/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",2018/07/05 06:00,2019/04/09 06:00,['2018/07/05 06:00'],"['2017/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2017014506 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2017014506 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Jul 10;2(13):1551-1561. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017014506.,,,13,,PMC6039665,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoiesis, or the formation of the ten different types of blood and marrow cells, is a complex process involving hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), cytokine growth factors and cell surface adhesion molecules, and both specific and ubiquitous transcription factors. The marrow micro-environmental niche is defined as the site at which HSCs reside and are nurtured, receiving the signals that lead to their survival, replication and/or differentiation. Using microscopic, biochemical and molecular methods many different cells and the signals responsible for niche function have been identified. Early studies suggested two distinct anatomical sites for the niche, perivascular and periosteal, but the preponderance of evidence now favors the former. Within the ""vascular niche"" much evidence exists for important contributions by vascular endothelial cells (ECs), CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells and mesenchymal stromal cells, through their elaboration of chemokines, cytokines and cell surface adhesion molecules. In a series of studies we have found, and will present the evidence that megakaryocytes (MKs), the precursors of blood platelets, must be added to this list. In addition to normal blood cell development, numerous studies have implicated the perivascular niche as contributing to the pathogenesis of a variety of hematological malignancies. Our laboratory focuses on the Ph (Crane et al., 2017)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). These diseases are characterized by clonal expansion of HSCs and one or more mature blood cell types, hypermetabolism, a propensity to disorders of hemostasis (thrombosis>bleeding) and in some, evolution to acute leukemia. While a variety of therapies can control the abnormal expansion of the progeny of the malignant HSC, the only curative therapy is myeloablation with conditioning therapy or immunological means, followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), a procedure that is often inadequate due to relapse of the malignant clone. While the three disorders were postulated by Dameshek in the 1950s to be related to one another, proof came in 2005 when an acquired mutation in the signaling kinase Janus kinase 2 (Jak2V617F) was identified in virtually all patients with PV, and approximately 50% of patients with ET and PMF. Since that time a number of other mutations have been identified that account for the ""Jak2V617F negative"" MPNs, including the thrombopoietin receptor, c-MPL, other mutations of Jak2, calreticulin and a variety of epigenetic modifier genes (e.g. TET2). Using a cell-specific Cre recombinase and SCT techniques we can introduce Jak2V617F into murine megakaryocytes and platelets, hematopoietic stem cells, and endothelial cells, alone or in combination, in order to probe the role of the mutant kinase in various cells on several aspects of the MPNs. Using these tools we have found that the expression of Jak2V617F in HSCs and ECs drives a MPN characterized by neutrophilia, thrombocytosis and splenomegaly, eventually evolving into myelosclerosis. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that Jak2V617F-bearing ECs were required for many features of the MPN, such as enhancing the growth of Jak2V617F-bearing HSCs over that of wild type HSCs, its characteristic radioresistance, and a hemostatic defect. Altogether, our studies suggest that the malignant vascular niche is a critical element in the pathogenesis of MPNs, and a more thorough understanding of the molecular basis for these findings could lead to improved treatment for patients with these disorders.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, they still need to face serious adverse effects of chemotherapy. One of these is cardiotoxicity which may lead to progressive heart failure in the long term. Cardiotoxicity is contributed mainly to the use of anthracyclines and might have genetic risk factors. Our goal was to test the association between left ventricular function and genetic variations of candidate genes. METHODS: Echocardiography data from medical records of 622 pediatric ALL and 39 OSC patients were collected from the period 1989-2015. Fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) were determined, 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 26 genes were genotyped. Multivariate logistic regression and multi-adjusted general linear model were performed to investigate the influence of genetic polymorphisms on the left ventricular parameters. Bayesian network based Bayesian multilevel analysis of relevance (BN-BMLA) method was applied to test for the potential interaction of the studied cofactors and SNPs. RESULTS: Our results indicate that variations in ABCC2, CYP3A5, NQO1, SLC22A6 and SLC28A3 genes might influence the left ventricular parameters.

Recent studies have demonstrated that circRNAs participate in pathogenesis mainly by acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges. The expression profile of circRNAs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has rarely been reported. METHODS: Profiles of circRNAs were analyzed using an Arraystar human circRNA microarray with 5 bone marrow samples from patients with newly diagnosed AML and 5 from patients with iron-deficiency anemia. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to validate the expression pattern of circRNAs. Furthermore, circRNA-miRNA network, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were applied. RESULTS: CircRNA microarray analysis revealed that 698 circRNAs were differentially expressed in AML patients, with 282 circRNAs found to be upregulated and 416 to be downregulated. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed that circ-ANAPC7 was significantly upregulated in AML. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that circ-ANAPC7 acts as a sponge for the miR-181 family, KEGG analysis revealed that it is associated with cancer-related pathways, and GO analysis indicated that most of its target genes are involved in biological processes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that circ-ANAPC7 is a promising biomarker for AML, and that it might participate in AML pathogenesis by acting as a sponge for the miR-181 family.","['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Scant data are, however, available on their presence in nonneoplastic lymph nodes. This study is aimed to (1) characterize the presence/distribution of benign TdT-positive cells in pediatric and adult reactive lymph nodes and (2) define the phenotype and nature of such elements. This retrospective study considered 141 reactive lymph nodes from pediatric and adult patients without history of neoplastic disease. TdT-positive cells were characterized by immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses, and their presence was correlated with the clinical-pathological features. The nature of TdT-positive cells was investigated by (1) double immunostaining for early lymphoid cell markers and (2) assessment of TdT expression in fetal lymph nodes. Sparse TdT-positive cells were documented in all pediatric cases and in most (76%) adult lymph nodes. TdT-positive cell density was higher in children than adults (15.9/mm(2) versus 8.6/mm(2); P < .05). TdT positivity did not correlate with any clinical or histological parameter, and double immunostaining disclosed a phenotype compatible with early lymphoid precursors (positivity for CD34 and CD10, and variable expression of CD7). A very high TdT-positive cell density (802.4/mm(2)) was reported in all fetal lymph nodes. In conclusion, TdT-positive cells are a common finding in pediatric and adult lymph nodes. The interstitial distribution and low number of such cells allow for the differential diagnosis with precursor lymphoid neoplasms. The high density in fetal lymph nodes and the phenotype of such cells suggest their belonging to an immature lymphoid subset gradually decreasing with age.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Accumulating evidence suggests that mutations of the CCND1 gene that result in nuclear retention and constitutive activation of CDK4/6 kinases are oncogenic drivers in cancer. However, the spectrum of CCND1 mutations across human cancers has not been systematically investigated. Here, we retrospectively mined whole-exome sequencing data from 124 published studies representing up to 29,432 cases from diverse cancer types and sites of origin, including carcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma and lymphoma/leukemia, via online tools to determine the frequency and spectrum of CCND1 mutations in human cancers and their associated clinico-pathological characteristics. Overall, in contrast to gene amplification, which occurred at a frequency of 4.8% (1,419 of 28,769 cases), CCND1 mutations were of very low frequency (0.5%, 151 of 29,432 cases) across all cancers, but were predominantly enriched in uterine endometrioid-type adenocarcinoma (6.5%, 30 of 458 cases) in both primary tumors and in advanced, metastatic endometrial cancer samples. CCND1 mutations in endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma occurred most commonly in the c-terminus of cyclin D1, as putative driver mutations, in a region thought to result in oncogenic activation of cyclin D1 via inhibition of Thr-286 phosphorylation and nuclear export, thereby resulting in nuclear retention and protein overexpression.

Entinostat, a selective class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, shows antitumor activity in various human cancers, including hematological malignancies. The therapeutic potential of cladribine and entinostat against multiple myeloma (MM) remains unclear. Here we investigate the combinatorial effects of cladribine and entinostat within the range of their clinical achievable concentrations on MM cells. While either agent alone inhibited MM cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, their combinations synergistically induced anti-proliferative/anti-survival effects on all MM cell lines (RPMI8226, U266, and MM1.R) tested. Further studies showed that the combinations of cladribine and entinostat as compared to either agent alone more potently induced mitotic catastrophe in the MM cells, and resulted in a marked increase of the cells at G1 phase associated with decrease of Cyclin D1 and E2F-1 expression and upregulation of p21(waf-1). Apoptotic ELISA and western blot analyses revealed that the combinations of cladribine and entinostat exerted a much more profound activity to induce apoptosis and DNA damage response, evidenced by enhanced phosphorylation of histone H2A.X and the DNA repair enzymes Chk1 and Chk2. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the combinations of cladribine and entinostat exhibit potent activity to induce anti-proliferative/anti-survival effects on MM cells via induction of cell cycle G1 arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage response. Regimens consisting of cladribine and/or entinostat may offer a new treatment option for patients with MM.

However, the trajectory of change and contributing neuropathology is unclear, limiting our ability to tailor intervention content and timing. This study aimed to explore information processing abilities and brain morphology early post-treatment for pediatric ALL. Procedure: Twenty-one children at the end of ALL treatment and 18 controls underwent neuropsychological assessment. A subset also completed structural magnetic resonance imaging. Results: A principal component analysis generated two cognitive factors: information processing capacity and information processing speed.

These small molecules targeting the B-cell receptor signaling pathway and the BCL-2 anti-apoptotic protein offer new chemo-free options to both unfit patients and high-risk patients who show a poor response to chemoimmunotherapy. Nonetheless, treatment with ibrutinib, idelalisib and venetoclax is associated with unique side effects. Awareness, prevention and the appropriate management of these specific toxicities are of crucial importance for a successful treatment. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to discuss the most relevant studies on small molecules in CLL, with particular attention to the emerging toxicity profile of these agents and to the factors that should be considered to address the most appropriate treatment approach for each patient. Expert opinion: The increased knowledge on the biology of CLL has translated into the development of targeted agents that are highly effective and produce deep responses. Toxicities potentially associated with these agents should be known for an optimal management of CLL patients.",,"['Mauro, Francesca R', 'Caputo, Maria D', 'Rosati, Serena', 'Pepe, Sara', 'De Benedittis, Daniela', 'De Luca, Maria L', 'Foa, Robin']","['Mauro FR', 'Caputo MD', 'Rosati S', 'Pepe S', 'De Benedittis D', 'De Luca ML', 'Foa R']","['a Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology , Sapienza University and Policlinico Umberto 1 , Rome , Italy.', 'a Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology , Sapienza University and Policlinico Umberto 1 , Rome , Italy.', 'a Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology , Sapienza University and Policlinico Umberto 1 , Rome , Italy.', 'a Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology , Sapienza University and Policlinico Umberto 1 , Rome , Italy.', 'a Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology , Sapienza University and Policlinico Umberto 1 , Rome , Italy.', 'a Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology , Sapienza University and Policlinico Umberto 1 , Rome , Italy.', 'a Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology , Sapienza University and Policlinico Umberto 1 , Rome , Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180718,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Interactions', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2018/07/04 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2018/07/04 06:00'],"['2018/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2018.1495557 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2018 Aug;11(8):601-611. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2018.1495557.

Although the drug has a potent immunosuppressive effect, infectious complications during dasatinib treatment have been reported rarely. We describe five patients who developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis during dasatinib treatment, in whom the colitis was initially confused with other causes. The patients, three with chronic myeloid leukemia, and two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, were diagnosed with CMV colitis based on endoscopic and histologic findings. The patients who examined blood CMV polymerase chain reaction were all positive. The patients received antiviral therapy in the form of either ganciclovir or valganciclovir, and the overall treatment outcome was fair. These cases suggest that physicians should consider the possibility of CMV reactivation when treating diarrhea and/or hematochezia in patients on dasatinib.","['Copyright (c) 2018 by The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases and Korean', 'Society for Chemotherapy.']","['Choi, Jae Ki', 'Cho, Sung Yeon', 'Choi, Su Mi', 'Kim, Gyo Hui', 'Lee, Sung Eun', 'Lee, Seok', 'Kim, Dong Wook', 'Lee, Dong Gun']","['Choi JK', 'Cho SY', 'Choi SM', 'Kim GH', 'Lee SE', 'Lee S', 'Kim DW', 'Lee DG']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Vaccine Bio Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Catholic Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. symonlee@catholic.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],,Korea (South),Infect Chemother,Infection & chemotherapy,101531537,,,,2018/07/04 06:00,2018/07/04 06:01,['2018/07/04 06:00'],"['2017/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/04 06:01 [medline]']","['50.153 [pii]', '10.3947/ic.2018.50.2.153 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Chemother. 2018 Jun;50(2):153-159. doi: 10.3947/ic.2018.50.2.153.,['NOTNLM'],"['Colitis', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Dasatinib']",2,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4666-960X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4655-0641']",PMC6031599,,['No conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether the fusion gene can be detected in neonatal blood spots (NBSs) from paediatric patients diagnosed with T-cell ALL, we analysed DNA from 38 paediatric patients with T-ALL by nested polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis.

Experiments were performed on HNSCC cell lines (SQ20B and SCC-9) and primary human oral carcinoma cells. Results showed that PKC412 inhibited HNSCC cell proliferation without provoking apoptosis activation. Cotreatment of C6 ceramide significantly augmented PKC412-induced lethality in HNSCC cells. PKC412 decreased Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in HNSCC cells, facilitated with cotreatment of C6 ceramide. In contrast, exogenous expression of a constitutively active Akt restored Akt-mTOR activation and attenuated lethality by the cotreatment. We propose that Mcl-1 is a primary resistance factor of PKC412. The cytotoxicity of PKC412 in HNSCC cells was potentiated with Mcl-1 short hairpin RNA knockdown, but was attenuated with Mcl-1 overexpression. Intriguingly, C6 ceramide downregulated Mcl-1 in HNSCC cells. In vivo, PKC412 oral administration inhibited SQ20B xenograft tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficient mice. The antitumor activity of PKC412 was further sensitized with coadministration of liposomal C6 ceramide. Together, we suggest that PKC412 could be further studied as a promising anti-HNSCC strategy, alone or in combination with C6 ceramide.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Zhu, Yanyan', 'Wang, Chaojie', 'Zhou, Yun', 'Ma, Ning', 'Zhou, Jianwei']","['Zhu Y', 'Wang C', 'Zhou Y', 'Ma N', 'Zhou J']","[""Department of Oncology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Oncology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Oncology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Oncology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Oncology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180703,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '038753E78J (N-caproylsphingosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2018/07/04 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/07/04 06:00'],"['2018/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26831 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Dec;233(12):9437-9446. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26831.

Their morphology in species and in special species is associated with different results about size, duration, and percentage of surface area covered by pinopodes. The content of pinopodes is different in rodents and humans. In mice and rats pinopodes have many vacuoles and no organelle that extends to the actin stalk above the microvilli. Human pinopodes do not have a large vacuole and contain the golgi complex, a rough endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles, and mitochondria that extend from the entire cell surface. It has been suggested that pinopodes are good markers of endometrial receptivity and implantation window. There are several molecular markers related to the presence of pinopodes, including integrins, leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF), l-selectin, HOXA10, glutaredoxin, glycodelinA, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, mucins, and microRNAs (miRNAs). Multiple lines of evidence have indicated that miRNAs could affect the expression of LIF and pinopodes in the endometrium and these molecules play key roles in implantation window processes. Here, we have summarized the morphology and function of pinopodes.

Here, we identified D2923 as a novel and selective inhibitor of CSF1R and explored its antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. D2923 potently inhibited CSF1R in vitro kinase activity with an IC50 value of 0.3 nM. It exhibited 10- to 300-fold less potency against a panel of kinases tested. D2923 markedly blocked CSF-1-induced activation of CSF1R and its downstream signaling transduction in THP-1 and RAW264.7 macrophages and thus inhibited the in vitro growth of macrophages. Moreover, D2923 dose-dependently attenuated the proliferation of a small panel of myeloid leukemia cells, mainly by arresting the cells at G1 phase as well as inducing apoptosis in the cells. The results of the in vivo experiments further demonstrated that D2923 displayed potent antitumor activity against M-NFS-60 xenografts, with tumor growth inhibition rates of 50% and 88% at doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg, respectively. Additionally, D2923 was well tolerated with no significant body-weight loss observed in the treatment groups compared with the control. Furthermore, a western blot analysis and the immunohistochemistry results confirmed that the phosphorylation of CSF1R in tumor tissue was dramatically reduced after D2923 treatment, and this was accompanied by the depletion of macrophages in the tumor.

The mRNA levels of caspase 3a and caspase 3b, as well as the activity of Caspase 3 increased significantly in vitro and in vivo, whereas the value of B cell leukemia 2-Bcl-2 associated X protein decreased significantly. Besides, the pro-apoptotic effect was relieved by alpha-tocopherol. Dietary 0.52% EPA had no apparent effect on intraperitoneal fat index. Moreover, EPA promoted the hydrolytic gene expressions in vitro and in vivo, including adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase-a. Meanwhile, the lipogenic gene expressions of liver X receptor alpha, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c and fatty-acid synthase were down-regulated by EPA in vitro and in vivo. However, EPA also acted to promote the marker gene expressions of adipogenesis, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and lipoprotein lipase in vitro and in vivo. Contents of EPA increased significantly in the treatment groups in vitro and in vivo. These results support that EPA affects multiple aspects of lipid metabolism, including hydrolysis, lipogenesis, adipogenesis and apoptosis.

MiR-652-3p (a circulating miRNA) was downregulated in new diagnosis (ND) patients compared with healthy controls. The levels of miR652-3p were restored in complete remission (CR) but were downregulated again in disease relapse (RE). The expression pattern of miR-652-3p was validated in bone marrow (BM) samples from other pediatric ALL patients. MiR-652-3p was significantly upregulated in BM when the patients (n=86) achieved CR, as compared with the matched ND samples (p<0.001). Moreover, the miR-652-3p levels in BM decreased again in two patients at RE. In addition, the lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines Reh and RS4:11 were found to have lower levels of miR-625-3p than the normal B-cell line. Overexpression of miR-652-3p using agomir increased the sensitivity to vincristine and cytarabine (all p<0.05) and promoted apoptosis (both p<0.05) in Reh and RS4:11 cells.

The clinical benefit of HDC/IL-2 is pronounced in monocytic forms of AML, where the leukemic cells express histamine type 2 receptors (H2R) and the NAPDH oxidase-2 (NOX2). HDC ligates to H2Rs to inhibit NOX2-derived formation of reactive oxygen species, but details regarding the anti-leukemic actions of HDC remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that human NOX2(+) myelomonocytic/monocytic AML cell lines showed increased expression of maturation markers along with reduced leukemic cell proliferation after exposure to HDC in vitro. These effects of HDC were absent in corresponding leukemic cells genetically depleted of NOX2 (NOX2(-/-)). We also observed that exposure to HDC altered the expression of genes involved in differentiation and cell cycle progression in AML cells and that these effects required the presence of NOX2. HDC promoted the differentiation also of primary monocytic, but not non-monocytic, AML cells in vitro. In a xenograft model, immunodeficient NOG mice were inoculated with wild-type or NOX2(-/-) human monocytic AML cells and treated with HDC in vivo. The administration of HDC reduced the in vivo expansion of NOX2(+/+), but not of NOX2(-/-) human monocytic AML cells.

Among them, an increased population density (PD) of animals receiving supplemental food raises concerns regarding the transmission of pathogens in these host populations. The primary aim of this study was to investigate how supplemental feeding is associated with host PD and prevalence of pathogens with different transmission modes in urban stray cats. We hypothesized that supplemental feeding would be positively associated with host PD and the prevalence of pathogens with density-dependent transmission modes compared with pathogens with transmission modes that are considered relatively density-independent. Methods: This study was conducted in six districts in Seoul, Republic of Korea which were selected based on different degrees of supplemental feeding and cat caretaker activity (CCA). The PD of stray cats was estimated by mark-recapture surveys. Stray cat blood samples (N = 302) were collected from stray cats by local animal hospitals from each district performing the trap-neuter-release which tested for eight pathogens with different transmission modes (feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline panleukopenia virus, feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus-1, Bartonella henselae, hemoplasma, and Toxoplasma gondii) with molecular or serological assays. Associations between the prevalence of each pathogen and PD, CCA, and sex of cats were statistically analyzed. Results: In contrast to initial predictions, the cat PD was generally higher in low CCA districts. The prevalence of (FeLV), which is transmitted through direct contact, was significantly higher in areas with a high CCA, conforming to our hypothesis. On the other hand, the prevalence of feline parvovirus, which can be spread by environmental transmission, was higher in low CCA districts. The remaining six pathogens did not show any association with the CCA; however, they had a unique association with the PD or the sex of the stray cats.

Despite significant progress made in clinical management of allogeneic-SCT, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and infectious complications remain the second and third cause of death after disease recurrence. Clinical options to restore immunocompetence after allogeneic-SCT are very limited as studies have raised awareness about the safety with regards to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Preclinical works are now focusing on strategies to improve thymic functions and to restore the peripheral niche that have been damaged by alloreactive T cells. In this mini review, we will provide a brief overview about the adverse effects of GVHD on the thymus and the peripheral niche and the resulting negative outcome on peripheral T cell homeostasis. Finally, we will discuss the potential relevance of coordinating our studies on thymic rejuvenation and improvement of the peripheral lymphoid niche to achieve optimal T cell regeneration in GVHD patients.",,"['Moutuou, Moutuaata M', 'Page, Gabriel', 'Zaid, Intesar', 'Lesage, Sylvie', 'Guimond, Martin']","['Moutuou MM', 'Page G', 'Zaid I', 'Lesage S', 'Guimond M']","[""Division d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Division d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Division d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Division d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180618,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,"['Animals', 'Cellular Microenvironment', 'Graft Survival/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', '*Homeostasis/immunology', 'Humans', '*Lymphopoiesis/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Thymocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2018/07/04 06:00,2018/07/04 06:01,['2018/07/04 06:00'],"['2018/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.01237 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Jun 18;9:1237. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01237. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['*GVHD', '*IL-7', '*SDF-1alpha', '*dendritic cells', '*interleukin-7', '*lymphocytes', '*lymphopenia', '*stem cell transplantation']",,,PMC6015883,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biogenic selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) by microorganism possess unique physical and chemical properties and biological activities compared with inorganic Se and organic Se. The study was conducted to investigate the mainly biological activities of SeNPs by Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 (L. casei 393). The results showed that L. casei 393 transformed sodium selenite to red SeNPs with the size of 50-80 nm, and accumulated them intracellularly. L. casei 393-SeNPs promoted the growth and proliferation of porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2), human colonic epithelial cells (NCM460), and human acute monocytic leukemia cell (THP-1)-derived macrophagocyte. L. casei 393-SeNPs significantly inhibited the growth of human liver tumor cell line-HepG2, and alleviated diquat-induced IPEC-J2 oxidative damage. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro experimental results showed that administration with L. casei 393-SeNPs protected against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88 (ETEC K88)-caused intestinal barrier dysfunction. ETEC K88 infection-associated oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase activity, total superoxide dismutase activity, total antioxidant capacity, and malondialdehyde) was ameliorated in L. casei 393-SeNPs-treated mice. These findings suggest that L. casei 393-SeNPs with no cytotoxicity play a key role in maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity and intestinal microflora balance in response to oxidative stress and infection.",,"['Xu, Chunlan', 'Guo, Yu', 'Qiao, Lei', 'Ma, Li', 'Cheng, Yiyi', 'Roman, Alexandra']","['Xu C', 'Guo Y', 'Qiao L', 'Ma L', 'Cheng Y', 'Roman A']","[""The Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China."", ""The Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China."", ""The Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China."", ""The Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China."", ""The Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China."", ""The Key Laboratory for Space Bioscience and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180618,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,2018/07/04 06:00,2018/07/04 06:01,['2018/07/04 06:00'],"['2018/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2018.01129 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2018 Jun 18;9:1129. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.01129. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['Lactobacillus casei', 'anticancer', 'antioxidant', 'biosynthesis', 'intestinal barrier', 'mechanism', 'nanoselenium', 'probiotic']",,,PMC6015882,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recently established clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system is a potentially elegant approach to functionally evaluate mutations in cancers. To reproduce mutations by homologous recombination (HR), the HR pathway must be functional, but DNA damage repair is frequently impaired in cancers. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for BCR-ABL1 in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia, and development of resistance due to kinase domain mutation is an important issue. We attempted to introduce the T315I gatekeeper mutation into three Ph+ myeloid leukemia cell lines with a seemingly functional HR pathway due to resistance to the inhibitor for poly (ADP) ribose polymerase1. Imatinib-resistant sublines were efficiently developed by the CRISPR/Cas9 system after short-term selection with imatinib; resulting sublines acquired the T315I mutation after HR.

Here, with newly generated knock-in mice, we investigated the biological effects of the mutant. Asxl1(G643fs) heterozygous (Asxl1(G643fs/+)) mice developed phenotypes recapitulating human low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and some of them developed MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm-like disease after long latency. H2AK119ub1 level around the promoter region of p16Ink4a was significantly decreased in Asxl1(G643fs/+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), suggesting perturbation of Bmi1-driven H2AK119ub1 histone modification by mutated Asxl1. The mutant form of ASXL1 had no ability to interact with BMI1 as opposed to wild-type ASXL1 protein. Restoration of HSC pool and amelioration of increased apoptosis in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were obtained from Asxl1(G643fs/+) mice heterozygous for p16Ink4a. These results indicated that loss of protein interaction between Asxl1 mutant and Bmi1 affected the activity of PRC1, and subsequent derepression of p16Ink4a by aberrant histone ubiquitination could induce cellular senescence, resulting in low-risk MDS-like phenotypes in Asxl1(G643fs/+) mice.

In mouse myeloid cells, Dpp8/9 inhibition activates the inflammasome sensor Nlrp1b, which in turn activates pro-caspase-1 to mediate cell death(3), but the mechanism of DPP8/9 inhibitor-induced pyroptosis in human myeloid cells is not yet known. Here we show that the CARD-containing protein CARD8 mediates DPP8/9 inhibitor-induced pro-caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis in human myeloid cells. We further show that DPP8/9 inhibitors induce pyroptosis in the majority of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary AML samples, but not in cells from many other lineages, and that these inhibitors inhibit human AML progression in mouse models. Overall, this work identifies an activator of CARD8 in human cells and indicates that its activation by small-molecule DPP8/9 inhibitors represents a new potential therapeutic strategy for AML.",,"['Johnson, Darren C', 'Taabazuing, Cornelius Y', 'Okondo, Marian C', 'Chui, Ashley J', 'Rao, Sahana D', 'Brown, Fiona C', 'Reed, Casie', 'Peguero, Elizabeth', 'de Stanchina, Elisa', 'Kentsis, Alex', 'Bachovchin, Daniel A']","['Johnson DC', 'Taabazuing CY', 'Okondo MC', 'Chui AJ', 'Rao SD', 'Brown FC', 'Reed C', 'Peguero E', 'de Stanchina E', 'Kentsis A', 'Bachovchin DA']","['Tri-institutional PhD Program in Chemical Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Chemical Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Chemical Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Tri-institutional PhD Program in Chemical Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Tri-institutional PhD Program in Chemical Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Antitumor Assessment Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Antitumor Assessment Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Tri-institutional PhD Program in Chemical Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Pharmacology Program of the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Tri-institutional PhD Program in Chemical Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. bachovcd@mskcc.org.', 'Chemical Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. bachovcd@mskcc.org.', 'Pharmacology Program of the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. bachovcd@mskcc.org.']",['eng'],"['U54 OD020355/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI137168/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM115327/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA188881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180702,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 1/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyroptosis/*drug effects']",2018/07/04 06:00,2019/05/11 06:00,['2018/07/04 06:00'],"['2016/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41591-018-0082-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41591-018-0082-y [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2018 Aug;24(8):1151-1156. doi: 10.1038/s41591-018-0082-y.

We performed whole-exome sequencing, copy-number variation, and/or RNA sequencing for 65 patients to discover mutations at diagnosis and blast crisis (BC). Forty-six patients with chronic-phase disease with the extremes of outcome were studied at diagnosis. Cancer gene variants were detected in 15 (56%) of 27 patients with subsequent BC or poor outcome and in 3 (16%) of 19 optimal responders (P = .007). Frequently mutated genes at diagnosis were ASXL1, IKZF1, and RUNX1 The methyltransferase SETD1B was a novel recurrently mutated gene. A novel class of variant associated with the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation was detected at diagnosis in 11 (24%) of 46 patients comprising fusions and/or rearrangement of genes on the translocated chromosomes, with evidence of fragmentation, inversion, and imperfect sequence reassembly. These were more frequent at diagnosis in patients with poor outcome: 9 (33%) of 27 vs 2 (11%) of 19 optimal responders (P = .07). Thirty-nine patients were tested at BC, and all had cancer gene variants, including ABL1 kinase domain mutations in 58%. However, ABL1 mutations cooccurred with other mutated cancer genes in 89% of cases, and these predated ABL1 mutations in 62% of evaluable patients. Gene fusions not associated with the Ph translocation occurred in 42% of patients at BC and commonly involved fusion partners that were known cancer genes (78%). Genomic analysis revealed numerous relevant variants at diagnosis in patients with poor outcome and all patients at BC. Future refined biomarker testing of specific variants will likely provide prognostic information to facilitate a risk-adapted therapeutic approach.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of

Merr. have been known to contain anticancer effects, particularly antileukemic effect. In this study, the inhibitory effect of Brucea javanica (BJ) on cell growth and inflammation was confirmed in human T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cells, and its efficacy as an antileukemic agent was verified. Our results showed that BJ extract induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of T-ALL Jurkat cells through inhibition of the CK2-mediated signaling pathway, while exerting no significant cytotoxicity in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, BJ extract suppressed the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, thus, inhibiting the interleukin (IL)-2 expression induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Notably, combined treatment with BJ extract plus CX-4945 or imatinib exerted enhanced inhibitory effects on T-ALL cell growth and IL-2 production. Overall, these results suggest that BJ extract can be a potent therapeutic herbal agent for T-ALL treatment and prevention of IL-2 mediated inflammatory immune responses.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We addressed this question in 3215 HSCTs performed between 2005 and 2013 in Germany for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Donors were HLA-matched related (MRD; n=872) or unrelated (10/10 MUD, n=1553) or HLA-mismatched unrelated (<10/10 MMUD, n=790). Overall survival (OS) was similar after MRD compared with 10/10 MUD HSCT, reflecting opposing hazards of relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32; P < .002) and nonrelapse mortality (HR, .63; P < .001). After UD HSCT, increasing HLA disparity was associated with inferior OS (HR, 1.21 [P < .02] and HR, 1.57 [P < .001] for 9/10 and </=8/10 MMUD, respectively, compared with 10/10 MUD). Among non-HLA donor characteristics, age, sex mismatching (male recipient-female donor), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) mismatching (positive recipient-negative donor) impacted OS. Multivariate subgroup analysis showed that OS was similar after HSCT from the youngest 9/10 MMUD (<30 years) compared with the oldest 10/10 MUD (>40 years) (HR, 1.18; P=.25) and also in male patients transplanted from female 10/10 MUD compared with male 9/10 MMUD (HR, .89; P=.46). In contrast, OS of CMV-positive patients tended to be better with CMV-negative 10/10 MUDs compared with CMV-positive 9/10 MMUDs (HR, 1.31; P = .04). Because of low patient numbers in subgroups, definite conclusions and establishment of a hierarchy among HLA matching and non-HLA donor characteristics could not be made. Our data suggest that the impact of donor age and sex mismatch but not CMV mismatch on outcome of allogeneic HSCT may be comparable with that of single HLA disparity.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

The pathophysiology of myelodysplastic syndrome involves recurrent genetic mutations, especially in genes controlling epigenetic regulation. Although the pathophysiology of diabetes is not well understood, several studies suggest a role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here for the first time the case of a 75-year-old Caucasian man who was treated for both diabetes and acute myeloid leukemia secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome, with a temporal association between glycemic dysregulation and the intake of 5-azacitidine. In fact, 2-3 days after starting each 7-day cycle of 5-azacitidine, he reported higher blood glucose levels, requiring an increased dose of self-administered insulin. CONCLUSION: This observation could help to understand the pathophysiology of these two conditions and could encourage physicians to monitor blood glucose levels in patients under hypomethylating agent with a history of diabetes.",,"['Ponard, Antoine', 'Ferreira-Maldent, Nicole', 'Ertault, Marjan', 'Delain, Martine', 'Amraoui, Kamel', 'Regina, Sandra', 'Jonville-Bera, Annie-Pierre', 'Herault, Olivier', 'Colombat, Philippe', 'Gyan, Emmanuel']","['Ponard A', 'Ferreira-Maldent N', 'Ertault M', 'Delain M', 'Amraoui K', 'Regina S', 'Jonville-Bera AP', 'Herault O', 'Colombat P', 'Gyan E']","[""Service d'hematologie et therapie cellulaire, Centre hospitalier universitaire, 2 boulevard Tonnelle, 37044, Tours, France."", 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite Francois Rabelais, Tours, France.', 'Service de medecine interne, Centre hospitalier universitaire, Tours, France.', ""Service d'hematologie et therapie cellulaire, Centre hospitalier universitaire, 2 boulevard Tonnelle, 37044, Tours, France."", ""Service d'hematologie et therapie cellulaire, Centre hospitalier universitaire, 2 boulevard Tonnelle, 37044, Tours, France."", ""Service d'hematologie et therapie cellulaire, Centre hospitalier universitaire, 2 boulevard Tonnelle, 37044, Tours, France."", 'Pole Sante Leonard de Vinci, Chambray-les-Tours, France.', 'Centre regional de pharmacovigilance, Service de pharmacologie clinique, Centre hospitalier universitaire, Tours, France.', ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Centre hospitalier universitaire, Tours, France."", 'Laboratoire LNOx, ERL CNRS 7001, Universite de Tours, Tours, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite Francois Rabelais, Tours, France.', ""Service d'hematologie et therapie cellulaire, Centre hospitalier universitaire, 2 boulevard Tonnelle, 37044, Tours, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Centre hospitalier universitaire, Tours, France."", 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite Francois Rabelais, Tours, France.', ""Service d'hematologie et therapie cellulaire, Centre hospitalier universitaire, 2 boulevard Tonnelle, 37044, Tours, France. emmanuel.gyan@univ-tours.fr."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, Centre hospitalier universitaire, Tours, France. emmanuel.gyan@univ-tours.fr."", 'Laboratoire LNOx, ERL CNRS 7001, Universite de Tours, Tours, France. emmanuel.gyan@univ-tours.fr.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite Francois Rabelais, Tours, France. emmanuel.gyan@univ-tours.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180703,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/etiology/genetics/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology']",2018/07/04 06:00,2019/04/11 06:00,['2018/07/04 06:00'],"['2017/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-018-1690-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-018-1690-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2018 Jul 3;12(1):199. doi: 10.1186/s13256-018-1690-3.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Diabetes', 'Hypomethylating agent', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome']",1,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9199-3225'],PMC6029345,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our understanding of the developmental trajectories linking the multipotent hematopoietic stem cell to the mature functional B-lymphocyte is extensive as a result of efforts to identify and prospectively isolate progenitors at defined maturation stages. The identification of defined progenitor compartments has been instrumental for the resolution of the molecular features that defines given developmental stages as well as for our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the progressive maturation process. Over the last years it has become increasingly clear that the regulatory networks that control normal B-cell differentiation are targeted by mutations in human B-lineage malignancies. This generates a most interesting link between development and disease that can be explored to improve diagnosis and treatment protocols in lymphoid malignancies.

During myeloid differentiation specific transcription factors are expressed at crucial developmental stages. However, precise mechanism controlling the diversification of myeloid progenitors is largely unknown, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factors have been characterized as key regulators of the development and function of the myeloid system. Past data point at functional redundancy among C/EBP family members during myeloid differentiation. In this study, we show that in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, high expression of vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) is needed for strong and sustained upregulation of CEBPB gene, while the moderate expression of VDR is sufficient for upregulation of CEBPD in response to 1,25D. The high expression level of the gene encoding for retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) allows for high and sustained expression of CEBPB, which becomes decreased along with a decrease of RARA expression.

The peptides showed 0(-)15% cytotoxicity at 5(-)100 microM in human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SK-OV-3) cells while they exhibited 0(-)12% toxicity in human leukemia cancer cell line (CCRF-CEM). Among all peptides, cyclic [HR](4) peptide was able to improve the delivery of a cell impermeable fluorescence-labeled phosphopeptide by two-fold. Fatty acids of different alkyl chain length were attached at the N-terminal of the linear peptide (HR)(4) to improve the molecular transporter property. Addition of fatty acyl chains was expected to help with the permeation of the peptides through the cell membrane. Thus, we synthesized seven fatty acyl derivatives of the linear (HR)(4) peptide. The peptides were synthesized using Fmoc/tBu solid phase peptide chemistry, purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) spectrometry. The fatty acyl peptides containing C(8), C12, C14, and C18 alkyl chain did not show cytotoxicity on SK-OV-3 or CCRF-CEM cell lines up to 50 microM concentration; however, at higher concentration (100 microM), they showed mild cytotoxicity. For example, C16-(HR)(4) was also found to reduce the proliferation of SK-OV-3 cells by 11% at 50 microM and C20-(HR)(4) showed mild toxicity at 10 microM, reducing the proliferation of SK-OV-3 cells by 21%. Increase in the length of alkyl chain showed cytotoxicity to the cell lines. C20-(HR)(4) peptide showed better efficiency in translocation of F'-GpYEEI to SK-OV-3 than the phosphopeptide alone. Further investigation of C20-(HR)(4) peptide efficacy showed that the peptide could deliver doxorubicin and epirubicin into SK-OV-3 and also improved the drug antiproliferative ability.

The peptide binds to DLX-4 target sites on the regulatory region of the globin gene cluster with native-like affinity and specificity in vitro.

PTEN is one of the tumor suppressors that are frequently found deficient in patients with late-stage cancers or leukemias. In this study we demonstrate that a MAPK inhibitor, PD98059, inhibits both AKT and ERK phosphorylation in a human myeloid leukemia cell line (TF-1), but not in PTEN-deficient leukemia cells (TF-1a). Ectopic expression of wild-type PTEN in myeloid leukemia cells restored cytokine responsiveness at physiological concentrations of GM-CSF (<0.02ng/mL) and significantly improved cell sensitivity to MAPK inhibitor. We also found that Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) was constitutively over-expressed in cytokine-independent TF-1a cells, and ectopic expression of PTEN down-regulated EGR1 expression and restored dynamics of EGR1 expression in response to GM-CSF stimulation. Data from primary bone marrow cells from mice with Pten deletion further supports that PTEN is indispensible for myeloid leukemia cells in response to MAPK inhibitors. Finally, We demonstrate that the absence of EGR1 expression dynamics in response to GM-CSF stimulation is one of the mechanisms underlying drug resistance to MAPK inhibitors in leukemia cells with PTEN deficiency. Our data suggest a novel mechanism of PTEN in regulating expression of EGR1 in hematopoietic cells in response to cytokine stimulation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that PTEN is dispensable for myeloid leukemia cells in response to MAPK inhibitors, and PTEN regulates EGR1 expression and contributes to the cytokine sensitivity in leukemia cells.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

Methods: The study included bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 122 patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia. Detection of the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson fusion gene (BCR-ABL1) was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization with a dual-color dual-fusion translocation probe, and MMR analysis was performed using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Results: Variant translocation was determined in 10 samples and a deletion on the derivative chromosome 9 (del/der(9)) was found in 20 samples. The rates of CCyR and MMR were similar between patients with reciprocal translocation, variant translocation, deletion of derivative BCR, or ABL1-BCR fusion gene. The Kaplan-Meier test did not show any significant differences in the rates of CCyR and MMR among those groups of patients.

This study aimed to assess the phenotypic diversity of LPCs in adult patients with Ph+ B-Acute ALL (B-ALL) and to assess its prognostic impact. Methods: Seventy adults with newly diagnosed Ph+ B-ALL were recruited at the Mansoura Oncology Center. Multiparameter flow cytometry studies of mononuclear blast cells for cluster of differentiation (CD)34, CD38, and CD58 were performed. Results: Seventeen patients had blasts with the pattern of LPCs (CD34+CD38-CD58-), while 53 cases had other diverse phenotypic patterns. The rate of complete response was significantly lower in patients with the LPC phenotype (47% vs. 81%, P=0.006). The median time to achieve a complete response was prolonged in patients with the CD34+CD38-CD58- phenotype (48 vs. 32 days, P=0.016). The three-year overall survival was significantly lower in patients with the CD34+CD38-CD58- phenotype (37% vs. 55% respectively, P=0.028). Multivariate analysis showed that the CD34+CD38- CD58- phenotype was an independent risk factor for overall survival. Conclusion: The presence of CD34+CD38-CD58- LPCs at diagnosis allows rapid identification of higher risk patients.

However, the clinical manifestations and treatment courses for CMV-associated thrombocytopenia in immunocompetent children are unclear. Methods: Medical records of the children who suffered from thrombocytopenia, and showed positive CMV polymerase chain reaction and CMV-like symptoms were retrospectively analyzed at three university hospitals in Daegu from January 2000 to March 2017. Patients suffering from leukemia, immunodeficiency, and other infections were excluded. Results: Among 1,065 children with thrombocytopenia, 29 (2.7%) displayed CMV-associated thrombocytopenia. The median age at diagnosis was 15 months and the median platelet count was 26,000/microL. They were classified into the CMV-induced thrombocytopenia (23/29) and CMV-related secondary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP, 6/29) groups. Fourteen subjects had hepatic dysfunction, four had Evans syndrome, two had pneumonitis, and one had gastritis. IVIG was used for 21 patients, and six patients among them showed recurrence, for whom IVIG or antiviral therapy was used. All, except one, recurrent or chronic cases belonged to the CMV-induced thrombocytopenia group. Antiviral therapy was used more frequently for the CMV-induced thrombocytopenia group (8/23, 34.8%) than for the CMV-related secondary ITP group (0/6); however, the results were not statistically significant (P=0.148). Conclusion: CMV is a rare but unique etiology of thrombocytopenia, and observed even in healthy children after the neonatal period.

However, the types, pattern of presentation and treatment outcomes vary across regions. We assessed the presentation and overall survival over an 11-year period in adult patients presenting with haematologic cancers in Jos, North Central Nigeria. Materials and Methods: This retrospective outcome study evaluated patients who presented with haematologic malignancies between 2005-2015 at the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH), Jos. Variables of interest were abstracted through chart reviews. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate baseline and follow-up parameters. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Sixty patients, contributing 25,994 person-days of follow-up were evaluated. The mean age was 43+17 years and 61.7% were males. Thirty-one patients (51.7%) presented with leukemia, 45.0% with lymphoma, and 3.3% with multiple myeloma. Forty-two (70.0%) presented with advanced disease, 5 (5.2%) were HIV positive and 4 (6.7%) had died at the end of follow-up. OS was 84.3% (95% CI: 58.1-94.7).

The aims of our study were to determine the incidence and clinical course of acute hepatitis and the important factors for its development in patients with leukemia after chemotherapy. Materials and methods: All patients with the diagnosis of leukemia who were treated at the Department of Hematology between January 2008 and January 2013 were included in the study. A detailed medical history, clinical and laboratory findings, treatment modalities, complications, and clinical course were recorded retrospectively. Results: A total of 124 patients (64 females) with the diagnosis of leukemia were included in the study. The mean age was 45.2 years (16-89 years) and mean follow-up time was 29.7 months (0.25-192 months). A total of 43 (34.6%) patients had acute hepatitis after chemotherapy. Pattern of liver injury was hepatocellular in 31 patients, cholestasis in 2, and mix in 10 patients. Age (p = 0.001), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg, p = 0.007), acute leukemia (p < 0.001), positive blood culture (p = 0.004), the amount of transfused red blood cell (p = 0.001), and amount of transfused platelets (p = 0.002) were significantly different under univariate analysis between the acute hepatitis group and the nonacute hepatitis group. Under multivariate analysis, only acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was identified as independent predictive factor for development of acute hepatitis after starting chemotherapy. Conclusion: Acute and self-limited hepatitis develops in the substantial proportion of patients with leukemia. The most important factor for development of acute hepatitis is the type of leukemia.How to cite this article: Kaya M, Akdogan R, Ucmak F, Ayyildiz MO, Karakus A, Kaplan MA.

However, only half of patients respond and almost all patients eventually relapse. Limited and conflicting data are available on predictive factors influencing response. We analyzed 128 patients from two institutions with MDS or AML treated with azacitidine to identify prognostic indicators. Genetic mutations in ASXL1, RUNX1, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, TET2, TP53, NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, KMT2A-PTD, EZH2, SF3B1, and SRSF2 were assessed by next-generation sequencing. With a median follow up of 5.6 years median survival was 1.3 years with a response rate of 49%. The only variable with significant influence on response was del(20q). All 6 patients responded (p = 0.012) but survival was not improved. No other clinical, cytogenetic or molecular marker for response or survival was identified. Interestingly, patients from poor-risk groups as high-risk cytogenetics (55%), t-MDS/AML (54%), TP53 mutated (48%) or relapsed after chemotherapy (60%) showed a high response rate. Factors associated with shorter survival were low platelets, AML vs. MDS, therapy-related disease, TP53 and KMT2A-PTD. In multivariate analysis anemia, platelets, FLT3-ITD, and therapy-related disease remained in the model. Poor-risk factors such as del(7q)/-7, complex karyotype, ASXL1, RUNX1, EZH2, and TP53 did not show an independent impact. Thus, no clear biomarker for response and survival can be identified.

We previously reported that uPAR and CXCR4 can be regulated by common microRNAs in leukemia cells. Transcripts containing response elements for shared microRNAs in their 3'UTR may regulate their availability. We investigated uPAR 3'UTR capability to recruit microRNAs, thus regulating the expression of their targets. uPAR 3'UTR transfection in KG1 leukemia cells up-regulates the expression of endogenous uPAR. Transfection of uPAR 3'UTR, inserted downstream a reporter gene, increases uPAR expression and simultaneously down-regulates the reporter gene expression. Transfection of uPAR 3'UTR also increases CXCR4 expression; accordingly, uPAR silencing induces down-regulation of CXCR4 expression, through a mechanism involving Dicer, the endoribonuclease required for microRNA maturation. Transfection of uPAR 3'UTR also increases the expression of pro-tumoral factors and modulates cell adhesion and migration, consistently with the capability of uPAR3'UTR-recruited microRNAs to target several and different transcripts and, thus, functions. Finally, we found 3'UTR-containing variants of uPAR transcript in U937 leukemia cells, which show higher levels of uPAR expression as compared to KG1 cells, in which these variants are not detected.

Treatment outcomes for aggressive subtypes of ATL remain poor, with little improvement in overall survival since HTLV-1 was discovered. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies for ATL are required. STF-62247 induces autophagy and selectively kills renal cell carcinoma without apoptotic cell death. Here, we demonstrate that STF-62247 reduced cell viability and resulted in autophagosome accumulation and autophagy in leukemic cell lines (S1T, MT-2, and Jurkat). Interestingly, STF-62247 induced apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected cell lines (S1T and MT-2), as indicated by DNA fragmentation and caspase activation, but not in non-HTLV-1-infected Jurkat cells; a caspase inhibitor did not prevent this caspase-associated cell death. STF-62247 also increased nuclear endonuclease G levels. Furthermore, STF-62247 reduced cell viability and increased the number of apoptotic cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from patients with acute ATL, which has a poor prognosis. Therefore, STF-62247 may have novel therapeutic potential for ATL.

Therapeutic agents used in the treatment of cancer can impact the immune system in a quantitative and qualitative manner. In this study, we evaluated the impact of arsenic trioxide (ATO) used in the management of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) on NK cell reconstitution and function. In patients with APL treated with single agent ATO, there was a significant delay in the reconstitution of circulating NK cells to reach median normal levels from the time of diagnosis (655 days for NK cells vs 145 and 265 days for T cells and B cells, respectively). In vitro experiments demonstrated that ATO significantly reduced the CD34 hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation to NK cells. Additional experimental data demonstrate that CD34(+) sorted cells when exposed to ATO lead to a significant decrease in the expression of IKZF2, ETS1, and TOX transcription factors involved in NK cell differentiation and maturation. In contrast, exposure of NK cells and leukemic cells to low doses of ATO modulates NK cell receptors and malignant cell ligand profile in a direction that enhances NK cell mediated cytolytic activity. We have demonstrated that NK cytolytic activity toward NB4 cell line when exposed to ATO was significantly higher when compared with controls. We also validated this beneficial effect in a mouse model of APL were the median survival with ATO alone and ATO + NK was 44 days (range: 33-46) vs 54 days (range: 52-75). In conclusion, ATO has a differential quantitative and qualitative effect on NK cell activity.

Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) adoptive infusion therapy may be conducive to tumour remission by boosting physical immunity. Furthermore, programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blockade immunotherapy has shown tremendous success in many cancer therapies. METHOD: We attempted to combine these two immunotherapy strategies to intervene in AML by generating AML cellspecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo with an AML cell strain expressing specific antigens. RESULTS: First, we observed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) could be induced to generate large numbers of CD8(+) CTL cells through immune stimulation. In addition, these CD8(+) cells could effectively recognize a human AML cell line and exert cytotoxicity. In animal tests, PD-1 blockade combined with CTL infusion could induce significantly more AML tumour reduction than either treatment alone. This synergistic effect was thought to be connected to immune modulation enhancement, as regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood (PB) were found to be suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: This finding suggested the potential application of PD-1 blockade in AML. The present work demonstrated an excellent synergistic tumour therapeutic effect of PD-1 blockade and CTL therapy compared with either treatment alone.",,"['Deng, Rui', 'Fan, Fang-Yi', 'Yi, Hai', 'Liu, Fang', 'He, Guang-Cui', 'Sun, Hao-Ping', 'Su, Yi']","['Deng R', 'Fan FY', 'Yi H', 'Liu F', 'He GC', 'Sun HP', 'Su Y']","[""a Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Immunotherapy Center , Cheng Du Military General Hospital of PLA , Cheng Du , People's Republic of China."", ""a Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Immunotherapy Center , Cheng Du Military General Hospital of PLA , Cheng Du , People's Republic of China."", ""a Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Immunotherapy Center , Cheng Du Military General Hospital of PLA , Cheng Du , People's Republic of China."", ""a Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Immunotherapy Center , Cheng Du Military General Hospital of PLA , Cheng Du , People's Republic of China."", ""a Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Immunotherapy Center , Cheng Du Military General Hospital of PLA , Cheng Du , People's Republic of China."", ""a Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Immunotherapy Center , Cheng Du Military General Hospital of PLA , Cheng Du , People's Republic of China."", ""a Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Immunotherapy Center , Cheng Du Military General Hospital of PLA , Cheng Du , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180630,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', '*CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology/transplantation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2018/07/03 06:00,2018/11/02 06:00,['2018/07/03 06:00'],"['2018/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2018.1486357 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Dec;23(10):740-746. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2018.1486357.

According to new reports, it is suggested that proliferating cells, such as human trophoblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and malignant tumors, can excrete progesterone-induced blocking factor at high ratio to escape from maternal immunity. It is shown in recent studies that progesterone-induced blocking factor is overexpressed in many malignant tumors such as breast, cervical, lymphoma, and leukemia. There are no data about progesterone-induced blocking factor expression in ovarian cancer cells. Hence, it is aimed to determine the progesterone-induced blocking factor expression levels in epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS: The study which was a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in a University Hospital. Twenty tissue specimens of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and 20 tissue specimens of patients with healthy ovary were included in the study. Primary rabbit polyclonal anti- progesterone-induced blocking factor antibody was used to incubate the sections at a ratio of 1:300. RESULTS: When the tissue sections were compared based on immunostaining with progesterone-induced blocking factor, we detected high stromal progesterone-induced blocking factor expression in the epithelial ovarian cancer group as check against to the normal ovarian group ( P = .007). Similarly, we found high glandular progesterone-induced blocking factor expression in the epithelial ovarian cancer group as check against to the normal ovarian group ( P < .001). CONCLUSION: Proving the existence of progesterone-induced blocking factor expression in epithelial ovarian cancer cells may lead new visions or new studies for epithelial ovarian cancer immunotherapy. As a result, epithelial ovarian cancer cells have greater levels of expression of progesterone-induced blocking factor protein than normal ovarian tissue according to immunohistochemistry. Further research is needed to understand the clinical importance of this finding, to learn outcomes of high levels of progesterone-induced blocking factor, and to investigate its underlying mechanisms.",,"['Madendag, Yusuf', 'Sahin, Erdem', 'Madendag, Ilknur Col', 'Sahin, Mefkure Eraslan', 'Acmaz, Gokhan', 'Karaman, Hatice']","['Madendag Y', 'Sahin E', 'Madendag IC', 'Sahin ME', 'Acmaz G', 'Karaman H']","['1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Health Sciences University Kayseri Education and Research Hospital, Kayseri, Turkey.', '1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Health Sciences University Kayseri Education and Research Hospital, Kayseri, Turkey.', '1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Health Sciences University Kayseri Education and Research Hospital, Kayseri, Turkey.', '2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey.', '1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Health Sciences University Kayseri Education and Research Hospital, Kayseri, Turkey.', '3 Department of Pathology Clinic, Health Sciences University Kayseri Education and Research Hospital, Kayseri, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PIBF1 protein, human)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial/*immunology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Suppressor Factors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Escape/*physiology']",2018/07/03 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/07/03 06:00'],"['2018/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1533033818783911 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2018 Jan 1;17:1533033818783911. doi: 10.1177/1533033818783911.,['NOTNLM'],"['*PIBF', '*epithelial ovarian cancer', '*immunostaining', '*progesterone-induced blocking factor', '*selective immunological tolerance']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7622-2991'],PMC6048602,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the progress in human leucocyte antigen (HLA) antigen typing technology and supportive care, the outcomes of thalassaemia major have greatly improved in recent years, even in high-risk patients. However, the problem of finding a suitable donor is still a major obstacle to curing these patients. In recent decades, the lack of available HSCT donors has led to the increased use of haploidentical donors (HDs) for HSCT in haematological malignancies. Recently, we explored the effect of HD HSCT to eight children with thalassaemia major based on the FBCA conditioning regimen (fludarabine, busulphan, cyclophosphamide, antithymocyte globulin), which is usually used in leukaemia patients receiving haploidentical HSCT in our centre. So far, all of the transplanted patients have a stable engraftment and are transfusion independent in daily life. This encouraging result has revised our previous conception about haploidentical HCST for thalassaemia major and strongly suggests that HD HSCT is a feasible and safe method for thalassaemia major patients.","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

This study aimed to explore the mutational spectrum and prognostic factors of AML-M0 and M1. METHODS: Sixty-five AML patients derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were enrolled in this study. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to depict the mutational spectrum of each patient. Clinical characteristics at diagnosis, including peripheral blood (PB) white blood cell counts (WBC), blast percentages in PB and bone marrow (BM), FAB subtypes and the frequencies of known recurrent genetic mutations were described. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methods and log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were constructed for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), using a limited backward elimination procedure. RESULTS: Forty-six patients had more than five recurrent genetic mutations. FLT3 had the highest mutation frequency (n=20, 31%), followed by NPM1 (n=18, 28%), DNMT3A (n=16, 25%), IDH1 (n=14, 22%), IDH2 (n=12, 18%), RUNX1 (n=11, 17%) and TET2 (n=7, 11%). Univariate analysis showed that age >/=60 years and TP53 mutations had adverse effect on EFS (P=0.015, P=0.036, respectively) and OS (P=0.003, P=0.004, respectively), WBC count >/=50x109/L and FLT3-ITD negatively affected EFS (P=0.003, P=0.034, respectively), whereas NPM1 mutations had favorable effect on OS (P=0.035) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) on EFS and OS (all P< 0.001). Multivariate analysis suggested that allo-HSCT and NPM1 mutations were independent favorable prognostic factors for EFS and OS (all P< 0.05), WBC count >/=50x109/L was an independent risk factor for EFS (P=0.002) and TP53 mutations for OS (P=0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided new insights into the mutational spectrum and molecular signatures of AML-M0 and M1. We proposed that FLT3-ITD, NPM1 and TP53 be identified as markers for risk stratification of AML-M0 and M1. Patients with AML-M0 and M1 would likely benefit from allo-HSCT.","['(c) 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

HE can be one of the dominant manifestations of a hematopoietic myeloid neoplasm or secondary/reactive to an underlying medical condition. If a cause of HE and its associated tissue/organ damage is not determined, the condition is considered to be idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). The work-up of HE can be challenging due to a broad range of causes of HE that can be either reactive or neoplastic. In recent years, with the advent of molecular genetic testing and the introduction of targeted therapy in the management of these patients, there is a growing interest in better characterization of these diseases. Using a multimodality approach and following a proper -algorithm, a diagnosis can be made in a large proportion of patients. In idiopathic HES, myeloid neoplasm associated -somatic mutations as evidence of clonality are reported in -20-25% patients; however, the mutation data should be -interpreted cautiously considering the prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Bone marrow morphology has been shown to have important value in the identification of a true myeloid neoplasm in these disorders. A genome-wide study may be needed to understand the ""idiopathic"" cases that would ultimately lead to better patient care.","['(c) 2018 S.

METHODS: The study population included all diagnostic medical radiation workers enrolled in the National Dosimetry Registry (NDR) between 1996 and 2011. NDR data were linked with mortality data obtained from national registries through 2015. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and relative standardised mortality ratios (rSMRs) were calculated for external comparison and for adjustment of the cohort's overall healthiness. RESULTS: A total of 1099 deaths (974 in men and 125 in women) were reported from among 80 837 medical radiation workers. The SMRs for all causes of death were significantly lower than expected in both men (SMR 0.45, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.48) and women (SMR 0.49, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58). No excesses were observed for any specific cause of death. The findings were similar by job title, calendar year of entry and year of birth. However, relative to all causes of death, mortality from all cancers (rSMR 1.60, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.82), leukaemia, colon cancer, stomach cancer and diseases of the circulatory system increased significantly among male workers. The results for female workers were limited due to small number of deaths; however, the rSMR for all cancers was significantly elevated (rSMR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.46). CONCLUSIONS: This cohort showed lower mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers than in the general population. However, occupational factors may have been involved in the increased relative mortality for several causes of death.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. No commercial re-use.

The crystal structure was determined by X-ray diffraction method and the polymeric complex crystallizes in the triclinic P-1 space group. The stability of Ag(I) complex was verified by (1)H and (13)C NMR measurements and the interaction with calf thymus DNA through UV-VIS and fluorescence quenching experiments was studied. The Ag(I) complex was able to interact with DNA by dual binding mode: partial intercalation along groove binding. The binding constants were calculated to be in the order of 10(3)M(-1).

There is scarce evidence about optimal surveillance schedules and methods for detection of tumour relapse after therapy. METHODS: The Renal Tumour Study Group-International Society of Paediatric Oncology (RTSG-SIOP) Wilms' tumour 2001 trial and study is an international, multicentre, prospective registration, biological study with an embedded randomised clinical trial for children with renal tumours aged between 6 months and 18 years. The study covers 243 different centres in 27 countries grouped into five consortia. The current protocol of SIOP surveillance for Wilms' tumour recommends that abdominal ultrasound and chest x-ray should be done every 3 months for the first 2 years after treatment and be repeated every 4-6 months in the third and fourth year and annually in the fifth year. In this retrospective cohort study of the protocol database, we analysed data from participating institutions on timing, anatomical site, and mode of detection of all first relapses of Wilms' tumour. The primary outcomes were how relapse of Wilms' tumour was detected (ie, at or between scheduled surveillance and with or without clinical symptoms, scan modality, and physical examination) and to estimate the number of scans needed to capture one subclinical relapse. The RTSG-SIOP study is registered with Eudra-CT, number 2007-004591-39. FINDINGS: Between June 26, 2001, and May 8, 2015, of 4271 eligible patients in the 2001 RTSG-SIOP Wilms' tumour database, 538 (13%) relapsed. Median follow-up from surgery was 62 months (IQR 32-93). The method used to detect relapse was registered for 410 (76%) of 538 relapses. Planned surveillance imaging captured 289 (70%) of these 410 relapses. The primary imaging modality used to detect relapse was reported for 251 patients, among which relapse was identified by abdominal ultrasound (80 [32%] patients), chest x-ray (78 [31%]), CT scan of the chest (64 [25%]) or abdomen (20 [8%]), and abdominal MRI (nine [4%]). 279 (68%) of 410 relapses were not detectable by physical examination and 261 (64%) patients did not have clinical symptoms at relapse. The estimated number of scans needed to detect one subclinical relapse during the first 2 years after nephrectomy was 112 (95% CI 106-119) and, for 2-5 years after nephrectomy, 500 (416-588). INTERPRETATION: Planned surveillance imaging captured more than two-thirds of predominantly asymptomatic relapses of Wilms' tumours, with most detected by abdominal ultrasound, chest x-ray, or chest CT scan. Beyond 2 years post-nephrectomy, a substantial number of surveillance scans are needed to capture one relapse, which places a burden on families and health-care systems.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified 223 adult patients (age >/= 18 y) with hematologic malignancies, including lymphoma (n = 163), leukemia (n = 49), and others (n = 11), who had a port placed from 2012 to 2015. Early (< 30 d after port placement) and overall port infections (bloodstream and site infections) were recorded. To elucidate clinical predictors for early and overall port infections, proportional subdistribution hazard regression (PSHREG) analyses were conducted with variables including patients' demographics, medications used, laboratory data, and port characteristics. RESULTS: Total duration of follow-up was 83,722 catheter-days (median per patient, 274 catheter-days). Early and overall port infections were identified in 8 (3.6%) and 26 (11.7%) patients, respectively. Early and overall infection rates were 1.2 and 0.3 infections/1,000 catheter-days, respectively. Backward stepwise multivariate PSHREG analyses identified hypoalbuminemia (< 3.5 mg/dL) at the time of port placement (hazard ratio = 5.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-22.16; P = .03) and steroid use (> 30 d cumulatively during follow-up period) (hazard ratio = 3.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-7.47; P = .002) as independent risk factors for early and overall port infections, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients with hematologic malignancies, hypoalbuminemia at the time of port placement was a clinical predictor for early port infections, whereas steroid use was a clinical predictor for overall port infections.",['Copyright (c) 2018 SIR.

However, the standards widely used in laboratories are mainly based on plasmids or cDNA, which cannot accurately reflect the process of RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Therefore, we aimed to develop armored RNA-based standards for p210 and p190 BCR-ABL1FG transcripts' quantification. METHODS: Using overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, we first linked a segment of the p210 or p190 BCR-ABL1FG transcript with four control genes (CGs; ABL1, BCR, GUSB, and B2M) to form p210FG-CG and p190FG-CG. Subsequently, using armored RNA technology, we prepared p210FG-CG- and p190FG-CG-armored RNAs and the p210FG-CG and p190FG-CG standards, the values of which were assigned by digital PCR (dPCR). RESULTS: The p210FG-CG and p190FG-CG standards were stable and homogeneous, and were significantly linear with r(2) > 0.98. A field trial including 52 laboratories across China showed that the coefficient of variation (CV%) of BCR-ABL1 values among samples was in the range of 58.6%-129.6% for p210 samples and 73.2%-194.0% for p190 samples when using local standards. By contrast, when using the p210FG-CG and p190FG-CG standards, the CV% of BCR-ABL1 values was decreased to 35.6%-124.9% and 36.6%-170.6% for p210 and p190 samples, respectively. In addition, 33.3% (3/9) of the p210 and p190 samples had CV% values <50.0%, whereas 44.4% (4/9) and 77.8% (7/9) of the samples had lower CV% values when using the p210FG-CG and p190FG-CG standards. CONCLUSION: The overall variability of detection of BCR-ABL1 transcripts decreased significantly when using the p210FG-CG or p190FG-CG standards, especially the p190FG-CG standard.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Fu, Yu', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Wu, Qisheng', 'Zhang, Jiawei', 'Bao, Lihua', 'Li, Jinming']","['Fu Y', 'Zhang R', 'Wu Q', 'Zhang J', 'Bao L', 'Li J']","['National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Beijing, China.', 'Graduate School, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Beijing Engineering Research Center of Laboratory Medicine, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Engineering Research Center of Laboratory Medicine, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Beijing, China.', 'Graduate School, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Engineering Research Center of Laboratory Medicine, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Beijing, China.', 'Graduate School, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Engineering Research Center of Laboratory Medicine, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Beijing, China.', 'Graduate School, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Engineering Research Center of Laboratory Medicine, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['81601848/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '7174345/Beijing Natural Science Foundation', '201402018/The Special Fund for Health Scientific Research in the Public Interest', ""from National Population and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic"", 'of China']",['Journal Article'],20180629,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Normal Distribution', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Reference Values']",2018/07/01 06:00,2018/12/15 06:00,['2018/07/01 06:00'],"['2018/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.22612 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2018 Nov;32(9):e22612. doi: 10.1002/jcla.22612.

They play an important role in the differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into adipocytes. However, the role of microRNAs in this process remains to be poorly understood. Here, we observed that miR-377-3p expression was markedly decreased during adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Overexpression of miR-377-3p decreased adipocyte differentiation and downregulated the expression of adipogenic markers. Meanwhile, bioinformatics-based studies suggested that LIFR is a target of miR-377-3p. Further analysis confirmed that expression of LIFR present markedly increased during adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs. In addition, downregulation expression of LIFR significantly inhibited the process of adipocyte differentiation. To confirm the relation between miR-377-3p and LIFR, luciferase reporter assays were carried out. The results indicated that miR-377-3p bound directly to the 3'-untranslated region of LIFR. These data indicate that miR-377-3p suppressed adipogenesis of hMSCs by targeting LIFR, which provides novel insights into the molecular mechanism of miRNA-mediated cellular differentiation.",,"['Li, Xingnuan', 'Yang, Yaofang', 'Yan, Ruiqiao', 'Xu, Xiaoyuan', 'Gao, Liyun', 'Mei, Jun', 'Liu, Jianyun', 'Wang, Xinping', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Wu, Ping', 'Li, Weidong', 'Zhao, Zhijun', 'Xiong, Jianjun', 'Wang, Tao']","['Li X', 'Yang Y', 'Yan R', 'Xu X', 'Gao L', 'Mei J', 'Liu J', 'Wang X', 'Zhang J', 'Wu P', 'Li W', 'Zhao Z', 'Xiong J', 'Wang T']","[""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical Skills Center, Affiliated Hospital of Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, 601 Jinsui Road, Xinxiang, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Ningxia Key Laboratory of Clinical and Pathogenic Microbiology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China. jianjunxiong409@163.com."", ""Key Laboratory of System Bio-medicine of Jiangxi Province, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, Jiangxi, People's Republic of China. comwangtaocom@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['81460221/the National Natural Science Foundation of China', '20161BAB205197/Jiangxi Province Natural Science Foundation']",['Journal Article'],20180629,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (MIRN377 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", '*Adipogenesis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism']",2018/07/01 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/07/01 06:00'],"['2018/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-018-3366-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-018-3366-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2018 Dec;449(1-2):295-303. doi: 10.1007/s11010-018-3366-0.

Data on 169 children and adolescents with HR-AML who received their first allo-HSCT in first or second remission between 2000 and 2015 were extracted from a nationwide, Japanese HSCT registry. The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 55.2% (95% CI, 46.8-62.9%) and 69.6% (61.4-76.3%), respectively, for all the HR-AML patients. In univariate analysis, the cytogenetic subgroup had a significant impact on both the DFS (P = 0.011) and OS (P < 0.001) rates. In particular, 14 patients with t(16;21) showed an extremely poor outcome. Additionally, older age at allo-HSCT (10-19 years old, P = 0.025), myeloablative conditioning with total-body irradiation (P = 0.019), and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD, P = 0.049) were associated with inferior OS. The donor type and occurrence of chronic GVHD did not affect the outcome. Multivariate analysis revealed t(16;21) to be associated with increased overall mortality (hazard ratio = 4.416, P < 0.001). Because the outcome of patients with certain HR-AML subgroups, such as t(16;21)-positive cases, is extremely poor even with allo-HSCT in remission, a novel therapy is urgently required.",,"['Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Yoshida, Masanori', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Miyamura, Takako', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Noguchi, Maiko', 'Kakuda, Harumi', 'Watanabe, Kenichiro', 'Cho, Yuko', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Shiba, Norio', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Okada, Keiko', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Hashii, Yoshiko', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Ishida, Hiroyuki']","['Tomizawa D', 'Yoshida M', 'Kondo T', 'Miyamura T', 'Taga T', 'Adachi S', 'Koh K', 'Noguchi M', 'Kakuda H', 'Watanabe K', 'Cho Y', 'Fukuda T', 'Kato M', 'Shiba N', 'Goto H', 'Okada K', 'Inoue M', 'Hashii Y', 'Atsuta Y', 'Ishida H']","[""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan. tomizawa-d@ncchd.go.jp."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Chiba Children's Hospital, Chiba, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shizuoka Children's Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', ""Division of Hemato/Oncology and Regenerative Medicine, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital, Osaka, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto City Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180629,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (FUS protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2018/07/01 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2018/07/01 06:00'],"['2018/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-018-0273-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-018-0273-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Mar;54(3):393-401. doi: 10.1038/s41409-018-0273-7.

We identified two drugs that together form an effective combination therapy against FLT3-ITD AML. One of the drugs, Sorafenib, an inhibitor of FLT3-ITD and other kinase activity, produces an impressive but short-lived remission in FLT3-ITD AML patients. The second, arsenic trioxide (ATO), at therapeutically achievable concentrations, reduces the level of FLT3-ITD and Mcl-1 proteins, and induces apoptosis in leukemic cell lines and in primary cells expressing FLT3-ITD. We linked this relative sensitivity to ATO to low levels of reduced glutathione. While producing proapoptotic effects, ATO treatment also has an unwanted effect whereby it causes the accumulation of the phosphorylated (inactive) form of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a kinase necessary for apoptosis. When ATO is combined with Sorafenib, GSK3beta is activated, Mcl-1 is further reduced, and proapoptotic proteins Bak and Bax are activated. Mice xenografted with FLT3-ITD MOLM13 cell line treated with the Sorafenib/ATO combination have significantly improved survival. This combination has potential to improve the therapeutic outcome of FLT3-ITD-targeted therapy of AML patients. Mol Cancer Ther; 17(9); 1871-80.

Approximately 20% of these patients die within 6 months (early death), and another 20% to 30% progress to myeloid leukemia (ML-DS) within their first 4 years of life. The aim of the multicenter, nonrandomized, historically controlled TMD Prevention 2007 trial was to evaluate the impact of low-dose cytarabine treatment on survival and prevention of ML-DS in patients with TMD. Patients received cytarabine (1.5 mg/kg for 7 days) in case of TMD-related symptoms at diagnosis (high white blood cell count, ascites, liver dysfunction, hydrops fetalis) or detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) 8 weeks after diagnosis. The 5-year probability of event-free and overall survival of 102 enrolled TMD patients was 72 +/- 5% and 91 +/- 3%, respectively. In patients eligible for treatment because of symptoms (n = 43), we observed a significantly lower cumulative incidence (CI) of early death as compared with symptomatic patients in the historical control (n = 45) (12 +/- 5% vs 33 +/- 7%, PGray = .02). None of the asymptomatic patients in the current study suffered early death. However, the treatment of symptomatic or MRD-positive patients did not result in a significantly lower CI of ML-DS (25 +/- 7% [treated] vs 14 +/- 7% [untreated], PGray = .34 [per protocol analysis]; historical control: 22 +/- 4%, PGray = .55). Thus, low-dose cytarabine treatment helped to reduce TMD-related mortality when compared with the historical control but was insufficient to prevent progression to ML-DS.

Cytarabine- and anthracycline-based chemotherapy induction regimens (7 + 3) remain the standard of care, and most patients have poor long-term survival. The reapproval of Mylotarg, an anti-CD33-calicheamicin antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), has demonstrated ADCs as a clinically validated option to enhance the effectiveness of induction therapy. We are interested in developing a next-generation ADC for AML to improve upon the initial success of Mylotarg. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression pattern of CLL-1 and its hematopoietic potential were investigated. A novel anti-CLL-1-ADC, with a highly potent pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer conjugated through a self-immolative disulfide linker, was developed. The efficacy and safety profiles of this ADC were evaluated in mouse xenograft models and in cynomolgus monkeys. RESULTS: We demonstrate that CLL-1 shares similar prevalence and trafficking properties that make CD33 an excellent ADC target for AML, but lacks expression on hematopoietic stem cells that hampers current CD33-targeted ADCs. Our anti-CLL-1-ADC is highly effective at depleting tumor cells in AML xenograft models and lacks target independent toxicities at doses that depleted target monocytes and neutrophils in cynomolgus monkeys. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data suggest that an anti-CLL-1-ADC has the potential to become an effective and safer treatment for AML in humans, by reducing and allowing for faster recovery from initial cytopenias than the current generation of ADCs for AML.",['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Zheng, Bing', 'Yu, Shang-Fan', 'Del Rosario, Geoffrey', 'Leong, Steven R', 'Lee, Genee Y', 'Vij, Rajesh', 'Chiu, Cecilia', 'Liang, Wei-Ching', 'Wu, Yan', 'Chalouni, Cecile', 'Sadowsky, Jack', 'Clark, Vanessa', 'Hendricks, Angela', 'Poon, Kirsten Achilles', 'Chu, Wayne', 'Pillow, Thomas', 'Schutten, Melissa M', 'Flygare, John', 'Polson, Andrew G']","['Zheng B', 'Yu SF', 'Del Rosario G', 'Leong SR', 'Lee GY', 'Vij R', 'Chiu C', 'Liang WC', 'Wu Y', 'Chalouni C', 'Sadowsky J', 'Clark V', 'Hendricks A', 'Poon KA', 'Chu W', 'Pillow T', 'Schutten MM', 'Flygare J', 'Polson AG']","['Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California. polson@gene.com zheng.bing@gene.com.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California. polson@gene.com zheng.bing@gene.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180629,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (CLEC12A protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*pharmacology', 'Lectins, C-Type/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Mitogen/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/genetics/immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2018/07/01 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2018/07/01 06:00'],"['2018/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-0333 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0333 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Feb 15;25(4):1358-1368. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0333.

Pimozide is a cationic amphiphilic drug (CAD); CADs block the synthesis of neutral lipids, impair cholesterol homeostasis of cancer cells and increase accumulation of diacylglycerol-3-phosphate. Pimozide exerts tumoricidal activity which was first shown for melanoma and neuroblastoma via proposed anti- dopaminergic effects. Recently, pancreas cancers are shown to elevate dopamine receptor-2 synthesis, which is blocked by pimozide leading growth inhibition. Besides binding to inner mitochondrial membrane and reducing cellular respiration, pimozide also inhibits calmodulin, T-type calcium channels and sigma-receptors which all correlate with tumor-inhibitory functions. Pimozide also exerts chemotherapy and radiotherapy-sensitizing effects in cancer cells and acts as an inhibitor of STAT-3 and STAT-5 signaling proteins with potential activity in leukemia, liver and prostate cancer. Pimozide also blocks stem cell features and Wnt-beta/catenin signaling in liver cancer. Pimozide interferes with Fatty Acid Protein Binding-4 and activates PPAR-gamma and it was proposed to alleviate cancer cachexia. Besides mechanisms of calmodulin and sigma-receptor associated pathways, pimozide was proposed to inhibit glioblastoma via serotonin receptor 5-HT7. Pimozide is a selective inducer of autophagy and also inhibits ubiquitine specific protease (USP-1) which may associate with its chemosensizing potential in lung cancer and glioblastoma. Via versatile mechanisms of tumoricidal actions and due to its highly traversing capability through the blood-brain barrier, pimozide highly deserves to be studied in animal models of drug resistant refractory cancers and glioblastoma, which have very poor prognosis.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Upon pharmacologic inhibition of the CBFbeta-SMMHC/RUNX1 interaction, RUNX1 shows increased binding at three MYC distal enhancers, where it represses MYC expression by mediating the replacement of the SWI/SNF complex component BRG1 with the polycomb-repressive complex component RING1B, leading to apoptosis. Combining the CBFbeta-SMMHC inhibitor with the BET inhibitor JQ1 eliminates inv(16) leukemia in human cells and a mouse model. Enhancer-interaction analysis indicated that the three enhancers are physically connected with the MYC promoter, and genome-editing analysis demonstrated that they are functionally implicated in deregulation of MYC expression.

The new category of disease is named hereditary myeloid disorder (HMD). Although most myeloid neoplasms are sporadic, germ line mutations and familial predisposition can contribute to development of chronic myeloid diseases and acute myeloid leukemia. This finding and upcoming frequent use of genome wide detection of molecular aberrations will lead to a higher detection rate of a genetic predisposition and influence treatment decisions. Hereditary predisposition is responsible for 5-10% of myeloid malignancies. Management of affected patients begins by the awareness of treating physicians of the problem and a precise work up of the patient and family members. Areas covered: This review focuses on current knowledge about germ line predisposition for myeloid neoplasms including diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic aspects in adult patients. Essential information for clinical routine is provided. Expert commentary: Compared to a patient without predisposition, adaptation of treatment strategy for patients with an HMD is often necessary, especially to avoid higher risk of relapse or higher toxicity during chemotherapy or transplantation. Mistakes in choice of a related donor can be omitted. Relatives at risk of developing a HMD need specific surveillance.",,"['Crysandt, Martina', 'Brings, Kira', 'Beier, Fabian', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Jost, Edgar']","['Crysandt M', 'Brings K', 'Beier F', 'Thiede C', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Jost E']","['a Medical Faculty, Dept. of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation , University Hospital RWTH Aachen , Aachen , Germany.', 'a Medical Faculty, Dept. of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation , University Hospital RWTH Aachen , Aachen , Germany.', 'a Medical Faculty, Dept. of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation , University Hospital RWTH Aachen , Aachen , Germany.', 'b Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I , Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der TU Dresden , Dresden , Germany.', 'a Medical Faculty, Dept. of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation , University Hospital RWTH Aachen , Aachen , Germany.', 'a Medical Faculty, Dept. of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation , University Hospital RWTH Aachen , Aachen , Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180723,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*genetics']",2018/06/30 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2018/06/30 06:00'],"['2018/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2018.1494566 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2018 Aug;11(8):625-636. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2018.1494566.

The deletions are mediated by illegitimate variable(diversity)joining recombination via cryptic recombination signal sequences (RSSs). We developed a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe set that can detect any type of IKZF1 deletion, including the commonly deleted exon 4 to 7 region. The probe set consists of a designed probe for the commonly deleted region (Cy3; red) and a bacterial artificial chromosomes clone probe for detecting the 3' flanking region (Spectrum Green). Intact IKZF1 showed a fusion signal, and the deleted allele showed loss of the red signal (0R1G1F). The FISH probes worked correctly for human leukemic cell lines and clinical samples. One case showed an atypical break-apart signal (1R1G1F). Inverse PCR of the case revealed rearrangement of the excised IKZF1 fragment into a legitimate RSS site at Ig kappa on chromosome 2, suggesting a pathogenic role of this recombination-activating gene 1/2-mediated event. In this study, we established FISH probe detecting IKZF1 deletion in a quick, quantitative, and cost-effective manner, and the results provided a novel insight into B-cell receptor editing by rearrangement of a cryptic RSS-mediated genomic fragment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia pathology.","['Copyright (c) 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

However, their expression patterns and regulatory functions during alltransretinoic acid (ATRA)induced APL differentiation remain to be fully elucidated. The profile of dysregulated lncRNAs between three bone marrow (BM) samples from patients with APL postinduction and three BM samples from untreated matched controls was examined with the Human Transcriptome Array 2.0. The dysregulated lncRNA expression of an additional 27 APL BM samples was validated by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) analysis. The lncRNA functions were predicted through coexpressed messenger RNA (mRNA) annotations. Coexpressed lncRNAmRNA networks were constructed to analyze the functional pathways. In total, 825 lncRNAs and 1,218 mRNAs were dysregulated in the treated APL BM group, compared with the untreated APL BM group. The expression of 10 selected lncRNAs was verified by RTqPCR analysis. During APL differentiation, NONHSAT076891 was the most upregulated lncRNA, whereas TCONS_00022632XLOC_010933 was the most downregulated. Functional analysis revealed that several lncRNAs may exert activities in biological pathways associated with ATRAinduced APL differentiation through cis and/or trans regulation of mRNAs.

A total of 18 patients with ALL were treated with the four aforementioned radiotherapy plans prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A planned prescribed dose of 12 Gy/6 Frequency was administered to determine planning target volume (PTV). Dosimetry evaluation indexes in PTV and organs at risk were analyzed. Comparison of clinical untoward effects and the results of transplantation among the four plans were performed. The conformity index of HT plans was significantly increased compared with those in IMRT plans. The mean dose (D) to the lung and volume ratio of target volume occupied by 5 Gy (V5) in TMLI plans were lower compared with TBI plans. Doses to organs were controlled within the normal range. Dmax, Dmean and V5 of bilateral lungs and Dmax and Dmean of bilateral crystalline lens in IMRT plans were significantly higher compared with HT plans. There were no significant differences in untoward effects among the four plans. Subsequent to symptomatic treatments with antiemetic, antidiarrheal and fluid infusion, untoward effects improved, and all patients demonstrated tolerance to these therapies. A total of six patients treated with HTTBI revealed complete and successful transplantation; however, one patient following transplantation suffered from severe rejection and had succumbed to mortality due to severe infection. Patients treated with HTTMLI, IMRTTBI and IMRTTMLI completed successful transplantation and no rejection responses were observed. Conformity of HT plans are higher than that of IMRT plans. The four radiotherapy plans exhibit similar clinical untoward effects and the same transplantation success rate.

At present, the pathogenesis of AML and potential methods to effectively prevent AML have become areas of interest in research. In the present study, two messenger ribonucleic acid sequencing datasets of patients with AML were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the poor and good prognosis groups were screened using the Linear Models for Microarray Data package, and the prognosisrelated genes were screened using univariate Cox regression analysis. A total of 206 significant DEGs were identified. Following univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, 14 genes significantly associated with prognosis were screened and six of these genes, including triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREML2), cysteineglutamate transporter (SLC7A11), NACHT, LRR, and PYD domainscontaining protein 2 (NLRP2), DNA damageinducible transcript 4 protein (DDIT4), lymphocytespecific protein 1 (LSP1) and Ctype lectin domain family 11 member A (CLEC11A), were used to construct model equations for risk assessment. The prognostic scoring system was used to evaluate risk for each patient, and the results showed that patients in the lowrisk group had a longer survival time, compared with those in the highrisk group (P=9.59e06 for the training dataset and P=0.00543 for the validation dataset). A total of eight main Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were identified, the top three of which were hematopoietic cell lineage, focal adhesion, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Taken together, the results showed that the scoring system established in the present study was credible and that the six genes were identified, which were significantly associated with the risk assessment of AML, offer potential as prognostic biomarkers.

PDGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) which are small molecule inhibitors targeting PDGFR prevent and block cell proliferation signal transduction pathways. Recently, there have been 11 TKIs (including imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib and ponatinib) targeting PDGFR approved by FDA for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, renal cell carcinoma et al. Pharmacokinetics (PK) reflects the processes of drugs in body, while pharmacodynamics (PD) reflects the efficacy. Genetic polymorphisms of metabolizers and transporters contribute to highly inter-individual variability in PK and PD. This review aims to introduce the clinical applications, instruction and usage, PK, PD and pharmacogenetics of these PDGFR TKIs. METHODS: In vivo and in vitro studies about PDGFR TKIs were searched from PubMed. Data and information were analyzed and summarized. RESULTS: The overview of (1) general information on PDGFR kinase inhibitors; (2) PK parameters of PDGFR kinase inhibitors; (3) metabolic enzymes and transporters of PDGFR kinase inhibitors; (4) main drug interactions of PDGFR kinase inhibitors; (5) adverse events of PDGFR kinase inhibitors; and (6) genetic polymorphism on PK and PD of PDGFR kinase inhibitors, was exhibited and discussed in this review. CONCLUSION: This review summarized the general information, PK, metabolic enzymes and transporters, main drug interactions, adverse events and pharmacogenetics of FDA approved PDGFR TKIs. Studies showed that Single nucleotide polymorphisms of metabolic enzymes and transporters had influence on the PK and PD of PDGFR TKIs.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Qian, Yi', 'Yu, Lei', 'Zhang, Xue-Hui', 'Yuan, Zi-Qing-Yun', 'Zhao, Ping', 'Sun, Lu-Ning', 'Wang, Yong-Qing']","['Qian Y', 'Yu L', 'Zhang XH', 'Yuan ZQ', 'Zhao P', 'Sun LN', 'Wang YQ']","['Research Division of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Research Division of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Shengze Hospital, Suzhou 215228, China.', 'Research Division of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Shengze Hospital, Suzhou 215228, China.', 'Research Division of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Research Division of Clinical Pharmacology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Jiangsu Shengze Hospital, Suzhou 215228, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Drug Metab,Current drug metabolism,100960533,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', '*Pharmacogenomic Variants', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2018/06/30 06:00,2019/04/27 06:00,['2018/06/30 06:00'],"['2017/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['CDM-EPUB-91369 [pii]', '10.2174/1389200219666180629112943 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Metab. 2018;19(14):1168-1181. doi: 10.2174/1389200219666180629112943.,['NOTNLM'],"['Platelet-derived growth factor receptor', 'pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacogenomics', 'pharmacokinetics', 'small-molecule inhibitors', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors.']",14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A few studies have suggested that the use of thrombopoietin agonists (TPOa) may be useful in this setting. Our retrospective study is the largest series published to date; we retrospectively evaluated TPOa efficacy and safety in 20 adult alloSCT recipients who received TPOa as a compassionate use for clinically relevant thrombocytopenia. RESULTS: Twelve of 20 patients (60%) responded, with a 180-day cumulative incidence of successful platelet recovery to >/=30 and >/=50 x 10(9) /L of 57% (95% CI: 44%-71%) and 32% (95% CI: 18%-46%), respectively, which were reached at a median of 28 and 34 days from the start of therapy. Fifty percent of the responders were able to discontinue the TPOa without recurrence of severe thrombocytopenia and its associated hemorrhagic complications. No serious adverse events were reported.

In leukemia and lymphomas, the collateral effect of programmed DNA alterations during immune diversification is the major source of genome instability. Cytidine deamination from cytidine (C) to uridine (U) at immunoglobulin (Ig) gene loci is required for initiation of antibody diversification, while the same process also contributes to recurrent translocation or mutations outside of Ig loci in lymphocyte-origin tumors. Furthermore, genome sequencing of cancer cells from many tissue origins revealed a significant enrichment of cytidine deaminase mutagenesis signature in human cancers. Thus, cytidine deamination, which can intensively happen in an enzyme-dependent fashion at specific genomic regions, is a widespread genome instability source across many tumor types. AID/APOBEC superfamily proteins are the main single-stranded DNA deaminases in eukaryotes, which play vital roles in adaptive and innate immunity. Their deamination products can be channeled into mutations, insertions and deletions (indels), clusters of mutations called kaetagis, or chromosomal rearrangements/translocations.

Although numerically small, these cells have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of multiple immune responses, including microbial infection, autoimmunity, and cancer. Even in the steady state, cytokine production by NKT cells influences the basal status and function of other immune cells, including dendritic cells and CD8 T cells. To fully understand their biology and harness them in the clinic, it is imperative to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in the acquisition of their functionality. Unlike conventional alphabeta T cells, NKT cells acquire their effector function during development in the thymus. At this time, precursors commit to one of three functionally different effector lineages: NKT1, NKT2, and NKT17. These subsets are characterized by the secretion of different cytokines upon antigenic stimulation and by the expression of the master transcription factors Tbet, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), and retinoic orphan receptor gamma t (RORgammat).

METHODS: It was a prospective, observational study conducted from January 2013 through June 2014 in a tertiary care centre in New Delhi. Children between 1 and 12 y of age, on chemotherapy for acute leukemia with persistent febrile neutropenia (> 96 h) were enrolled. These children were not on any antifungal prophylaxis. Diagnosis of IFI was based on European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria. Prevalence and outcome was reported in mean +/- 95% CI form and etiological species were presented in the form of the frequency distribution. RESULTS: Three hundred nineteen episodes involving 187 children of febrile neutropenia were screened and 74 were enrolled. Prevalence of IFI was 22.97% (13.99-34.21). Positive cases were further classified into proven 3(17.6%), probable 11(64.8%) and possible 3(17.6%) according to EORTC/MSG criteria. On multivariate analysis, abnormal CXR and clinical sinusitis were important predictors of IFI. Most common fungi isolated was Aspergillus sp. followed by Candida sp. Mortality rate was 9.45% (3.89-18.52). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, prevalence of IFI is very high in children with persistent febrile neutropenia who are not on antifungal prophylaxis. Abnormal chest x- ray and clinical sinusitis are important predictors of IFI.",,"['Kumar, Jogender', 'Singh, Amitabh', 'Seth, Rachna', 'Xess, Immaculata', 'Jana, Manisha', 'Kabra, Sushil Kumar']","['Kumar J', 'Singh A', 'Seth R', 'Xess I', 'Jana M', 'Kabra SK']","['Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, 110029, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, 110029, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, 110029, India. drrachnaseth@yahoo.co.in.', 'Department of Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Radiodiagnosis, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, 110029, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20180629,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Febrile Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2018/06/30 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2018/06/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12098-018-2722-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12098-018-2722-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2018 Dec;85(12):1090-1095. doi: 10.1007/s12098-018-2722-0.

In this study, we investigated the effect of CD49d and CXCR4 expressions on survival of CLL cells. Primary CLL cells were cultured with CD49d ligand, VCAM-1, or bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs); then, apoptosis and immunophenotype analyses were performed. VCAM-1 treatment could not induce direct apoptosis protection or immunophenotype change on the CD49d-expressing CLL cells, but resulted in actin reorganization. The BMSC-induced apoptosis protection was independent from the presence of CD49d expression of CLL cells, but showed an inverse correlation with their CXCR4 expression level. We suppose that CD49d contributes to enhanced survival of leukemic cells by mediating migration to the protective microenvironment, not by direct prevention of apoptosis.

Is it a real problem?,2089-2098,10.1007/s00277-018-3413-7 [doi],"With tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients are achieving similar rates of survival to the general population and some treatment aspects such as adherence and drug-to-drug interactions (DDI) are becoming increasingly important. Our aim was to investigate the frequency and real clinical consequences of DDI between TKI and concurrent medications in CML. We performed a retrospective multicenter study including 105 patients receiving 134 TKI treatments. Sixty-three patients (60%) had at least one potential DDI. The mean number of concomitant medications was 4.8 (0-19). The mean number of DDI by TKI treatment was 1.2 (0-8); it increased with the number of concomitant medications and age in a significant manner. A total of 159 DDI were detected, involving 55 different drugs. The most common drug classes involved were proton pump inhibitors, statins, and antidepressants. A DDI-related clinical effect (toxicity and/or lack of efficacy) was suspected during the common course of patient follow-up in only five patients (4.7%). This number increased to 20% when data were centrally reviewed. Most of the adverse events (AE) attributed to DDIs were mild.

In addition, we show that JQ1 synergises with daunorubicin in causing AML cell death. Daunorubicin alone causes a dose- and time-dependent increase in S100A8 and S100A9 protein levels in AML cell lines which is overcome by cotreatment with JQ1.

Only a small number of cases have been reported in the literature with little cytogenetic or molecular data available. In this study, we describe the clinicopathologic and genetic features of 23 patients with hairy cell leukemia-variant (16 men and 7 women) with a median age of 70 years. Most patients had splenomegaly (90%), leukocytosis (77%), and lymphocytosis (82%); no patients had monocytopenia. Histologically, the bone marrow biopsy specimens showed a mixed pattern of predominantly interstitial and lesser intrasinusoidal infiltration by leukemic cells. In bone marrow aspirate smears most cells had villous cytoplasmic features and a small nucleolus. We describe unusual sites of hairy cell leukemia-variant involvement in 4 patients, including brain, omentum, terminal ileum, and skin at the time of initial presentation. Immunophenotyping showed monotypic B-cells positive for pan B-cell antigens, CD11c, and CD103, and negative for CD25 and annexin A1. Conventional cytogenetic or fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed deletions of 17p13/TP53 and 11q22/ATM gene in 5/12 (42%) and 2/9 (22%) cases, respectively. Sequencing of the variable region of IGVH showed mutations (>2% deviation from germline) in 40% of the cases assessed. MAP2K1 mutation (p.C121S) was seen in 1 of 14 (7%) patients tested. No BRAF V600E mutations were detected. The patients were treated in a heterogeneous manner, but most often with therapies designed for classical hairy cell leukemia and the 5-year overall survival was 84%. In summary, hairy cell leukemia-variant exhibits a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features that may overlap with classic hairy cell leukemia and other hairy cell-like B-cell neoplasms. A subset of patients can have an aggressive clinical course. In our experience MAP2K1 mutations are uncommon in this disease.",,"['Angelova, Evgeniya A', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Wang, Wei', 'Muzzafar, Tariq', 'Lu, Xinyan', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Hu, Zhihong', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi']","['Angelova EA', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Wang W', 'Muzzafar T', 'Lu X', 'Khoury JD', 'Ravandi F', 'Patel KP', 'Hu Z', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. rkanagal@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20180628,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2018/06/30 06:00,2019/08/23 06:00,['2018/06/30 06:00'],"['2018/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41379-018-0093-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41379-018-0093-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2018 Nov;31(11):1717-1732. doi: 10.1038/s41379-018-0093-8.

To identify the target antigens of MCL-BCRs, BCRs from 21 patients and seven MCL cell lines were recombinantly expressed and used for antigen screening. The BCRs from 8/21 patients and 2/7 MCL cell lines reacted specifically with the autoantigen low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-associated protein 1 (LRPAP1). High-titered and light chain-restricted anti-LRPAP1 serum antibodies were found in MCL patients, but not in controls. LRPAP1 induced proliferation by BCR pathway activation, while an LRPAP1-ETA' toxin-conjugate specifically killed MCL cells with LRPAP1-specific BCRs. Our results suggest a role of LRPAP1 in lymphomagenesis and maintenance of a considerable proportion of MCL cases by chronic autoantigenic stimulation, likely evolving from a chronic autoreactive B-cell response.

Heparanase plays an important role in the nucleus as part of an active chromatin complex. Our previous studies revealed that rs4693608 correlates with heparanase levels and increased risk of acute and extensive chronic graft vs. host disease (GVHD). Discrepancy between recipient and donor in this SNP significantly affected the risk of acute GVHD. In the present study, we analyzed the HPSE gene region, including rs4693608, and demonstrated that this region exhibits SNPs-dependent enhancer activity. Analysis of nuclear proteins from normal leukocytes revealed their binding to DNA probe of both alleles with higher affinity to allele G. All malignant cell lines and leukemia samples disclosed a shift of the main bands in comparison to normal leukocytes. At least five additional shifted bands were bound to allele A while allele G probe was bound to only one main DNA/protein complex. Additional SNPs rs4693083, rs4693084, and rs4693609 were found in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs11099592 (exon 7). Only rs4693084 affected protein binding to DNA in cell lines and leukemia samples. As a result of the short distance between rs4693608 and rs4693084, both SNPs may be included in a common DNA/protein complex. DNA pull-down assay revealed that heparanase is involved in self-regulation by negative feedback in rs4693608-dependent manner. During carcinogenesis, heparanase self-regulation is discontinued and the helicase-like transcription factor begins to regulate this enhancer region. Altogether, our study elucidates conceivable mechanism(s) by which rs4693608 SNP regulates HPSE gene expression and the associated disease outcome.",,"['Ostrovsky, Olga', 'Grushchenko-Polaq, Ania Hava', 'Beider, Katia', 'Mayorov, Margarita', 'Canaani, Jonathan', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Vlodavsky, Israel', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Ostrovsky O', 'Grushchenko-Polaq AH', 'Beider K', 'Mayorov M', 'Canaani J', 'Shimoni A', 'Vlodavsky I', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. olga.ostrovsky@sheba.health.gov.il.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Cancer and Vascular Biology Research Center, Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180629,United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,2018/06/30 06:00,2018/06/30 06:01,['2018/06/30 06:00'],"['2017/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41389-018-0060-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41389-018-0060-8 [pii]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2018 Jun 29;7(6):51. doi: 10.1038/s41389-018-0060-8.,,,6,,PMC6023935,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its diagnosis is very difficult as radiological images are not specific. Histology and immunohistochemistry are necessary for an accurate diagnosis. CASE REPORT We report the case of 46-year-old, Caucasian, non-smoker male, treated in 2014 by orchiectomy and systemic chemotherapy for a stage IIB testicular seminoma. Considering the rapid increase of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels without any evident medical reason, a computed tomography/positron emission tomography (CT/PET) scan was performed and revealing a diffuse, nodular, peritoneal tumor infiltration associated with multiple mesenteric and mediastinal adenopathies. Laparoscopy confirmed a diffuse tumor infiltration of the peritoneum. Histology and immunohistochemistry were consisted with the diagnosis of a myeloid monoblastic sarcoma. Cytology of bone marrow documented an monocytic acute myeloid leukemia. The patient started a systemic induction chemotherapy with high dose cytarabine and idarubicin that was complicated by an infectious pneumonia and colitis, and a grade IV thrombocytopenia leading to a brain subdural hemorrhage and quickly to patient's death. CONCLUSIONS We describe a rare, peritoneal, myeloid sarcoma in a young patient who had been treated by systemic chemotherapy for testicular seminoma 4 years earlier. The patient was clinically asymptomatic and presented only elevated LDH levels without any evident clinical reason. Considering the persistence of this biochemical abnormality, more investigations were performed leading to a diagnosis of peritoneal myeloid sarcoma associated with monocytic acute myeloid leukemia, probably secondary to the past chemotherapy.",,"['Longo, Raffaele', 'Dorvaux, Veronique', 'Chatelain, Eric', 'Quetin, Philippe', 'Plastino, Francesca', 'Eid, Nada', 'Marcon, Nathalie', 'Hennequin, Laurent', 'Campitiello, Marco']","['Longo R', 'Dorvaux V', 'Chatelain E', 'Quetin P', 'Plastino F', 'Eid N', 'Marcon N', 'Hennequin L', 'Campitiello M']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Mercy Hospital, Metz-Thionville Regional Hospital Center, Ars-Laquenexy, France.', 'Division of Hematology, Mercy Hospital, Metz-Thionville Regional Hospital Center, Ars-Laquenexy, France.', 'Division of Digestive Surgery, Mercy Hospital, Metz-Thionville Regional Hospital Center, Ars-Laquenexy, France.', 'Division of Radiotherapy, Mercy Hospital, Metz-Thionville Regional Hospital Center, Ars-Laquenexy, France.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Mercy Hospital, Metz-Thionville Regional Hospital Center, Ars-Laquenexy, France.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Mercy Hospital, Metz-Thionville Regional Hospital Center, Ars-Laquenexy, France.', 'Division of Pathology, Mercy Hospital, Metz-Thionville Regional Hospital Center, Ars-Laquenexy, France.', 'Division of Radiodiagnostics and Medical Imaging, Mercy Hospital, Metz-Thionville Regional Hospital Center, Ars-Laquenexy, France.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Mercy Hospital, Metz-Thionville Regional Hospital Center, Ars-Laquenexy, France.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180629,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/complications/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/complications/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Seminoma/complications/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/complications/diagnostic imaging/*therapy']",2018/06/30 06:00,2018/11/27 06:00,['2018/06/30 06:00'],"['2018/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/27 06:00 [medline]']","['910434 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.910434 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2018 Jun 29;19:763-766. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.910434.,,,,,PMC6055577,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we have shown the importance of one of the subtypes of SphK, SphK2, in the regulation of cargo content in exosomes released from human myeloid leukemia K562 cells. First, SphK2 has been shown to localize with N-Rh-PE-positive late endosomes in the cells. Next, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sphk2 but not SphK1 resulted in a reduction of cargo content in purified exosomes. The involvement of SphK2 in this phenomenon was further investigated by pharmacological approaches. When cells were treated with N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), one of the most frequently used inhibitors for SphK, cargo contents in purified exosomes were enhanced unexpectedly. Finally, it has been shown that DMS has a potency to stimulate SphK2 activity depending on the substrate sphingosine- and the inhibitor-doses as estimated by in vitro assay systems using a purified SphK2. These findings suggest that SphK2/S1P signaling plays an important role in the regulation of cargo content in exosomes in K562 cells.",,"['Mohamed, Nesma Nabil Ibrahim', 'Okada, Taro', 'Kajimoto, Taketoshi', 'Nakamura, Shun-Ichi']","['Mohamed NNI', 'Okada T', 'Kajimoto T', 'Nakamura SI']","['Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe 650-0017, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180525,Japan,Kobe J Med Sci,The Kobe journal of medical sciences,0413531,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.91 (sphingosine kinase 2, human)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Exosomes/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lysophospholipids/metabolism', 'Multivesicular Bodies/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*metabolism', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",2018/06/30 06:00,2018/11/07 06:00,['2018/06/30 06:00'],"['2018/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Kobe J Med Sci. 2018 May 25;63(4):E123-E129.,['NOTNLM'],"['exosomes', 'multivesicular endosomes', 'sphingosine kinase 2', 'N,N-dimethylsphingosine', 'Sphingosine 1-phosphate']",4,,PMC6192818,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies examining the association between single-food items and CLL risk have yielded mixed results, while few studies have been conducted on overall diet, reporting inconclusive findings. This study aimed to evaluate the association between adherence to three dietary patterns and CLL in the multicase-control study (MCC-Spain) study. Anthropometric, sociodemographic, medical and dietary information was collected for 369 CLL cases and 1605 controls. Three validated dietary patterns, Western, Prudent and Mediterranean, were reconstructed in the MCC-Spain data. The association between adherence to each dietary pattern and CLL was assessed, overall and by Rai stage, using mixed logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. High adherence to a Western dietary pattern (i.e. high intake of high-fat dairy products, processed meat, refined grains, sweets, caloric drinks, and convenience food) was associated with CLL [ORQ4 vs. Q1=1.63 (95%CI 1.11; 2.39); P-trend=0.02; OR 1-SD increase=1.19 (95%CI: 1.03; 1.37)], independently of Rai stages. No differences in the association were observed according to sex, Body Mass Index, energy intake, tobacco, physical activity, working on a farm, or family history of hematologic malignancies.

While therapy cessation for patients appeared as a safe option for about half of those patients with optimal response, no systematic assessment of long-term TKI dose de-escalation has been made. We use a mathematical model to analyze and consistently describe biphasic treatment responses from TKI-treated patients from two independent clinical phase III trials. Scale estimates reveal that drug efficiency determines the initial response while the long-term behavior is limited by the rare activation of leukemic stem cells. We use this mathematical framework to investigate the influence of different dosing regimens on the treatment outcome. We provide strong evidence to suggest that TKI dose de-escalation (at least 50%) does not lead to a reduction of long-term treatment efficiency for most patients, who have already achieved sustained remission, and maintains the secondary decline of BCR-ABL1 levels. We demonstrate that continuous BCR-ABL1 monitoring provides patient-specific predictions of an optimal reduced dose without decreasing the anti-leukemic effect on residual leukemic stem cells. Our results are consistent with the interim results of the DESTINY trial and provide clinically testable predictions. Our results suggest that dose-halving should be considered as a long-term treatment option for CML patients with good response under continuing maintenance therapy with TKIs. We emphasize the clinical potential of this approach to reduce treatment-related side-effects and treatment costs.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Fassoni, Artur C', 'Baldow, Christoph', 'Roeder, Ingo', 'Glauche, Ingmar']","['Fassoni AC', 'Baldow C', 'Roeder I', 'Glauche I']","['Instituto de Matematica e Computacao, Universidade Federal de Itajuba, Brazil.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Partner Site Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany ingmar.glauche@tu-dresden.de.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180628,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Computer Simulation', 'Female', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage']",2018/06/30 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2018/06/30 06:00'],"['2018/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.194522 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.194522 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Nov;103(11):1825-1834. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.194522.

Although the CXCR4 pathway has recently been suggested as an adverse prognostic marker in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, its biological relevance in this disease remains underexplored. In a homogeneous set of 52 biopsies from patients, an antibody-based cytokine array showed that tissue levels of CXCL12 correlated with high microvessel density and bone marrow involvement at diagnosis, supporting a role for the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in disease progression. We then identified the tetra-amine IQS-01.01RS as a potent inverse agonist of the receptor, preventing CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis and triggering apoptosis in a panel of 18 cell lines and primary cultures, with superior mobilizing properties in vivo than those of the standard agent. IQS-01.01RS activity was associated with downregulation of p-AKT, p-ERK1/2 and destabilization of MYC, allowing a synergistic interaction with the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitor, CPI203. In a xenotransplant model of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the combination of IQS-01.01RS and CPI203 decreased tumor burden through MYC and p-AKT downregulation, and enhanced the induction of apoptosis. Thus, our results point out an emerging role of CXCL12-CXCR4 in the pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and support the simultaneous targeting of CXCR4 and bromodomain proteins as a promising, rationale-based strategy for the treatment of this disease.",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Recasens-Zorzo, Clara', 'Cardesa-Salzmann, Teresa', 'Petazzi, Paolo',

Nearly all patients in both treatment arms experienced an adverse event (AE), and the incidence rate of serious AEs was higher for blinatumomab. However, as treatment exposure differed between the 2 arms, we conducted an exploratory safety analysis comparing exposure-adjusted event rates (EAERs) of blinatumomab vs SOC. Analyses were conducted for all patients who received therapy (safety population). Patients received a median (range) of 2 cycles (1-9) of blinatumomab (N = 267) vs 1 cycle (1-4) of SOC (N = 109). Grade >/=3 AE rates were generally higher in cycle 1 of blinatumomab than in cycle 2 (76% vs 37%). After adjusting for time on treatment, EAERs of grade >/=3 were significantly lower for blinatumomab vs SOC overall (10.73 vs 45.27 events per patient-year; P < .001) and for events of clinical interest, including infections (1.63 vs 6.49 events per patient-year; P < .001), cytopenias (3.64 vs 20.07 events per patient-year; P < .001), and neurologic events (0.38 vs 0.95 events per patient-year; P = .008). The EAER of grade >/=3 cytokine-release syndrome was higher for blinatumomab than for SOC (0.16 vs 0 events per patient-year; P = .038). These data further support the role of blinatumomab as an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with r/r Ph(-) ALL.

Considering the recent diagnosis and treatment of CLL, initial suspicion was relapsed disease. However, considering the immune deficiency associated with CLL and its treatment, infectious aetiologies were strongly considered. Further investigation revealed a case of disseminated histoplasmosis mimicking CLL in this reported patient. Considering appropriate diagnosis and timely therapy, the reported patient had good prognosis despite being diagnosed with disseminated histoplasmosis.

Combination therapies have attracted great attention. The principal purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of synergism between ABT-199 and paclitaxel. Moreover, we analyzed the biomarker to identify tumors which are most likely to respond to this combination. We evaluated the effect of this combination in a panel of nine cancer cell lines including cervical cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphoma, leukemia and breast cancer. Combination index (CI) assay showed that four of nine call lines exhibited synergistic respond to ABT-199/paclitaxel combination due to enhanced intrinsic apoptosis. However, paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation impaired the synergistic effect by impeding the freeing of Bax and Bim by ABT-199 because ABT-199 cannot hit phosphorylated Bcl-2 (pBcl-2). By means of a correlation analysis of JNK level with CI value in combination with overexpressing or silencing JNK protein in cancer cells, we identified basal JNK1 level as a potential biomarker for predicting the level of pBcl-2 upon paclitaxel treatment, and thus for predicting a synergistic response. A cut-off value of 0.37 for relative JNK1 expression level was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to distinguish between synergistic and non-synergistic response cancers. A more accurate and valid cut-off value for JNK1 will be gained based on a large-scale clinical samples analysis.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Next, an initial exploration around our hit 11 was pursued to identify an adequate tool compound for in vivo testing. In vitro treatment of different hematological neoplasia cell lines led to the identification of molecules with clear antiproliferative efficacies (GI50 values in the nanomolar range).

The aim of this study was to detect the expres- sion changes of miR-101 in cervical cancer tissues and the effects on the biological functions of cervical cancer SiHa cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through transient transfection of SiHa cells with mature miR-101 sequences, the effects on apoptosis, proliferation, and cell cycle were evaluated by real-time PCR, CCK-8 assay, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Significantly less miR-101 was expressed in cervical cancer tissues than that in normal cervical tissues. miR-101 was overexpressed in SiHa cells through transient transfection of miR-101 mimics. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry showed that miR-101 overexpression significantly inhibited cell proliferation, pro- moted apoptosis, and arrested them in the G(l)/S phase. Real-time PCR exhibited that Mcl-i and c-Fos mRNA expressions significantly decreased.

METHODS: Prospectively collected data of a cohort study from July 2004 to February 2016. Multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: 589 episodes of BSI were documented in 357 AL patients, 55% caused by gram-positive bacteria (coagulase-negative staphylococci 35.7%, Enterococcus spp 10.8%) and 43.5% by gram-negative bacteria (E. coli 21%, PA 12%). We identified 110 (18.7%) multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms, especially MDR-Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (7%). The 30-day mortality was 14.8%. Age (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.7-5.7); chronic lung disease (4.8; 1.1-21.8); fatal prognosis according to McCabe index (13.9; 6.4-30.3); shock (3.8; 1.9-7.7); pulmonary infection (3.6; 1.3-9.9); and MDR-PA infections with inappropriate treatment (12.8; 4.1-40.5) were related to mortality. MDR-PA BSI was associated to prior antipseudomonal cephalosporin use (9.31; 4.38-19.79); current use of betalactams (2.01; 1.01-4.3); shock (2.63; 1.03-6.7) and pulmonary source of infection (9.6; 3.4-27.21). CONCLUSIONS: MDR organisms were commonly isolated in BSI in AL. Inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment for MDR-PA is the primary factor related to mortality that can be changed.

We designed a questionnaire to collect baseline patient information, medication adherence (measured using the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale), and side effects.

Statistical comparisons of different parameters between adherent and nonadherent groups were conducted.Fifty-eight patients were enrolled in this study, and 31% of them had poor adherence. The lack of information about treatment and medication was the major reason for poor medication adherence. Patients who were younger and unmarried were prone to poor adherence. The occurrence of side effects carried no statistically significant influence on adherence. Poor adherence resulted in a poor treatment response (lower 3-month early molecular response rate and lower 12-month major molecular response rate).Poor adherence is common in Taiwanese patients with CML.

The majority of endometrial cancers can be cured by surgery alone or in combination with adjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy; however, a subset of patients experience recurrence for reasons that remain unclear. Recurrence is associated with chemoresistance to carboplatin and paclitaxel and consequentially, high mortality. Understanding the pathways involved in endometrial cancer chemoresistance is paramount for the identification of biomarkers and novel molecular targets for this disease. Here, we generated the first matched pairs of carboplatin-sensitive/carboplatin-resistant and paclitaxel-sensitive/paclitaxel-resistant endometrial cancer cells and subjected them to bulk RNA sequencing analysis. We found that 45 genes are commonly upregulated in carboplatin- and paclitaxel-resistant cells as compared to controls. Of these, the leukemia inhibitory factor, (LIF), the protein tyrosine phosphatase type IVA, member 3 (PTP4A3), and the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) showed a highly significant correlation between expression level and endometrial cancer overall survival (OS) and can stratify the 545 endometrial cancer patients in the TCGA cohort into a high-risk and low-risk-cohorts. Additionally, four genes within the 45 upregulated chemoresistance-associated genes are ADAMTS5, MICAL2, STAT5A, and PTP4A3 codes for proteins for which small-molecule inhibitors already exist. We identified these proteins as molecular targets for chemoresistant endometrial cancer and showed that treatment with their correspondent inhibitors effectively killed otherwise chemoresistant cells. Collectively, these findings underline the utility of matched pair of chemosensitive and chemoresistant cancer cells to identify markers for endometrial cancer risk stratification and to serve as a pharmacogenomics model for identification of alternative chemotherapy approaches for treatment of patients with recurrent disease.",,"['Hellweg, Raffaele', 'Mooneyham, Ashley', 'Chang, Zenas', 'Shetty, Mihir', 'Emmings, Edith', 'Iizuka, Yoshie', 'Clark, Christopher', 'Starr, Timothy', 'Abrahante, Juan H', 'Schutz, Florian', 'Konecny, Gottfried', 'Argenta, Peter', 'Bazzaro, Martina']","['Hellweg R', 'Mooneyham A', 'Chang Z', 'Shetty M', 'Emmings E', 'Iizuka Y', 'Clark C', 'Starr T', 'Abrahante JH', 'Schutz F', 'Konecny G', 'Argenta P', 'Bazzaro M']","[""Masonic Cancer Center and Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Room 490, 420 Delaware Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA."", ""Department of Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", 'Heidelberg University Breast Unit, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Masonic Cancer Center and Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Room 490, 420 Delaware Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA."", ""Department of Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", ""Department of Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", ""Masonic Cancer Center and Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Room 490, 420 Delaware Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA."", ""Department of Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", ""Masonic Cancer Center and Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Room 490, 420 Delaware Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA."", ""Masonic Cancer Center and Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Room 490, 420 Delaware Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA."", ""Department of Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", ""Masonic Cancer Center and Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Room 490, 420 Delaware Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA."", ""Department of Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", ""Masonic Cancer Center and Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Room 490, 420 Delaware Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA."", ""Department of Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", 'University of Minnesota Informatics Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Heidelberg University Breast Unit, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Gynecologic Oncology, Hematology and Oncology Department, UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, CA, USA.', ""Department of Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", ""Masonic Cancer Center and Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Room 490, 420 Delaware Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA. mbazzaro@umn.edu."", ""Department of Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA. mbazzaro@umn.edu.""]",['eng'],['T32 CA009138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180627,United States,Horm Cancer,Hormones & cancer,101518427,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/*chemistry', 'Carboplatin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/*methods']",2018/06/29 06:00,2019/05/29 06:00,['2018/06/29 06:00'],"['2018/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12672-018-0337-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12672-018-0337-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Horm Cancer. 2018 Oct;9(5):326-337. doi: 10.1007/s12672-018-0337-6.

We report here on 22 APL patients treated with prolonged ATRA-ATO therapy at the time of disease relapse. Twenty patients obtained molecular complete remission (CRm) after 2 cycles (90%). Of these, two patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) while the remaining proceeded to receive additional cycles (up to a total of 5) of ATRA-ATO. With a median follow-up of 58 months from the time of relapse (range: 21-128 months), the 4-year OS probability was 0.85 (95% CI 0.61-0.94), DFS was 0.74 (95% CI 0.49-0.88), and EFS 0.68 (95% CI 0.45-0.83).

Approximately 6000 new cases of ALL are diagnosed each year in the USA, 80-85% of which represent B-ALL forms. Most presentations of B-ALL are leukemic, whereas T-ALL presents with a mediastinal mass, with or without leukemic involvement. The revised fourth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification (2017) has introduced some changes in both B and T-ALL. Here, we summarize the categories of lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas as defined by the WHO and recent developments in the understanding of this group of hematologic malignancy. RECENT FINDINGS: Two provisional categories of B-ALL have now been identified including B-ALL, BCR-ABL1-like, and B-ALL with iAMP21. The Philadelphia chromosome-like B-ALL includes forms of the disease that shares the expression profiling of B-ALL with t(9;22) but lack such rearrangement. The second one shows amplification of part of the chromosome 21. Both entities are associated with worse prognosis. Within the T-ALL group, an early precursor T cell form has now been introduced as a provisional category. Such group demonstrates expression of stem cell and myeloid markers in conjunction with the T cell antigens. The current review summarizes the recent updates to the WHO classification.",,"['Wenzinger, Christopher', 'Williams, Eli', 'Gru, Alejandro A']","['Wenzinger C', 'Williams E', 'Gru AA']","['Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology & Dermatology, University of Virginia, 415 Lane Road, Hospital Expansion Bldg Room 3024, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.

Furthermore, deregulations of the hematopoietic differentiation program are at the origin of numerous diseases including leukemia. Importantly, many aspects of blood cell development have been conserved from human to Drosophila. Hence, Drosophila has emerged as a potent genetic model to study blood cell development and leukemia in vivo. In this chapter, we give a brief overview of the Drosophila hematopoietic system, and we provide a protocol for the dissection and the immunostaining of the larval lymph gland, the most studied hematopoietic organ in Drosophila. We then focus on the various paradigms that have been used in fly to investigate how conserved genes implicated in leukemogenesis control blood cell development. Specific examples of Drosophila models for leukemia are presented, with particular attention to the most translational ones.

Despite the excitement surrounding immunotherapy, it is currently not possible to predict which patients will respond. Within solid tumors, the status of the immune microenvironment provides valuable insight regarding potential responses to immune therapies. Much less is known about the immune microenvironment within hematologic malignancies but the characteristics of this environment are likely to serve a similar predictive role. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common hematologic malignancy in adults, and only 25% of patients are alive 5 years following their diagnosis. There is evidence that manipulation of the immune microenvironment by leukemia cells may play a role in promoting therapy resistance and disease relapse. In addition, it has long been documented that through modulation of the immune system following allogeneic bone marrow transplant, AML can be cured, even in patients with the highest risk disease. These concepts, along with the poor prognosis associated with this disease, have encouraged many groups to start exploring the utility of novel immune therapies in AML. While the implementation of these therapies into clinical trials for AML has been supported by preclinical rationale, many questions still exist surrounding their efficacy, tolerability, and the overall optimal approach.

Novel strategies for treatment of acute leukemia have been developed, but treatment resistance is remained as the most problematic issue. It is hypothesized that the HO-1 gene up-regulation is responsible for tumor resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy-induced apoptosis. The levels of HO-1 expression are related to (GT)n microsatellite polymorphisms in the location of its promoter. This study designed to compare allelic frequencies of (GT)n microsatellite polymorphisms in HO-1 gene between acute leukemia patients and healthy controls. Indeed, 3-year disease-free survival was also evaluated. Methods: Sixty-three patients with acute leukemia and seventy healthy infants were included in this study. We used the medical records of patients to collect information about survival after chemotherapy. The number of GT repeats in HO-1 promoter was determined by an ABI 3100 sequencer. Results: The HO-1 GT repeats ranged from 14 to 34 with peaks at 27 repeats in both cases and controls. Children with longer alleles ((GT)n >/= 27) had enhanced 3-year survival rate after treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy (P<0.05). Conclusion: Although no significant differences were observed between leukemia patients and controls regarding allelic frequency, we found elevated frequency of ""LL"" genotype in leukemia patients with good prognosis and 3-year surveillance.

BCR-ABL dependent and independent pathways play equally important role in CML. TGFbeta-Smad pathway, an important BCR -ABL independent pathway, has scarce data in CML. Present study investigate the association between TGFbeta-Smad pathway and CML. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four CML patients and age matched healthy controls (n=63) were enrolled in this study. Patients were segregated into responder and resistant groups depending on their response to Imatinib mesylate (IM). TGFbeta1 serum levels were evaluated by ELISA and transcript levels of TGFbeta1 receptors, SMAD4 and SMAD7 were evaluated by Real-Time PCR. Sequencing of exons and exon-intron boundaries of study genes was performed using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in 20 CML patients. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 16.0. Results:TGFbeta1 serum levels were significantly elevated (p = 0.02) and TGFbetaR2 and SMAD4 were significantly down-regulated (p = 0.012 and p = 0.043 respectively) in the patients. c.69A>G in TGFbeta1, c.1024+24G>A in TGFbetaR1 and g.46474746C>T in SMAD7 were the most important genetic variants observed with their presence in 10/20, 8/20 and 7/20 patients respectively. In addition, TGFbetaR1 transcript levels were reduced in CML patients with c.69A>G mutation.

Mutations in the genes coding for receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are quite common in all forms of acute leukemia. This can be a major cause of deregulation of the PI3K-mTOR pathway. To understand how cells display resistance to the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, we used a panel of 25 acute leukemia cell lines. We observed that while a number of cell lines displayed sensitivity to the dual PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor PKI-587, many cells displayed substantial resistance. Cells sensitive to PKI-587 also showed aberrant activation of PI3K/mTOR pathway components such as AKT and S6K and also displayed sensitivity to a panel of various other PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Using RNA sequencing data, we observed that expression of a G protein-coupled receptor, P2RY14, was upregulated nine-fold in cells showing resistance to the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. P2RY14 has not been much studied in hematologic malignancies. However, this receptor seems to have a role in the localization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and in promoting regenerative capabilities following injury. We observed that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with higher expression of P2RY14 mRNA displayed relatively poor survival compared to patients carrying lower expression of P2RY14 suggesting a role of P2RY14 in patient survival. To understand the role of this receptor in cell signaling, we used phospho-protein arrays and observed activation of distinct signaling cascades. Furthermore, array data were verified using murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 stably transfected with P2RY14. We observed that activation of P2RY14 by its ligand, UDP-glucose, resulted in selective induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our data suggest that acute leukemia cells resistant to PI3K/mTOR inhibition display upregulation of a GPCR, P2RY14, which has a role in patient survival and also couples to the activation of ERK signaling.",,"['Shah, Kinjal', 'Moharram, Sausan A', 'Kazi, Julhash U']","['Shah K', 'Moharram SA', 'Kazi JU']","['Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180619,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,"['0 (Morpholines)', '0 (P2RY14 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2Y)', '0 (Triazines)', '96265TNH2R (gedatolisib)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y/genetics/*metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Triazines/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2018/06/29 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/06/29 06:00'],"['2018/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-018-0516-x [doi]', '516 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2018 Jun 19;10:83. doi: 10.1186/s13148-018-0516-x. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*AML', '*B-ALL', '*P2RY14']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0719-5336'],PMC6010022,,"['Not applicable.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Springer', 'Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and', 'institutional affiliations.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among its four main clinical subtypes, the prognosis of acute and lymphoma variants remains poor. The long latency (3-6 decades) and low incidence (3-5%) of ATLL imply the involvement of viral and host factors in full-blown malignancy. Despite multiple preclinical and clinical studies, the contribution of the stromal microenvironment in ATLL development is not yet completely unraveled. The aims of this study were to investigate the role of the host microenvironment, and specifically fibroblasts, in ATLL pathogenesis and to propose a murine model for the lymphoma subtype. Here we present evidence that the oncogenic capacity of HTLV-1-immortalized C91/PL cells is enhanced when they are xenotransplanted together with human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) in immunocompromised BALB/c Rag2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mice. Moreover, cell lines derived from a developed lymphoma and their subsequent in vivo passages acquired the stable property to induce aggressive T cell lymphomas. In particular, one of these cell lines, C91/III cells, consistently induced aggressive lymphomas also in NOD/SCID/IL2Rgammac KO (NSG) mice. To dissect the mechanisms linked to this enhanced tumorigenic ability, we quantified 45 soluble factors released by these cell lines and found that 21 of them, mainly pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, were significantly increased in C91/III cells compared to the parental C91/PL cells. Moreover, many of the increased factors were also released by human fibroblasts and belonged to the known secretory pattern of ATLL cells. C91/PL cells co-cultured with HFF showed features reminiscent of those observed in C91/III cells, including a similar secretory pattern and a more aggressive behavior in vivo. On the whole, our data provide evidence that fibroblasts, one of the major stromal components, might enhance tumorigenesis of HTLV-1-infected and immortalized T cells, thus throwing light on the role of microenvironment contribution in ATLL pathogenesis. We also propose that the lymphoma induced in NSG mice by injection with C91/III cells represents a new murine preclinical ATLL model that could be adopted to test novel therapeutic interventions for the aggressive lymphoma subtype.",,"['Vicario, Mattia', 'Mattiolo, Adriana', 'Montini, Barbara', 'Piano, Maria Assunta', 'Cavallari, Ilaria', 'Amadori, Alberto', 'Chieco-Bianchi, Luigi', 'Calabro, Maria Luisa']","['Vicario M', 'Mattiolo A', 'Montini B', 'Piano MA', 'Cavallari I', 'Amadori A', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Calabro ML']","['Immunology and Molecular Oncology, Veneto Institute of Oncology, IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology, Veneto Institute of Oncology, IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology, Veneto Institute of Oncology, IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology, Veneto Institute of Oncology, IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology, Veneto Institute of Oncology, IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology, Veneto Institute of Oncology, IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology, Veneto Institute of Oncology, IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180613,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,2018/06/29 06:00,2018/06/29 06:01,['2018/06/29 06:00'],"['2018/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2018.01215 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2018 Jun 13;9:1215. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.01215. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['ATLL', 'HTLV-1', 'fibroblasts', 'lymphoma', 'microenvironment', 'preclinical model']",,,PMC6008390,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism of action and the in vivo behavior of HJB remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of HJB on human leukemia K562 cells and its pharmacokinetic properties in rats. The results demonstrated that HJB significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells and promoted apoptosis. Besides, HJB resulted in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential deltaPSIm, increased the level of the calcium homeostasis regulator protein TRPC6 and cytosolic calcium. The activity of caspase-8, caspase-9 and the expression of p53 were significantly increased after treatment with HJB. Additionally, HJB has rapid absorption rate and relative long elimination t1/2, indicating a longer residence time in vivo. The results indicate that HJB inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells and induced apoptosis by affecting the function of mitochondria and calcium homeostasis to activate the p53 signaling pathway. The pharmacokinetic study of HJB suggested it is absorbed well and has moderate metabolism in vivo.

Enasidenib (AG-221) is an allosteric inhibitor that binds to the IDH2 dimer interface and blocks the production of 2HG by IDH2 mutants(9,10). In a phase I/II clinical trial, enasidenib inhibited the production of 2HG and induced clinical responses in relapsed or refractory IDH2-mutant AML(11). Here we describe two patients with IDH2-mutant AML who had a clinical response to enasidenib followed by clinical resistance, disease progression, and a recurrent increase in circulating levels of 2HG. We show that therapeutic resistance is associated with the emergence of second-site IDH2 mutations in trans, such that the resistance mutations occurred in the IDH2 allele without the neomorphic R140Q mutation. The in trans mutations occurred at glutamine 316 (Q316E) and isoleucine 319 (I319M), which are at the interface where enasidenib binds to the IDH2 dimer. The expression of either of these mutant disease alleles alone did not induce the production of 2HG; however, the expression of the Q316E or I319M mutation together with the R140Q mutation in trans allowed 2HG production that was resistant to inhibition by enasidenib. Biochemical studies predicted that resistance to allosteric IDH inhibitors could also occur via IDH dimer-interface mutations in cis, which was confirmed in a patient with acquired resistance to the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120). Our observations uncover a mechanism of acquired resistance to a targeted therapy and underscore the importance of 2HG production in the pathogenesis of IDH-mutant malignancies.",,"['Intlekofer, Andrew M', 'Shih, Alan H', 'Wang, Bo', 'Nazir, Abbas', 'Rustenburg, Arien S', 'Albanese, Steven K', 'Patel, Minal', 'Famulare, Christopher', 'Correa, Fabian M', 'Takemoto, Naofumi', 'Durani, Vidushi', 'Liu, Hui', 'Taylor, Justin', 'Farnoud, Noushin', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Cross, Justin R', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Arcila, Maria E', 'Roshal, Mikhail', 'Petsko, Gregory A', 'Wu, Bin', 'Choe, Sung', 'Konteatis, Zenon D', 'Biller, Scott A', 'Chodera, John D', 'Thompson, Craig B', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Stein, Eytan M']","['Intlekofer AM', 'Shih AH', 'Wang B', 'Nazir A', 'Rustenburg AS', 'Albanese SK', 'Patel M', 'Famulare C', 'Correa FM', 'Takemoto N', 'Durani V', 'Liu H', 'Taylor J', 'Farnoud N', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Cross JR', 'Tallman MS', 'Arcila ME', 'Roshal M', 'Petsko GA', 'Wu B', 'Choe S', 'Konteatis ZD', 'Biller SA', 'Chodera JD', 'Thompson CB', 'Levine RL', 'Stein EM']","['Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Lymphoma Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cancer Biology & Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Computational & Systems Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Computational & Systems Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology & Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'The Donald B. and Catherine C.

Serum levels of the apoptotic degradation product cytokeratin-18 fragments (CK18F) were associated with acute hepato-intestinal GVHD. Here we present a prospective clinical observational trial (NCT00935324) investigating serum levels of total CK18 (tCK18) and apoptotic CK18F to predict imminent acute hepato-intestinal GVHD and response to treatment. Total (t)CK18 and CK18F kinetics were measured before transplantation and in weekly intervals thereafter. In total 109 patients were enrolled. Acute hepato-intestinal GVHD grade I-IV was suspected in 36 patients (33%) at a median of 56 days post-transplant, 12 of these patients developed steroid-refractory GVHD. Both tCK18 and apoptotic CK18F increased at GVHD onset, and distinguished patients with suspected acute hepato-intestinal GVHD who were negative in intestinal histology. In patients with clinical acute hepato-intestinal GVHD, tCK18 significantly raised already 7-14 days before symptom onset. In receiver operator characteristics, areas under the curve at GVHD onset were 0.927 (p < 0.001) for tCK18 and 0.875 (p < 0.001) for apoptotic CK18F for patients with proven hepato-intestinal acute GVHD.

We evaluated whether individual comorbidities could better characterize NRM risk. Furthermore, given differing toxicity profiles of conditioning agents, we hypothesized that the hazard of comorbidities is exerted in a regimen-specific manner. This retrospective study included 875 adults treated with an allo-SCT. Six conditioning regimens were considered. Across the entire cohort and within each regimen, the hazard ratio (HR) for NRM associated with individual comorbidities was assessed using multivariable Cox regressions. In the overall population, renal dysfunction, hypoalbuminemia, and severe hepatic disease were associated with the highest risk of NRM (HR 2.1, HR 1.9, HR 1.7, respectively). The risk associated with specific comorbidities was modified by the conditioning regimen and was not correlated with intensity. In patients conditioned with fludarabine/busulfan (Flu/Bu4), NRM risk was increased with cardiac disease (HR 5.54). Severe pulmonary disease and a pre-existing infection were associated with increased NRM risk in patients receiving fludarabine/melphalan (HR 4.9) and fludarabine/treosulfan (HR 3.6), respectively. Comorbidities may exert effects unique to particular conditioning regimens, suggesting that regimen selection should be driven in part by specific comorbidities.",,"['Fein, Joshua A', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Shem-Tov, Noga', 'Yerushalmi, Ronit', 'Magen, Hila', 'Furie, Nadav', 'Kopel, Eli', 'Danylesko, Ivetta', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Shouval, Roni']","['Fein JA', 'Shimoni A', 'Labopin M', 'Shem-Tov N', 'Yerushalmi R', 'Magen H', 'Furie N', 'Kopel E', 'Danylesko I', 'Nagler A', 'Shouval R']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Internal Medicine ""F"" Department, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'The Mina and Everard Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan, Israel. shouval@gmail.com.', 'Dr. Pinchas Bornstein Talpiot Medical Leadership Program, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan, Israel. shouval@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180627,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', '*Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2018/06/29 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2018/06/29 06:00'],"['2018/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0185-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0185-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Aug;32(8):1787-1794. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0185-y.

Glass microspheres were found to decrease the spin-spin relaxation time (T2) of water protons in the gels, which was interpreted as enhanced water binding by the glass. We were thus interested in determining whether the observed effects on water proton relaxation were a direct consequence of water-glass interactions. Here we show how glass microspheres reduce the mobility of pure water, reflected in large decreases in the T2 of water protons, decreases in the self-diffusion coefficient of water molecules, a lower water activity, and strengthening of O-H bonds. Even though glass is considered an inert material, glass microspheres were shown to inhibit the growth of human embryonic kidney cells, and stimulate or inhibit the growth of leukemia and monocytic lymphoma cells in vitro, depending on dose and time. The germination of alfalfa seeds and the growth of E.coli cells were also inhibited upon exposure to glass microspheres. This work indicates that the properties and behavior of materials, even ones considered inert, can be affected by their size. These observations suggest possible toxicological consequences of exposure to microparticles, but also open us possibilities to affect cellular/organism function via modulation of macromolecular hydration.",,"['Marangoni, A G', 'Al-Abdul-Wahid, M S', 'Nicholson, R', 'Roma, A', 'Gravelle, A J', 'De Souza, J', 'Barbut, S', 'Spagnuolo, P A']","['Marangoni AG', 'Al-Abdul-Wahid MS', 'Nicholson R', 'Roma A', 'Gravelle AJ', 'De Souza J', 'Barbut S', 'Spagnuolo PA']","['Department Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G2W1, Canada. amarango@uoguelph.ca.', 'NMR Centre, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G2W1, Canada.', 'Department Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G2W1, Canada.', 'Department Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G2W1, Canada.', 'Department Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G2W1, Canada.', 'Department Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G2W1, Canada.', 'Department Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G2W1, Canada.', 'Department Food Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G2W1, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180627,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['059QF0KO0R (Water)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Escherichia coli/growth & development', 'Germination/physiology', 'Glass/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', '*Microspheres', 'Seeds/physiology', 'Water/*chemistry']",2018/06/29 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2018/06/29 06:00'],"['2018/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-28123-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-28123-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jun 27;8(1):9744. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-28123-4.,,,1,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3129-4473', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7925-5863']",PMC6021452,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PCR or DNA sequencing were used for JAK2 V617F, JAK2 exon12, CALR and MPL W515L/K mutation analyses, and follow-up information on patients was updated by direct phone call or follow-up in outpatient. RESULTS: Among the 410 patients with Ph negative MPN, 136 (33.2%) cases were asymptomatic at diagnosis. 389 cases were sequenced and JAK2 V617F was detected in 87.1% (122/140) of PV, 64.1% (118/184) of ET, 64.6% (42/65) of PMF; JAK2 exon 12 mutation in 1 case of PV; MPL W515L/K mutation in 1 case of ET and PMF, respectively; CALR mutation in 18(9.8%) cases of ET and 5 (7.7%) cases of PMF.

METHODS: CCK-8 was used to detect the effect of DADS on proliferation of K562 cells, flow cytometry was employed to observe the effect of cycle arrest by DADS and RNAi silencing MCL-1 gene in K562 cells. The expressions of MCL-1, PCNA and CDK1 in K562 cells treated with DADS were detected by Western blot. The amphigamy of MCL-1 with PCNA and CDK1 was detected by Coimmunoprecipitation. RESULTS: CCK-8 detection showed that the inhibition rates of K562 cells treated with 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 micromol/L DADS were 32.48%, 59.34%, 66.42%, 77.06%, 81.05% respectively (P<0.05). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the perecentages of G2/M cells were increased to 18.6% and 34.4%, 17.5% and 28.5%, respectively at 24 and 48 h after treating K562 cells with 60 and 120 micromol/L DADS (P<0.05). And the perecentage of G2/M cells of silencing MCL-1 was significantly increased (P<0.05). Silencing effects of MCL-1+DADS on the cells were enhanced more significantly as compared with DADS or MCL-1 alone (P<0.05). Western blot exhibited that DADS could markedly downregulate the expression of MCL-1, PCNA and CDK1(P<0.05). Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that MCL-1 bound with PCNA and CDK1, then forming heterodimers, which were downregulated respectively more significantly than that in the control group after treating K562 cells with DADS for 8 h (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: DADS can inhibit the K562 cell proliferation and induce them arrest G2/M through downregulation of MCL-1, then decreasing the expression of PCNA and CDK1 in hunan leukemia K562 cells.

METHODS: Fourty-nine patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (except M3) who were admitted to our hospital were selected. All the patients were older than 50 years old, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could not be performed for various reasons. Decitabine-based chemotherapy regimens were used during induction therapy including single decitabine therapy(DAC), decitabine combined with CAG regimen(DAC-CAG) and decitabine combined with HAAG regimen(DAC-HAAG). Most of patients continued to use the original treatment after complete remission, while others were given the standard ""3+7"" regimen chemotherapy. A total of 2-4 courses of treatment was conducted in the majority of patients. RESULTS: All of the 49 patients completed the induction therapy, in which 26 cases achieved complete remission(CR), 7 cases achieved partial remission(PR) and no response(NR) existed in 16 cases. The complete remission and the overall response rate(ORR) were 53% and 67% respectively. The overall response rate of DAC group, DAC-CAG group and DAC-HAAG group were 17%, 77% and 63% respectively. 14 patients were infected and 1 patients died of pulmonary infection during the induction therapy. The median number of suspended red blood cells and platelet infused were 9 units and 69 units respectively. Neutrophil recovery time was 15.1 days while the platelet recovery time was 20.1 days during the induction therapy. The mean follow-up time was 21 months. Overall survival(OS) was 75% at 6 months, 30% at 1 year, and 26% at 2 year, while disease-free survival(DFS) was 83% at 3 months, 54% at 1 year, and 47% at 2 year. The induction therapy could reach CR that was an independent prognostic factor, however, the initial white blood cell count, platelet count, age, chemotherapy regimen, prognostic stratification and whether complical by pnenmonia during chemotherapy were not independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: The induction efficacy of decitabine combined with chemotherapy is superior to that of decitabine alone. The outcome of induction chemotherapy is an independent prognostic factor, however, the high white blood cell count, poor karyotype, complications and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes do not affect long-term survival.

METHODS: Two hundred and Seventy-eight ALL children diagnosed and treated in Hainan general hospital from March 2013 to March 2017 were collected. All ALL children received therapy with CCLg-ALL-2008 regimen. The 3 year event-free survival (EFS) rate of ALL children in different groups was analyzed in terms of 4 indexes including sensitivity response to prednison at day 8 (D8-SRP), bone marrow remission at day 15 (D15-BMR) and at day 33 (D33-BMR), and minimal residual disease at day 33 (D33-BMR), and minimal residual disease at day 33(D33-MRD). These 4 indexes and other indexes possibly affecting the prognosis of ALL children were enrolled in Cox regression model for analysis of independent factors affecting the prognosis of ALL children. RESULTS: The D8-SRP test showed that among 269 ALL children, 240(89.22%) cases displayed prednisone poor response (PPR); the 3-year EFS rate in predrisone good response(PGR) group was significantly higher than that in PPR group(P<0.05). The D15-BMR detection showed that among 262 ALL children, the bone marrow remission(BMR) as M1 was observed in 230 cases (87.79%), M2 in 20 cases (7.63%) and M3 in 9 cases (4.58%); the 3-year EFS rate showed as follows:M1 group >M2 group >M3 group(P<0.05). The D33-BMR detection showed that among 257 ALL children, the BMR as M1 was observed in 227 cases (88.33%), M2 in 21 cses(8.17%) and M3 in 9 caes (3.51%); the 3-year EFS rate in 3 groups showed as follows: M1 group >M2 group >M3 group(P<0.05). The D33-MRD detection showed that among 185 ALL children, MRD<10(-10) was found in 128 cases (69.19%), MRD>/=10(-4)-10(-2) in 43 cases (23.24%), MRD >/=10(-2) in 14 cases (7.57%); the 3-year EFS rate in 3 groups showed as follows: MRD <10(-4) group > MRD>/= 10(-4)-10(-2) group>MRD>/=10(-2) group. The Cox regression analysis showed that PPR in D8-SRP test, M2 and M3 in D15 and D33 BMR detection, and MRD>/=10(-2) in D33 MRD detection as well as T-ALL typing were independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of ALL children.

METHODS: The drug-resistant cell lines SUP-B15/ADR and RS4;11/ADR were derived by exposing the parental cells [SUP-B15(Ph(+)) and RS4;11(Ph(-))] to the ascending concentrations of ADR. The cell viability was detected by CCK-8 method. The expression of P-gp was examined by Western blot, and RT-qPCR was performed to detect the expression of MDR1. RESULTS: The drug-resistant cell lines SUP-B15/ADR and RS4;11/ADR were successfully established, their resistance indexes were 14.088+/-0.763 and 10.473+/-1.024, respectively. After the cryopreserved SUP-B15/ADR and RS4;11/ADR cells were resuscitated, their survival rates were 88.4+/-1.2% and 89.3+/-1.6% respectively, while their resistance indexes were 13.976+/-0.967 and 10.342+/-0.846 respectively (P>0.05).

METHODS: The clinical data of 41 acute leukemia patients with febrile ncutropenia received high dose tigecycline (100 mg q12h), who showed ineffectiveness of treatment with carbapenems, from 20151.30-2017.1. 29 in our hospital were collected and analyzed retrospectively. The temperature, inflammatory indicators as well as hepatic and renal function before and after treatment with tigecycline were compared. RESULTS: Among 41 patients treated with tigecycline due to ineffectiveness of treatment with carbapenems, the infection had been controled in 34 cases, 7 patients died due to ineffectiveness of anti-infective treatment, these patients all were patients with relapse/refractory leukemia. 41 patients were examined etialogically, as a result, 22 patients showed possitive, among them the gram-negative bacill was found in 11(11/22) cases. The average deferves counce time of tigecycline was 28.2+/-12.0 hours. The temperature of patients treated with tigecycline for 48 hours decreased significantly (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in calcitonin and C-reactive protein levels after treatment with tigecycline (P>0.05), but cacitonin level displayed decrease tread. There was no hepatic and renal impairment after treatment with tigecycline, but levels of as partate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and blood area nitrogen in blood significantly increased as compared with levels before treatment with tigecycline (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The application of high dose tigecycline for treatment of febrile neutropenia is safety and effective.

METHODS: Clinical features and therapeutic effect were retrospectively analyzed in 75 AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation and 76 FLT3-ITD(-) AML patients with a normal karotype from June 2011 to April 2016. Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR, and FLT3-ITD mutation length was analyzed by DNA sequencing in 40 patients. RESULTS: AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation had higher WBC count and the ratio of BM blast cells at initial diagnosis was also higher than those in AML patients without FLT3-ITD mutation (95.13 vs 10.85)(P<0.01); 72% vs 59%(P<0.01). The CR rates in AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation less than those in AML patients without FLT3-ITD mutation(70.42% vs 94.7%)(P<0.01). OS (P<0.01) and RFS (P<0.01) were significantly increased in patients with AML who received allo-HSCT as compared with the patients who received consolidation chemotherapy and similar to AML patients without FLT3-ITD mutation who received HSCT. Patients with maintenance sorafenib after HSCT had longer OS (P<0.05) and RFS (P<0.05) than controls. ITDs exceeding 60 bp in length were associated with decreasing OS as compared with shorter ITD in AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation (P<0.05). OS and RFS were similar among the 2 groups receiving consolidation chemotherapy. Besides, the patients with allo-HSCT had shorter ITDs and longer OS than ITDs exceeding 60 bp (P<0.05) and similar to AML patients without FLT3-ITD mutation. CONCLUSION: AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation has poorer outcome, among which the prognosis was worse in patients with ITD exceeding 60 bp, and the chemotherapy alone can not improve the prognosis of FLT3-ITD(+).

METHODS: A total of 85 samples were collected from 50 AML (except M3) patients, including 50 samples from the newly diagnosed patients, 7 samples of AML patients with non-remission and 28 samples of AML patients with complete remission. All samples were used for detection of LSC from immune phenotype of CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) by flow cytometry. The detection of immune phenotypic of leukemia cells was performed in the newly diagnosed patients. The detection of leukemia- associated immune phenotypes (LAIP) was implemented in the non-newly diagnosed patients. RESULTS: The LSC was identified in the CD34(+)/ CD38(-)/ CD123(+) in AML and consistent with the relative position of the leukemia cell in flow cytometry figures. Statistical analysis showed significant difference in LSC content between the newly diagnosed AML group and the post-chemotherapy complete remission group(P<0.01),but did not between the newly diagnosed AML group and the post-chemotherapy non-remission group(P>0.05).There was significant positive correlation between the LSC content and MRD level in 28 AML patients with complete remission (r=0.680,P<0.01). CONCLUSION: LSC exist in AML and the relative position are consistent with the leukemia cells in flow cytometry figures, the size characteristics and weak expression of CD45 are also similar to leukemia cells.

OCT4 expression was determined in bone marrow sample collected before treatment. Complete response (CR), event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Results Compared with the controls, OCT4 mRNA expression was higher in AML patients (P < .001), and higher OCT4 expression was correlated with presence of complex karyotype (CK) (P = .037), FLT3-ITD mutation (P = .012) and poorer risk stratification (P < .001) in AML patients. As to predictive value, OCT4 mRNA expression was decreased in patients achieved CR compared to non-CR patients (P = .022). Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves showed that shorter EFS (9.0 (95% CI (7.7-10.3)) months vs. 25.0 (95% CI (17.5-32.5)) months, P < .001) and shorter OS (20.0 (95% CI (17.8-22.2) months vs. 33.0 months, P < .001) were observed in OCT4 mRNA high expression patients compared to OCT4 mRNA low expression patients. Multivariate Cox's proportional hazards regression analyses revealed that OCT4 mRNA high expression was an independent predictive factor for shorter EFS and OS in AML patients.

It is established that MTOR is a master regulator of starvation-induced macroautophagy/autophagy, but recent studies have also implicated an essential role for the MAPK8/cJun NH2-terminal kinase 1 signal transduction pathway. We found that MAPK8/JNK1 and MAPK9/JNK2 were not required for autophagy caused by starvation or MTOR inhibition in murine fibroblasts and epithelial cells.

Although T-ALL prognosis has significantly improved due to the development of intensive chemotherapeutic protocols, primary drug-resistant and relapsed patients still display a dismal outcome. In addition, lifelong irreversible late effects from conventional therapy are a growing problem for leukemia survivors. Therefore, novel targeted therapies are required to improve the prognosis of high-risk patients. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the kinase subunit of two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes, which are referred to as mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. These two complexes regulate a variety of physiological cellular processes including protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis, as well as autophagy in response to external cues. However, mTOR activity is frequently deregulated in cancer, where it plays a key oncogenetic role driving tumor cell proliferation, survival, metabolic transformation, and metastatic potential. Promising preclinical studies using mTOR inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in many human cancer types, including T-ALL. Here, we highlight our current knowledge of mTOR signaling and inhibitors in T-ALL, with an emphasis on emerging evidence of the superior efficacy of combinations consisting of mTOR inhibitors and either traditional or targeted therapeutics.",,"['Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Evangelisti C', 'Chiarini F', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['CNR Istituto di Genetica Molecolare, Unita di Bologna, 40136 Bologna, Italy. camilla.evangelisti@cnr.it.', 'Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, 40136 Bologna, Italy. camilla.evangelisti@cnr.it.', 'CNR Istituto di Genetica Molecolare, Unita di Bologna, 40136 Bologna, Italy. francesca.chiarini@cnr.it.', 'Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, 40136 Bologna, Italy. francesca.chiarini@cnr.it.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27834, USA. mccubreyj@ecu.edu.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy. alberto.martelli@unibo.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180626,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism']",2018/06/29 06:00,2018/10/16 06:00,['2018/06/29 06:00'],"['2018/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19071878 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19071878 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Jun 26;19(7). pii: ijms19071878. doi: 10.3390/ijms19071878.,['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'combination therapy', 'mTOR', 'targeted therapy']",7,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5196-7260'],PMC6073309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, a combination of histidine and tryptophan amino acids were designed and evaluated for their efficiency in intracellular delivery of cell-impermeable phosphopeptides and the anti-HIV drug, emtricitabine. Two new decapeptides, with linear and cyclic natures, both containing alternate tryptophan and histidine residues, were synthesized using Fmoc/tBu solid-phase chemistry. The peptides were characterized and purified by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. These peptides did not show significant toxicity up to 100 microM in ovarian cancer (SK-OV-3) and leukemia cancer (CCRF-CEM) cells. Furthermore, the cellular uptake of a fluorescence (F')-labeled cell-impermeable phosphopeptide (F'-GpYEEI) was enhanced in the presence of linear (WH)(5) and cyclic [WH](5) by 2- and 8-fold, respectively, compared to the uptake of the phosphopeptide alone. The cellular uptake was not significantly changed in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors. Furthermore, the intracellular uptake of the fluorescently-labeled anti-HIV drug, emtricitabine (F'-FTC), by linear (WH)(5) and cyclic [WH](5) in SK-OV-3 cancer cell lines was found to be enhanced by 3.5- and 9-fold, respectively, compared to that of the drug alone. Fluorescent uptake experiments confirmed the localization of F'-GpYEEI-loaded cyclic [WH](5) intracellularly in the SK-OV-3 cancer cell line after 3 h of incubation.

Nevertheless, it remains a relatively unexplored area in older patients with AML. The lack of progress in this field can be attributed to two main reasons. First, physicians have a general reluctance to submitting older adults to intensive chemotherapy due to their frailty and to the unfavourable biological disease profile predicting a poor outcome following conventional chemotherapy. Second, with the increasing use of low-intensity therapies (i.e., hypomethylating agents) differing from conventional drugs in mechanism of action and dynamics of response, there has been concomitant skepticism that these schedules can produce deep hematological responses. Furthermore, age dependent differences in disease biology also contribute to uncertainty on the prognostic/predictive impact in older adults of certain genetic abnormalities including those validated for MRD monitoring in younger patients.

We addressed how microenvironmental cues control tumor cell invasion in pediatric medulloblastoma (MB). We show that bFGF promotes MB tumor cell invasion through FGF receptor (FGFR) in vitro and that blockade of FGFR represses brain tissue infiltration in vivo. TGF-beta regulates pro-migratory bFGF function in a context-dependent manner. Under low bFGF, the non-canonical TGF-beta pathway causes ROCK activation and cortical translocation of ERK1/2, which antagonizes FGFR signaling by inactivating FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2), and promotes a contractile, non-motile phenotype. Under high bFGF, negative-feedback regulation of FRS2 by bFGF-induced ERK1/2 causes repression of the FGFR pathway. Under these conditions, TGF-beta counters inactivation of FRS2 and restores pro-migratory signaling. These findings pinpoint coincidence detection of bFGF and TGF-beta signaling by FRS2 as a mechanism that controls tumor cell invasion. Thus, targeting FRS2 represents an emerging strategy to abrogate aberrant FGFR signaling.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHOD: A retrospective analysis of 126 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with frontline FCR: 63 received second-line treatment (41 relapsed, nine refractory [SD/PD], 13 prior toxicity). Time to next treatment (TTNT) was calculated from beginning FCR to initiation of second-line therapy. Overall and event-free survival was calculated from initiation of salvage treatment (OS2/EFS2). RESULTS: Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 67 and 37 months from second-line therapy. TTNT < 24 months was associated with shorter OS2 and EFS2 similar to those observed with primary refractory disease (OS2 19 and 23 months; EFS2 12 and 9 months for TTNT < 24 months and SD/PD, respectively). TTNT >/= 24 months (71% chemotherapy-based second-line), had longer OS2 and EFS2 (48 and 20 months). Among the 13 patients receiving second-line therapy after discontinuing FCR due to toxicity EFS2 was 41 months (59 months from initiation of FCR). CONCLUSION: With limitations of sample size and treatment heterogeneity, patients progressing <24 months following FCR have poor outcomes, similar to refractory patients, while longer remissions are indicative of a chemoimmunotherapy sensitive disease.

Many therapies are currently being investigated, from immunomodulatory agents to adoptive cell therapy, bispecific T-cell engagers, oncolytic virotherapy, and checkpoint inhibition. One of the most exciting immunotherapies recently FDA approved is the use of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells for pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With this approval and others, immunotherapy for pediatric cancers is gaining traction. One of the caveats to many of these immunotherapies is the challenge of predictive biomarkers; determining which patients will respond to a given therapy is not yet possible. Much research is being focused on which biomarkers will be predictive and prognostic for these patients. Despite many benefits of immunotherapy, including less long-term side effects, some treatments are fraught with immediate side effects that range from mild to severe, although most are manageable. With few downsides and the potential for disease cures, immunotherapy in the pediatric population has the potential to move to the front-line of therapeutic options.",,"['Wedekind, Mary Frances', 'Denton, Nicholas L', 'Chen, Chun-Yu', 'Cripe, Timothy P']","['Wedekind MF', 'Denton NL', 'Chen CY', 'Cripe TP']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone and Marrow Transplant, Department of Pediatrics, Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH, 43205, USA."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, The Research Institute, Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, 700 Children's Drive, Research Bldg II, Columbus, OH, 43205, USA."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, The Research Institute, Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, 700 Children's Drive, Research Bldg II, Columbus, OH, 43205, USA."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, The Research Institute, Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, 700 Children's Drive, Research Bldg II, Columbus, OH, 43205, USA."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone and Marrow Transplant, Department of Pediatrics, Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH, 43205, USA. timothy.cripe@nationwidechildrens.org."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders, The Research Institute, Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, 700 Children's Drive, Research Bldg II, Columbus, OH, 43205, USA. timothy.cripe@nationwidechildrens.org.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Paediatr Drugs,Paediatric drugs,100883685,"['0 (CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['CTLA-4 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology']",2018/06/28 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2018/06/28 06:00'],"['2018/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40272-018-0297-x [doi]', '10.1007/s40272-018-0297-x [pii]']",ppublish,Paediatr Drugs. 2018 Oct;20(5):395-408. doi: 10.1007/s40272-018-0297-x.,,,5,,PMC6153971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The discovery of activating mutations of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 in a majority of patients has been a seminal observation, with several early phase clinical trials currently exploring these as potential therapeutic targets. Characterization of early T cell precursor ALL, incorporation of minimal residual disease assessment into therapeutic protocols, and use of pediatric-intensive regimens along with judicious use of allogeneic HCT have significantly improved risk stratification and treatment outcomes.

Within a context where both treatments and guidelines are fast evolving, we aim to shed new light on IFD management in hematologic departments in France. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional observational study was prospectively conducted in 24 French centers in September and October 2013. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-four hospitalized children and adult patients suffering from hematologic malignancy were enrolled: 147 (30%) were allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, 131 (27%) were patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 71 (14%) were patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who did not undergo allogeneic HSCT, and the 145 (29%) remaining patients did not belong to the three above groups. Two hundred forty-six patients (50%) received antifungal treatment, which was prophylactic in 187 (76%) treated patients. These rates were similar across all groups (63-80%). Patients received prophylaxis with an azole (79%), intravenous amphotericin B formulation (10%), echinocandin (9%), or two combination drugs (2%). CONCLUSION: Results indicate that prophylaxis is the leading antifungal strategy in French hematology units, regardless of the disease condition, representing 76% of prescriptions for antifungal therapy.

The nature of this disease is such that, while imposing a high level of care workload on the family, it also affects various family aspects including personal, familial, and social interactions and relationships, as well as family functioning. This study aims to describe family interactions in childhood leukemia. METHODS: This study was an exploratory descriptive study, conducted on 58 participants (40 family members and 18 members of the health team), with purposeful sampling and semi-structured interviews-63 personal interviews and four group interviews-in the research context of the Cancer Hospital in Isfahan, 2016-2017. Data analysis in this study was carried out with qualitative content analysis using the Graneheim method. RESULTS: In the data analysis, four main categories and 13 subcategories were revealed. The first category, changes in roles, included the subcategories of super caregiver mother, supportive super father, role shift, self and others' forgetfulness, and confusion in roles and tasks; the second category, changes in interpersonal relationships, included the subcategories of changes in spousal relationships, changes in parent-child relationships, and changes in relationships between children; the third category, changes in social interactions, included the subcategories of changes in relationships with relatives, changes in relationships with peers, changes in relationships with the therapy team, and changes in interaction with supportive social networks; and the fourth category, changes in relationship with God, included the subcategories of spiritual bond and spiritual illness. CONCLUSION: Regarding the findings of this study, it is expected that health system policymakers in the country, while striving to strengthen the positive aspect of changes in family relationships and interactions, will develop and execute operational, comprehensive, and society-based plans in order to eliminate the barriers and problems of relationships within the family, as well as in relation to the larger community, taking into consideration the family's cultural and social beliefs.",,"['Moghaddasi, Jaefar', 'Taleghani, Fariba', 'Moafi, Alireza', 'Malekian, Azadeh', 'Keshvari, Mahrokh', 'Ilkhani, Mahnaz']","['Moghaddasi J', 'Taleghani F', 'Moafi A', 'Malekian A', 'Keshvari M', 'Ilkhani M']","['Department of Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Nursing and Midwifery Care Research Center, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.

The clinical features of RT are fairly non-specific and unable to discriminate transformation from other mimics. In case of clinically suspected RT, a CT/MRT is recommended, and FDG-PET/CT may help to select the site of biopsy. Radiological features suggestive of RT have been defined, but there are only limited data about their predictive value, and histological confirmation is still considered the gold standard for RT diagnosis. We retrospectively analyzed 34 patients with clinically suspected RT and available radiological and histological data. A histopathological diagnosis of RT with concordant clinical and radiological findings was obtained in 13 patients. In 18 patients, CT did not show features of transformation, concordant with lack of RT in the biopsy. Of interest, a distinct lymphoma other than DLBCL was identified in two of these cases. A false-positive radiological diagnosis of RT was rendered in two patients, including a case of Herpes simplex virus lymphadenitis.

We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 116 older patients (median age 64 years) who underwent HCT from 2006 to 2015 for myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1). On univariate analysis, overall survival (OS) for the cohort at 3 years was 33% (95% CI 25-42). Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 3 years were 24% (95% CI 16-32) and 43% (95% CI 34-52), respectively. Multivariable analysis for OS demonstrated AML patients to have superior outcome (HR 1.60 for other myeloid, 95% CI 1.01-2.54, p = 0.045), as well as related donors (HR 1.92 for unrelated, 95% CI 1.22-3.03, p = 0.005). For NRM, AML patients had superior outcome (HR 1.76 for other myeloid, 95% CI 1.03-3.01, p = 0.038), as well as patients with related donors (HR 1.81 for unrelated, 95% CI 1.07-3.07, p = 0.028).

In the two groups, we evaluated complete remission (CR), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS). The AZA group included 89 patients; median age was 73 years (range 61-80) and median white blood cell count (WBCc) 2.5 x 10(9)/L (range 0.27-83), 45% of the patients had BM blasts >/= 30%, and 44 (49%) had a secondary AML (sAML). Karyotype was evaluable in 69 patients: 51 (74%) had intermediate-risk abnormalities and 18 (26%) an unfavorable risk karyotype. IC group consisted of 110 patients who received an induction course with mitoxantrone, cytarabine, and etoposide, followed by two consolidation cycles including idarubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide. Median age was 67 years (range 61-78) and median WBCc 8.0 x 10(9)/L (range 0.69-258); 44 (40%) had a sAML. Karyotype was evaluable in 88 patients, 71 (81%) had intermediate risk, and 17 (19%) unfavorable risk karyotype. To minimize the effects of treatment selection bias, adjustments were made using the propensity-score matching method, which yielded 74 patient pairs. CR rate was significantly higher in IC vs AZA group (73 vs 25%, respectively) (p < 0.0001), but the 3-year OS rates and median OS were not significantly different (21.6 vs 11% and 15.8 vs 13 months, respectively).

In this study, we aimed on the clinical features and the prognostic significance associated with CEBPA mutations in 30 pediatric patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: In addition, the association between found variants and mutations of Ten-Eleven-Translocation 2 (TET2), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and Casitas B-cell lymphoma (CBL), FLT3 (Fms-Related Tyrosine Kinase), JAK2 (Januse Kinase-2) and Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) were analyzed, which are important prognostic risk factors for pediatric acute leukemia patients. The entire CEBPA coding region was screened using the NGS method. RESULTS: CEBPA mutations were detected in 16 (53.3 %) of 30 patients. In total, ten distinct of nucleotide changes were identified in 30 patients, including 6 novel and 4 known mutations by sequencing the entire CEBPA gene. We found 6 frame shift mutations, 1 missense mutation, 3 synonymous variants. The most common mutation was the c.487del G resulting p.Glu163Ser in 5 cases. Three patients carried CEBPA double mutations. CONCLUSION: The detected variants in this article seemed to be the first screening results of genes studied by NGS in pediatric acute leukemia patients.

Although most cases originate from developing countries, an ageing population and increased prevalence of chronic illness may mean some clinicians practicing in developed countries will encounter ROCM cases in their careers. Yohai et al published a systematic review of 145 case reports from 1970 to 1993 assessing prognostic factors for patients presenting with ROCM. We present an updated review of the literature and assess whether survival outcomes have changed in the two decades since that seminal paper. SEARCH STRATEGY: An extensive Medline literature search was performed for case reports published between 1994 and 2015. RESULTS: In total, 210 published cases were identified from the literature review, of which 175 patients from 140 papers were included in this review. Fifty-five were female, with an overall mean age of 43 years. Overall survival rate was 59.5%, which was not significantly better than the previous series reported (60%) reported by Yohai et al. Survival rates in patients with chronic renal disease had improved, from 19% to 52%, and in patients with leukaemia (from 13% to 50%). Facial necrosis and hemiplegia remained poor prognostic indicators (33% and 39% survival rates, respectively). Early commencement of medical treatment related to better survival outcomes (61% if commenced within first 12 days of presentation, compared to 33% if after 13 days). Timing of surgery had less of an effect on overall survival. However, in 28 cases that did not receive any surgical treatment, survival was only 21%. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall survival rates have not improved, survival in patients with renal disease were better, potentially due to the introduction of liposomal amphotericin B which is less nephrotoxic. Prompt recognition of ROCM, reversal of predisposing co-morbidities and aggressive medical treatment remain the cornerstone of managing this highly aggressive disease.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Vaughan, Casey', 'Bartolo, Amanda', 'Vallabh, Nimisha', 'Leong, Samuel C']","['Vaughan C', 'Bartolo A', 'Vallabh N', 'Leong SC']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20180808,England,Clin Otolaryngol,Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,101247023,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Fungal Infections/microbiology/*mortality', '*Forecasting', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Mucormycosis/*mortality', 'Nose Diseases/microbiology/*mortality', 'Orbital Diseases/microbiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate/trends']",2018/06/28 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2018/06/28 06:00'],"['2018/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/coa.13175 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Otolaryngol. 2018 Dec;43(6):1454-1464. doi: 10.1111/coa.13175.

The analysis included 369 CML patients in the chronic or accelerated phases, selected from the CML Cooperative Study Group database; 25 events in 23 (6.2%) of these patients were VAEs. At the time of VAE incidence, nine patients were on treatment with imatinib, 12 with nilotinib, three with dasatinib, and one with bosutinib. VAE incidence comprised 13 cases of ischemic heart disease (IHD), eight of cerebral infarction (CI), and four of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). IHD incidence rate in the study population was higher than that in the age-matched general population, particularly in nilotinib-treated patients, while CI incidence rate was almost equivalent. Compared with the Suita score, the SCORE chart and the Framingham score risk assessment tools detected more patients with high or very high risk of VAEs. In conclusion, incidence of IHD requires closer monitoring in nilotinib-treated patients.

Three patients, fulfilling the PMR ACR/EULAR criteria, received TCZ at the dosage of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks for three times followed by prednisone 0.2 mg/kg in case of inefficacy.

An ischaemic visual accident suggestive of GCA occurred in one patient during TCZ treatment. IL-6 was increased at baseline compared to controls, further increased after the first TCZ infusion, and was suppressed by GC. IL-17 production decreased during TCZ treatment and reverted to pre-treatment levels after GC. VEGF e PDGF showed a less constant pattern, but an increase of VEGF concentration antedated visual symptoms. The other cytokines were not detectable in patients and controls.

We investigated the vascular adverse effects of three generations of TKIs in a translational model for atherosclerosis, the APOE*3Leiden.CETP mouse. Mice were treated for sixteen weeks with imatinib (150 mg/kg BID), nilotinib (10 and 30 mg/kg QD) or ponatinib (3 and 10 mg/kg QD), giving similar drug exposures as in CML-patients. Cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed longitudinally, and histopathological analysis of atherosclerosis and transcriptome analysis of the liver was performed. Imatinib and ponatinib decreased plasma cholesterol (imatinib, -69%, p < 0.001; ponatinib 3 mg/kg, -37%, p < 0.001; ponatinib 10 mg/kg-44%, p < 0.001) and atherosclerotic lesion area (imatinib, -78%, p < 0.001; ponatinib 3 mg/kg, -52%, p = 0.002; ponatinib 10 mg/kg, -48%, p = 0.006), which were not affected by nilotinib. In addition, imatinib increased plaque stability.

Some Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumors have higher Programmed Cell Death Ligand, PD-L1 expression. However, it is not known how EBV alters ICs in the context of its preferred host, the B lymphocyte and in derived lymphomas. Here, we found that latency III-expressing Burkitt lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) or their EBNA2-transfected derivatives express high PD-L1. In a DLBCL model, EBNA2 but not LMP1 is sufficient to induce PD-L1. Latency III-expressing DLBCL biopsies showed high levels of PD-L1. The PD-L1 targeting oncosuppressor microRNA miR-34a was downregulated in EBNA2-transfected lymphoma cells. We identified early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) as a repressor of miR-34a transcription. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of EBF1 was sufficient to induce miR-34a transcription, which in turn reduced PD-L1. MiR-34a reconstitution in EBNA2-transfected DLBCL reduced PD-L1 expression and increased its immunogenicity in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) and in three-dimensional biomimetic microfluidic chips. Given the importance of PD-L1 inhibition in immunotherapy and miR-34a dysregulation in cancers, our findings may have important implications for combinatorial immunotherapy, which include IC inhibiting antibodies and miR-34a, for EBV-associated cancers.",,"['Anastasiadou, Eleni', 'Stroopinsky, Dina', 'Alimperti, Stella', 'Jiao, Alan L', 'Pyzer, Athalia R', 'Cippitelli, Claudia', 'Pepe, Giuseppina', 'Severa, Martina', 'Rosenblatt, Jacalyn', 'Etna, Marilena P', 'Rieger, Simone', 'Kempkes, Bettina', 'Coccia, Eliana M', 'Sui, Shannan J Ho', 'Chen, Christopher S', 'Uccini, Stefania', 'Avigan, David', 'Faggioni, Alberto', 'Trivedi, Pankaj', 'Slack, Frank J']","['Anastasiadou E', 'Stroopinsky D', 'Alimperti S', 'Jiao AL', 'Pyzer AR', 'Cippitelli C', 'Pepe G', 'Severa M', 'Rosenblatt J', 'Etna MP', 'Rieger S', 'Kempkes B', 'Coccia EM', 'Sui SJH', 'Chen CS', 'Uccini S', 'Avigan D', 'Faggioni A', 'Trivedi P', 'Slack FJ']","['Harvard Medical School Initiative for RNA Medicine, Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The Wyss Institute for Biological Inspired Engineering at Harvard, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School Initiative for RNA Medicine, Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Sant'Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Sant'Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Bioinformatics Core, Harvard T.

We hypothesize that combinatorial targeting of AML cells can enhance therapeutic efficacy without increasing toxicity. To identify target antigen combinations specific for AML and leukemic stem cells, we generated a detailed protein expression profile based on flow cytometry of primary AML (n = 356) and normal bone marrow samples (n = 34), and a recently reported integrated normal tissue proteomic data set. We analyzed antigen expression levels of CD33, CD123, CLL1, TIM3, CD244 and CD7 on AML bulk and leukemic stem cells at initial diagnosis (n = 302) and relapse (n = 54). CD33, CD123, CLL1, TIM3 and CD244 were ubiquitously expressed on AML bulk cells at initial diagnosis and relapse, irrespective of genetic characteristics. For each analyzed target, we found additional expression in different populations of normal hematopoiesis. Analyzing the coexpression of our six targets in all dual combinations (n = 15), we found CD33/TIM3 and CLL1/TIM3 to be highly positive in AML compared with normal hematopoiesis and non-hematopoietic tissues.

This has led to notable improvements in the accuracy and timing of diagnosis and prognostication of MDS, as well as the identification of possible novel targets for therapeutic intervention. For the practicing clinician, however, this increase in genomic, epigenomic, and immunologic knowledge needs consideration in a ""real-world"" context to aid diagnostic specificity. Although the 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification for MDS is comprehensive and timely, certain limitations still exist for day-to-day clinical practice. In this review, we describe an up-to-date diagnostic approach to patients with suspected lower-risk MDS, including hypoplastic MDS, and demonstrate the requirement for an ""integrated"" diagnostic approach. Moreover, in the era of rapid access to massive parallel sequencing platforms for mutational screening, we suggest which patients should undergo such analyses, when such screening should be performed, and how those data should be interpreted.

However, the molecular mechanism behind the activity of mutant CALR remains unknown. Here we show that mutant, but not wild-type, CALR interacts to form a homomultimeric complex. This intermolecular interaction among mutant CALR proteins depends on their carboxyl-terminal domain, which is generated by a unique frameshift mutation found in patients with MPN. With a competition assay, we demonstrated that the formation of mutant CALR homomultimers is required for the binding and activation of MPL. Since association with MPL is required for the oncogenicity of mutant CALR, we propose a model in which the constitutive activation of the MPL downstream pathway by mutant CALR multimers induces the development of MPN.

However, according to the latest monitoring data, the replication ability and isolation rate of ALV-K have clearly increased, and new strains with mutations in the pol gene have also been found. To determine the effects of such mutations on the biological characteristics of ALV-K, a pair of infectious clones were constructed and rescued. The first virus was an ALV-K Chinese isolate with mutations in its pol gene, named rSDAUAK-11. The second virus was a recuperative rSDAUAK-11 from which mutations in the pol gene were recovered according to the corresponding region of the ALV-K prototype virus JS11C1, named rRSDAUAK-11. In addition, two quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were developed to specifically detect these virus strains. Using such methods, we observed a marked improvement of the reverse transcriptase activity, replication ability and vertical transmission ability of rSDAUAK-11, which also revealed a formidable competitive advantage in mixed infection with rRSDAUAK-11 and corresponded to the differences between the wild strains SDAUAK-11 and JS11C1.

Interestingly, IgHV3-21 is often co-expressed with light chain IgLV3-21, which is potentially able to trigger cell-autonomous BCR-mediated signaling. However, this light chain has never been characterized independently of the heavy chain IgHV3-21.Experimental Design: We performed total RNA sequencing in 32 patients and investigated IgLV3-21 prognostic impact in terms of treatment-free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS) in 3 other independent cohorts for a total of 813 patients. IgLV3-21 presence was tested by real-time PCR and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.Results: Using total RNA sequencing to characterize 32 patients with high-risk CLL, we found a high frequency (28%) of IgLV3-21 rearrangements. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that these patients express higher levels of genes responsible for ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation (P < 0.0001) as well as MYC target genes (P = 0.0003). Patients with IgLV3-21 rearrangements displayed a significantly shorter TFS and OS (P < 0.05), particularly those with IgHV mutation. In each of the three independent validation cohorts, we showed that IgLV3-21 rearrangements-similar to UM IgHV status-conferred poor prognosis compared with mutated IgHV (P < 0.0001). Importantly, we confirmed by multivariate analysis that this was independent of IgHV mutational status or subset #2 stereotyped receptor (P < 0.0001).Conclusions: We have demonstrated for the first time that a light chain can affect CLL prognosis and that IgLV3-21 light chain usage defines a new subgroup of CLL patients with poor prognosis.

Typical symptoms of VOD/SOS may include hyperbilirubinemia, painful hepatomegaly, weight gain, and ascites. Defibrotide, a polydisperse mixture of predominantly single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides, is currently the only therapy approved to treat hepatic VOD/SOS with pulmonary/renal dysfunction (ie, multiorgan dysfunction/multiorgan failure [MOD/MOF]) following HSCT in the United States and to treat severe hepatic VOD/SOS post-HSCT in the European Union. In preclinical and human studies, defibrotide has demonstrated profibrinolytic, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and angio-protective actions, thus promoting an anticoagulant phenotype of the endothelium that protects and stabilizes the function of endothelial cells. In a phase 3, historically controlled, multicenter trial in adults and children with VOD/SOS and MOD/MOF (defibrotide: n = 102; controls treated before defibrotide availability: n = 32), defibrotide resulted in significantly greater day +100 survival following HSCT (38.2%) vs controls (25.0%; propensity analysis-estimated between-group difference: 23%; P = .0109). The most common adverse events (AEs) were hypotension and diarrhea; rates of common hemorrhagic AEs were similar in the defibrotide and historical control group (64% and 75%, respectively). In a phase 3 prophylaxis trial, defibrotide was found to lower incidence of VOD/SOS in children (not an approved indication) and reduce the incidence of graft-versus-host disease. This review describes the development and clinical applications of defibrotide, focusing on its on-label use in patients with VOD/SOS and MOD/MOF after HSCT.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Richardson, Paul G', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Iacobelli, Massimo', 'Nejadnik, Bijan']","['Richardson PG', 'Carreras E', 'Iacobelli M', 'Nejadnik B']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Spanish Bone Marrow Donor Program, Josep Carreras Leukemia Foundation and Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Techitra s.r.l., Milan, Italy; and.', 'Galena Biopharma, San Ramon, CA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Polydeoxyribonucleotides)', '438HCF2X0M (defibrotide)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Multiple Organ Failure/diet therapy/etiology', 'Polydeoxyribonucleotides/*therapeutic use']",2018/06/28 06:00,2019/04/17 06:00,['2018/06/28 06:00'],"['2017/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2017008375 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2017008375 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Jun 26;2(12):1495-1509. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017008375.,,,12,,PMC6020812,,,,,,,,,,,['Blood Adv. 2018 Aug 14;2(15):1853.

Using an MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mouse model, we demonstrate dynamic alterations of BM cellular niche components, including MSPCs and endothelial cells during AML development and its association with AML engraftment. Primary patient AML cells also induced similar niche alterations in xenografted mice. AML cell infiltration in BM causes an expansion of early B-cell factor 2(+) (Ebf2(+)) MSPCs with reduced Cxcl12 expression and enhanced generation of more differentiated mesenchymal progenitor cells. Importantly, in vivo fate-mapping indicates that Ebf2(+) MSPCs participated in AML niche formation. Ebf2(+) cell deletion accelerated the AML development. These data suggest that native BM MSPCs may suppress AML. However, they can be remodeled by AML cells to form leukemic niche that might contribute to AML progression. AML induced dysregulation of hematopoietic niche factors like Angptl1, Cxcl12, Kitl, Il6, Nov, and Spp1 in AML BM MSPCs, which was associated with AML engraftment and partially appeared before the massive expansion of AML cells, indicating the possible involvement of the niche factors in AML progression.

Treatment failure can probably occur if subtherapeutic levels are achieved. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 32-year-old woman who suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia was admitted and received treatment with vincristine and dexamethasone. After several days, to control her fever, based on two consecutive positive serum galactomannan test results, voriconazole as an antifungal agent was added to Aspergillus infection treatment. Through the first week after voriconazole initiation, its plasma concentrations were subtherapeutic. The most suspicious medication for interaction was dexamethasone, which can induce CYP450 isoenzymes and reduce plasma concentration. CONCLUSION: As a result of the narrow therapeutic window of voriconazole and the relationship between efficacy and plasma concentration of azoles, therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole in patients receiving a high dose of glucocorticoids is recommended, in order to achieve optimal response to treatment and toxicity reduction.

Constitutive activation of NFkappaB and beta-catenin signaling promotes cellular proliferation and survival and resistance to Imatinib therapy in CML. Akirin-2 is a nuclear protein which is required for NFkappaB dependent gene expression as a cofactor and has been linked to Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. The purpose of this study is to examine Akirin-2, NFkappaB and beta-catenin in imatinib resistance of CML and to test if any direct physical protein-protein interaction exists between NFkB and both beta-catenin and Akirin-2. METHODS: RT-PCR and western blot were performed to determine Akirin-2, NFkappaB-p65 and beta-catenin gene and protein expressions, Co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis were carried out to detect the direct physical interactions and binding of NFkappaB-p65 and beta-catenin proteins to MDR1 promoter region, respectively. RESULTS: beta-catenin and NFkappaB-p65 proteins bound to DNA promoter regions of MDR1 in imatinib-sensitive and resistant CML cells, whereas any direct protein-protein interaction could not be found between NFkappaB-p65 and Akirin-2 or beta-catenin proteins. Nuclear beta-catenin and NFkappaB-p65 levels increased in imatinib resistance. Moreover, increased Akirin-2 protein accumulation in the nucleus was shown for the first time in imatinib resistant CML cells. DISCUSSION: We show for the first time that Akirin-2 can be a novel biomarker in imatinib resistance. Targeting Akirin-2, NFkappaB and beta-catenin genes may provide an opportunity to overcome imatinib resistance in CML.",,"['Karabay, Arzu Zeynep', 'Koc, Asli', 'Ozkan, Tulin', 'Hekmatshoar, Yalda', 'Altinok Gunes, Buket', 'Sunguroglu, Asuman', 'Buyukbingol, Zeliha', 'Atalay, Arzu', 'Aktan, Fugen']","['Karabay AZ', 'Koc A', 'Ozkan T', 'Hekmatshoar Y', 'Altinok Gunes B', 'Sunguroglu A', 'Buyukbingol Z', 'Atalay A', 'Aktan F']","['a Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Biochemistry , Ankara University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Biochemistry , Ankara University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'b Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology , Ankara University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'b Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology , Ankara University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'c Vocational School of Health , Ankara University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'b Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology , Ankara University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Biochemistry , Ankara University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'd Biotechnology Institute, Ankara University , Ankara , Turkey.', 'a Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Biochemistry , Ankara University , Ankara , Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180626,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB7A protein, human)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Transcription Factor RelA/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', '*beta Catenin/biosynthesis/genetics']",2018/06/28 06:00,2018/11/02 06:00,['2018/06/28 06:00'],"['2018/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2018.1488795 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2018 Dec;23(10):765-770. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2018.1488795.

However, the diagnostic and prognostic significance of miR-34a in AML remains largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore its associations with clinical characteristics and prognosis of AML patients. METHODS: This study detected serum miR-34a level in 117 diagnosed AML patients and 60 control subjects by using qRT-PCR, and results were compared to clinical features and patient outcome. Since cytogenetically-normal AML (CN-AML) has a good uniformity of cytogenetics and provides a perfect platform for detection of AML biomarkers, we further analyzed miR-34a expression in 56 CN-AML subjects. RESULTS: We found that miR-34a was significantly downregulated in AML and CN-AML patients. MiR-34a underexpression was commonly observed in AML patients with intermediate/poor risk cytogenetic, and M5 subtype. ROC analysis demonstrated that serum miR-34a could well identify AML/CN-AML patients from healthy individuals. More importantly, miR-34a expression was found negatively correlated with aggressive clinical variable, and served as an independent prognostic indicator. In addition, AML/CN-AML patients with low miR-34a expression displayed shorter overall and recurrence free survival.

In this study, we evaluated the immunotoxicity of beta-CYP and 3-PBA on the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60. Both beta-CYP and 3-PBA reduced cell viability. In addition, both beta-CYP and 3-PBA stimulated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while only beta-CYP induced cell cycle arrest in G1 stage. Moreover, exposure to beta-CYP and 3-PBA at 100 muM inhibited all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced mRNA expressions of the granulocytic differentiation-related genes, CD11b and CSF-3R. Furthermore, exposure to beta-CYP and 3-PBA resulted in a downregulation of the granulocytic differentiation promoting transcriptional factors, PU.1 and C/EBPepsilon. Furthermore, we found that beta-CYP and 3-PBA exposure led to elevated levels of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and that pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) blocked the toxic effects caused by beta-CYP and 3-PBA.

IgE is produced by plasma cells that differentiate from allergen-specific B cells. B cells are known to be killed by chemotherapy; however, it is not known whether A-IgE-secreting plasma cells are killed or inhibited by chemotherapy. If yes, serum A-IgE levels would be expected to decrease after chemotherapy. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether A-IgE levels in atopic individuals (serum A-IgE >/=0.35 kUA/L) decrease into the nonatopic range (< 0.35 kUA/L) after chemotherapy. METHODS: In 105 patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia, we measured serum A-IgE before and after chemotherapy. In a subset of these patients, we also measured B cell counts before and after chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of the 105 patients, 36 were atopic. In these patients, median A-IgE level before chemotherapy was 1.6 kUA/L whereas the median level after chemotherapy was 0.6 kUA/L (p < 0.001). In 12/36 (33%) patients, A-IgE levels decreased into the nonatopic range. In nonatopic patients (n = 69), the median A-IgE level also dropped: from 0.04 kUA/L before to 0.03 kUA/L after chemotherapy (p = 0.001). Among the total patients (n = 105), the median pre:post-chemotherapy A-IgE ratio was 1.8 (2.6 in atopic and 1.5 in nonatopic patients). In contrast, the median ratio of pre:post-chemotherapy B cell counts was 87.6. CONCLUSIONS: A-IgE levels decrease after chemotherapy but markedly less than B cell counts. Thus, at least some A-IgE plasma cells appear to survive chemotherapy.","['(c) 2018 S.

In most countries, it is impossible to establish full residential histories. In recent publications, childhood leukaemia and background radiation have been studied with and without full residential histories. This paper investigates the consequences of lacking such full data. Data from a nationwide Finnish Case-Control study of Childhood Leukaemia and gamma rays were analysed. This included 1093 children diagnosed with leukaemia in Finland in 1990-2011. Each case was matched by gender and year of birth to three controls. Full residential histories were available. The dose estimates were based on outdoor background radiation measurements. The indoor dose rates were obtained with a dwelling type specific conversion coefficient and the individual time-weighted mean red bone marrow dose rates were calculated using age-specific indoor occupancy and the age and gender of the child. Radiation from Chernobyl fallout was included and a 2-year latency period assumed. The median separation between successive dwellings was 3.4km and median difference in red bone marrow dose 2.9nSv/h. The Pearson correlation between the indoor red bone marrow dose rates of successive dwellings was 0.62 (95% CI 0.60, 0.64). The odds ratio for a 10nSv/h increase in dose rate with full residential histories was 1.01 (95% CI 0.97, 1.05). Similar odds ratios were calculated with dose rates based on only the first dwelling (1.02, 95% CI 0.99, 1.05) and only the last dwelling (1.00, 95% CI 0.98, 1.03) and for subjects who had lived only in a single dwelling (1.05, 95% CI 0.98, 1.10). Knowledge of full residential histories would always be the option of choice. However, due to the strong correlation between exposure estimates in successive dwellings and the uncertainty about the most relevant exposure period, estimation of overall exposure level from a single address is also informative.

Despite recent advances in the development of specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), some CML patients suffer from relapse due to TKI resistance. Here, we assessed the efficacy of a novel combinatorial arsenic trioxide (ATO) and cisplatin (CDDP) treatment (Ato-C) in human Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic cells. Combination index analyses revealed that a synergistic interaction of ATO and CDDP elicits a wide range of effects in K562, KU-812, MEG-A2, and KCL-22cells. Notably, Ato-C synergistically enhanced apoptosis and decreased the survival of both acquired TKI-resistant CML cells and the cells expressing mutant Bcr-Abl(T315I). In addition, Ato-C dramatically decreased the phosphorylation level of forkhead transcription factor FOXO1/3a and STAT5 as well as c-Myc protein level. Interestingly, results of gene set enrichment analysis showed that Ato-C significantly downregulates the expression of MYC- and/or E2F1-target genes. Furthermore, Ato-C significantly suppressed the proliferation of MEG-A2-derived tumor when compared with that following monotherapy in vivo. Collectively, these results suggest that combined Ato-C treatment could be a promising alternative to the current therapeutic regime in CML.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

PROCEDURE: This study included 1,489 patients with ALL, aged 1-45 years, treated according to the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol, using alternate-week dexamethasone during delayed intensification, with prospective registration of symptomatic ON. We aimed at comparing risk factors, timing, and clinical characteristics of ON in children and young adults. RESULTS: ON was diagnosed in 67 patients, yielding a 5-year cumulative incidence of 6.3%, but 28% in female adolescents. Median age at ALL diagnosis was 12.1 years and 14.9 years for females and males, respectively. At ON diagnosis, 59 patients had bone pain (91%) and 30 (46%) had multiple-joint involvement. The median interval between ALL and ON diagnosis was significantly shorter in children aged 1.0-9.9 years (0.7 years [range: 0.2-2.1]) compared with adolescents (1.8 years [range: 0.3-3.7, P < 0.001]) and adults (2.1 years [range: 0.4-5.3, P = 0.001]). Female sex was a risk factor in adolescent patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-4.2) but not in children aged 1.1-9.9 years (HR = 2.4, 95% CI: 0.9-6.2, P = 0.08) or adults aged 19-45 years (HR = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.3-4.0). Age above 10 years at ALL diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] = 3.7, P = 0.026) and multiple joints affected at ON diagnosis (OR = 3.4, P = 0.027) were risk factors for developing severe ON. CONCLUSION: We provide a detailed phenotype of patients with ALL with symptomatic ON, including description of risk factors and timing of ON across age groups.

The remaining 17 MLL-r cases exhibited complex translocations with homozygous disruptions on chromosome 11 or two breakpoints on the same MLL allele with a deletion of functional regions. A total of 77 patients (45 ALL and 32 AML) received chemotherapy with a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Unexpectedly, we identified children with reciprocal MLL fusions who exhibited relatively favorable outcomes compared with those in children with complex translocations or a single direct MLL fusion allele (66.1% vs. 24.6% and 27.6%, P = 0.001). Reciprocal MLL fusion may be functionally rescued by a partially truncated MLL protein. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive MLL-r analysis by targeted next-generation sequencing can provide detailed molecular information and is helpful for precise stratified treatment and clinical prognosis determination.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Yang, Liu', 'Ding, Lixia', 'Liang, Jianwei', 'Chen, Jing', 'Tang, YanJing', 'Xue, Huiliang', 'Gu, Longjun', 'Shen, Shuhong', 'Li, Benshang', 'Chen, Jing']","['Yang L', 'Ding L', 'Liang J', 'Chen J', 'Tang Y', 'Xue H', 'Gu L', 'Shen S', 'Li B', 'Chen J']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'Shanghai Ministry of Science and Technology Key Laboratory of Health and Disease Genomics, Chinese National Human Genome Center at Shanghai, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180626,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2018/06/27 06:00,2019/05/11 06:00,['2018/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27266 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Oct;65(10):e27266. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27266.

Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene produces several isoforms due to alternative splicing; however, the biological function of each specific isoform has yet to be identified. In this study, we report a previously unknown role for PMLIV, the most intensely studied nuclear isoform, in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling-associated EMT and migration in breast cancer. This study demonstrates that PMLIV overexpression promotes a more aggressive mesenchymal phenotype and increases the migration of MCF-7 cancer cells. This event is associated with activation of the TGF-beta canonical signaling pathway through the induction of Smad2/3 phosphorylation and the translocation of phospho-Smad2/3 to the nucleus. In this study, we report a previously unknown role for PMLIV in TGF-beta signaling-induced regulation of breast cancer-associated EMT and migration.

This study examined the relationship between KIR gene content and clinical outcomes including the control of opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus in the setting of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling HSCT in an Australian cohort. The presence of the KIR B haplotype which contain more activating receptors in the donor, in particular centromeric B haplotype genes (Cen-B), was associated with improved overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing sibling HSCT and receiving myeloablative conditioning. Donor Cen-B haplotype was also associated with reduced acute graft versus host disease grades II-IV whereas donor telomeric-B haplotype was associated with decreased incidence of CMV reactivation. In contrast, we were not able to demonstrate a reduced rate of relapse when the donor had KIR Cen-B, however relapse with a donor Cen-A haplotype was a competing risk factor to poor overall survival. Here we show that the presence of donor activating KIR led to improved outcome for the patient, potentially through reduced relapse rates and decreased incidence of acute GvHD translating to improved overall survival.

In this study, we investigated the effect of TKIs on the levels of plasma TPO concentration in patients with well-controlled chronic myeloid leukemia receiving imatinib or dasatinib and those in treatment-free remission (TFR). METHODS: Blood samples for blood cell counts and plasma TPO levels were obtained from 23 dasatinib-treated patients before and 1 h after intake, 11 patients treated with imatinib before and 2 h after intake, and nine TFR patients. Levels of plasma TPO were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Levels of TPO were significantly inversely correlated with platelet counts in the entire cohort (r = - 0.568, p < 0.0001). Dasatinib intake, but not imatinib, significantly reduced platelet counts after intake (p = 0.0009 in dasatinib and p = 0.5431 in imatinib). However, imatinib and dasatinib intake increased the levels of TPO in these patients (p = 0.0024, dasatinib; p = 0.0098, imatinib). CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that neither dasatinib nor imatinib therapy inhibits TPO production.

The heterogeneity and clonal evolution of HM subpopulations are the main obstacles for precise diagnoses, risk stratification, and even targeted therapies. Standard bulk-sample genomic examinations average total mutations from multiple subpopulations and conceal the clonal diversity that may play a significant role in HM progression. Therefore, the development of novel methods that detect intra-tumor heterogeneity is critical for the discovery of novel potential therapeutic targets. The recently developed single cell sequencing (SCS) technologies can analyse genetic polymorphisms at a single cell level. SCS requires the precise isolation of single cells and amplification of their genetic material. It allows the analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic information in single cancer cells. SCS may also be able to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) of HM by sequencing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood. Functional heterogeneity and clonal evolution exist in acute leukemia, multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) subpopulations and have prognostic value. In this thesis, we provide an overview of SCS technologies in HM and discuss the heterogeneous genetic variation and clonal structure among subpopulations of HM.

The clinical behavior of GISTs varies greatly, has extended follow-up, and almost all of the tumors have malignant potential. The introduction of imatinib has led to extraordinary improvements in the treatment of individuals with GISTs (as well as those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)). However, there have been notable postmarketing reports of adverse drug reactions of hepatotoxicity with the use of imatinib. By our search, among individuals taking imatinib for the treatment of GIST, only six cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) have been reported. Here, we present an interesting case of an elderly woman who developed DILI after taking imatinib for the treatment of GIST. As the liver function tests (LFTs) initially did not improve, it was decided to proceed with an interventional radiology (IR)-guided liver biopsy, which showed a histologic pattern of acute hepatitis, consistent with DILI. Ultimately, discontinuation of the antineoplastic agent led to recovery in the patient's clinical condition along with normalization of her LFTs over the next several weeks. Thus, it is essential that physicians remain alert for and suspect DILI for any patient being treated with imatinib who presents with a sudden elevation of LFTs. The key to making the diagnosis is stopping the offending agent and closely monitoring the liver enzymes for improvement. When discontinuation of imatinib alone does not lead to improvement in LFTs and the patient's clinical status, a detailed history should be taken and initial diagnostic testing performed to exclude other etiologies. And, if they are negative, a liver biopsy should be considered.",,"['Shah, Jamil M', 'Lin, Kyawzaw', 'Etienne, Denzil', 'Reddy, Madhavi', 'Liu, Yingxian']","['Shah JM', 'Lin K', 'Etienne D', 'Reddy M', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Academic Affiliate of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Clinical Affiliate of the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Academic Affiliate of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Clinical Affiliate of the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Academic Affiliate of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Clinical Affiliate of the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Academic Affiliate of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Clinical Affiliate of the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, USA.', 'Department of Anatomic Pathology, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Academic Affiliate of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Clinical Affiliate of the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180424,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,2018/06/27 06:00,2018/06/27 06:01,['2018/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.2529 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2018 Apr 24;10(4):e2529. doi: 10.7759/cureus.2529.,['NOTNLM'],"['drug-induced hepatitis', 'drug-induced hepatotoxicity', 'drug-induced liver injury', 'gastrointestinal stromal tumor', 'gleevec', 'imatinib']",4,,PMC6015995,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This value can be realized using nano-engineering technology, where a new generation of tools can, with unprecedented ability, manipulate biological functions. One striking example is the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The underpinning biology is the newly identified LIF/IL-6 axis in T lymphocytes, which can tilt the behaviour between immune tolerance versus immune attack. This LIF/IL-6 axis is ideally suited to nanotherapeutic manipulation, given its inherent mechanistic simplicity of two mutually opposing feed-forward loops that determine either tolerogenic (LIF) or inflammatory (IL-6) immunity. Using LIF that is formulated in biodegradable nanoparticles (LIF-NP) and targeted to CD4+ T cells, the axis is harnessed towards immune tolerance. This has implications for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, where the clinical burden is immense. It encompasses more than 100 diseases and, in the USA alone, costs more than $100 billion in direct health care costs annually. Other properties of LIF include the promotion of healthy neuro-glial interactions within the central nervous system (CNS), where, in addition to MS, LIF-NP therapy is relevant to inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases that represent a large and increasing need within aging populations. Thirdly, LIF is a reparative growth factor that can maintain genomic plasticity. LIF-NP supports the use of stem cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine plus augment therapeutic benefits within the patient. These core properties of LIF are greatly amplified in value by the advantage of being formulated as nanoparticles, namely (i) targeted delivery, (ii) exploitation of endogenous regulatory pathways and (iii) creation of surrogate micro-stromal niches. We discuss LIF-NP as a means to harness endogenous pathways for the treatment of MS, both to reset immune self-tolerance and to promote repair of myelin that is required to support health within the nervous system.",,"['Metcalfe, Su M', 'Strom, Terry B', 'Williams, Anna', 'Fahmy, Tarek M']","['Metcalfe SM', 'Strom TB', 'Williams A', 'Fahmy TM']","['Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'The Transplant Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Center for Life Science (CLS), East Campus, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Immunobiology Yale School of Engineering and Applied Science and Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150101,England,Nanobiomedicine (Rij),Nanobiomedicine,101667896,,,,2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2018/06/27 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5772/60622 [doi]', '10.5772_60622 [pii]']",epublish,Nanobiomedicine (Rij). 2015 Jan 1;2:5. doi: 10.5772/60622. eCollection 2015 Jan-Dec.,['NOTNLM'],"['In vivo', 'Inflammatory immune axis', 'LIF-nanoparticles', 'Multiple sclerosis', 'Nanomedicine', 'Targeted delivery']",,,PMC5997376,,"['There is no conflict of interests for any of the authors.

Methods: English language posts related to SJIA, Still's disease, or juvenile arthritis were collected and analyzed. Results: In total, 71 posts created between 2009 and 2015 on 15 websites were identified in November 2015. Of the 32 unique authors, 17 were SJIA patients aged 13-20 years (40 posts), 7 were mothers of SJIA patients (12 posts), and 8 patients had unspecified forms of juvenile arthritis (19 posts). Many patients posted about similar diagnostic experiences marked by 5 phases: 1) early prediagnosis: pain and fatigue overlooked until crisis occurred, 2) first misdiagnosis: doctors talked about ""growing pains"" and psychosocial problems (""fake pains"" to avoid school), 3) second misdiagnosis: severity acknowledged, but diagnosed as leukemia or another cancer, 4) tests: tests leading to diagnosis and treatment conducted, and 5) cognitive identity: patient accepted the diagnosis and its implications. Many adolescent patients, looking back at disease onset in their childhood, described themselves as a ""sleeping child"" rather than the typical active child. Several patients tried to hide their illness from friends, but expressed concerns openly online. Many patients described SJIA as a powerful external enemy, using terms like ""bulldozer,"" ""dragon,"" and ""monster."" Many posts from patients and their mothers used superhero language/imagery to help ""fight"" SJIA. Some patients also posted about the risk of death. Conclusion: Although most adolescent SJIA patients openly posted about the difficulties of their disease online, they made efforts to hide their disease in the real world. They frequently used superhero words and images in describing their fight for better health. Physicians can use these insights when counseling SJIA patients to provide a narrative that meshes with the patients' worldview and perhaps to improve physician-patient communication to increase treatment adherence.",,"['Modica, Renee F', 'Lomax, Kathleen G', 'Batzel, Pamela', 'Cassanas, Armelle']","['Modica RF', 'Lomax KG', 'Batzel P', 'Cassanas A']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA.', 'Treato, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Treato, Princeton, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180613,New Zealand,Open Access Rheumatol,Open access rheumatology : research and reviews,101688698,,,,2018/06/27 06:00,2018/06/27 06:01,['2018/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OARRR.S165010 [doi]', 'oarrr-10-073 [pii]']",epublish,Open Access Rheumatol. 2018 Jun 13;10:73-81. doi: 10.2147/OARRR.S165010. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['SJIA', ""Still's disease"", 'adolescents', 'juvenile arthritis', 'social media', 'superheroes']",,,PMC6005297,,"['Disclosure KGL is an employee of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

Few studies have emphasized patient attitudes or preferences about discontinuing tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of Chinese CML patients and their views and perspectives on TFR. Methods: A total of 329 CML patients participated in this multicenter, questionnaire-based, standardized, semi-structured, interview-guided, open-ended, cross-sectional study. Information about demographics, diagnosis information, treatment history, quality of life (QoL), and TFR preference was collected.

Physical activity, symptom burden, mood impact, and daily impact were found to be better among adherent patients. Thirty-four percent of the patients were willing to attempt TFR positively. The reasons for preferring TFR were due to side effects (56%) followed by high cost (52%), inconvenience (42%), and pregnancy need (41%). Multivariate analysis indicated that patients who were younger (OR=0.96, 95% CI=0.94-0.99) with shorter disease duration (OR=0.90, 95% CI=0.82-0.98) and higher disease symptom burden (OR=1.08, 95% CI=0.98-1.21) were more likely positive about TFR.

However, allo-HSCT significantly improved the OS and LFS of patients and also their clinical outcomes.",,"['Tang, Shanhao', 'Shen, Hongjie', 'Qu, Changju', 'Dai, Haiping', 'Zhu, Xiaming', 'Xue, Shengli', 'Ding, Zixuan', 'Lu, Jing', 'Wu, Depei', 'Tang, Xiaowen']","['Tang S', 'Shen H', 'Qu C', 'Dai H', 'Zhu X', 'Xue S', 'Ding Z', 'Lu J', 'Wu D', 'Tang X']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Yinzhou People Hospital, Ningbo, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China. drwudepei@163.com.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China. drwudepei@163.com.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China. drwudepei@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, China. xwtang1020@163.com.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China. xwtang1020@163.com.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China. xwtang1020@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180625,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/therapy', '*Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2018/06/27 06:00,2020/02/25 06:00,['2018/06/27 06:00'],"['2017/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-018-0249-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-018-0249-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Feb;54(2):236-243. doi: 10.1038/s41409-018-0249-7.

Data on population and underlining conditions were extracted from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia, World Bank, the Institute of Public Health of Serbia, the World Health Organization, National reference laboratory for medical mycology, the national registries of Serbian professional societies, and relevant publications. The population structure/inhabitants in 2016 (not including the autonomous region Kosovo &amp; Metohija) was 7,058,322; with 6,041,743 adults (85.6%). The populations at risk (total cases per year) were: HIV infected 2441; acute myeloid leukemia 212; stem cell transplantation 151; solid organ transplants 59; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 250,302; adult asthmatics 311,806; adult cystic fibrosis 65; pulmonary tuberculosis 898; lung cancer 7260; intensive care unit admissions 19,821; and renal support 520. Annual fungal disease cases estimated are: candidemia 518; invasive aspergillosis 619; Candida peritonitis 187; Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia 62; cryptococcosis 5; mucormycosis or fusariosis 23; severe asthma with fungal sensitization 10,393; allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis 9094; chronic pulmonary aspergillosis 448, recurrent Candida vaginitis 135,303; oral candidiasis 208,489; esophageal candidiasis 173, fungal keratitis 70; tinea capitis 300; and onychomycosis 342,721. We expect that 156,825 people suffer from serious SFD each year (2221/100,000), and 409 dies annually. Additionally, the prevalence of superficial infections exceeds 1,008,995 cases (14,295/100,000). The first Rhinosporidium outbreak in Europe was associated with Serbian Silver Lake. The plant pathogen Fusarium seems to be emerging in Serbian pediatric haematooncology settings.

This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of MPA synergizing with LPS to induce IL-1beta release. Methods: Undiluted human blood cells, THP-1 human myeloid leukemia mononuclear cells (THP-1) cells, or monocytes were stimulated with LPS and treated with or without MPA, and the supernatant IL-1beta was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA levels of IL-1beta were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The intracellular protein levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) phospho-p65 (p-p65), precursor interleukin-1beta (pro-IL-1beta), NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing-3 (NLRP3), and cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease-1 (caspase-1) p20 in THP-1 cell were measured by Western blot. Results: The MPA alone failed to induce IL-1beta, whereas MPA synergized with LPS to increase IL-1beta in a dose-dependent manner (685.00 +/- 20.00 pg/ml in LPS + 5 mumol/L MPA group, P = 0.035; 742.00 +/- 31.58 pg/ml in LPS + 25 mumol/L MPA group, P = 0.017; 1000.00 +/- 65.59 pg/ml in LPS + 75 mumol/L MPA group, P = 0.024; versus 408.00 +/- 35.50 pg/ml in LPS group). MPA alone has no effect on the IL-1beta mRNA expression, LPS induced the expression of IL-1beta mRNA 2761 fold, and LPS + MPA increased the IL-1beta expression 3018 fold, which had the same effect with LPS group (P = 0.834). MPA did not affect the intracellular NF-kappaB p-p65 and pro-IL-1beta protein levels but activated NLRP3 inflammasome. Ac-YVAD-cmk blocked the activation of caspase-1 and subsequently attenuated IL-1beta secretion (181.00 +/- 45.24 pg/ml in LPS + MPA + YVAD group vs. 588.00 +/- 41.99 pg/ml in LPS + MPA group, P = 0.014). Conclusions: Taken together, MPA synergized with LPS to induce IL-1beta release via the activation of caspase-1, rather than the enhanced production of pro-IL-1beta. These findings suggested that patients immunosuppressed with mycophenolate mofetil may have overly activated caspase-1 during infection, which might contribute to a more sensitive host defense response to invading germs.",,"['Huang, Xue-Chan', 'He, Yi', 'Zhuang, Jian', 'He, Juan', 'Luo, Gui-Hu', 'Han, Jiao-Chan', 'Sun, Er-Wei']","['Huang XC', 'He Y', 'Zhuang J', 'He J', 'Luo GH', 'Han JC', 'Sun EW']","['Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, China; Institute of Clinical Immunology, Academy of Orthopedics, Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, China.', 'Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China.', 'Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China.', 'Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China.', 'Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, China; Institute of Clinical Immunology, Academy of Orthopedics, Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Inflammasomes)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caspase 1/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Inflammasomes', 'Interleukin-1beta/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mycophenolic Acid/*pharmacology', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein']",2018/06/27 06:00,2018/12/15 06:00,['2018/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ChinMedJ_2018_131_13_1533_235116 [pii]', '10.4103/0366-6999.235116 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2018 Jul 5;131(13):1533-1540. doi: 10.4103/0366-6999.235116.,['NOTNLM'],"['Autoimmune Diseases', 'Caspase-1 Host Defense', 'Interleukin-1beta', 'Lipopolysaccharide Mycophenolic Acid']",13,,PMC6032679,,['There are no conflicts of interest'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study (July 2013-September 2014). SETTING: Government-run, tertiary-care, university hospital in Chandigarh, Northern India. PARTICIPANTS: 414 episodes in 264 children aged <12 years, not undergoing stem-cell transplantation. OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictors for 'high-risk' febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: Microbiologically-documented infections were observed in 82 children (19.8%); bacterial 14.2%, fungal 4.3%, polymicrobial 9.7%. Complications were documented in 109 (26%) children. 43 (10.3%) died: 8 due to fungal and 35 due to bacterial sepsis. Children admitted within 7 days of the last chemotherapy (P<0.01) and having a non-upper respiratory focus of infection (P<0.02) were at risk of developing microbiologically-documented infections and death. Platelet count <20000/uL (P=0.03) was an additional predictor for microbiologically-documented infections, while albumin <2.5 g/dL (P=0.04) and C-reactive protein >90 mg/L (P=0.02) were risk factors predicting mortality. The median (IQR) duration of hospital stay was 5 (3,8) days. Hospital stay <5 days was seen in 144 (35%) children. Children with acute myeloid leukaemia (P<0.01) and admitted within 7 days of chemotherapy (P=0.02) were likely to have a prolonged hospital stay >5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Febrile neutropenic children admitted within 7 days of completion of chemotherapy, those with a non-upper respiratory focus of infection, CRP >90 mg/dL, platelet <20000/uL and albumin <2.5 g/dL need to be considered as 'high risk' for complications and mortality.",,"['Das, Anirban', 'Trehan, Amita', 'Bansal, Deepak']","['Das A', 'Trehan A', 'Bansal D']","['Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.

Key to this process is the refolding of misfolded or aggregated proteins by molecular chaperones or, alternatively, their degradation by proteases. In most prokaryotes and in chloroplasts and mitochondria, protein degradation is performed by the caseinolytic protease ClpP, a tetradecamer barrel-like proteolytic complex. Dysregulating ClpP function has shown promise in fighting antibiotic resistance and as a potential therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. Here we use methyl-transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)-based NMR, cryo-EM, biochemical assays, and molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the structural dynamics of ClpP from Staphylococcus aureus (SaClpP) in wild-type and mutant forms in an effort to discover conformational hotspots that regulate its function. Wild-type SaClpP was found exclusively in the active extended form, with the N-terminal domains of its component protomers in predominantly beta-hairpin conformations that are less well-defined than other regions of the protein. A hydrophobic site was identified that, upon mutation, leads to unfolding of the N-terminal domains, loss of SaClpP activity, and formation of a previously unobserved split-ring conformation with a pair of 20-A-wide pores in the side of the complex. The extended form of the structure and partial activity can be restored via binding of ADEP small-molecule activators.

JDP2 encodes a bZIP protein that has been implicated as a T-ALL oncogene from insertional mutagenesis studies in mice, but its role in human T-ALL pathogenesis has remained obscure. Here we show that JDP2 is aberrantly expressed in a subset of T-ALL patients and is associated with poor survival. JDP2 is required for T-ALL cell survival, as its depletion by short hairpin RNA knockdown leads to apoptosis. Mechanistically, JDP2 regulates prosurvival signaling through direct transcriptional regulation of MCL1. Furthermore, JDP2 is one of few oncogenes capable of initiating T-ALL in transgenic zebrafish. Notably, thymocytes from rag2:jdp2 transgenic zebrafish express high levels of mcl1 and demonstrate resistance to steroids in vivo. These studies establish JDP2 as a novel oncogene in high-risk T-ALL and implicate overexpression of MCL1 as a mechanism of steroid resistance in JDP2-overexpressing cells.",['(c) 2018 Mansour et

At study entry, B-ALL patients were classified as standard risk (SR) or high risk (HR) based on age, white blood cell (WBC) count, and central nervous system status. After achieving complete remission (CR), patients with high end-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) (>/=10(-3) by polymerase chain reaction analysis of patient-specific antigen receptor rearrangements) and/or adverse cytogenetics (KMT2A rearrangement or hypodiploidy) were reclassified as very high risk (VHR) and received intensified therapy. IKZF1 deletion status was retrospectively evaluated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Between 2005 and 2011, 678 Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL patients aged 1 to 18 years enrolled; 651 achieved CR and 648 received a final risk group. Among all 678 patients, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 87% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84-89) and overall survival 93% (95% CI, 90-94). Five-year disease-free survival of SR patients (N = 407) was 94% (95% CI, 91-96), HR (N = 176) was 84% (95% CI, 77-88), and VHR (N = 65) was 79% (95% CI, 67-87). IKZF1 deletion was present in 62 of 385 (16%) assessed patients and was associated with inferior 5-year EFS (63%; 95% CI, 49%-74% vs 88%; 95% CI, 84%-91%; P < .001), and higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse, including among those with low MRD (24% vs 8%, P = .001). In multivariable analysis, age >/=15 years, WBC >/=50 x 10(9)/L, IKZF1 deletion, and MRD >/=10(-4) was each associated with inferior outcome. In conclusion, risk-stratified therapy on DFCI 05-001 resulted in favorable outcomes for B-ALL patients, including those with VHR features. IKZF1 deletion was an independent predictor of inferior outcome.

We studied the impact on the structure and expression of host chromatin by the human retrovirus HTLV-1. We show that HTLV-1 disrupts host chromatin structure by forming loops between the provirus and the host genome; certain loops depend on the critical chromatin architectural protein CTCF, which we recently discovered binds to the HTLV-1 provirus. We show that the provirus causes two distinct patterns of abnormal transcription of the host genome in cis: bidirectional transcription in the host genome immediately flanking the provirus, and clone-specific transcription in cis at non-contiguous loci up to >300 kb from the integration site. We conclude that HTLV-1 causes insertional mutagenesis up to the megabase range in the host genome in >10(4) persistently-maintained HTLV-1(+) T-cell clones in vivo.","['(c) 2018, Melamed et al.']","['Melamed, Anat', 'Yaguchi, Hiroko', 'Miura, Michi', 'Witkover, Aviva', 'Fitzgerald, Tomas W', 'Birney, Ewan', 'Bangham, Charles Rm']","['Melamed A', 'Yaguchi H', 'Miura M', 'Witkover A', 'Fitzgerald TW', 'Birney E', 'Bangham CR']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/K019090/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT100291MA/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180626,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/metabolism/virology', 'Clone Cells', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Editing', 'Genetic Loci', 'Genome, Human', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Mutation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proviruses/genetics/growth & development', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",2018/06/27 06:00,2019/04/11 06:00,['2018/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7554/eLife.36245 [doi]', '36245 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2018 Jun 26;7. pii: 36245. doi: 10.7554/eLife.36245.,['NOTNLM'],"['*CTCF', '*HTLV-1', '*chromatin looping', '*human', '*infectious disease', '*insertional mutagenesis', '*microbiology', '*retrovirus', '*virus']",,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7312-3138', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6184-0033', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6943-3782', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2370-8496', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8314-8497', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2624-3599']",PMC6019074,,"['AM, HY, MM, AW, TF, EB, CB No competing interests declared']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A low level of ROS is important for maintaining quiescence and the differentiation potential of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), whereas the level of ROS increases during haematopoietic differentiation; thus, suggesting the importance of redox signalling in haematopoiesis. Here, we will analyse the importance of ROS for haematopoiesis and include evidence showing that cells from leukaemia patients live under oxidative stress. The potential sources of ROS will be described. Finally, the level of oxidative stress in leukaemic cells can also be harnessed for therapeutic purposes.

The idea that differences in gene expression ranking are associated with presence or absence of disease is compelling and has strong biological plausibility. Nevertheless, the TSP formulation ignores significant available information which can improve classification accuracy and is vulnerable to selecting genes which do not have differential expression in the two conditions (""pivot"" genes). RESULTS: We introduce the AUCTSP classifier as an alternative rank-based estimator of the magnitude of the ranking reversals involved in the original TSP. The proposed estimator is based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) and as such, takes into account the separation of the entire distribution of gene expression levels in gene pairs under the conditions considered, as opposed to comparing gene rankings within individual subjects as in the original TSP formulation. Through extensive simulations and case studies involving classification in ovarian, leukemia, colon, breast and prostate cancers and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, we show the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of improving classification accuracy, avoiding overfitting and being less prone to selecting non-informative (pivot) genes. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed AUCTSP is a simple yet reliable and robust rank-based classifier for gene expression classification. While the AUCTSP works by the same principle as TSP, its ability to determine the top scoring gene pair based on the relative rankings of two marker genes across all subjects as opposed to each individual subject results in significant performance gains in classification accuracy. In addition, the proposed method tends to avoid selection of non-informative (pivot) genes as members of the top-scoring pair.",,"['Kagaris, Dimitri', 'Khamesipour, Alireza', 'Yiannoutsos, Constantin T']","['Kagaris D', 'Khamesipour A', 'Yiannoutsos CT']","['Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Southern Illinois University, 1230 Lincoln Drive, Carbondale, 62901, IL, USA. kagaris@engr.siu.edu.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Southern Illinois University, 1230 Lincoln Drive, Carbondale, 62901, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Public Health, 410 West 10th Street, Suite 3000, Indianapolis, 46202, IN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180626,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biomarkers/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods']",2018/06/27 06:00,2019/02/15 06:00,['2018/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-018-2231-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-018-2231-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2018 Jun 26;19(1):244. doi: 10.1186/s12859-018-2231-1.,['NOTNLM'],"['*AUC', '*Breast cancer', '*Colon cancer', '*Diffuse large B-Cell lymphoma', '*Gene expression', '*Gene selection', '*Leukemia', '*Microarray data analysis', '*Ovarian cancer', '*Prostate cancer', '*Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve']",1,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2061-5080'],PMC6020231,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-two patients at median diagnostic age of 32 years (median of 19-65) were included in this analysis. Most patients had B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (n=26; 78%) and 81% of cases were <55 years at study entry. 75% of patients had <30x109/l leukocyte count at diagnosis and median follow-up was 14 months (range 0.8-69). All grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) after PEG-ASP administration were observed in 24 patients (75%). The most common grade 3/4 AEs were: decreased fibrinogen (58%), increased bilirubin (31%) and increased GGTP (27%). Clinical manifestations related to PEG-ASP were seen in 9 patients and included: abdominal pain (n=6), thrombosis (n=2), diarrhea (n=1) and pancreatitis (n=1). The median time from PEG-ASP administration to first toxic symptoms was 7 days (range 1-19), and there were also 4 (13%) early induction deaths. All deaths were observed in >/=50-year-old patients after a median of 5 days following PEG-ASP (range 1-9). Three of these four patients had massive obesity. While all expired patients had grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia at the time of death, sepsis was not present. Administration of PEG-ASP in induction remission for ALL patients resulted in a significant, but mostly reversible hepatotoxicity.

C60 fullerene potential application in the frame of cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) relies on rapid development of new light sources as well as on better understanding of the fullerene interaction with cells. The aim of this study was to analyze C60 fullerene effects on human leukemic cells (CCRF-CEM) in combination with high power single chip light-emitting diodes (LEDs) light irradiation of different wavelengths: ultraviolet (UV, 365nm), violet (405nm), green (515nm) and red (632nm). The time-dependent accumulation of fullerene C60 in CCRF-CEM cells up to 250ng/10(6) cells at 24h with predominant localization within mitochondria was demonstrated with immunocytochemical staining and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. In a cell viability assay we studied photoexcitation of the accumulated C60 nanostructures with ultraviolet or violet LEDs and could prove that significant phototoxic effects did arise. A less pronounced C60 fullerene phototoxic effect was observed after irradiation with green, and no effect was detected with red light. A C60 fullerene photoactivation with violet light induced substantial ROS generation and apoptotic cell death, confirmed by caspase3/7 activation and plasma membrane phosphatidylserine externalization. Our work proved C60 fullerene ability to induce apoptosis of leukemic cells after photoexcitation with high power single chip 405nm LED as a light source. This underlined the potential for application of C60 nanostructure as a photosensitizer for anticancer therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

To address the potential for novel therapeutic targets in LSCs, we investigated the roles of miRNA-126 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 7 (TRAF7) in AML. We used qRT-PCR and Western blot to investigate the expression levels of miRNA-126 and TRAF7 in AML cell lines. Then, we uncovered the effect of miRNA-126 on AML cell proliferation and apoptosis by MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Furthermore, dual-luciferase assay and Western blot were used to determine the target of miRNA-126 in AML and the potential mechanism by which cell apoptosis is suppressed by miRNA-126. We found that miRNA-126 was highly expressed in all of the AML cell lines, and that inhibition of miRNA-126 significantly induced cell death through apoptosis. The suppression of apoptosis in AML with high expression of miRNA-126 was caused by down-regulating TRAF7, which blocked the c-FLIP pathway.

In our implementation, the approach identified a critical Lys residue in the BIR3 domain of XIAP. We report for the first time that it is possible to target such residue covalently to attain potent and selective agents.

Patients with heritable phosphatidic acid phosphatase lipin-1-null mutations present with severe rhabdomyolysis and muscle atrophy in glycolytic muscle fibers, which are accompanied with mitochondrial aggregates and reduced mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to muscle atrophy as a result of lipin-1 deficiency are still not clear. In this study, we found that lipin-1 deficiency in mice is associated with a marked accumulation of abnormal mitochondria and autophagic vacuoles in glycolytic muscle fibers. Our studies using lipin-1-deficient myoblasts suggest that lipin-1 participates in B-cell leukemia (BCL)-2 adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (Bnip3)-regulated mitophagy by interacting with microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain (LC)3, which is an important step in the recruitment of mitochondria to nascent autophagosomes. The requirement of lipin-1 for Bnip3-mediated mitophagy was further verified in vivo in lipin-1-deficient green fluorescent protein-LC3 transgenic mice (lipin-1(-/-)-GFP-LC3). Finally, we showed that lipin-1 deficiency in mice resulted in defective mitochondrial adaptation to starvation-induced metabolic stress and impaired contractile muscle force in glycolytic muscle fibers.

Failure to carry out this role leads to immunodeficiency, which is mainly characterized by the presence of recurrent infections.[1] Defects in neutrophil function can be quantitative, as seen in neutropenia or qualitative, as seen in neutrophil dysfunction. The standard circulating neutrophil count is above 1.5 x 10/L. Neutropenia can be classified in asymptomatic (mild), moderate, and severe, and thus, the progression to infection concerning the number. Neutropenia, with decreased production with marrow hypoplasia, can be primary and due to chronic benign neutropenia, cyclical neutropenia, and other congenital and familial neutropenias. It can be secondary to cytotoxic drugs, aplastic anemia, leukemia, drug reactions, and infections. Neutropenia, with increased destruction with marrow hyperplasia, is due to hypersplenism and immune neutropenia. Secondary causes are the commonest. For example, neutropenia caused as a side effect of chemotherapy for malignancies. Congenital forms are rare and vary in severity; some of them are life-threatening conditions including leukocyte adhesion deficiency, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, hyper-IgE, recurrent infection syndrome, and chronic granulomatous disease.[2][3]","['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']","['Justiz Vaillant, Angel A.', 'Zito, Patrick M.']","['Justiz Vaillant AA', 'Zito PM']",,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,2018/06/26 06:01,2018/06/26 06:01,,,['NBK507702 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,20180626,['20211115'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2018/06/26 06:01'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, GACKIX is an ideal model to dissect the context-dependent function of activator-coactivator complexes. However, the dynamic and transient protein-protein interactions (PPIs) formed by GACKIX are difficult targets for small molecules. An additional complication is that activator-binding motifs, such as GACKIX, are found in multiple coactivators, making specificity difficult to attain. In this study, we demonstrate that the strategy of tethering can be used to rapidly discover highly specific covalent modulators of the dynamic PPIs between activators and coactivators. These serve as both ortho- and allosteric modulators, enabling the tunable assembly or disassembly of the activator-coactivator complexes formed between the KIX domain and its cognate activator binding partners MLL and CREB. The molecules maintain their function and selectivity, even in human cell lysates and in bacterial cells, and thus, will ultimately be highly useful probes for cellular studies.","['(c) 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, aberrantly high expression of EVI1 has potent oncogenic properties and confers poor prognosis and chemo-resistance in leukemia and solid tumors. To investigate to what extent EVI1 function might be regulated by post-translational modifications we carried out mass spectrometry- and antibody-based analyses and uncovered an ATM-mediated double phosphorylation of EVI1 at the carboxy-terminal S858/S860 SQS motif. In the presence of genotoxic stress EVI1-WT (SQS), but not site mutated EVI1-AQA was able to maintain transcriptional patterns and transformation potency, while under standard conditions carboxy-terminal mutation had no effect. Maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cell clonogenic potential was profoundly impaired with EVI1-AQA compared with EVI1-WT, in particular in the presence of genotoxic stress. Exploring mechanistic events underlying these observations, we showed that after genotoxic stress EVI1-WT, but not EVI1-AQA increased its level of association with its functionally essential interaction partner CtBP1, implying a role for ATM in regulating EVI1 protein interactions via phosphorylation. This aspect of EVI1 regulation is therapeutically relevant, as chemotherapy-induced genotoxicity might detrimentally sustain EVI1 function via stress response mediated phosphorylation, and ATM-inhibition might be of specific targeted benefit in EVI1-overexpressing malignancies.",,"['Paredes, Roberto', 'Schneider, Marion', 'Stevens, Adam', 'White, Daniel J', 'Williamson, Andrew J K', 'Muter, Joanne', 'Pearson, Stella', 'Kelly, James R', 'Connors, Kathleen', 'Wiseman, Daniel H', 'Chadwick, John A', 'Loffler, Harald', 'Teng, Hsiang Ying', 'Lovell, Simon', 'Unwin, Richard', 'van de Vrugt, Henri J', 'Smith, Helen', 'Kustikova, Olga', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Somervaille, Tim C P', 'Pierce, Andrew', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Meyer, Stefan']","['Paredes R', 'Schneider M', 'Stevens A', 'White DJ', 'Williamson AJK', 'Muter J', 'Pearson S', 'Kelly JR', 'Connors K', 'Wiseman DH', 'Chadwick JA', 'Loffler H', 'Teng HY', 'Lovell S', 'Unwin R', 'van de Vrugt HJ', 'Smith H', 'Kustikova O', 'Schambach A', 'Somervaille TCP', 'Pierce A', 'Whetton AD', 'Meyer S']","['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Palatine Road, Manchester M20 3LI, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Palatine Road, Manchester M20 3LI, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Division of Developmental Biology and Medicine, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health M13 9WL, University of Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Palatine Road, Manchester M20 3LI, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Palatine Road, Manchester M20 3LI, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Palatine Road, Manchester M20 3LI, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Palatine Road, Manchester M20 3LI, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Palatine Road, Manchester M20 3LI, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Palatine Road, Manchester M20 3LI, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Group, CRUK Manchester Institute, Manchester M20 4XB, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Group, CRUK Manchester Institute, Manchester M20 4XB, UK.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Palatine Road, Manchester M20 3LI, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Evolution, Systems and Genomics Domain,Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Palatine Road, Manchester M20 3LI, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Oncogenetics, Department of Clinical Genetics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Evolution, Systems and Genomics Domain,Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School;

The goal of this protocol is to efficiently revert lineage-primed, conventional human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) maintained on either feeder-free or feeder-dependent conditions to a naive-like pluripotency with improved functionality. This chemical naive reversion method employs the classical leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), GSK3beta, and MEK/ERK inhibition cocktail (LIF-2i), supplemented with only a tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 (LIF-3i). LIF-3i reverts conventional hPSC to a stable pluripotent state adopting biochemical, transcriptional, and epigenetic features of the human pre-implantation epiblast. This LIF-3i method requires minimal cell culture manipulation and is highly reproducible in a broad repertoire of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and transgene-free human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. The LIF-3i method does not require a re-priming step prior to the differentiation; N-hPSC can be differentiated directly with extremely high efficiencies and maintain karyotypic and epigenomic stabilities (including at imprinted loci). To increase the universality of the method, conventional hPSC are first cultured in the LIF-3i cocktail supplemented with two additional small molecules that potentiate protein kinase A (forskolin) and sonic hedgehog (sHH) (purmorphamine) signaling (LIF-5i). This brief LIF-5i adaptation step significantly enhances the initial clonal expansion of conventional hPSC and permits them to be subsequently naive-reverted with LIF-3i alone in bulk quantities, thus obviating the need for picking/subcloning rare N-hPSC colonies later. LIF-5i-stabilized hPSCs are subsequently maintained in LIF-3i alone without the need of anti-apoptotic molecules.

In Crohn's disease and psoriasis, treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors is associated with hepatosplenic gammadelta T cell lymphoma and with clonal expansion of gammadelta T cells, respectively. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of clonal T-LGL cells in patients with RA and define risk factors for this rare hematologic malignancy. METHODS: A total of 529 RA patients were recruited between November 2013 and August 2015. Eight-color flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting [FACS]) was performed to screen for aberrant T cell populations of LGLs. Molecular analysis of the T cell receptor was used to confirm the diagnosis in patients with suggestive FACS findings. Electronic patient files were used to determine risk factors. Patients with clonal populations were monitored prospectively for up to 4 years. RESULTS: The median patient age was 61 years, and 74% were female. The median duration of RA was 12 years. The median Disease Activity Score in 28 joints was 2.8, and 69.9% of patients had ever been treated with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. We identified clonal T-LGL expansions in 19 patients, equaling a prevalence of 3.6%. The T-LGL cell clone was constant over time in most patients and was significantly associated with the duration of the exposure to TNF-blocking agents (P = 0.01). No other risk factors could be detected. CONCLUSION: RA patients with long-term exposure to TNF-blocking agents were at a greater risk of developing clonal expansions of LGLs. This finding may prompt clinicians to refrain from using these substances in RA patients with known T cell aberrations.","['(c) 2018, American College of Rheumatology.']","['Schwaneck, Eva C', 'Renner, Regina', 'Junker, Lara', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Gadeholt, Ottar', 'Geissinger, Eva', 'Kleinert, Stefan', 'Gernert, Michael', 'Tony, Hans-Peter', 'Schmalzing, Marc']","['Schwaneck EC', 'Renner R', 'Junker L', 'Einsele H', 'Gadeholt O', 'Geissinger E', 'Kleinert S', 'Gernert M', 'Tony HP', 'Schmalzing M']","['Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany, and Praxisgemeinschaft Rheumatologie-Nephrologie, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181030,United States,Arthritis Rheumatol,"Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",101623795,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)']",,"['Antirheumatic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/chemically induced/*epidemiology/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/immunology']",2018/06/26 06:00,2019/08/02 06:00,['2018/06/26 06:00'],"['2017/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.40654 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheumatol. 2018 Dec;70(12):1914-1922. doi: 10.1002/art.40654.

PTEN tumour suppressor gene inactivation is a frequent event in T-ALL but its effect on patient therapy response is debatable. We analysed the effect of the presence of mutated PTEN on outcome in 257 children with T-ALL treated with Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP)-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) protocols. PTEN mutations were present in 31 (12.1%) patients and were significantly associated with increased risk of relapse. PTEN mutations also indicate a poor prognosis in T-ALL patients in the absence of NOTCH1 mutations or in the group of patients with co-presence of PTEN mutation and deletions. These results indicate that PTEN genomic aberrations and the biologically consequential PTEN inactivation contribute to adverse therapy response in T-ALL patients; PTEN status as a biomarker may contribute to the development of new molecularly-defined stratification algorithms.,['(c) 2018 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Paganin, Maddalena', 'Grillo, Maria Francesca', 'Silvestri, Daniela', 'Scapinello, Greta', 'Buldini, Barbara', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruij', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Paganin M', 'Grillo MF', 'Silvestri D', 'Scapinello G', 'Buldini B', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Biondi A', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Conter V', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Basso G']","['Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Azienda Ospedaliera di Padova, Padova, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Paediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Centre of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Clinica Pediatrica, Fondazione MBBM, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Paediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Paediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Centro Ricerca M.

Recently, latrophilin-1 (LPHN1) was reported to be expressed in human monocytic leukemia cell lines and in primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. However, this expression was found to be absent in healthy leukocytes. LPHN1 was therefore considered a novel biomarker of human AML. In previous papers, we established two P-gp-positive variants (SKM-1/VCR and MOLM-13/VCR) of AML cell lines derived from parental human AML cells SKM-1 and MOLM-13 by selection with VCR. The present paper addresses the measurement of LPHN1 expression in SKM-1 and MOLM-13 cells and their P-gp-positive variants. Both parental AML lines were positive for LPHN1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels. However, the expression of LPHN1 at both the mRNA and protein levels was reduced in both P-gp-positive SKM-1/VCR and MOLM-13/VCR variants of AML cells. Interestingly, we observed an elevation of the latrophilin-3 transcript in P-gp-positive variants of AML cell lines.

It has a variety of biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbiological and anti-cancer properties. On account of its antioxidant activity, EA might protect cancer cells from free radical damage in photodynamic therapy (PDT) during which reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was stimulated leading to irreversible tumor cell injury. In this study, the influence of EA on K562 cells in 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-based PDT is demonstrated. Cell apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry. Oxidative damage induced by PDT was investigated by measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA). Comet assay was used to evaluate the potential genotoxic effect induced by PDT on the cells. The results showed that EA supplementation alone did not affect the lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and apoptosis in K562 cells. It increases the lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, apoptosis and decreases the survival rate in K562 cells induced by ALA-PDT. The singlet oxygen quencher sodium azide suppresses apoptosis, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage induced by EA in PDT. In conclusion, EA consumption during PDT did not decrease the effectiveness of cancer therapy on malignant cells.

We prospectively examined immune cell populations in peripheral blood taken at baseline of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Len-dex) therapy and reviewed clinical and microbiology records in 90 patients with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM). Risk factors for infection were analyzed using logistic regression. During a median of 11 cycles of Len-dex treatment, 52 (57.8%) patients experienced at least 1 infection episode. Of a total of 92 episodes of infection, 58 (63%) episodes were clinically defined, 29 (31.5%) episodes were microbiologically defined, and 5 (5.4%) episodes were fever of unknown origin. Severe episodes were more frequently observed during the first 3 cycles. After adjusting for risk factors for infection based on univariate analyses, multivariate analyses showed that lower Hb (< 10 g/dL) was a clinically independent factor associated with occurrence of infections. Lower frequency (P = 0.044) and absolute count (P = 0.014) of circulating CD3(+)CD4(+)CD161(+) cells prior to Len-dex treatment were also associated with the occurrence of infection, especially during the first 3 cycles of Len-dex therapy.

Here, we demonstrate for the first time the controllable fabrication of bio-bar codes for dendritically amplified sensing of low-abundant HTLV-II DNA by the integration of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-catalyzed template-free polymerization extension with bio-bar-code amplification (BCA). HTLV-II DNA hybridizes with magnetic microparticle (MMP)-modified capture probe 1, forming a stable DNA duplex with a protruding 3'-hydroxylated sequence which may function as a primer to initiate the TdT-catalyzed first-step polymerization extension for the generation of a poly-thymidine (T) sequence. The resultant poly-T products may hybridize with poly-adenine (A) capture probe 2, inducing the self-assembly of multiple capture probe 2-/reporter probe-functionalized Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) onto the MMP. Subsequently, the reporter probes may act as the primers to initiate the TdT-catalyzed second-step polymerization extension, producing large numbers of G-rich DNAzymes for the generation of an enhanced chemiluminescence signal. Taking advantage of the efficient polymerization extension reaction catalyzed by TdT, the high amplification efficiency of BCA, and the intrinsically high sensitivity of G-rich DNAzyme-driven chemiluminescence, this method exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity with a limit of detection of as low as 0.50 aM and a large dynamic range of 9 orders of magnitude from 1 aM to 1 nM. Moreover, this method can be applied for the discrimination of a single-base mismatch and the measurement of HTLV-II DNA in both human serum and human T-lymphocytic leukemia cells, holding great potential in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis.",,"['Wang, Li-Juan', 'Ren, Ming', 'Liang, Li', 'Zhang, Chun-Yang']","['Wang LJ', 'Ren M', 'Liang L', 'Zhang CY']","['College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science , Collaborative Innovation Center of Functionalized Probes for Chemical Imaging in Universities of Shandong , Key Laboratory of Molecular and Nano Probes , Ministry of Education , Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Clean Production of Fine Chemicals , Shandong Normal University , Jinan 250014 , China .

There is evidence that CD300A plays a role in autophagy and angiogenesis, while, no studies have been reported which investigated the role of CD300A in tumors. CD300A was found to be highly expressed with statistical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as associated with prognosis, through the analysis of differential expression genes using the TCGA and GTEx database. A decrease in CD300A expression could promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation and migration of AML cell line U937, as well as promote the activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. These results demonstrated that CD300A operated as a tumor promoter in AML cells. We further analyzed coexpression genes of CD300A and then screened two genes, ADCY7 and PECAM1, which were both overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in AML. Meanwhile, CD300A increased the expression of PECAM1 and ADCY7 in U937 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PECAM1 promoted the proliferation and migration and inhibited the apoptosis of U937 cells. ADCY7 participated in the regulation of proliferation and migration, but not apoptosis, in U937 cells. Both PECAM1 and ADCY7 promoted tumor progression through the AKT pathway, showing the same molecular mechanism as CD300A. To summarize, we, for the first time, confirmed that CD300A promoted tumor progression by increase PECAM1 and ADCY7 expression, and activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in AML.

An unprecedented one-pot method of selective formation of C-10alpha-acetate 14 starting from a 1:1 mixture of C-10alpha- to C-10beta-dihydroartemisinin was developed. The key step of this facile method is a mild decarboxylative activation of malonic acid mediated by DCC/DMAP. Ether-linked thymoquinone-artemisinin hybrids 6a/b stood out as the most active compounds in all categories, while showing no toxic side effects toward healthy human foreskin fibroblasts and thus being selective. They exhibited EC50 values of 0.2 muM against the doxorubicin-sensitive as well as the multidrug-resistant leukemia cells and therefore can be regarded as superior to doxorubicin. Moreover, they showed to be five times more active than the standard drug ganciclovir and nearly eight times more active than artesunic acid against HCMV. In addition, hybrids 6a/b possessed excellent antimalarial activity (EC50 = 5.9/3.7 nM), which was better than that of artesunic acid (EC50 = 8.2 nM) and chloroquine (EC50 = 9.8 nM).

Although growing evidence suggests that hTERT inhibits cellular apoptosis by telomere-independent functions, the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Here, we show that hTERT contains a BH3-like motif, a short peptide sequence found in BCL-2 family proteins, and interacts with anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins MCL-1 and BCL-xL, suggesting a functional link between hTERT and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Additionally, we propose that hTERT can be categorized into the atypical BH3-only proteins that promote cellular survival, possibly due to the non-canonical interaction between hTERT and antiapoptotic proteins. Although the detailed mechanisms underlying the hTERT BH3-like motif functions and interactions between hTERT and BCL-2 family proteins have not been elucidated, this work proposes a possible connection between hTERT and BCL-2 family members and reconsiders the role of the BH3-like motif as an interaction motif.",,"['Jin, Young', 'You, Long', 'Kim, Hye Jeong', 'Lee, Han-Woong']","['Jin Y', 'You L', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee HW']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180625,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis', 'Beclin-1/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Telomerase/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",2018/06/26 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2018/06/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['molcells.2018.0206 [pii]', '10.14348/molcells.2018.0206 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2018 Jul 31;41(7):684-694. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2018.0206.

The 2016 World Health Organization classification categorizes patients with >/= 5% RS and SF3B1 mutation as MDS-RS, in contrast to its prior MDS-RS classification (>/= 15% RS, no genotyping data). Treatment responses in MDS patients with mutated SF3B1 are not well described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with MDS and known SF3B1 mutational status were identified from MDS Clinical Research Consortium institutions and grouped when possible as 5% to 15% or >/= 15% RS. Patients with wild-type versus mutated SF3B1 were matched 2:1 to analyze treatment response. RESULTS: Of 471 patients identified, 16% showed SF3B1 mutation. More patients with mutated SF3B1 were lower-risk MDS. We found that 50% were RS-positive compared to 19% of wild-type patients (P < .001). Having the mutation was associated with better overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.48, P = .001) and longer leukemia-free survival (hazard ratio = 0.5, P < .005). Patients with RS and the mutation had the best outcome. Regarding treatment response, 14 (35%) of 40 erythroid-stimulating agent-treated patients with mutation experienced response versus 9 (16%) of 56 wild-type patients (P = .032), with no differences in response to hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide. CONCLUSION: SF3B1 mutations in MDS are commonly associated with RS and show better outcomes, with mutated/positive RS presence being significantly better than isolated RS or presence of mutation or neither. Patients with mutation showed better responses to an erythroid-stimulating agent. A new categorization incorporating SF3B1 mutation status, regardless of RS percentage, shows clinical value.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Diabetes is emerging as a potential late effect of cancer therapy; however, the magnitude of risk has not been well established. The goal of our study was to evaluate the risk for diabetes in childhood cancer survivors in Ontario using validated population-based databases. METHODS: We used provincial administrative health databases to compare the rate of diabetes in childhood cancer survivors and controls from the general population. Diabetes was measured using a validated algorithm. We used a cause-specific hazard regression model in which death and development of another cancer were treated as competing risks. RESULTS: We identified 10,438 1-year survivors of childhood cancer that were diagnosed before age 21 between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2010. The mean follow up was 11.2 years (standard deviation, 6.9). Cancer survivors had a 55% increased rate of developing diabetes compared with matched controls (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.78) in models adjusted for rurality and income. Individuals treated for cancer between ages 6 and 10 had the highest increased rates of diabetes (HR 3.89, CI 2.26 to 6.68). Among cancer types, leukemia and lymphoma were associated with the greatest increased risk for diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports evidence of an increased risk for diabetes in survivors of childhood cancer. Future research is warranted for better identification of treatment-related risk factors for diabetes in this population.","['Copyright (c) 2018 Diabetes Canada. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Executive dysfunction is one of the most consistently observed deficits and can have substantial and pervasive effects on academic success, occupational achievement, psychosocial function, and psychiatric status. We examined the neural mechanisms of executive dysfunction by measuring structural and functional connectomes in 161 long-term survivors of pediatric ALL, age 8-21 years, who were treated on a single contemporary chemotherapy-only protocol for standard/high- or low-risk disease. Lower global efficiency, a measure of information exchange and network integration, of both structural and functional connectomes was found in survivors with executive dysfunction compared with those without dysfunction (p < 0.046). Patients with standard/high- versus low-risk disease and those who received greater number of intrathecal treatments containing methotrexate had the lowest network efficiencies. Patients with executive dysfunction also showed hyperconnectivity in sensorimotor, visual, and auditory-processing regions (p = 0.037) and poor separation between sensorimotor, executive/attention, salience, and default mode networks (p < 0.0001). Connectome disruption was consistent with a pattern of delayed neurodevelopment that may be associated with reduced resilience, adaptability, and flexibility of the brain network.

Re-expression of TSG is inversely proportionate with STAT3 signaling pathways. Demethylation of DNA by 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) results in re-expression of silenced TSG. Forced expression of PRG2 by 5-Aza induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits BCR/ ABL tyrosine kinase resulting in hematological remission in CML patients. However, majority of CML patients treated with imatinib would develop resistance under prolonged therapy. Methods: CML cells resistant to imatinib were treated with 5-Aza and cytotoxicity of imatinib and apoptosis were determined by MTS and annexin-V, respectively. Gene expression analysis was detected by real time-PCR, STATs activity examined using Western blot and methylation status of PRG2 was determined by pyrosequencing analysis. Result: Expression of PRG2 was significantly higher in K562-R+5-Aza cells compared to K562 and K562-R (p=0.001). Methylation of PRG2 gene was significantly decreased in K562-R+5-Aza cells compared to other cells (p=0.021). STAT3 was inactivated in K562-R+5-Aza cells which showed higher sensitivity to imatinib. Conclusion: PRG2 gene is a TSG and its overexpression might induce sensitivity to imatinib.

Methods: in this retrospective study, all patients diagnosed with primary cancers and registered with the KPBCR were included. New cancer cases registered from 2014 were identified from pathological labs, medical reports of 48 health facilities providing cancer diagnosis or treatment services and the national death registry program. Data for patients who were referred to neighboring provinces to access health services were also collected from national referral registries. Results from autopsies was additionally extracted from regional forensic and legal medicine centers and added to the registry periodically. Age standardized incidence rates (ASRs) per 100,000 person-years for all cancers were computed, using direct-standardization and CanReg methodology. Mortality to incidence (M:I) ratios and microscopically verified (MV) proportions were calculated as quality measures. Results: A total of 2,838 cases of cancer were registered in Kerman province, 2014. Of these 45. 6% involved women (n=1,293). Individuals aged 60-64 years represented the largest proportion (11.6%) of the total cancer prevalence, followed by those aged 55-59 years (10.86%) and 65-69 years (8.99%). The ASRs for all cancers were 155.1 and 118.90 per 100,000, in men and women, respectively. In women, breast (ASR: 26.4), skin (ASR: 13.0), thyroid (ASR: 9.2), leukemia (ASR: 8.0) and colorectal (ASR: 7.70) were the most common cancers. In men, bladder (ASR: 24.70), skin (ASR: 16.80), lung (ASR: 14.6), leukemia (ASR: 14.50), and stomach (ASR: 10.8) were found to be the most frequent.

Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is essential for the maintenance of telomere DNA length. Recently, a variable tandem-repeats polymorphism, MNS16A, located in the downstream region of the TERT gene, was reported to have an effect on TERT expression and telomerase activity. Previous studies have linked both relative telomere length (RTL) and TERT variants with cancer. Therefore, we evaluated associations between RTL, TERT gene polymorphisms (hTERT, rs2735940 C/T and MNS16A Ins/Del) and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in an Iranian population. Methods: RTL was determined by a multiplex quantitative PCR-based method, and variants of the hTERT, rs2735940 C/T and MNS16A Ins/Del, were genotyped by amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR), and PCR, respectively. Results: Our results indicated that RTL was shorter in ALL patients (1.53+/-0.12) compared to the control group (2.04+/-0.19) (P=0.029). However, no associations between hTERT gene variants or haplotypes and the risk of childhood ALL were observed (P>0.05). Also hTERT polymorphisms were not associated with RTL or patient clinicopathological characteristics, including age (P=0.304), sex (P=0.061) organomegally (P=0.212) CSF involvement (P=0.966) or response to treatment (P=0.58).

A First of Its Kind Study on CML Patients of Kashmir,1479-1485,,"Background: The prognostic significance of the common BCR-ABL transcripts like e13a2 (b2a2) and e14a2 (b3a2) in Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been reported from patients treated with different tyrosine kinase inhibitors but its impact on clinical response and overall survival remains still unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of different transcript types in a cohort of CML patients treated with imatinib. Methods: A total 42 confirmed cases of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients were recruited into our cohort study and a multiplex Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction technique (RT-PCR) was used to detect 3 main transcript types 'e1a2', 'e13a2', and 'e14a2' found in CML. Results: Only two types of transcripts e13a2 (b2a2) and e14a2 (b3a2) were detected in our CML patients and none had the e1a2 type. All the patients were RT-PCR positive for either e13a2 or e14a2 fusion transcript demonstrating 100% concordance with their Ph+ve cytogenetic status at baseline. TLC count (range of 201-600x103/mul) and platelet count (range of 201-900x103/mul) at baseline were found to be associated more with the e14a2 (b3a2) than the e13a2 (b2a2) transcript type (p-value: 0.001). The two transcripts found did not relate significantly towards sex, age-group or indicated spleen size ranges as well as percentage ranges of blast cells. Conclusion: We conclude that there is no overall prognostic implication of either the e13a2 or the e14a2 transcript type across the spectrum of indicated clinical parameters evaluated. Even the overall survival analysis of the two transcript types revealed no prognostic association whatsoever.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],"['Azad, Niyaz A', 'Shah, Zafar A', 'Pandith, Arshad A', 'Khan, Mosin S', 'Rasool, Roohi', 'Rasool, Javed', 'Aziz, Shiekh A']","['Azad NA', 'Shah ZA', 'Pandith AA', 'Khan MS', 'Rasool R', 'Rasool J', 'Aziz SA']","['Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.

However, there are no available information to show the laminarin effect on glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels in mice with leukemia in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty normal BALB/c mice were separated randomly into five groups. Group I mice received normal diet as control. Leukemia was generated in groups II-V using WEHI-3 cells: Group II mice received normal diet as positive control; group III, IV and V mice received laminarin at 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/ml with ddH2O, respectively, by oral gavage every 2 days for 14 days (total of seven times). All mice were weighed during the treatment. After treatment, mice were sacrificed, blood was collected for determination of cell markers, liver and spleen samples were weighed, and spleens were used for phagocytosis and natural killer (NK) cell activity and cell proliferation using flow cytometric assay. RESULTS: Laminarin did not affect animal appearances, but increased the body weight at all doses. It reduced the weight of liver at 2.5 and 5 mg/ml and of spleen at 5 mg/ml. Laminarin increased CD3 (2.5 mg/ml) and CD19 (1 and 5 mg/ml) cell populations but reduced CD11b (5 mg/ml) cell populations, however, these did not affect Mac-3 marker level. Laminarin at 1 mg/ml increased phagocytosis by macrophages from peripheral blood mononuclear cell, but did not affect those from the peritoneal cavity. Laminarin increased NK cell cytotoxic activity at all doses and at a target ratio of 25:1 and 50:1. Laminarin did not affect B-cell proliferation, but at 5 mg/ml significantly reduced T-cell proliferation. Laminarin restored glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (2.5 and 5 mg/ml) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (2.5 mg/ml) levels. Based on these results, we suggest that laminarin can promote immune responses and protect against liver injury.","['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Shang, Hung-Sheng', 'Shih, Yung-Luen', 'Chen, Chao-Ping', 'Lee, Mei-Hui', 'Lu, Hsu-Feng', 'Chou, Pei-Yi', 'Liao, Nien-Chieh', 'Chen, Yung-Liang', 'Hsueh, Shu-Ching', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Shang HS', 'Shih YL', 'Chen CP', 'Lee MH', 'Lu HF', 'Chou PY', 'Liao NC', 'Chen YL', 'Hsueh SC', 'Chung JG']","['Graduate Institute of Clinical of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Division of Clinical Pathology, Department of Pathology, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'School of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Fu-Jen Catholic University, New Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Genetic Counseling Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Restaurant, Hotel and Institutional Management, Fu-Jen Catholic University, New Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Yuanpei University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C. jgchung@mail.cmu.edu.tw ch1835@chgh.org.tw.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Medicine, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. jgchung@mail.cmu.edu.tw ch1835@chgh.org.tw.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Glucans)', '9008-22-4 (laminaran)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",IM,"['Alanine Transaminase/*blood', 'Animals', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/*blood', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Glucans/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects/genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia/blood/*diet therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects']",2018/06/25 06:00,2018/10/10 06:00,['2018/06/25 06:00'],"['2018/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['32/4/783 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.11308 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2018 Jul-Aug;32(4):783-790. doi: 10.21873/invivo.11308.,['NOTNLM'],"['Laminarin', 'glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase', 'glutamic pyruvic transaminase', 'immune response', 'leukemia BALB/c mice']",4,,PMC6117764,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all available cohort studies regarding the comparison of HMA alone and in combination with HDACi for MDS and AML. Embase and Pubmed databases were searched for relevant studies. The overall hazard ratios for the HMA alone and HDACi combination were extracted. Heterogeneity among the included studies was evaluated by Cochrane's Q Test and I(2) statistics. A random-effect model or a fixed-effect model was applied depending on the heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis was used to evaluate the source of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Seven studies comprising 922 patients (458 patients treated with HMA alone and 464 with HMA and HDACi) were included in the analysis. Pooled data showed no significant differences in complete remission (CR) rates, hematologic improvement (HI), overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicities between HMA alone treatment and HMA with HDACi regimens. CONCLUSIONS: HDACi and HMA combination does not appear to be more effective and better tolerated than HMA alone.

About 20 alkaloids, belonging to the subclass of 5,8'-linked naphthylisoquinolines, have so far been discovered in this plant species. Here, we report on the isolation and structure elucidation of six further such 5,8'-coupled monomeric alkaloids, named ancistrolikokines I (9), C3 (10), F2 (11), J (12), J2 (13), and J3 (14). They were identified in the twigs of A. likoko, along with the two new atropo-diastereomeric dimers michellamines A8 (15a) and B8 (15b) and the naphthalene-devoid dihydroisoquinoline ent-ealaine D (19). The latter had previously only been known from total synthesis and has now been identified for the first time as an authentic natural product. Three of the new alkaloids, 12-14, are the only fully dehydrogenated naphthylisoquinolines with a 5,8'-biaryl linkage, apart from one single known other example previously likewise found in A. likoko. The stereostructures of the new alkaloids were established by spectroscopic (in particular HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR), chemical (oxidative degradation), and chiroptical (electronic circular dichroism) methods. The new ancistrolikokines exhibited moderate to strong cytotoxic activities against drug-sensitive acute lymphoblastic CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and against cells of their multidrug-resistant subline, CEM/ADR5000. A first structure-activity relationship (SAR) study on a small library of 5,8'-coupled naphthylisoquinolines from the twigs of A. likoko suggests that the oxygenation patterns in the isoquinoline portion at C-6 and C-8 play a crucial role for the antileukemic activities within this group of alkaloids.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study compared emergency contraception use between cancer survivors in the Reproductive Window Study on ovarian function after cancer and in the general population in the 2006-2010 National Survey for Family Growth. In a cross-sectional analysis of survivors, multivariable models were used to test associations between participant characteristics and emergency contraception use. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): A total of 616 female cancer survivors aged 18-40. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Self-reported emergency contraception use. RESULT(S): The mean age of survivors was 33.4 +/- 4.7, at a mean 7.5 years since diagnosis. Breast cancer (22%), Hodgkin lymphoma (18%), and leukemia (8%) were the most common cancers. Since diagnosis, 156 (25.3%) used emergency contraception, 60% because of not otherwise using contraception. Age-adjusted prevalence of use was higher in survivors than in the general population (28.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 24.7-31.9] vs. 12.0% [95% CI 11.1-12.9]). In multivariable analysis among survivors, nonwhite race (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.8), breast cancer (PR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.0), partnered relationship (PR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.9), and older age (age 36-40 vs. 31-35; PR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.0) were associated with emergency contraception. CONCLUSION(S): Female young adult cancer survivors were significantly more likely to use emergency contraception compared with the general population.

We report four pediatric acute leukemia (AL) cases (prevalence: 0.18%) with megakaryoblasts co-expressing the T-specific antigen CD3 (cytoplasmic), together with a very homogeneous antigen profile of immature cells and other lymphoid traits. In one case, the presence of epsilon CD3 mRNA was confirmed as well on sorted CD34+ blasts. All four cases were infants, and two of them disclosed trisomy 21 in the blast population (not constitutional) without being children with Down Syndrome. They were homogeneously treated with AML schemes, achieving all four CR. However, 3 patients relapsed early. Only one patient is alive and remain disease-free, with a long follow-up. Even though cyCD3 was the only T cell marker expressed, its specificity entails the consideration of these cases as a new subtype of MPAL Megakaryoblastic/T, keeping this in mind when designing diagnostic panels.

Because previous studies have reported discrepant results regarding the presence of long-term thyroid complications in HSCT survivors following chemotherapy-only conditioning, we investigated the frequency of thyroid abnormalities in a series of children treated with HSCT for different disorders without TBI as part of the conditioning protocol. METHODS: We compared thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, total triiodothyronine (TT3), anti-peroxidase (TPO Ab) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and thyroid volume z-score in 28 HSCT survivors and 16 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. RESULTS: HSCT recipients had a higher frequency of TD and thyroid complications in total, including TD and euthyroid Hashimoto thyroiditis, compared to the control group. Patients transplanted for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) were more likely to develop a thyroid complication compared to patients with non-malignant hematologic diseases and leukemia patients. BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, citarabin and melphalan) conditioning compared to busulfan (Bu) and fludarabine (Flu)-based regimens and autologous compared to allogenic grafting were associated with a higher prevalence of TD in our study. HSCT survivors had higher mean serum TT3 levels. A multivariate analysis revealed that autologous (auto)-HSCT recipients had higher mean serum titers of TPO Ab compared to allogenic (allo)-HSCT recipients and controls and the mean thyroid volume z-score was significantly higher in controls compared to auto-/allo-HSCT survivors. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a 35.7% prevalence of thyroid abnormalities, emphasizing the need for a long-term surveillance of thyroid function and morphology even in this group of patients who were not exposed to TBI.",,"['Cima, Luminita N', 'Martin, Sorina C', 'Lambrescu, Ioana M', 'Stejereanu, Lavinia', 'Zaharia, Cristina', 'Colita, Anca', 'Fica, Simona']","['Cima LN', 'Martin SC', 'Lambrescu IM', 'Stejereanu L', 'Zaharia C', 'Colita A', 'Fica S']","['Department of Endocrinology, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 37 Dionisie Lupu Street, 030167 Bucharest, Romania, Phone: +4 021 318 0719, Email: luminitasapera82@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Elias University Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Elias University Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Paediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Fundeni Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Paediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Fundeni Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, Elias University Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Thyroid Diseases/*etiology', 'Thyroid Function Tests', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects']",2018/06/24 06:00,2018/11/28 06:00,['2018/06/24 06:00'],"['2018/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/jpem-2018-0020 [doi]', 'jpem-2018-0020 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2018 Aug 28;31(8):869-878. doi: 10.1515/jpem-2018-0020.,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy-only conditioning', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'pediatric recipients', 'thyroid disorders']",8,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3564-7376'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The title compounds were synthesized in the reaction sequence involving reaction of diethyl methylphosphonate with methyl 2-(tosylamino)benzoate, condensation of thus formed diethyl 2-oxo-2-(2-N-tosylphenyl)ethylphosphonate with various aldehydes followed by successful application of the obtained 3-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-1,2-dihydroquinolin-4-ols as Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reagents for the olefination of formaldehyde. Also, enantioselective approach to the target compounds has been evaluated using 3-dimenthoxyphosphoryl group as a chiral auxiliary. Single X-ray crystal analysis of (2S)-3-(dimenthoxyphosphoryl)-2-phenyl-1-tosyldihydroquinolin-4-ol revealed the presence of strong resonance-assisted hydrogen bond (RAHB). The obtained 3-methylidene-2,3-dihydroquinolin-4(1H)-ones were then tested for their cytotoxic activity against two leukemia cell lines NALM-6 and HL-60 and a breast cancer MCF-7 cell line. All compounds showed very high cytotoxic activity with the IC50 values mostly below 1 mum in all three cancer cell lines. The selected analogs were also tested on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and on human mammary gland/breast cells (MCF-10A) to evaluate their influence on normal cells. Since one of the most serious problems in cancer chemotherapy is the development of drug resistance, the mRNA levels and activity of ABCB1 transporter considered to be the most important factor engaged in drug resistance, were evaluated in MCF-7 cells treated with two selected analogs. Both compounds were strong ABCB1 transporter inhibitors that could prevent efflux of anticancer drugs from cancer cells.","['(c) 2018 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.']","['Koszuk, Jacek', 'Bartosik, Tomasz', 'Wojciechowski, Jakub', 'Wolf, Wojciech M', 'Janecka, Anna', 'Drogosz, Joanna', 'Dlugosz, Angelika', 'Krajewska, Urszula', 'Mirowski, Marek', 'Janecki, Tomasz']","['Koszuk J', 'Bartosik T', 'Wojciechowski J', 'Wolf WM', 'Janecka A', 'Drogosz J', 'Dlugosz A', 'Krajewska U', 'Mirowski M', 'Janecki T']","['Institute of Organic Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Zeromskiego 116, 90-924, Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Zeromskiego 116, 90-924, Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of General and Ecological Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Zeromskiego 116, 90-924, Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of General and Ecological Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Zeromskiego 116, 90-924, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Lodz, Muszynskiego 1, 90-151, Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Zeromskiego 116, 90-924, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['DEC-2012/07/B/ST5/02006/National Science Centre of Poland', '502-14-300/Medical University of Lodz', '503/1-156-02/503-11-02/Medical University of Lodz']",['Journal Article'],20180808,Switzerland,Chem Biodivers,Chemistry & biodiversity,101197449,"['0 (3-methylidene-1-tosyl-2,3-dihydroquinolin-4(1H)-one)', '0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Tosyl Compounds)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Quinolines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tosyl Compounds/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2018/06/24 06:00,2018/10/16 06:00,['2018/06/24 06:00'],"['2018/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbdv.201800242 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biodivers. 2018 Sep;15(9):e1800242. doi: 10.1002/cbdv.201800242.

We aim to report the effect of oral ruxolitinib, the Janus kinase (JAK) family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on clinical and immune status of a 12-year-old boy with severe CMC due to a novel STAT1 GOF mutation. METHODS: Clinical features and laboratory data were analyzed, particularly lymphocyte subsets, ex vivo IFNgamma- and IFNalpha-induced STAT1, 3, 5 phosphorylation dynamics during the course of JAK1/2 inhibition therapy, and Th17-related, STAT1- and STAT3-inducible gene expression before and during the treatment. Sanger sequencing was used to detect the STAT1 mutation. Literature review of ruxolitinib in treatment of CMC is appended. RESULTS: A novel STAT1 GOF mutation (c.617T > C; p.L206P), detected in a child with recalcitrant CMC, was shown to be reversible in vitro with ruxolitinib. Major clinical improvement was achieved after 8 weeks of ruxolitinib treatment, while sustained suppression of IFNgamma- and IFNalpha-induced phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5, as well as increased STAT3-inducible and Th17-related gene expression, was demonstrated ex vivo. Clinical relapse and spike of all monitored phosphorylated STAT activity was registered shortly after unplanned withdrawal, decreasing again after ruxolitinib reintroduction.

By employing forkhead box A2 (FOXA2)-deficient mouse models coupled with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) repletion, we reveal definitive roles of uterine glands in embryo implantation and stromal cell decidualization. Here we report that LIF from the uterine glands initiates embryo-uterine communication, leading to embryo attachment and stromal cell decidualization. Detailed histological and molecular analyses discovered that implantation crypt formation does not involve uterine glands, but removal of the luminal epithelium is delayed and subsequent decidualization fails in LIF-replaced glandless but not gland-containing FOXA2-deficient mice. Adverse ripple effects of those dysregulated events in the glandless uterus result in embryo resorption and pregnancy failure. These studies provide evidence that uterine glands synchronize embryo-endometrial interactions, coordinate on-time embryo implantation, and impact stromal cell decidualization, thereby ensuring embryo viability, placental growth, and pregnancy success.",,"['Kelleher, Andrew M', 'Milano-Foster, Jessica', 'Behura, Susanta K', 'Spencer, Thomas E']","['Kelleher AM', 'Milano-Foster J', 'Behura SK', 'Spencer TE']","['Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, 65211, MO, USA.', 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, 65211, MO, USA.', 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, 65211, MO, USA.', 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, 65211, MO, USA. spencerte@missouri.edu.', ""Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, 65211, MO, USA. spencerte@missouri.edu.""]",['eng'],"['R01 HD096266/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HD076347/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R21HD076347/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | Eunice Kennedy', 'Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', '(NICHD)/International', 'R01HD096266/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | Eunice Kennedy', 'Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', '(NICHD)/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180622,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Foxa2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '135845-92-0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Decidua/cytology/*metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Placentation/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism']",2018/06/24 06:00,2019/01/15 06:00,['2018/06/24 06:00'],"['2018/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-018-04848-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-018-04848-8 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2018 Jun 22;9(1):2435. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-04848-8.,,,1,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2815-766X'],PMC6015089,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Qingdai is the main traditional Chinese medicine used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but the complex active ingredients and antitumor targets in treatment of CML have not been clearly defined in previous studies. MATERIAL AND METHODS We constructed a protein-protein interaction network diagram of CML with 638 nodes (proteins) and 1830 edges, based on the biological function of chronic myelocytic leukemia by use of Cytoscape, and we determined 19 key gene nodes in the CML molecule by network topological properties analysis in a data bank. Then, we used the Surflex-dock plugin in SYBYL7.3 docking and acquired the protein crystal structures of key genes involved in CML from the chemical composition of the traditional Chinese medicine Qingdai with key proteins in CML networks. RESULTS According to the score and the spatial structure, the pharmacodynamically active ingredients of Qingdai are Isdirubin, Isoindigo, N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, and Isatin, among which Isdirubin is the most important. We further screened the most effective activity key protein structures of CML to find the best pharmacodynamically active ingredients of Qingdai, according to the binding interactions of the inhibitors at the catalytic site performed in best docking combinations. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that Isdirubin plays a role in resistance to CML by altering the expressions of PIK3CA, MYC, JAK2, and TP53 target proteins. Network pharmacology and molecular docking technology can be used to search for possible reactive molecules in traditional chinese medicines (TCM) and to elucidate their molecular mechanisms.",,"['Zhou, Chao', 'Liu, LiJuan', 'Zhuang, Jing', 'Wei, JunYu', 'Zhang, TingTing', 'Gao, ChunDi', 'Liu, Cun', 'Li, HuaYao', 'Si, HongZong', 'Sun, ChangGang']","['Zhou C', 'Liu L', 'Zhuang J', 'Wei J', 'Zhang T', 'Gao C', 'Liu C', 'Li H', 'Si H', 'Sun C']","['Cancer Center, WeiFang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Cancer Center, WeiFang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Cancer Center, WeiFang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Cancer Center, WeiFang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Clinical Institute, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Clinical Institute, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Clinical Institute, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Clinical Institute, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Department of Public Health, Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Department of Oncology, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180623,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'R1R8QUL21Z (Qingdai compound)']",IM,"['Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Ligands', '*Medicine, Chinese Traditional', '*Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Systems Biology/*methods']",2018/06/24 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/06/24 06:00'],"['2018/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['908104 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.908104 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2018 Jun 23;24:4305-4316. doi: 10.12659/MSM.908104.,,,,,PMC6049014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (SALL) are at risk of obesity and related cardiometabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke and cardiovascular events. Therefore, it is important to address obesity in this population as this may help mitigate future cardiometabolic comorbidities. In this systematic review, we aim to assess current treatment strategies including lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery to manage overweight and obesity in SALL. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search the following databases for primary studies: CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. In addition, unpublished primary studies will be searched in ClinicalTrials.gov as well as conference proceedings, presentations, abstracts, editorials and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses A&I. Reviewers will perform title, abstract, and full-text screening as well as data abstraction and risk of bias assessment independently with a third reviewer to be consulted to resolve disagreements. Searches will be run and updated through May 1st, 2018. The overall quality of the evidence will be determined using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria for each outcome. A meta-analysis will be performed if two studies deploying similar interventions, populations, and design and outcomes are identified. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As individual patient data will not be included, we do not require ethics approval. This review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Several chromatin associated enzymes have been shown to influence post-translational modification (PTM) in DNA, histones, and non-histone proteins. Any deregulation of this core group of enzymes often leads to cancer development. Ubiquitylation of histone H2B in mammalian cells was identified over three decades ago. An exciting really interesting new gene (RING) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, known as RNF20 and RNF40, monoubiquitinates histone H2A at K119 or H2B at K120, is known to function in transcriptional elongation, DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair processes, maintenance of chromatin differentiation, and exerting tumor suppressor activity. RNF20 is somatically altered in breast, lung, prostate cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and mixed lineage leukemia, and its reduced expression is a key factor in initiating genome instability; and it also functions as one of the significant driving factors of oncogenesis. Loss of RNF20/40 and H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) is found in several cancers and is linked to an aggressive phenotype, and is also an indicator of poor prognosis.

Although 5-year survival of patients with localized prostate cancer approaches 100%, survival decreases precipitously after metastasis. Bone is the preferred site for disseminated prostate cancer cell colonization, altering the equilibrium of bone homeostasis resulting in weak and fragile bones. Currently, no curative options are available for prostate cancer bone metastasis. Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (MDA-7)/IL24 is a well-studied cytokine established as a therapeutic in a wide array of cancers upon delivery as a gene therapy. In this study, we explored the potential anticancer properties of MDA-7/IL24 delivered as a recombinant protein. Using bone metastasis experimental models, animals treated with recombinant MDA-7/IL24 had significantly less metastatic lesions in their femurs as compared with controls. The inhibitory effects of MDA-7/IL24 on bone metastasis resulted from prostate cancer-selective killing and inhibition of osteoclast differentiation, which is necessary for bone resorption. Gain- and loss-of-function genetic approaches document that prosurvival Akt and Mcl-1 pathways are critically important in the antibone metastatic activity of MDA-7/IL24. Our previous findings showed that MDA-7/IL24 gene therapy plus Mcl-1 inhibitors cooperate synergistically. Similarly, an Mcl-1 small-molecule inhibitor synergized with MDA-7/IL24 and induced robust antibone metastatic activity. These results expand the potential applications of MDA-7/IL24 as an anticancer molecule and demonstrate that purified recombinant protein is nontoxic in preclinical animal models and has profound inhibitory effects on bone metastasis, which can be enhanced further when combined with an Mcl-1 inhibitory small molecule.

Of 56 included reports, 32 reported on CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma, 15 on FL, and 11 on DLBCL. Within the study period, 40, 11, and 7 studies evaluated rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab, respectively. Substantially more data were available for rituximab-based combination regimens than for either ofatumumab or obinutuzumab. Moreover, substantial heterogeneity was recorded in the study design and backbone chemotherapy. Thus, the available data are inconclusive regarding any potential similarities or differences in efficacy among these anti-CD20 agents for each respective disease. More importantly, only 1 direct comparison among the anti-CD20 agents was identified, emphasizing the need for head-to-head randomized controlled trials of these drugs to inform clinical decision-making for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

They play effective roles in innate immune and inflammatory responses by intercellular relations and inflammatory mediator secretion. Human THP-1 leukemia cells are frequently used for the in vitro determination of the signal pathways, and the functions of macrophages. Phorbol-12-Myristate-13-Acetate (PMA) is commonly used to induce macrophage differentiation of monocytic cell lines but the extent of differentiation in comparison to primary tissue macrophages is unclear. Midkine acts as a cytokine and growth factor which organizes proliferation, differentiation, survival, adhesion and migration of immune cells. The aim of this study was to observe the differences in the secretion of midkine, TNF-alpha, IL-10 and IFN-gamma of macrophages differentiated from monocytes when stimulated with different doses of PMA for different durations. For this purpose, THP-1 monocytic cells were proliferated by PMA at 24, 48 and 72 hours by using the concentrations of 10 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml and 60 ng/ ml. Midkine, TNF-alpha, IL-10 and IFN-gamma cytokine levels were determined by ELISA in the supernatants of the cells collected at the end of incubation times. PMA stimuli initiated changes that were indicative of differentiation in the cell morphology. Differentiation of cells by PMA induced midkine, TNF-alpha, IL-10 and IFN-gamma secretions in monocytic cells even at the lowest dosage (10 ng/ml). PMA caused cytotoxicity in the cells when the dosages were increased (> 20 ng/ml). THP-1 cells have a basal secretion of midkine and are increased by dosage dependent with PMA stimulation. Midkine secretion has shown changes dependent with dosage and time. A difference was also observed in the cytokine profile of PMA stimulated cells at different doses. The results indicated that the differentiation of THP-1 monocytes to macrophages requires optimization to ensure that this in vitro macrophage model more precisely reflects real in vivo physiologic conditions. As a conclusion the results have shown that a modified PMA differentiation protocol (20 ng/ml and 48 hours incubation) might enhance macrophage differentiation of THP-1 cells without induced cell death (viability 92.2%) and cytokine secretion and midkine responses were the important discriminators of the level of macrophage differentiation.",,"['Biriken, Derya', 'Yazihan, Nuray', 'Yilmaz, Sukran']","['Biriken D', 'Yazihan N', 'Yilmaz S']","['Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Microbiology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Screed Institute, Cell and Virus Bank, Ankara, Turkey.']",['tur'],,['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Mikrobiyol Bul,Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,7503830,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '137497-38-2 (Midkine)', '56937-68-9 (phorbolol myristate acetate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/pharmacology', '*Cytokines/immunology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/drug effects', '*Midkine/immunology', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', '*THP-1 Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2018/06/24 06:00,2019/04/18 06:00,['2018/06/24 06:00'],"['2018/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5578/mb.66745 [doi]'],ppublish,Mikrobiyol Bul. 2018 Apr;52(2):147-155. doi: 10.5578/mb.66745.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Degisik konsantrasyonlarda ve surelerde Phorbol-12-Myristate-13-Acetate ile uyarilan insan THP-1 losemi hucrelerinin sitokin ve midkin yanitlarinin arastirilmasi.,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, new effective and selective clinical treatments are urgently needed. An analysis of data from large-scale, high-throughput drug screening cell line projects identified Bosutinib, a Src/Abl inhibitor that is currently used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, as a candidate drug to treat HNSCC. Using a panel of HNSCC-derived cell lines, we found that treatment with Bosutinib reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of sensitive cell lines. The drug rapidly inhibited Src and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) phosphorylation, and sensitivity to Bosutinib was correlated with the activation status of EGFR. Similar findings were observed in in vivo xenograft assays using HNSCC derived cells. Moreover, in the presence of mutations in PIK3CA, the combination of Bosutinib with the PI3Kalpha inhibitor Alpelisib showed a synergistic effect. These results suggest that Bosutinib could be a new effective drug for the treatment of HNSCC, particularly in tumors with high EGFR activity.

However, their chemical variability, depending on the species, varieties, or geographical origin (among other factors) determines different bioactivities that need to be evaluated. Methods: The antioxidant activity of Corymbia citriodora and eight Eucalyptus species EOs was determined using two different methods: the scavenging ability of 2,2&prime;-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS(+&bull;)) and peroxyl free radicals or oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Antibacterial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms Streptococcus pneumoniae (strains D39 and TIGR4), and Haemophilus influenza (strain DSM 9999). The essential oils&rsquo; minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was assessed using a microdilution method. The antiproliferative activity was determined using the THP-1 cell line (human acute monocytic leukaemia) with methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay (MTT). Results:Corymbia citriodora and Eucalyptus viminalis EOs showed the highest ABTS and peroxyl free radical scavenging capacity. Eucalyptus globulus EO showed a high potential to treat Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Haemophilus influenzae was the respiratory pathogen that showed the highest resistance to all EOs, including tea tree EO. After 96 h of incubation, at 25 &mu;g/mL, Eucalyptus radiata and Eucalyptus viminalis EOs showed highest cytotoxic activity against the THP-1 cell line.

As an adaptor protein of E3 ligase function, TRAF6 regulates NF-kappaB signaling via TAK1 and I-kappaB kinase (IKK) activation. Here, we investigated novel mechanisms by which TRAF6 signaling is regulated under receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis. DESIGN: A yeast two-hybrid screen system identified cellular factors that interact with TRAF6. The interactions were confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, followed by immuno-blotting. The role of TRAF6 in bone growth and remodeling was determined by osteoclast differentiation and bone-resorption pit assays. Regulatory mechanisms were examined by co-immunoprecipitation, immuno-blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and luciferase reporter assays. RESULTS: We show that B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia protein 3 (BCL3) interacts with TRAF6 through its ankyrin-repeat domain and inhibits osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). Further, TRAF6 interacts with CYLD to mediate BCL3 deubiquitination, which facilitates the cytoplasmic accumulation of BCL3 and represses BCL3 and p50 complex-mediated cyclin D1 transcription. CONCLUSIONS: TRAF6 promotes RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by regulating novel non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling via BCL3 deubiquitination, indicating that BCL3 provides valuable insights into bone loss-associated diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

Injectable azacitidine can improve post-transplant outcomes but presents challenges with exposure and compliance. Oral CC-486 allows extended dosing to prolong azacitidine activity. We investigated use of CC-486 maintenance therapy after alloSCT. Adults with MDS or AML in morphologic complete remission at CC-486 initiation (42 to 84 days after alloSCT) were included. Patients received 1 of 4 CC-486 dosing schedules per 28-day cycle for up to 12 cycles. Endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence, relapse/progression rate, and survival. Of 30 patients, 7 received CC-486 once daily for 7 days per cycle (200 mg, n=3; 300 mg, n=4) and 23 for 14 days per cycle (150 mg, n=4; 200 mg, n=19 [expansion cohort]). Grades 3 to 4 adverse events were infrequent and occurred with similar frequency across regimens. Standard concomitant medications did not alter CC-486 pharmacokinetic parameters. Three patients (10%) experienced grade III acute GVHD and 9 experienced chronic GVHD. Of 28 evaluable patients, 6 (21%) relapsed or had progressive disease: 3 of 7 patients (43%) who had received 7-day dosing and 3 of 23 (13%) who had received 14-day dosing. Transplant-related mortality was 3%. At 19 months of follow-up, median overall survival was not reached. Estimated 1-year survival rates were 86% and 81% in the 7-day and 14-day dosing cohorts, respectively. CC-486 maintenance was generally well tolerated, with low rates of relapse, disease progression, and GVHD.

Prospective analysis of the specimens using this approach showed that 23% of patients screened for HSCT had detectable residual disease by DeltaN (.04% to 53%). Of those patients who proceeded to transplant as being in morphologic remission, 10 had detectable disease (.04% to 14%) by DeltaN. The disease-free survival of this group was 10% (0 to 35%) compared with 55% (46% to 64%, P < .001) for those without disease. The DeltaN assay was validated using the post-HSCT specimen by sorting abnormal or suspicious cells to confirm recipient or donor origin by chimerism studies. All 15 patients who had confirmation of tumor detection relapsed, whereas the 2 patients with suspicious phenotype cells lacking this confirmation did not. The phenotype of the relapse specimen was then used retrospectively to assess the pre-HSCT specimen, allowing identification of additional samples with low levels of MRD involvement that were previously undetected. Quantitative assessment of WT1 gene expression was not predictive of relapse or other outcomes in either pre- or post-transplant specimens. MRD detected by DeltaN was highly specific, but did not identify most relapsing patients. The application of the assay was limited by poor quality among one-third of the specimens and lack of a diagnostic phenotype for comparison.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study focused on delayed healing after extraction in patients with hematologic malignancy. Sockets with delayed healing were defined as those with intense pain and bone exposure 1 week postoperatively. Patients with and without delayed socket healing were compared using the Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney U test with some variables. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was conducted to define cutoff values for delayed healing. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-four dental extractions in 93 patients (median age, 64 yr; range, 20 to 85 yr) were analyzed. The incidence of delayed socket healing was 7.5% (7 of 93 patients). There was no postoperative bleeding. Older age, type of hematologic malignancy (acute leukemia), shorter time from dental extraction to initiation of chemotherapy, low platelet count or hemoglobin level, requirement for red blood cell concentrate or platelet transfusion, and use of an absorbable hemostatic agent were statistically associated with the occurrence of delayed socket healing. Platelet and hemoglobin cutoffs were 4.6 x 10(4)/muL and 7.7 g/dL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although dental extraction can be safely performed in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy, oral surgeons should understand the potential risk for delayed socket healing. When considering dental extraction, patients with hematologic malignancy and low hemoglobin or platelet levels should be informed about the possibility of delayed socket healing.","['Copyright (c) 2018 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, whether these anesthetics also affect biological functions of cancer stem cells is largely unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of three commonly used amide-linked local anesthetics (ropivacaine, lidocaine and bupivacaine) on leukemia stem cell (LSC) derived from two different leukemia diseases (acute myeloid leukemia, n=8 and chronic myeloid leukemia, n=8) as well as normal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) derived from cord blood donors (n=8) as comparison. We show that all three local anesthetics at clinically achievable concentrations significantly inhibit colony formation and serial replating of LSC in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting their inhibitory effects on LSC differentiation, proliferation and self-renewal. In addition, lidocaine and bupivacaine are more potent than ropivacaine. However, local anesthetics at the same concentrations do not affect LSC and HSC survival, demonstrating the differentiation and self-renewal as the primary effects of local anesthetics on LSC and HSC. Interestingly, local anesthetics display certain selectivity between LSC and HSC by having higher efficacy on LSC than HSC. Mechanism studies using both pharmacological and genetic approaches demonstrate that these local anesthetics target LSC via inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin but not Hedgehog or NF-kB signaling. Our work is the first to demonstrate the possible influence of amide-linked local anesthetics on cancer as well as normal stem cells via inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Our findings contribute to the comprehensive understanding of potential implication of amide-linked local aesthesis in tumor biology.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha36 gene silencing on tau protein phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and cell apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with estrogen or left untreated, to investigate the effects of estrogen stimulation on ERalpha36 and the ERK/protein B kinase (AKT) signaling pathway. ERalpha36 mRNA expressions were detected by quantitative RT-PCR. A phosphatase kit was used to test protein phosphatase (PP)-2A activity before and after treatment. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect protein expression of ERalpha36; tau protein; phosphorylated- tau (p-tau) at site Thr231 [p-tau (Thr231)]; glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3beta and its specificity sites (Tyr216 and Ser9); Cyclin Dl; proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA); B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2; and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). A cell-counting kit (CCK)-8 assay was used to determine cell viability. Cell apoptosis and rate of tumor growth and volume were determined by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and a xenotransplanted tumor model in nude mice. Results show that without estrogen stimulation, ERalpha36 was inactivated. When stimulated by estrogen, expression of ERalpha36, PP2A, p-GSK3beta (Ser9)/total protein ( t)-GSK3beta, Cyclin Dl, PCNA, and Bcl-2 were up-regulated, and p-GSK3beta (Tyr216)/ t-GSK3beta expression was down-regulated, as was p-tau (Thr231) and Bax expression. The expression of p-ERK/ERK, p-AKT/AKT, p-methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)/MEK, and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/mTOR expression was up-regulated, suggesting that the ERK/AKT signaling pathway is activated. Cell proliferation was also accelerated, whereas apoptosis was inhibited with stimulation by estrogen. However, we found that the effects of silencing ERalpha36 on the expression of related intracellular factors had no association with estrogen. Our study demonstrates that ERalpha36 gene silencing can inhibit the activation of the ERK/AKT signaling pathway, increase tau protein phosphorylation, decrease cell vitality and tumorigenicity, and promote apoptosis of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.-Wang, H.-B., Li, T., Ma, D.-Z., Zhi, H.

RESULTS: Most adult stem cells are preserved in a quiescent, nonmotile state in vivo which acts as a ""protective state"" for stem cells to reduce endogenous stress provoked by DNA replication and cellular respiration as well as exogenous environmental stress. The dynamic balance between quiescence, self-renewal and differentiation is critical for supporting a functional blood system throughout life of an organism. Stress-conditions, for example ionizing radiation exposure can trigger the blood forming HSCs to proliferate and migrate through extramedullary tissues to expand the number of HSCs and increase hematopoiesis. In addition, a wealth of investigation validated that deregulation of this balance plays a critical pathogenic role in various different hematopoietic diseases including the leukemia development. CONCLUSION: The review summarizes the current knowledge on how alterations in dietary and metabolic factors could alter the risk of leukemia development following ionizing radiation exposure by inhibiting or even reversing the leukemic progression. Understanding the influence of diet, metabolism, and epigenetics on radiation-induced leukemogenesis may lead to the development of practical interventions to reduce the risk in exposed populations.",,"['Karabulutoglu, Melis', 'Finnon, Rosemary', 'Imaoka, Tatsuhiko', 'Friedl, Anna A', 'Badie, Christophe']","['Karabulutoglu M', 'Finnon R', 'Imaoka T', 'Friedl AA', 'Badie C']","['a Cancer Mechanisms and Biomarkers group, Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards , Public Health England , Didcot , UK.', 'b CRUK & MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology , University of Oxford , Oxford , UK.', 'a Cancer Mechanisms and Biomarkers group, Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards , Public Health England , Didcot , UK.', 'c Department of Radiation Effects Research, National Institute of Radiological Sciences , National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology , Chiba , Japan.', 'd Department of Radiation Oncology , University Hospital, LMU Munich , Munich , Germany.', 'a Cancer Mechanisms and Biomarkers group, Biological Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards , Public Health England , Didcot , UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180924,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Autophagy', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Diet', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Hematopoiesis/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2018/06/23 06:00,2019/09/27 06:00,['2018/06/23 06:00'],"['2018/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553002.2018.1490042 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2019 Apr;95(4):452-479. doi: 10.1080/09553002.2018.1490042.

Data including demographics, clinical course, and outcome were collected. Pharmacokinetic samples were obtained from two younger patients to guide dosing. RESULTS: In total, three patients (4.5, 5, and 19 years of age) with invasive mucormycosis who were treated with isavuconazole were identified. All patients were treated with isavuconazole as a second line therapy and experienced improvement following the initiation of this treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our limited clinical experience, isavuconazole may be a safe and effective treatment option for children and adolescents afflicted by IMI. Prospective clinical trials should be performed in order to evaluate the pharmakokinetics and safety of isavuconazole in the pediatric population.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Barg, Assaf A', 'Malkiel, Sarah', 'Bartuv, Maya', 'Greenberg, Gahl', 'Toren, Amos', 'Keller, Nathan']","['Barg AA', 'Malkiel S', 'Bartuv M', 'Greenberg G', 'Toren A', 'Keller N']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & BMT, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & BMT, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Pharmacy Services, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Department of Diagnostic imaging, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & BMT, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""Pediatric Infectious Disease Unit, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel."", 'The Department of Health Management, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180622,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '60UTO373KE (isavuconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Mucormycosis/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Nitriles/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Pyridines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use']",2018/06/23 06:00,2019/05/11 06:00,['2018/06/23 06:00'],"['2018/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27281 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Oct;65(10):e27281. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27281.

The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of CSF3R mutations in acute leukemia and their association with other genetic abnormalities. METHODS: Amplicon-targeted, next-generation sequencing of 58 genes was performed retrospectively on 1152 patients (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], n = 587; acute lymphoid leukemia [ALL], n = 565). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect 35 leukemia-specific gene fusions. RESULTS: CSF3R mutations (26 patients) were detected in 3.6% (13 of 364 patients), 4.6% (8 of 175 patients), and 8.3% (4 of 48 patients) of those with de novo, relapsed, and secondary AML, respectively, and in 0.2% (1 of 565 patients) of those with ALL. In total, 9 distinct CSF3R mutations were detected. Membrane-proximal missense mutations and cytoplasmic truncations were identified as mutually exclusive. The proportion of patients who had French-American-British subtypes M2 and M4 in the CSF3R-mutated group was significantly greater than that in the CSF3R wild-type group for both the de novo AML cohort (P = .001) and the relapsed AML cohort (P = .024). All de novo and relapsed AMLs with CSF3R mutations were associated with genetic alterations in transcription factors, including RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, double-mutated CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPAdm), and NPM1 mutations; and core-binding factor gene abnormalities and CEBPAdm accounted for 90.5% (19 of 21 patients). CONCLUSIONS: CSF3R mutations are uncommon in AML; however, when they occur, they are often associated with core-binding factor gene abnormalities and CEBPAdm.

Unfortunately, the prognosis of patients aged >65 years is dismal, with 1-year overall survival approaching 10% with conventional therapies. The hypothesis of harnessing the immune system against cancer, including leukemia, has been postulated for a long time, and several clinical attempts have been made in this field. In the last years, we increased our knowledge about the interplay between AML and immune cells, but no major improvement has been translated, up to now, from bench to bedside. However, the outstanding results coming from the modern immuno-oncology trials with new drugs have granted a new interest for immunotherapy in AML. Accordingly, the elderly population represents an ideal target, given the low percentage of patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant. With that in mind, in the era of immunotherapy, we consider immunosenescence as the optimal background to start investigating a biology-driven approach to AML therapy in the elderly.

METHODS: The primary cultured suckling mouse myocardium were randomly divided into control group and oxidative stress group. Firstly, the suckling mouse atria cardiomyocytes were treated with H2O2 at the concentration of 100 m mumol/L for 2 hours. Then, the index of oxidative stress and anti-oxidative stress superoxide dismutase (SOD), the con-tents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) of this two groups were detected by ELISA. Myocardial apoptosis of the two groups was detected by TUNEL. The expressions of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), C/EBP homolo-gous protein (chop), Bcl-2 associated X protein (bax), B-cell leukemia 2 protein (bcl-2) mRNA were detected by real time PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the viability of SOD and the contents of MDA in oxidative stress group were reduced, the contents of MDA was increased (P < 0.01).

Observations: We searched MEDLINE (1990-2018), the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and American Society of Hematology websites (2010-2018). We used the search terms ""acute lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemia"" or ""ALL."" We largely selected publications in the past 5 years but did not exclude commonly referenced and highly regarded older publications. Target therapies toward specific transcripts (eg, BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase oncoprotein by tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and specific leukemic cell surface antigens (eg, CD20, CD22, and CD19 monoclonal antibodies) are major breakthroughs. Current treatments produce long-term survival in 50% of patients with precursor B-cell ALL including 50% to 70% with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL, 50% to 60% with T-cell ALL, and 80% with mature B-cell ALL. Next-generation sequencing and genomic profiling in ALL have identified new prognostic markers, targets, and ALL subtypes (eg, Ph-like ALL). Monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibody constructs, and chimeric antigen receptor T cellular therapies developed in the past 5 to 7 years have revolutionized the treatment of ALL and resulted in US Food and Drug Administration approvals of blinatumomab in 2014, as well as inotuzumab and tisagenlecleucel in 2017 as ALL salvage strategies. Their use in combined modalities as salvage and frontline therapies is currently under investigation. Conclusions and Relevance: Therapies targeting specific transcripts or leukemic cell surface antigens are major breakthroughs in the treatment of adults with ALL. The incorporation of new monoclonal antibodies and other targeted approaches into frontline regimens is showing promising results. If confirmed, such strategies may increase the cure rates in adults to levels achieved in pediatric ALL and reduce the need for intensive and prolonged chemotherapy.",,"['Jabbour, Elias', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jabbour E', 'Pui CH', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']",2018/06/23 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2018/06/23 06:00'],"['2018/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['2685652 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1915 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2018 Oct 1;4(10):1413-1420. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1915.,,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A ""war on cancer"" had been declared. Combination cytotoxic chemotherapy was predicted to cure all cancers, based on the stunning success in treating childhood leukemia. Breast cancer treatments were primitive; radical mastectomy and radiation were standard of care for disease that had not spread. Ablative endocrine surgery (oophorectomy, hypophysectomy, and adrenalectomy) was a palliative last option for metastatic breast cancer. However, only 30% responded, surviving for only 1 or 2 years: every patient soon died. The discovery of the estrogen receptor (ER) and translation to breast cancer treatment triggered a revolution in women's health. Two important but interconnected events occurred in 1972 at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology (WFEB) that would exploit the breast tumor ER as the first target to save lives and prevent breast cancer development. Two new groups of medicines-selective ER modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs)-would continue the momentum of research at the WFEB to improve women's health. Here, we recount the important progress made in women's health based on knowledge of the endocrinology of breast cancer. We propose future opportunities in SERM therapeutics to ""refresh"" the current standards of care for breast cancer treatment.

EAC originates from within the intestinal-type metaplasia, Barrett's esophagus, a condition arising on a background of gastroesophageal reflux disease and associated inflammation. Methods: This study used a druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening library of 6022 siRNAs in conjunction with bioinformatics platforms, genomic studies of EAC tissues, somatic variation data of EAC from The Cancer Genome Atlas data of EAC, and pathologic and functional studies to define novel EAC-associated, and targetable, immune factors. Results: By using a druggable genome library we defined genes that sustain EAC cell growth, which included an unexpected immunologic signature. Integrating Cancer Genome Atlas data with druggable siRNA targets showed a striking concordance and an EAC-specific gene amplification event associated with 7 druggable targets co-encoded at Chr6p21.1. Over-representation of immune pathway-associated genes supporting EAC cell growth included leukemia inhibitory factor, complement component 1, q subcomponent A chain (C1QA), and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which were validated further as targets sharing downstream signaling pathways through genomic and pathologic studies. Finally, targeting the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2-, C1q-, and leukemia inhibitory factor-activated signaling pathways (TYROBP-spleen tyrosine kinase and JAK-STAT3) with spleen tyrosine kinase and Janus-activated kinase inhibitor fostamatinib R788 triggered EAC cell death, growth arrest, and reduced tumor burden in NOD scid gamma mice. Conclusions: These data highlight a subset of genes co-identified through siRNA targeting and genomic studies of expression and somatic variation, specifically highlighting the contribution that immune-related factors play in support of EAC development and suggesting their suitability as targets in the treatment of EAC.",,"['Duggan, Shane P', 'Garry, Catherine', 'Behan, Fiona M', 'Phipps, Sinead', 'Kudo, Hiromi', 'Kirca, Murat', 'Zaheer, Abdul', 'McGarrigle, Sarah', 'Reynolds, John V', 'Goldin, Robert', 'Kalloger, Steve E', 'Schaeffer, David F', 'Long, Aideen', 'Strid, Jessica', 'Kelleher, Dermot']","['Duggan SP', 'Garry C', 'Behan FM', 'Phipps S', 'Kudo H', 'Kirca M', 'Zaheer A', 'McGarrigle S', 'Reynolds JV', 'Goldin R', 'Kalloger SE', 'Schaeffer DF', 'Long A', 'Strid J', 'Kelleher D']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Life Science Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Centre for Complement and Inflammation Research, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', ""Centre for Pathology, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', ""Department of Gastroenterology, St James' Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."", ""Department of Gastroenterology, St James' Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."", 'Department of Surgery, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Surgery, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', ""Centre for Pathology, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Centre for Complement and Inflammation Research, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Life Science Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180131,United States,Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol,Cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology,101648302,,,,2018/06/23 06:00,2018/06/23 06:01,['2018/06/23 06:00'],"['2017/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jcmgh.2018.01.012 [doi]', 'S2352-345X(18)30019-5 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2018 Jan 31;5(4):569-590. doi: 10.1016/j.jcmgh.2018.01.012. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['ATCC, American Type Culture Collection', ""BE, Barrett's esophagus"", ""Barrett's Esophagus"", 'EAC, esophageal adenocarcinoma', 'ERBB2, erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2', 'ESCC, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'FCS, fetal calf serum', 'GEM, gene expression microarray', 'GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'GO, gene ontology', 'HGD, high-grade dysplastic', 'IL, interleukin', 'Inflammation', 'JAK-STAT, Janus kinase/signal transducer-and-activator of transcription', 'LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor', 'MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide', 'PBS, phosphate-buffered saline', 'RA, rheumatoid arthritis', 'SV, somatic variation', 'SYK, spleen tyrosine kinase', 'TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'TREM2, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2', 'Therapeutic Targets', 'VEGFA, vascular endothelial growth factor A', 'mRNA, messenger RNA', 'siRNA, small interfering RNA']",4,,PMC6009761,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulating data suggests an important role of SIRPalpha in cell signaling as a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In various cancers, including prostate, breast and liver, as well as astrocytoma and myeloid malignancies, downregulation of SIRPalpha is frequently observed, resulting in activation of these downstream signaling pathways.

Recently, it has been reported that blocking CD47, an anti-phagocytic signal expressed on tumor cells and an SIRPalpha ligand, may serve as a promising therapeutic approach, particular for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

The current study reveals that RPL10 R98S cells accumulate reactive oxygen species which promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ATP levels, causing the proliferation defect. RPL10 R98S mutant leukemia cells can survive high oxidative stress levels via a specific increase of IRES-mediated translation of the anti-apoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), mediating BCL-2 protein overexpression. RPL10 R98S selective sensitivity to the clinically available Bcl-2 inhibitor Venetoclax (ABT-199) was supported by suppression of splenomegaly and the absence of human leukemia cells in the blood of T-ALL xenografted mice. These results shed new light on the oncogenic function of ribosomal mutations in cancer, provide a novel mechanism for BCL-2 upregulation in leukemia, and highlight BCL-2 inhibition as a novel therapeutic opportunity in RPL10 R98S defective T-ALL.",,"['Kampen, Kim R', 'Sulima, Sergey O', 'Verbelen, Benno', 'Girardi, Tiziana', 'Vereecke, Stijn', 'Rinaldi, Gianmarco', 'Verbeeck, Jelle', 'Op de Beeck, Joyce', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Meijerink, Jules P P', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Spincemaille, Pieter', 'Cools, Jan', 'Cassiman, David', 'Fendt, Sarah-Maria', 'Vermeersch, Pieter', 'De Keersmaecker, Kim']","['Kampen KR', 'Sulima SO', 'Verbelen B', 'Girardi T', 'Vereecke S', 'Rinaldi G', 'Verbeeck J', 'Op de Beeck J', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Meijerink JPP', 'Moorman AV', 'Harrison CJ', 'Spincemaille P', 'Cools J', 'Cassiman D', 'Fendt SM', 'Vermeersch P', 'De Keersmaecker K']","['Department of Oncology, Laboratory for Disease Mechanisms in Cancer, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Laboratory for Disease Mechanisms in Cancer, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Laboratory for Disease Mechanisms in Cancer, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Laboratory for Disease Mechanisms in Cancer, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Laboratory for Disease Mechanisms in Cancer, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Cellular Metabolism and Metabolic Regulation, Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Laboratory of Cellular Metabolism and Metabolic Regulation, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Laboratory for Disease Mechanisms in Cancer, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Laboratory for Disease Mechanisms in Cancer, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology & Hematology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Gastroenterology-Hepatology and Metabolic Center, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Gastroenterology-Hepatology and Metabolic Center, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Cellular Metabolism and Metabolic Regulation, Center for Cancer Biology, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Laboratory of Cellular Metabolism and Metabolic Regulation, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Laboratory for Disease Mechanisms in Cancer, KU Leuven and Leuven Cancer Institute (LKI), Leuven, Belgium. kim.dekeersmaecker@kuleuven.be.']",['eng'],['334946/European Research Council/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180621,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Internal Ribosome Entry Sites)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RPL10 protein, human)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Rpl10 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Internal Ribosome Entry Sites', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', '*Mutation', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein L10', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2018/06/23 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/06/23 06:00'],"['2017/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0176-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0176-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Feb;33(2):319-332. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0176-z.

Data about peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) as a reliable graft source for T-LBL treatment are lacking. MATERIAL AND METHODS T-LBL patients who underwent T cell-replete haploidentical peripheral blood hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-PBHCT) from July 2007 to January 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS A total of 25 patients (age >/=15 years) with median age of 24 (range 15-51) years were enrolled. The median number of CD34+ cells infused was 5.0 (1.6-14.4) 106/kg. Sustained myeloid engraftment with full donor chimerism was achieved in all patients. The cumulative incidence of grades 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at day 100 was 24%. Two-year extensive chronic GVHD cumulative incidence was 20%. The 3-year overall survival rate for all patients was 70%. The median survival time of the complete remission (CR) group was better than that of the non-CR group (not reached vs. 9 m) (P<0.01). The relapse rate was 17% for patients who obtained CR and were given haplo-HCT as consolidation treatment.

This prospective analysis aimed to further elucidate pre-diagnosis plasma immune marker profiles associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk. We identified 598 incident lymphoma cases and 601 matched controls in Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study participants with archived pre-diagnosis plasma samples and measured 13 immune marker levels with multiplexed immunoassays. Using multivariable logistic regression we calculated Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) per standard deviation unit increase in biomarker concentration for risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and major histological subtype, stratifying additional models by years (<5, 5 to <10, >/=10) after blood draw. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor-alpha, CXC chemokine ligand 13, soluble CD30, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-2 were individually positively associated, and B-cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family inversely associated, with all non-Hodgkin lymphoma and one or more subtypes. The biomarker combinations associated independently with lymphoma varied somewhat by subtype and years after blood draw. Of note, the unexpected inverse association between B-cell activating factor and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma risk (OR: 95%CI: 0.51, 0.43-0.62) persisted more than ten years after blood draw (OR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.52-0.93).

The objective of this study was to analyze the cost of illness (COI) of leukemia, and to mark out the underlying driving factors, in Japan. METHODS: COI method was applied to the data from government statistics. We first summed up the direct and indirect costs from 1996 to 2014; then future COI for the year 2017-2029 was projected. RESULTS: Calculated COI showed an upward trend with a 13% increase from 1996 to 2014 (270-305 billion yen). Increased COI was attributed to an increase in direct costs. Although mortality cost accounted for the largest proportion of COI, but followed a downward trend. Decreased mortality costs reflected the effects of aging. Mortality cost per person also decreased, however, the percentage of mortality cost for individuals >/=65 years of age increased consistently from 1996 to 2014. If a similar trend in health-related indicators continue, COI would remain stable from 2017 to 2029 regardless of models. CONCLUSION: COI of leukemia increased from 1996 to 2014, but was projected to decrease in foreseeable future. With advancement of new therapies, leukemia has become potentially curable and require long-term care; so direct cost and morbidity cost will remain unchanged. This reveal the further continuing burden on public funds. Thus, the information obtained from this study can be regarded as beneficial to future policy making with respect to government policies in Japan.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

In this study, expression of common endometrial markers Leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF), mucin 1 (MUC1) and integrin beta3 were studied and compared. METHODS: Fourteen women with RIF, 25 with RM and 20 fertile controls were recruited for endometrial biopsy during implantation window on day LH + 7. Spatial and temporal expression of MUC1, LIF and Integrin beta3 were compared using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry. Association of MUC1, LIF and integrin beta3 expression levels with demographic and clinical characteristics were determined. RESULTS: MUC1 expression in both luminal and glandular epithelium in women with RIF were significantly lower than that in women with RM and fertile controls. There were no differences in LIF and Integrin beta3 expression in endometrial epithelium among three groups. Decreased MUC1 expression were not significantly associated with age, BMI, gravidity, parity, cycle length, progesterone level and previous miscarriage. CONCLUSIONS: Deceased expression of MUC1 is an independent marker for endometrial receptivity in RIF women, suggesting MUC1 may contribute to the reproductive failure in RIF women.",,"['Wu, Fangrong', 'Chen, Xiaoyan', 'Liu, Yingyu', 'Liang, Bo', 'Xu, Hui', 'Li, Tin Chiu', 'Wang, Chi Chiu']","['Wu F', 'Chen X', 'Liu Y', 'Liang B', 'Xu H', 'Li TC', 'Wang CC']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong. ccwang@cuhk.edu.hk.', 'Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong. ccwang@cuhk.edu.hk.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong. ccwang@cuhk.edu.hk.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180621,England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)']",IM,"['Abortion, Habitual/diagnosis/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/diagnosis/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Mucin-1/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy']",2018/06/23 06:00,2018/10/17 06:00,['2018/06/23 06:00'],"['2018/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12958-018-0379-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12958-018-0379-1 [pii]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2018 Jun 21;16(1):60. doi: 10.1186/s12958-018-0379-1.,['NOTNLM'],"['Endometrium', 'Implantation', 'Receptivity markers', 'Reproductive failure']",1,,PMC6013892,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The present work describes the fabrication, optimization, and evaluation of bioactive hydroxyapatite nanoparticles to achieve sustained delivery of bendamustine HCl. METHODS: Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by the wet chemical precipitation method by reacting a calcium and phosphate precursor and the reaction was optimized via Box-Behnken DOE. The drug was loaded on particles by physical adsorption. Various analytical studies were performed on the fabricated nanoparticles in addition to biodistribution studies to establish the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the designed formulation. RESULTS: pH of the reactant solution was found to have a more profound effect on the particle size and size distribution in comparison to reactant concentration. The particles were found to have a spherical morphology by SEM. Size of the blank and drug-loaded nanoparticles was found to be 130+/-20 nm by TEM. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) studies confirmed the presence of hydroxyapatite as the dominant phase while DSC studies indicated the presence of the drug in its amorphous form after its adsorption on NPs.

The standard technique consists of 12 Gy in 6 fractions over a period of 3 days. The Standard-fractionation compAred to one-daily fRaction total body irrAdiation prior to tranSplant In LEUkemia patieNts (SARASIN) study aimed to compare standard fractionation with once-daily fractionation before transplant in leukemia. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively compared TBI regimens delivered in 2993 patients from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation database, who underwent transplantation between 2000 and 2014 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 1729) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 1264). TBI was delivered as either 12 Gy in 6 fractions (group 1, considered the reference group; 1362 ALL and 857 AML patients), 9 to 12 Gy in 2 fractions (group 2, 173 ALL and 256 AML patients), or 12 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions (group 3, 194 ALL and 151 AML patients). RESULTS: The median follow-up was 60 and 84 months in ALL and AML patients, respectively. At 5 years, the leukemia-free survival rate, overall survival rate, relapse incidence, and nonrelapse mortality rate were 46.6%, 50.4%, 28.8%, and 24.6%, respectively, in ALL patients and 46.6%, 48.9%, 29.7%, and 23.6%, respectively, in AML patients. In multivariate analyses, the outcomes of groups 2 and 3 were not statistically different from those in group 1. The cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies (SMs) was significantly higher in group 2 (7.2%; P < 10(-6) for group 2 vs group 1). However, group 2 was not associated with an increase in SMs when we considered non-T-cell-depleted transplant patients. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the 12-Gy fractionated TBI dose delivered either in 2 fractions or in 1 fraction per day over a period of 3 to 4 days resulted in nonsignificant differences in disease control and survival. However, 1-day fractionation may be associated with a higher risk of mucositis and hemorrhagic cystitis. The absence of a significant difference in the SM incidence in the non-T-cell-depleted group should be interpreted with caution in the context of a retrospective study design. Our findings are important to consider for radiation therapy department organization. In-depth analyses of other nonlethal toxicities and late effects are required.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Early-stage MF patches or plaques often resemble inflammatory skin disorders (ISDs), including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Cell adhesion molecule 1 gene (CADM1), which was initially identified as a tumor suppressor gene in human non-small cell lung cancer, has been reported as a diagnostic marker for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. OBJECTIVE: We investigated CADM1 expression in MF neoplastic cells, especially during early stages, and evaluated its usefulness as a diagnostic marker for MF. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study by using immunohistochemical staining and confirmed the expression of CADM1 in MF. In addition, we compared CADM1 messenger RNA expression in microdissected MF samples and ISD samples. RESULTS: In the overall study period, 55 of 58 MF samples (94.8 %) stained positive for CADM1. None of the 50 ISD samples showed positive reactivity (P < .0001). We found CADM1 messenger RNA expression in the intradermal lymphocytes of patients with MF but not in those of patients with an ISD. LIMITATIONS: We did not conduct a validation study for MF cases in other institutions. CONCLUSIONS: CADM1-positive cells can be identified in early stages with fewer infiltrating cells and may be useful as a diagnostic marker for early-stage MF.","['Copyright (c) 2018 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Here, we examine the signaling mechanisms from JAK2-V617F and responses to ruxolitinib in JAK2-V617F-positive leukemic cell lines, including PVTL-2, newly established from a patient with post-MPN secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and the widely used model cell line HEL. We have found that ruxolitinib downregulated the mTORC1/S6K/4EBP1 pathway at least partly through inhibition of the STAT5/Pim-2 pathway with concomitant downregulation of c-Myc, MCL-1, and BCL-xL as well as induction of autophagy in these cells. Ruxolitinib very efficiently inhibited proliferation but only modestly induced apoptosis. However, inhibition of BCL-xL/BCL-2 by the BH3 mimetics ABT-737 and navitoclax or BCL-xL by A-1331852 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis involving activation of Bak and Bax synergistically with ruxolitinib in HEL cells. On the other hand, the putative pan-BH3 mimetic obatoclax as well as chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 inhibited autophagy at its late stage and induced apoptosis in PVTL-2 cells synergistically with ruxolitinib. The present study suggests that autophagy as well as the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, regulated at least partly by the mTORC1 pathway downstream of STAT5/Pim-2, protects JAK2-V617F-positive leukemic cells from ruxolitinib-induced apoptosis depending on cell types and may contribute to development of new strategies against JAK2-V617F-positive neoplasms.",,"['Ishida, Shinya', 'Akiyama, Hiroki', 'Umezawa, Yoshihiro', 'Okada, Keigo', 'Nogami, Ayako', 'Oshikawa, Gaku', 'Nagao, Toshikage', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Ishida S', 'Akiyama H', 'Umezawa Y', 'Okada K', 'Nogami A', 'Oshikawa G', 'Nagao T', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180601,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,2018/06/22 06:00,2018/06/22 06:01,['2018/06/22 06:00'],"['2017/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25515 [doi]', '25515 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Jun 1;9(42):26834-26851. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25515. eCollection 2018 Jun 1.,['NOTNLM'],"['BH3 mimetic', 'JAK2-V617F', 'MPN', 'apoptosis', 'mTOR']",42,,PMC6003557,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical, radiological, microbiological features and treatment response of patients with invasive aspergillosis that occurred despite posaconazole prophylaxis were analyzed. Diagnostic accuracy of serum galactomannan assay according to posaconazole plasma concentrations has been performed. A total of 288 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, treated by induction chemotherapy, who received posaconazole prophylaxis for more than five days were included in the present study.

However, the comprehensive mechanisms of the underlying pathogenesis of T-PLL are unknown. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the pathogenesis of T-PLL based on a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between T-PLL blood cell samples and normal peripheral blood cell samples were investigated using the GSE5788 Affymetrix microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. To investigate the functional changes associated with tumor progression, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were used on the identified DEGs, followed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) and sub-PPI analysis. Transcription factors and tumor-associated genes (TAGs) were investigated further. The results identified 84 upregulated genes and 354 downregulated genes in T-PLL samples when compared with healthy samples. These DEGs featured in various functions including cell death and various pathways including apoptosis. The functional analysis of DEGs revealed 17 dysregulated transcription factors and 37 dysregulated TAGs. Furthermore, the PPI network analysis based on node degree (a network topology attribute) identified 61 genes, including the core downregulated gene of the sub-PPI network, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3; degree, 13) and the core upregulated gene, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1; degree, 5), that may have important associations with the progression of T-PLL. Alterations to cell functions, including cell death, and pathways, including apoptosis, may contribute to the process of T-PLL. Candidate genes identified in the present study, including STAT3 and IRS1, should be targets for additional studies.",,"['Shi, Zhangzhen', 'Yu, Jing', 'Shao, Hui', 'Cheng, Kailiang', 'Zhai, Jingjie', 'Jiang, Qi', 'Li, Hongjun']","['Shi Z', 'Yu J', 'Shao H', 'Cheng K', 'Zhai J', 'Jiang Q', 'Li H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130033, P.R.

High expression and constitutive activation of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) has been associated with the development of resistance to anticancer drugs in a number of tumor types. The activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) is associated with the occurrence of MDR and MRP1 expression. The present study aimed to investigate the ability of solanine to resensitize the Adriamycin((R)) (ADR)-resistant human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562/ADM to ADR. Results of the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay demonstrated that solanine inhibited K562/ADM cell proliferation. K562/ADM cell sensitivity to ADR was increased following treatment with solanine, indicated by increased intracellular accumulation of ADR. Western blotting demonstrated that treatment with solanine led to reduced MRP1 protein expression, suggesting that solanine-induced ADR accumulation is due to the downregulation of MRP1 expression. Solanine-mediated MRP1 downregulation was observed to be dependent on the JNK signaling pathway.

Here, we report a case of simultaneously developed CLL/SLL with endometrioid-type uterine cancer. Case Report: A 58-year-old woman was admitted to the 2nd Department of Gynecology, Lublin Medical University, Lublin, Poland, in June 2017, where the uterine cancer was diagnosed. After the surgery, pathological examination revealed a uterine moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of endometrioid subtype (subtype I according to Bokhman) deeply infiltrating the myometrium as well as the uterine cervix. Surprisingly, CLL/SLL was subsequently diagnosed in all removed pelvic as well as para-aortic lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical analysis showed CD45 (++), CD20 (+), CD3 (-/+), CD19 (+), CD23 (+), CD5 (+), and CD34 (+). Proliferative activity, assessed by MIB-1 proliferative index immunostaining, reached 18%.

Methods: Our objective was to analyze the anti-D alloimmunization rate in a selected group of women under 55 years of age diagnosed with acute leukemia over an 18-year period. We focused the analysis on RhD-negative patients who received RhD-positive platelet transfusions. Results: From January 1998 to October 2016, 382 women under 55 years were diagnosed with acute leukemia. A total of 56 patients were RhD-negative, and 48 (85.7%) received RhD-positive platelets. The median number of platelet concentrates transfused per patient was 23, and 48% of all platelet transfusions were RhD-positive. The 48 RhD-negative patients received a total of 949 RhD-positive platelet concentrates. Two patients developed anti-D: a 36-year-old woman with M3 acute myeloblastic leukemia and a 52-year-old patient with a secondary acute myeloblastic leukemia.

For decades, the standard of care for AML has been the combination of cytarabine and daunorubicin, typically delivered in combination as ""7 + 3"" induction. In 2017, a liposomal-encapsulated combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine (CPX-351, Vyxeos) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of newly diagnosed tAML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRCs). CPX-351 was designed to deliver a fixed 5:1 molar ratio of cytarabine and daunorubicin, respectively, based on the hypothesis that ratiometric dosing may be more effective than the delivery of either drug at their maximum tolerated dose. In a Phase III trial of older patients with sAML aged 60-75 years, CPX-351 was compared to ""7 + 3"" and was associated with a higher overall survival, event-free survival, and higher rates of complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). These data were the basis for the approval of this new drug for use in the treatment of AML, but questions remain regarding how to best administer this agent across AML subgroups. Future directions include evaluating dose intensification with CPX-351, combining this agent with targeted therapies, and better understanding the mechanism of improved responses in tAML and AML-MRC, two entities that are historically less responsive to cytotoxic agents. In summary, CPX-351 offers an exciting new change to the landscape of AML therapy.",,"['Chen, Evan C', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'Brunner, Andrew M']","['Chen EC', 'Fathi AT', 'Brunner AM']","['Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180612,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2018/06/22 06:00,2018/06/22 06:01,['2018/06/22 06:00'],"['2018/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S141212 [doi]', 'ott-11-3425 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2018 Jun 12;11:3425-3434. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S141212. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CPX-351', 'Vyxeos', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytarabine', 'daunorubicin', 'liposomal', 'liposome']",,,PMC6003284,,"['Disclosure AMB receives research funding to his institution from Celgene, Takeda,', 'and Novartis and served on an advisory board for Celgene.

Although the bovine adaptor protein 3 complex subunit delta-1 (boAP3D1) has been proposed as the potential receptor, the specific ligand-receptor interaction has not yet been completely defined and boAP3D1 receptor and gp51 3D structures have not been determined. This study was thus aimed at a functional annotation of boAP3D1 cellular adaptor protein and BLV gp51 and, proposing a reliable model for gp51-AP3D1 interaction using bioinformatics tools. The boAP3D1 receptor interaction patterns were calculated based on models of boAP3D1 receptor and gp51 complexes' 3D structures, which were constructed using homology techniques and data-driven docking strategy. The results showed that the participation of 6 key amino acids (aa) on gp51 (Asn170, Trp127, His115, Ala97, Ser98 and Glu128) and 4 aa on AP3D1 (Lys925, Asp807, Asp695 and Arg800) was highly probable in the interaction between gp51 and BLVR domains. Three gp51 recombinant peptides were expressed and purified to validate these results: the complete domain (rgp51), the N-terminal portion (rNgp51) and the C-terminal fragment (rCgp51); and binding assays to Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were then carried out with each recombinant. It was found that rNgp51 preferentially bound to MDBK cells, suggesting this domain's functional role during invasion. The rNgp51-MDBK cell interaction was sensitive to trypsin (98% reduction) and chymotrypsin treatment (80% reduction). These results highlighted that the N-terminal portion of gp51 interacted in vitro with the AP3D1 receptor and provides a plausible in silico interaction model.",,"['Corredor, Adriana Patricia', 'Gonzalez, Janneth', 'Baquero, Luis Alfredo', 'Curtidor, Hernando', 'Olaya-Galan, Nury Nathalia', 'Patarroyo, Manuel Alfonso', 'Gutierrez, Maria Fernanda']","['Corredor AP', 'Gonzalez J', 'Baquero LA', 'Curtidor H', 'Olaya-Galan NN', 'Patarroyo MA', 'Gutierrez MF']","['Virology Laboratory, Universidad Javeriana, Bogota DC, Colombia.', 'Nutrition and Biochemistry Department, Science Faculty, Universidad Javeriana, Bogota DC, Colombia.', 'Molecular Biology and Immunology Department, Fundacion Instituto de Inmunologia de Colombia (FIDIC), Bogota DC, Colombia.', 'Molecular Biology and Immunology Department, Fundacion Instituto de Inmunologia de Colombia (FIDIC), Bogota DC, Colombia.', 'Basic Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universidad del Rosario, Bogota DC, Colombia.', 'Virology Laboratory, Universidad Javeriana, Bogota DC, Colombia.', 'PhD Programme in Biomedical and Biological Sciences, Universidad del Rosario, Bogota DC, Colombia.', 'Molecular Biology and Immunology Department, Fundacion Instituto de Inmunologia de Colombia (FIDIC), Bogota DC, Colombia.', 'Basic Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universidad del Rosario, Bogota DC, Colombia.', 'Virology Laboratory, Universidad Javeriana, Bogota DC, Colombia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180621,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex delta Subunits)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Protein Complex delta Subunits/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', '*Computer Simulation', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Thermodynamics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",2018/06/22 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2018/06/22 06:00'],"['2018/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0199397 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-09340 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jun 21;13(6):e0199397. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199397. eCollection 2018.,,,6,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9839-6151', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4282-4951', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4751-2500', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0767-3737']",PMC6013181,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The three PIM kinase isozymes (PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3) share similar downstream substrates with other key oncogenic kinases and have differing but mutually compensatory functions across tumors. This supports the therapeutic potential of pan-PIM kinase inhibitors, especially in combination with other anticancer agents chosen based on their role in overlapping signaling networks. Reported here is a preclinical characterization of INCB053914, a novel, potent, and selective adenosine triphosphate-competitive pan-PIM kinase inhibitor. In vitro, INCB053914 inhibited proliferation and the phosphorylation of downstream substrates in cell lines from multiple hematologic malignancies. Effects were confirmed in primary bone marrow blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated ex vivo and in blood samples from patients receiving INCB053914 in an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study. In vivo, single-agent INCB053914 inhibited Bcl-2-associated death promoter protein phosphorylation and dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth in acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma xenografts. Additive or synergistic inhibition of tumor growth was observed when INCB053914 was combined with selective PI3Kdelta inhibition, selective JAK1 or JAK1/2 inhibition, or cytarabine.

29927566,,Publisher,,,,,1993,ANKRD26-Related Thrombocytopenia,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia is characterized by lifelong mild-to-moderate thrombocytopenia with a normal platelet size and no syndromic associations. Most individuals have normal hemostasis or a mild bleeding phenotype and do not develop severe spontaneous bleeding. Some individuals may have concomitant erythrocytosis and leukocytosis. The risk for myeloid malignancies (including myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia) is increased in individuals with ANKRD26 pathogenic variants. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia is established in a proband by the presence of lifelong thrombocytopenia and identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ANKRD26 on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Adjunct hemostatic agents (e.g., antifibrinolytics, desmopressin) for bleeding or a major surgical procedure; platelet transfusions are reserved for severe bleeding or procedures with a high bleeding risk. Prevention of secondary complications: For individuals with a myeloid neoplasm, careful consideration of stem cell transplant eligibility and pre-transplant therapies undertaken through a large academic institution with experience in the management of individuals with germline predisposition syndromes. Surveillance: Surveillance for early detection of myeloid neoplasms should include an annual complete blood count with bone marrow examination if abnormalities are noted. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual by evaluation of the platelet count and molecular genetic testing of the ANKRD26 pathogenic variant in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who may benefit from surveillance. GENETIC COUNSELING: ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. All individuals reported to date have an affected parent. Each child of an individual with ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia has a 50% chance of inheriting the ANKRD26 pathogenic variant. Once the ANKRD26 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible; however, phenotypic variability (due to variable expressivity) within families is observed.","['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

Many ZIP8 regulated downstream signals and pathways remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated ZIP8 regulatory roles in downstream targets in ZIP8-gain and loss cells and in ZIP8 overexpressed lungs. Our results show that the overexpression of ZIP8 in mouse fibroblast cells (MEF) induces significant morphological change and re-organization of filament actin (F-actin), along with increased cell proliferation and migration rate. In ZIP8 knockout chronic myelogenous leukemia HAP1 cells, significant clonal morphological change with increased cell-cell adhesion was observed. In the ZIP8 overexpressed lung, F-actin was aberrantly enriched around the tracheal branch. In these ZIP8 gain and loss cell lines and ZIP8 transgenic lungs, we identified two relevant transcription factors, NF-kappaB and Snail2, whose activation is dependent on the ZIP8 level. They were both significantly upregulated in ZIP8 overexpressed cells and lungs. Expression of NF-kappaB and Snail2 targets, COL1A2 and E-cadherin, was also correspondingly elevated. Taken together, our results suggest that ZIP8 is a new regulator for cell morphology and cytoskeleton which involves NF-kappaB and Snail2.",,"['Geng, Xiangrong', 'Liu, Liu', 'Banes-Berceli, Amy', 'Yang, Zhouyuan', 'Kang, Pengde', 'Shen, Jian', 'Tsai, Kan-Jen', 'Liu, Zijuan']","['Geng X', 'Liu L', 'Banes-Berceli A', 'Yang Z', 'Kang P', 'Shen J', 'Tsai KJ', 'Liu Z']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Oakland University, 2200 N.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Clinical, morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic examinations of endometrial aspiration pipelle biopsy specimens obtained on days 22-24 of the menstrual cycle from 94 infertile women with endometriosis: 50 women with Stage I-II EGE and 44 women with ovarian endometrioid cysts (OEC). A control group consisted of 54 women with tubal peritoneal factor of infertility (TPFI) and a successful attempt at IVF. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were found to contain a number of endometrial surface epithelial cells containing mature pinopods. The expression levels of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), HOXA-10, glycodelin A, avbeta3 integrin, estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), aromatase in the superficial epithelium, glandular epithelium and endometrial stroma were immunohistochemically revealed. Forty-four patients, including 17 with Stage I-II EGE and 27 with TPFI, showed mRNA expression levels of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), LIF, ER1, PgR, HOXA-10, and PTEN by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a preliminary reverse transcription PCR assay. RESULTS: It was established that in the infertile women with Stage I-II EGE and those with OEC, endometrial receptivity was impaired, which was manifested by a decline in the number of superficial epithelial cells containing mature pinopods, as well as a decrease in the endometrial level of the key receptivity markers: alphavbeta3 integrin, LIF, glycodelin A, and HOXA10 and increases in the synthesis of aromatase and in the imbalance of endometrial stromal expression of ER and PR detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Molecular genetic study showed lower mRNA expression levels of the HOXA-10, LIFR, and PgR genes, which confirms the data obtained by IHC.",,"['Paramonova, N B', 'Kogan, E A', 'Kolotovkina, A V', 'Burmenskaya, O V']","['Paramonova NB', 'Kogan EA', 'Kolotovkina AV', 'Burmenskaya OV']","['I.M.

There is a biological level of immune surveillance that is consistent with clinical gingival health and homeostasis. Clinical gingival health may be found in a periodontium that is intact, i.e. without clinical attachment loss or bone loss, and on a reduced periodontium in either a non-periodontitis patient (e.g. in patients with some form of gingival recession or following crown lengthening surgery) or in a patient with a history of periodontitis who is currently periodontally stable. Clinical gingival health can be restored following treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis. However, the treated and stable periodontitis patient with current gingival health remains at increased risk of recurrent periodontitis, and accordingly, must be closely monitored. Two broad categories of gingival diseases include non-dental plaque biofilm-induced gingival diseases and dental plaque-induced gingivitis. Non-dental plaque biofilm-induced gingival diseases include a variety of conditions that are not caused by plaque and usually do not resolve following plaque removal. Such lesions may be manifestations of a systemic condition or may be localized to the oral cavity. Dental plaque-induced gingivitis has a variety of clinical signs and symptoms, and both local predisposing factors and systemic modifying factors can affect its extent, severity, and progression. Dental plaque-induced gingivitis may arise on an intact periodontium or on a reduced periodontium in either a non-periodontitis patient or in a currently stable ""periodontitis patient"" i.e. successfully treated, in whom clinical inflammation has been eliminated (or substantially reduced). A periodontitis patient with gingival inflammation remains a periodontitis patient (Figure 1), and comprehensive risk assessment and management are imperative to ensure early prevention and/or treatment of recurrent/progressive periodontitis. Precision dental medicine defines a patient-centered approach to care, and therefore, creates differences in the way in which a ""case"" of gingival health or gingivitis is defined for clinical practice as opposed to epidemiologically in population prevalence surveys. Thus, case definitions of gingival health and gingivitis are presented for both purposes. While gingival health and gingivitis have many clinical features, case definitions are primarily predicated on presence or absence of bleeding on probing.

A 68-year-old male patient with refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia had received umbilical cord blood transplantation after two courses of induction therapy. Empirical therapy with caspofungin was initiated 5 days before transplantation. Tacrolimus was continuously infused to prevent graft-versus-host disease. A minidose of methotrexate was intravenously administered on days 1 and 3 post-transplantation, which was changed to prednisolone from day 7 due to severe mucositis. During a recurrence of fever on day 11, blood cultures were found to be positive for a yeast-like organism, which was later confirmed by mass spectrometry to be G. capitatum. The serum levels of beta-D-glucan were elevated to 747 pg/mL. Caspofungin was switched to liposomal amphotericin B; however, radiological findings revealed pulmonary, splenic, and central nervous system involvement. Progressive renal and hepatic dysfunction subsequently developed. The patient died on day 25 post-transplantation secondary to the development of hemophagocytic syndrome and respiratory failure. We emphasize that recurrent febrile episodes, prolonged neutropenia, and underlying gastrointestinal mucosal damage require extreme caution due to the possibility of breakthrough infection caused by new fungal pathogens during empirical therapy with caspofungin.",,"['Oya, Shuki', 'Muta, Tsuyoshi']","['Oya S', 'Muta T']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Japan Community Healthcare Organization Kyushu Hospital, Kitakyushu, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Japan Community Healthcare Organization Kyushu Hospital, Kitakyushu, Japan. muta0621@gmail.com.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan. muta0621@gmail.com.', 'Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, 1-9-6 Chiyoda, Naka-ku, Hiroshima, 730-8619, Japan. muta0621@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180620,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', ""0 (Gram's stain)"", '0 (Phenazines)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)', 'J4Z741D6O5 (Gentian Violet)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Culture', 'Caspofungin/*therapeutic use', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gentian Violet', '*Geotrichum/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Microscopy', 'Mycoses/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Phenazines', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis/therapy']",2018/06/22 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/06/22 06:00'],"['2018/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-018-2481-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-018-2481-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2018 Nov;108(5):558-563. doi: 10.1007/s12185-018-2481-8.

A population of stem-like cells has been reported to possess the ability of self-renewal, invasion, metastasis, and engraftment of distant tissues. This unique cell subpopulation has been designated as cancer stem cells (CSC). CSC were first identified in leukemia, and the contributions of CSC to cancer progression have been reported in many different types of cancers. The cancer stem cell hypothesis attempts to explain tumor cell heterogeneity based on the existence of stem cell-like cells within solid tumors. The elimination of CSC is challenging for most human cancer types due to their heightened genetic instability and increased drug resistance. To combat these inherent abilities of CSC, multi-pronged strategies aimed at multiple aspects of CSC biology are increasingly being recognized as essential for a cure. One of the most challenging aspects of cancer biology is overcoming the chemotherapeutic resistance in CSC. Here, we provide an overview of autotaxin (ATX), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and their signaling pathways in CSC. Increasing evidence supports the role of ATX and LPA in cancer progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Several studies have demonstrated the ATX-LPA axis signaling in different cancers. This lipid mediator regulatory system is a novel potential therapeutic target in CSC. In this review, we summarize the evidence linking ATX-LPA signaling to CSC and its impact on cancer progression and metastasis. We also provide evidence for the efficacy of cancer therapy involving the pharmacological inhibition of this signaling pathway.",,"['Lee, Dongjun', 'Suh, Dong-Soo', 'Lee, Sue Chin', 'Tigyi, Gabor J', 'Kim, Jae Ho']","['Lee D', 'Suh DS', 'Lee SC', 'Tigyi GJ', 'Kim JH']","['Department of Medical Science, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan, 50612, Gyeongsangnam-do, Republic of Korea. jhkimst@pusan.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['I01 BX001187/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 AI080405/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092160/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.39 (alkylglycerophosphoethanolamine phosphodiesterase)', 'PG6M3969SG (lysophosphatidic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Lysophospholipids/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/*metabolism']",2018/06/22 06:00,2019/05/09 06:00,['2018/06/22 06:00'],"['2018/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10555-018-9745-x [doi]', '10.1007/s10555-018-9745-x [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2018 Sep;37(2-3):509-518. doi: 10.1007/s10555-018-9745-x.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autotaxin', '*Cancer stem cells', '*Lysophosphatidic acid', '*Lysophosphatidic acid receptor']",2-3,,PMC6309296,['NIHMS986683'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we reassessed this association. The study cohort consisted of all patients with an abnormal karyotype randomized in the EORTC/GIMEMA AML-10 and AML-12 trials. Abnormal karyotypes were classified as no subclones present (cytogenetic abnormality in a single clone), defined subclones present (presence of one to three subclones), and composite karyotypes (CP) (clonal heterogeneity not allowing enumeration of individual subclones). The main endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Among 1291 patients with an abnormal karyotype, 1026 had no subclones, 226 at least 1 subclone, and 39 a CP. Patients with defined subclones had an OS similar to those with no subclones (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-1.26), but CP patients had a shorter OS (HR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.11-2.26). However, in a multivariate Cox model stratified by protocol and adjusted for age, cytogenetic risk group, secondary versus primary AML, and performance status, clonal heterogeneity lost its prognostic importance (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.91-1.32 for defined subclones versus no subclones; HR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.67-1.38 for CP versus no subclones). Also, the impact of having a donor on DFS was similar in the three clonal subgroups. In summary, in patients with cytogenetic abnormality, presence of subclones had no impact on OS. The dismal outcome in patients with a CP was explained by the known predictors of poor prognosis.

We aimed to characterize the immune landscape of the CML BM and predict the current treatment goal of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, molecular remission 4.0 (MR4.0). Using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and automated image analysis, we studied BM tissues of CML patients (n = 56) and controls (n = 14) with a total of 30 immunophenotype markers essential in cancer immunology. CML patients' CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells expressed higher levels of putative exhaustion markers PD1, TIM3, and CTLA4 when compared to control. PD1 expression was higher in BM compared to paired peripheral blood (PB) samples, and decreased during TKI therapy. By combining clinical parameters and immune profiles, low CD4+ T-cell proportion, high proportion of PD1+TIM3-CD8+ T cells, and high PB neutrophil count were most predictive of lower MR4.0 likelihood. Low CD4+ T-cell proportion and high PB neutrophil counts predicted MR4.0 also in a validation cohort (n = 52) analyzed with flow cytometry. In summary, the CML BM is characterized by immune suppression and immune biomarkers predicted MR4.0, thus warranting further testing of immunomodulatory drugs in CML treatment.",,"['Bruck, Oscar', 'Blom, Sami', 'Dufva, Olli', 'Turkki, Riku', 'Chheda, Himanshu', 'Ribeiro, Antonio', 'Kovanen, Panu', 'Aittokallio, Tero', 'Koskenvesa, Perttu', 'Kallioniemi, Olli', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Pellinen, Teijo', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Bruck O', 'Blom S', 'Dufva O', 'Turkki R', 'Chheda H', 'Ribeiro A', 'Kovanen P', 'Aittokallio T', 'Koskenvesa P', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Porkka K', 'Pellinen T', 'Mustjoki S']","['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki and HUSLAB, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Solna, Sweden.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland. satu.mustjoki@helsinki.fi.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. satu.mustjoki@helsinki.fi.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180620,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",2018/06/22 06:00,2019/04/17 06:00,['2018/06/22 06:00'],"['2018/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0175-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0175-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Jul;32(7):1643-1656. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0175-0.

The therapeutic armamentarium against this incurable disease has recently seen a tremendous expansion with the introduction of specific pathway inhibitors and innovative immunotherapy. However, none of these approaches is curative and devoid of side effects. We have used B-cell-specific antibodies conjugated with antigens (AgAbs) of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to efficiently expand memory CD4(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that recognized viral epitopes in 12 treatment-naive patients with CLL. The AgAbs carried fragments from the EBNA3C EBV protein that is recognized by the large majority of the population. All CLL cells pulsed with EBNA3C-AgAbs elicited EBV-specific T cell responses, although the intensity varied across the patient collective. Interestingly, a large proportion of the EBV-specific CD4(+) T cells expressed granzyme B (GrB), perforin, and CD107a, and killed CLL cells loaded with EBV antigens with high efficiency in the large majority of patients. The encouraging results from this preclinical ex vivo study suggest that AgAbs have the potential to redirect immune responses toward CLL cells in a high percentage of patients in vivo and warrant the inception of clinical trials.",,"['Schneidt, Viktor', 'Ilecka, Marta', 'Dreger, Peter', 'van Zyl, Dwain G', 'Fink, Susanne', 'Mautner, Josef', 'Delecluse, Henri-Jacques']","['Schneidt V', 'Ilecka M', 'Dreger P', 'van Zyl DG', 'Fink S', 'Mautner J', 'Delecluse HJ']","['German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Unit F100, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, Heidelberg University, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unit U1074, DKFZ, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Unit F100, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unit U1074, DKFZ, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Unit F100, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, Heidelberg University, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unit U1074, DKFZ, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Unit F100, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unit U1074, DKFZ, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Nierenzentrum Heidelberg, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 81377, Munich, Germany.', ""Children's Hospital Technische Universitat Munchen, 80804, Munich, Germany."", 'DZIF, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Unit F100, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. h.delecluse@dkfz.de.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, Heidelberg University, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. h.delecluse@dkfz.de.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unit U1074, DKFZ, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. h.delecluse@dkfz.de.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. h.delecluse@dkfz.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180620,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (EBNA-3C, epstein-barr virus)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies/*chemistry/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/*immunology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2018/06/22 06:00,2019/05/31 06:00,['2018/06/22 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0160-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0160-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Jan;33(1):88-98. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0160-7.

Here, we used global comparative DNA methylation profiling at CG-rich regions of 27 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples to select a subset of aberrantly methylated CG-rich regions (~400 regions, ~15,000 CpGs) for quantitative DNA methylation profiling in a large cohort of AML patients (n = 196) using MALDI-TOF analysis of bisulfite-treated DNA. Meta-analysis separated a subgroup of CG-rich regions showing highly correlated DNA methylation changes that were marked by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. While the group of non-polycomb group (PcG) target regions displayed methylation patterns that correlated well with molecular and cytogenetic markers, PcG target regions displayed a much weaker association with genetic features. However, the degree of methylation gain across the latter panel showed significant correlation with active DNMT3A levels and with overall survival.

In this study, we explored the role of miR-138 in myeloma bone disease and evaluated the potential of systemically delivered locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified anti-miR-138 oligonucleotides in suppressing myeloma bone disease. We showed that expression of miR-138 was significantly increased in MSCs from MM patients (MM-MSCs) and myeloma cells compared to those from healthy subjects. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-138 resulted in enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MM-MSCs in vitro and increased the number of endosteal osteoblastic lineage cells (OBCs) and bone formation rate in mouse models of myeloma bone disease. RNA sequencing of the OBCs identified TRPS1 and SULF2 as potential miR-138 targets that were de-repressed in anti-miR-138-treated mice.

In human myeloid leukemia, low GFI1 levels correlate with an inferior prognosis. Here, we show that knockdown (KD) of Gfi1 in mice causes a fatal myeloproliferative disease (MPN) that could progress to leukemia after additional mutations. Both KO and KD mice accumulate myeloid cells that show signs of metabolic stress and high levels of reactive oxygen species. However, only KO cells have elevated levels of Lysine 372 methylated p53. This suggests that in contrast to absence of GFI1, KD of GFI1 leads to the accumulation of myeloid cells because sufficient amount of GFI1 is present to impede p53-mediated cell death, leading to a fatal MPN. The combination of myeloid accumulation and the ability to counteract p53 activity under metabolic stress could explain the role of reduced GF1 expression in human myeloid leukemia.",,"['Fraszczak, Jennifer', 'Vadnais, Charles', 'Rashkovan, Marissa', 'Ross, Julie', 'Beauchemin, Hugues', 'Chen, Riyan', 'Grapton, Damien', 'Khandanpour, Cyrus', 'Moroy, Tarik']","['Fraszczak J', 'Vadnais C', 'Rashkovan M', 'Ross J', 'Beauchemin H', 'Chen R', 'Grapton D', 'Khandanpour C', 'Moroy T']","['Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de microbiologie, infectiologie et immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de microbiologie, infectiologie et immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de microbiologie, infectiologie et immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.

Immunoparesis had a greater impact in recent trials: median overall survival (OS) was up to 3 years longer for patients without immunoparesis compared to the old trials, less than 1 year longer. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 39%, 36% and 57% longer for patients with normal IgG, IgA and IgM levels, respectively.

Much of our knowledge of the effects that virus infections have on cells originates from in vitro imaging studies using experimental culture systems consisting of cell lines and primary cells. Recently, intravital microscopy using multi-photon excitation of fluorophores has been applied to observe virus dissemination and pathogenesis in real-time under physiological conditions in living organisms. Critical steps during viral infection and pathogenesis could be studied by direct visualization of fluorescent virus particles, virus-infected cells, and the immune response to viral infection. In this review, I summarize the latest research on in vivo studies of viral infections using multi-photon intravital microscopy (MP-IVM). Initially, the underlying principle of multi-photon microscopy is introduced and experimental challenges during microsurgical animal preparation and fluorescent labeling strategies for intravital imaging are discussed.

However, methods for the unsupervised integration of the resulting heterogeneous data sets are lacking. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi-omics data sets. MOFA infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multi-omics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.",['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Imatinib was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor to be discovered with high specificity for Bcr-Abl protein resulting from t(9, 22)-derived Philadelphia chromosome. Although the specific targeting of that oncoprotein, several Bcr-Abl-dependent and Bcr-Abl-independent mechanisms of resistance to imatinib arose after becoming first-line therapy in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment.Consequently, new specific drugs, namely dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib, were rationally designed and approved for clinic to override resistances. Imatinib fine mechanisms of action had been elucidated to rationally develop those second- and third-generation inhibitors.

When overexpressed in solid cancers, vimentin drives epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and ultimately, metastasis. The effects of its overexpression in AML are unclear. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the TCGA data of 173 AML patients for which complete clinical and expression data were available. In this analysis, we assessed the association between VIM mRNA expression and patient's clinical and molecular characteristics including clinical outcome. RESULTS: VIM overexpression was associated with higher white blood count (< p = 0.0001). Patients with high VIM expression have worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared with patients with low VIM expression (median OS; 7.95 months vs 19.2 months; p = 0.029). After age-stratification, high VIM expression was significantly associated with worse overall survival in older patients (age >/= 60; median OS: 5.4 vs 9.9 months: p = 0.0257) but not in younger patients (age < 60). In stratification analysis according to cytogenetic status, high VIM expression was significantly associated with shorter OS (7.95 vs 24.6 months: p = 0.0102) in cytogenetically normal, but not in cytogenetic abnormal AML.

Here, we focused on the phenotypic and functional characterization of Tregs in CLL patients to improve our understanding of the putative mechanism by which these cells combine immunosuppressive and effector-like properties. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from newly diagnosed CLL patients (n = 25) and healthy volunteers (n = 25). The phenotypic and functional characterization of Tregs and their subsets was assessed by flow cytometry. In vitro analysis of TH1, TH2, TH17 and Tregs cytokines was evaluated by IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-17A and IL-10 secretion assays. The transcriptional profiling of 84 genes panel was evaluated by RT(2) Profiler PCR Array. Statistical analysis was carried out using exact non parametric Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: In all CLL samples, we found a significant increase in the frequency of IL-10-secreting Tregs and Tregs subsets, a significant rise of TH2 IL-4(+) and TH17 IL-17A(+) cells, and a higher percentage of IFN-gamma/IL-10 and IL-4/IL-10 double-releasing CD4(+) T cells. In addition, we also observed the up-regulation of innate immunity genes and the down-regulation of adaptive immunity ones.

Methods: A total of 29 consecutive patients who underwent stereotactic biopsy of brainstem and deep brain lesions between May 2012 and January 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The Cosman-Roberts-Wells (CRW) stereotactic frame was installed under local anesthesia. Thin-layer CT and MRI scanning were performed. Target coordinates were calculated by inputting CT-MRI data into the radionics surgical planning system. The individualized puncture path was designed according to the location of the lesions and the characteristics of the image. Target distributions were as follows: 12 cases of midbrain or pons, 2 cases of internal capsule, 3 cases of thalamus, 12 cases of basal ganglia. The biopsy samples were used for further pathological and/or genetic diagnosis. Results: Twenty-eight of the 29 cases (96.6%) were diagnosed accurately by histopathology and genomic examination following stereotactic biopsy. Pathological results were as follows: 8 cases of lymphoma, 7 cases of glioma, 4 cases of demyelination, 2 cases of germ cell tumor, 2 cases of metastatic tumor, 1 cases of cerebral sparganosis, 1 case of tuberculous granuloma, 1 case of hereditary prion disease, 1 case of glial hyperplasia, 1 case of leukemia. The accurate diagnosis of one case required a combination of histopathology and genomic examination. Undefined diagnosis was still made in 1 cases (3.45%) after biopsy. After biopsy, there were 2 cases (6.9%) with symptomatic slight hemorrhage, 1 case (3.45%) with symptomatic severe hemorrhage, and 1 cass (3.45%) with permanent neurological dysfunction. No one died because of surgery or surgical complications. Conclusions: Stereotactic biopsy is fast, safe and minimally invasive.

However, its downstream molecules are not fully understood yet. Here, we report that NC as STAT3 inhibitor downregulates myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) protein in HSC-3 and HSC-4 human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells and a nude mouse tumor xenograft model. METHODS: This study investigated the effects of NC on Mcl-1 expression in HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells using Western blotting, RT-PCR, and dual-luciferase assay. Immunohistochemistry was employed to evaluate Mcl-1 expression levels in mouse tumor tissues. Construction of Mcl-1 overexpression vector and transient transfection was done to test the apoptosis of HSC-3 cells. RESULTS: Nitidine chloride did not affect either mRNA level or promoter activity of Mcl-1, and the decrease in Mcl-1 protein by NC was caused by lysosome-dependent degradation, but not proteasome-dependent degradation. The overexpression of Mcl-1 protein in OSCC cell lines was sufficient to block the induction of apoptosis. In addition, NC strongly reduced the expression level of Mcl-1 protein compared with other STAT3 inhibitors such as cryptotanshione and S3I-201 in OSCCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that NC triggers apoptosis via lysosome-dependent Mcl-1 protein degradation and could be chosen as a promising chemotherapeutic candidate against human OSCCs.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This study was conducted to gather feedback from AYAs in an effort to generate actionable data for program development. METHODS: The target population included patients aged 13-31 treated for malignancy in one of the following disease sites: central nervous system, leukemia, lymphoma, neuroendocrine, sarcoma, and thyroid. A series of four focus groups was held to identify and describe gaps in care and provide suggestions for program development. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used. Qualitative data were derived from focus group discussion and free-response survey questions, while quantitative data were derived from objective survey questions and electronic medical record data. RESULTS: Across the four focus groups, 24 different AYAs participated, ranging from 8 to 19 individuals per session. Topics discussed included the following: communication, treatment experience, and overall AYA program; finances, work and school, and late effects; relationships, emotions, and spirituality; and body image, infertility, sexuality, risky behavior, and suicide. The results of the analyses corroborated what makes AYAs different from other age groups. The primary theme identified was the unique relationships of AYAs, which can be thought of along a continuum. CONCLUSIONS: Information obtained from these analyses has been used to inform specific projects within the development of the AYA program to address patient-identified gaps. For AYAs, the importance of relationships along a continuum should be considered when developing an AYA program, in addition to potential policy or health service research utilization in the future.",,"['Mobley, Erin M', 'Foster, Kristin J', 'Terry, William W']","['Mobley EM', 'Foster KJ', 'Terry WW']","['1 Department of Health Management and Policy, College of Public Health, University of Iowa , Iowa City, Iowa.', ""2 University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics , Stead Family Children's Hospital, Iowa City, Iowa."", ""2 University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics , Stead Family Children's Hospital, Iowa City, Iowa.""]",['eng'],['P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180620,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Delivery of Health Care/*methods', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Iowa', 'Male', 'Social Support', 'Young Adult']",2018/06/21 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2018/06/21 06:00'],"['2018/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2018.0023 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2018 Oct;7(5):592-603. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2018.0023.

To clarify the correlation of the epidemiological phenomenon of ALV-J with the evolution of envelope protein gp85, 140 strains of ALV-J isolated from chickens with different genetic backgrounds from 1999 to 2013 were compared. The homology of the gp85 protein and genetic genealogical relationships between 140 strains of ALV-J and the prototype strain HPRS-103, as well as between the same ALV-J strains and 8 American isolates, were analyzed and compared. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the variation range of homology of the gp85 protein between the prototype HPRS-103 and ALV-J isolates from different genetic backgrounds and different years. However, genetic pedigree analysis showed that virus strains that isolated from the same type of chickens remained close to each other on the phylogenetic tree, which means that there was a correlation between the genetic background of infected chickens and virus strains. Further analysis of amino acid sequences also found similar results and revealed that unique amino acid sites were formed in chickens with different genetic backgrounds, which proved that ALV-J could adapt to the new host through amino acid variation. Genetic sequence phylogenetic tree analysis was more representative than sequence homology comparisons for assessing ALV-J correlations. These conclusions contributed to the control and prevention of ALV infection. ALV-J is still prevalent in Chinese indigenous chickens, more attentions should be given to fulfill the purification.",,"['Li, Jianliang', 'Meng, Fanfeng', 'Li, Weihua', 'Wang, Yixin', 'Chang, Shuang', 'Zhao, Peng', 'Cui, Zhizhong']","['Li J', 'Meng F', 'Li W', 'Wang Y', 'Chang S', 'Zhao P', 'Cui Z']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center, Qingdao, Shandong, China, 266033.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology and Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Taian, Shandong, China, 271018.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/*physiology', '*Chickens', 'China', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/veterinary', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2018/06/21 06:00,2018/10/31 06:00,['2018/06/21 06:00'],"['2017/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0032-5791(19)30451-1 [pii]', '10.3382/ps/pey241 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2018 Oct 1;97(10):3532-3539. doi: 10.3382/ps/pey241.,,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We subsequently validated a set of eight of these genes in leukemia patients undergoing total-body irradiation. In the current study, we addressed the effect of intra-individual variability on the basal level of expression of those eight radiation-responsive genes identified previously, by examining baseline levels in 200 unexposed healthy human donors (122 males and 88 females with an average age of 46 years) using real-time PCR. In addition to the eight candidate genes ( DAGLA, WNT3, CD177, PLA2G16, WLS, POU2AF1, STAT4 and PRF1), we examined two more genes ( FDXR and DDB2) widely used in ex vivo whole blood experiments. Although significant sex- (seven genes) and age-dependent (two genes) differences in expression were found, the fold changes ranged only between 1.1-1.6. These were well within the twofold differences in gene expression generally considered to represent control values. Age and sex contributed less than 20-30% to the complete inter-individual variance, which is calculated as the fold change between the lowest (reference) and the highest Ct value minimum-maximum fold change (min-max FC). Min-max FCs ranging between 10-17 were observed for most genes; however, for three genes, min-max FCs of complete inter-individual variance were found to be 37.1 ( WNT3), 51.4 ( WLS) and 1,627.8 ( CD177). In addition, to determine whether discrimination between healthy and diseased baboons might be altered by replacing the published gene expression data of the 18 healthy baboons with that of the 200 healthy humans, we employed logistic regression analysis and calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The additional inter-individual variance of the human data set had either no impact or marginal impact on the ROC area, since up to 32-fold change gene expression differences between healthy and diseased baboons were observed.",,"['Agbenyegah, S', 'Abend, M', 'Atkinson, M J', 'Combs, S E', 'Trott, K R', 'Port, M', 'Majewski, M']","['Agbenyegah S', 'Abend M', 'Atkinson MJ', 'Combs SE', 'Trott KR', 'Port M', 'Majewski M']","['a Department of Radiation Oncology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'b Bundeswehr Institute of Radiobiology, Munich, Germany.', 'c Institute of Radiation Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'a Department of Radiation Oncology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'd Institute of Innovative Radiotherapy, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Oberschleissheim, Germany.', 'a Department of Radiation Oncology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'b Bundeswehr Institute of Radiobiology, Munich, Germany.', 'b Bundeswehr Institute of Radiobiology, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180620,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Acute Radiation Syndrome/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Papio/genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Triage', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2018/06/21 06:00,2018/09/22 06:00,['2018/06/21 06:00'],"['2018/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1667/RR15013.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2018 Sep;190(3):226-235. doi: 10.1667/RR15013.1.

Hence, a prospective study, involving 30 paediatric ALL cases, was done to assess the clinical relevance of in vivo apoptosis. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all patients were subjected to annexin V/propidium iodide staining to detect the degree of apoptosis [apoptotic index (AI)] at day 0 and day 35 post-induction chemotherapy. In addition, Bax and Bcl2 apoptotic protein expressions were studied at day 0 and their relative fluorescence mean intensity (RFMI) ratios were calculated. Results: Mean age of patients was 5.1 years. Of the 30 cases, 21 (70%) were at standard-risk, five (17%) at intermediate and four (13%) at high risk. Majority (83%) were B-ALL. Day 8 absolute blast count was >1000/mul in seven (23%) and <1000/mul in 23 of 30 (77%) cases. Day 35 marrow was M1 in 23 (92%) and M2 in two of 25 (8%) cases. AI at day 0 and day 35 ranged from 0.9 to16.6 per cent and 1.4 to 62.8 per cent with a mean of 5.90 and 19.64 per cent, respectively. The Bax/Bcl2 ratio ranged from 0.2 to 3.5 with a mean of 0.83. The ratio was predominantly anti-apoptotic, i.e. <1 (77%). A significant association was noted between low AI at day 0 and high total leucocyte count (P=0.02), T-cell phenotype (P=0.043) and high-risk as per NCI category (P=0.025). Significant increase (>30%) in day 35 AI was seen in only six cases. Interpretation & conclusions: Our study showed that low AI at day 0 was associated with a high-risk clinical phenotype in paediatric ALL. However, studies on larger group, especially with longer follow up or study of relapse cases, will help draw conclusions regarding apoptosis assessment in paediatric ALL.",,"['Singh, Ankita', 'Bhatia, Prateek', 'Trehan, Amita', 'Bansal, Deepak', 'Singh, Ajit', 'Bhatia, Alka']","['Singh A', 'Bhatia P', 'Trehan A', 'Bansal D', 'Singh A', 'Bhatia A']","['Department of Paediatrics, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Unit, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Unit, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Unit, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Unit, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', '*Phenotype', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",2018/06/21 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/06/21 06:00'],"['2018/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJMedRes_2018_147_3_248_234609 [pii]', '10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_303_16 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2018 Mar;147(3):248-255. doi: 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_303_16.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*Bax/Bcl2 ratio', '*apoptotic index', '*paediatric', '*ratio', '*spontaneous apoptosis', '*treatment']",3,,PMC6022376,,['None'],,['Indian J Med Res. 2018 Mar;147(3):225-227.

Morbidity due to autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) can be substantial; in addition, infection risk increases and pre-existing infections might deteriorate due to immunosuppressive medication. In the aging population, CLL occurs more frequently and AIC related to CLL represent a growing clinical challenge. Areas covered: This review summarizes current knowledge on pathophysiological mechanisms involved in AIC development and their prognostic significance. It provides diagnostic criteria and a treatment guideline for daily clinical practice, which includes the role of novel targeted agents. Expert commentary: The pathophysiology of AIC involves loss of self-tolerance, antigen presentation by malignant CLL cells, and autoantibody production through aberrant T- and B-cell function. The value of detecting autoantibodies via the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is disputable, since a positive test does not imply overt hemolysis. Importantly, AIC should be distinguished from infiltrative cytopenias, because of prognostic and therapeutic consequences. Compared to chemotherapy, triggering AIC by targeted therapies is less common and, hence, these agents may be valuable as treatment for CLL-related immune cytopenias.",,"['De Back, Tim R', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Tonino, Sanne H']","['De Back TR', 'Kater AP', 'Tonino SH']","['a Department of Hematology and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center (LYMMCARE) , Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'a Department of Hematology and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center (LYMMCARE) , Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'a Department of Hematology and Lymphoma and Myeloma Center (LYMMCARE) , Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180714,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Biomarkers', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Pancytopenia/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",2018/06/21 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2018/06/21 06:00'],"['2018/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2018.1489720 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2018 Aug;11(8):613-624. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2018.1489720.

This study quantified real-world rates and economic burden of these events among relapsed Ph- B-cell ALL patients in the United States. METHODS: Adults with relapsed Ph- B-cell ALL during 1 April 2009-31 October 2016 were selected from MarketScan(R) healthcare claims databases. Outcomes included proportions of patients with AESIs and AESI-related costs during 100 days after relapsed hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 400 relapsed Ph- B-cell ALL patients, 92.5% experienced >/=1 AESI during the median 100-day follow-up, of which 64.6% had infections, 94.6% cytopenia, and 46.2% GI toxicities. Mean (SD; median) AESI-related total cost per patient during follow-up was $197,213 ($308,551; $105,731), with a mean of 2 AESI-related hospitalizations comprising 32.2 inpatient days. Mean (SD; median) healthcare costs were highest for infections ($164,461 [$347,083; $64,528]), followed by cytopenia ($125,210 [$165,141; $67,475]) and GI events ($11,652 [$40,231; $1349]).

EGFL7 plays a vital role in controlling vascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the main signaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulating evidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulating tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has been frequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma, colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression of miR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role in oncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in both the osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activities via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of its angiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, such as ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hong, Guoju', 'Kuek, Vincent', 'Shi, Jiaxi', 'Zhou, Lin', 'Han, Xiaorui', 'He, Wei', 'Tickner, Jennifer', 'Qiu, Heng', 'Wei, Qiushi', 'Xu, Jiake']","['Hong G', 'Kuek V', 'Shi J', 'Zhou L', 'Han X', 'He W', 'Tickner J', 'Qiu H', 'Wei Q', 'Xu J']","['National Key Discipline and Orthopedic Laboratory, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'First Clinical College, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', ""Department of Radiography, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, The Second Affiliated Hospital of South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", 'National Key Discipline and Orthopedic Laboratory, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Orthopedic Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'National Key Discipline and Orthopedic Laboratory, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Orthopedic Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'National Key Discipline and Orthopedic Laboratory, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180619,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGF Family of Proteins)', '0 (EGFL7 protein, human)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (MIRN126 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Bone and Bones/metabolism/pathology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'EGF Family of Proteins', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*genetics', 'Fractures, Bone/genetics/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*genetics/pathology', 'Osteonecrosis/genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",2018/06/21 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/06/21 06:00'],"['2018/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26792 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Nov;233(11):8526-8537. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26792.

The contribution of both loci to ALL risk and underlying functional variants remain to be elucidated. We carried out single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) imputation across chromosome 10p12.31-12.2 in Latino and non-Latino white ALL cases and controls from two independent California childhood leukemia studies, and additional Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging study controls. Ethnicity-stratified association analyses were performed using logistic regression, with meta-analysis including 3,133 cases (1,949 Latino, 1,184 non-Latino white) and 12,135 controls (8,584 Latino, 3,551 non-Latino white). SNP associations were identified at both BMI1 and PIP4K2A. After adjusting for the lead PIP4K2A SNP, genome-wide significant associations remained at BMI1, and vice-versa (pmeta < 10(-10) ), supporting independent effects. Lead SNPs differed by ethnicity at both peaks. We sought functional variants in tight linkage disequilibrium with both the lead Latino SNP among Admixed Americans and lead non-Latino white SNP among Europeans. This pinpointed rs11591377 (pmeta = 2.1 x 10(-10) ) upstream of BMI1, residing within a hematopoietic stem cell enhancer of BMI1, and which showed significant preferential binding of the risk allele to MYBL2 (p = 1.73 x 10(-5) ) and p300 (p = 1.55 x 10(-3) ) transcription factors using binomial tests on ChIP-Seq data from a SNP heterozygote. At PIP4K2A, we identified rs4748812 (pmeta = 1.3 x 10(-15) ), which alters a RUNX1 binding motif and demonstrated chromosomal looping to the PIP4K2A promoter. Fine-mapping chromosome 10p12 in a multi-ethnic ALL GWAS confirmed independent associations and identified putative functional variants upstream of BMI1 and at PIP4K2A.",['(c) 2018 UICC.'],"['de

Previous studies showed that low vitamin D levels were associated with an increased inflammatory mucosal state and impaired mucosal tissue barriers. We examined the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and studied the association between vitamin D levels and methotrexate (MTX)-induced oral mucositis in pediatric ALL. METHODS: We assessed 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH)2D3) levels in 99 children with ALL before the start of 4 x 5 g/m(2) high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) (T0) and in 81/99 children after discontinuation of HD-MTX (T1). Two cutoff values for vitamin D deficiency exist: 25(OH)D3 levels < 30 and < 50 nmol/L. Oral mucositis was defined as grade >/= 3 according to the National Cancer Institute Criteria. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency occurred in respectively 8% (< 30 nmol/L) and 33% (< 50 nmol/L) of the patients at T0, and more frequently in children > 4 years of age as compared to children between 1 and 4 years of age. A decrease in 25(OH)D3 levels during HD-MTX therapy was associated with developing severe oral mucositis (OR 1.6; 95% CI [1.1-2.4]). 25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 levels at T0 and the change in 24,25(OH)2D3 levels during therapy were not associated with the development of severe oral mucositis. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that vitamin D deficiency occurs frequently in pediatric ALL patients above the age of 4 years. A decrease in 25(OH)D3 levels during MTX therapy was observed in children with ALL that developed severe oral mucositis.",,"['Oosterom, N', 'Dirks, N F', 'Heil, S G', 'de Jonge, R', 'Tissing, W J E', 'Pieters, R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M', 'Heijboer, A C', 'Pluijm, S M F']","['Oosterom N', 'Dirks NF', 'Heil SG', 'de Jonge R', 'Tissing WJE', 'Pieters R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Heijboer AC', 'Pluijm SMF']","['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, P.O. 85090, 3508 AB, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

The expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-2 (TNFR2) on Tregs could be used to identify the maximally suppressive Treg population, and TNF-alpha furtherly promoted the expansion and function of Tregs via TNFR2 in mice. However, the role of TNF-alpha has not been determined in AML patients. In view of high levels of TNF-alpha and Tregs in AML patients, we hypothesized that the increased frequency of Tregs may rely on TNF-alpha-TNFR2 pathway. We investigated the levels of TNFR2(+) Tregs and TNF-alpha secreted by T cells in peripheral blood (PB) of AML by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Our results showed the elevated plasma TNF-alpha in PB of newly diagnosed (ND) AML patients. The production of TNF-alpha by CD4(+) T cells, especially by T helper (Th)17 cells was remarkably higher in ND AML patients than in complete remission (CR) patients and healthy controls. Then, we found that the circulating frequencies of CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs and CD4(+)CD25(high) Tregs in AML patients were elevated compared with those in healthy controls and CR patients. TNFR2 expression was much higher on Tregs in AML patients and was preferentially expressed on CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that, in vitro, the additional TNF-alpha can increase the frequency of Tregs through TNFR2 in both AML patients and healthy controls. Summarily, in AML patients, the abnormally elevated level of TNF-alpha secreted by CD4(+) T especially Th17 cells promoted the higher Tregs frequency via the TNF-alpha-TNFR2 pathway.",,"['Wang, Min', 'Zhang, Chen', 'Tian, Tian', 'Zhang, Teng', 'Wang, Ruiqing', 'Han, Fengjiao', 'Zhong, Chaoqin', 'Hua, Mingqiang', 'Ma, Daoxin']","['Wang M', 'Zhang C', 'Tian T', 'Zhang T', 'Wang R', 'Han F', 'Zhong C', 'Hua M', 'Ma D']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jinan Central Hospital, Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180605,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2018/06/21 06:00,2018/06/21 06:01,['2018/06/21 06:00'],"['2018/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.01274 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Jun 5;9:1274. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01274. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['*T helper cells', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*regulatory T cells', '*tumor necrosis factor receptor-2', '*tumor necrosis factor-alpha']",,,PMC5996048,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that the downregulation of PML rendered HeLa cells more susceptible to infection by enterovirus 71 (EV71), and the overexpression of the PMLIII or PMLIV isoforms inhibited viral protein expression and resulted in viral titers that were 2-3 log units lower than those in the control. Using short interfering RNAs, the downregulation of either the PMLIII or PMLIV isoform increased both viral protein VP1 expression and viral production. The PML repression of EV71 replication was partially mediated by the inhibition of autophagy, and PML deficiency triggered autophagy. Furthermore, the EV71 infection resulted in a reduction in PML independent of the proteasome pathway. Instead, PML degradation was mediated by virus protease 3C(pro). In conclusion, PML contributes to a cellular antiviral effect by inhibiting autophagy, which is countered by a disruption of promyelocytic leukemia protein-nuclear bodies mediated by viral protease 3C(pro).",,"['Chen, Deyan', 'Feng, Chunhong', 'Tian, Xiaoyan', 'Zheng, Nan', 'Wu, Zhiwei']","['Chen D', 'Feng C', 'Tian X', 'Zheng N', 'Wu Z']","['Center for Public Health Research, Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Center for Public Health Research, Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Center for Public Health Research, Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Center for Public Health Research, Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Medical School, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Center for Public Health Research, Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Medical School, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180605,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,"['*Autophagy', 'Enterovirus A, Human/*physiology', 'Enterovirus Infections/*complications/*virology', 'Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*etiology/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Interference', '*Virus Replication']",2018/06/21 06:00,2018/06/21 06:01,['2018/06/21 06:00'],"['2018/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.01268 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Jun 5;9:1268. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01268. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['*3Cpro', '*autophagy', '*enterovirus 71', '*interferon-beta', '*promyelocytic leukemia', '*promyelocytic leukemia protein-nuclear bodies']",,,PMC5996053,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is at least partially driven by the chemo-resistant nature of the leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that sustain the disease, and therefore novel anti-LSC therapies could decrease relapses and improve survival. We performed in silico analysis of highly prognostic human AML LSC gene expression signatures using existing datasets of drug-gene interactions to identify compounds predicted to target LSC gene programs. Filtering against compounds that would inhibit a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene signature resulted in a list of 151 anti-LSC candidates. Using a novel in vitro LSC assay, we screened 84 candidate compounds at multiple doses and confirmed 14 drugs that effectively eliminate human AML LSCs. Three drug families presenting with multiple hits, namely antihistamines (astemizole and terfenadine), cardiac glycosides (strophanthidin, digoxin and ouabain) and glucocorticoids (budesonide, halcinonide and mometasone), were validated for their activity against human primary AML samples.

AA005 is an annonaceous acetogenin mimic that has shown significant cytotoxicity against a variety of cancer cell lines, but its in vivo antitumor effects have not been demonstrated so far, and its anticancer mechanisms remain ambiguous. In this study, we investigated the effects of AA005 on human colon cancer cell lines in vivo. Human colon carcinoma cell line SW620 xenograft nude mice were treated with AA005 (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 21 days. AA005 administration markedly inhibited the tumor growth via promoting nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and inducing AIF-dependent cell death. Subsequent studies in human colon carcinoma cell lines SW620 and RKO in vitro revealed that after the colon cancer cells exposed to AA005, downregulation of a B-cell lymphoma 2 family protein, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), was an early event due to the inhibition of Mcl-1 mRNA level and protein synthesis in a time-dependent manner. Intriguingly, knockdown of Mcl-1 using small interfering RNA markedly accelerated the nuclear translocation of AIF and upregulation of receptor interacting protein-1, and enhanced AA005-mediated lethality, whereas ectopic expression of Mcl-1 substantially attenuated AA005-mediated lethality in the colon cancer cells. Finally, silencing Mcl-1 expression markedly enhanced AA005-induced lethality in SW620 xenograft nude mice, demonstrating a pivotal role of Mcl-1 downregulation in mediating the in vivo antitumor effects of AA005. Taken together, this study demonstrates for the first time the anticancer effects of AA005 against human colon cancer cell lines in vivo, which is mediated through the downregulation of Mcl-1.",,"['Han, Bing', 'Cao, Yu-Xia', 'Li, Zhan-Ming', 'Wu, Zhao-Xia', 'Mao, Yu-Qin', 'Chen, Hui-Ling', 'Yao, Zhu-Jun', 'Wang, Li-Shun']","['Han B', 'Cao YX', 'Li ZM', 'Wu ZX', 'Mao YQ', 'Chen HL', 'Yao ZJ', 'Wang LS']","['Minhang Branch, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Fudan-Minhang Academic Health System, Minhang Hospital, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Jinan Central Hospital, 250013, Jinan, China.', 'Minhang Branch, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Fudan-Minhang Academic Health System, Minhang Hospital, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China.', 'Minhang Branch, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Fudan-Minhang Academic Health System, Minhang Hospital, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China.', 'Minhang Branch, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Fudan-Minhang Academic Health System, Minhang Hospital, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China.', 'Minhang Branch, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Fudan-Minhang Academic Health System, Minhang Hospital, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, 210093, Nanjing, China. sioc-yzj@163.com.', 'Minhang Branch, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China. lishunwang@fudan.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Fudan-Minhang Academic Health System, Minhang Hospital, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 201199, Shanghai, China. lishunwang@fudan.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180619,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (AA005)', '0 (Acetogenins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Alcohols)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Acetogenins/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fatty Alcohols/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lactones/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2018/06/21 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/06/21 06:00'],"['2018/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41401-018-0025-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41401-018-0025-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2019 Feb;40(2):231-242. doi: 10.1038/s41401-018-0025-7.

However, because a small fraction of APL lack translocations of RARA, we focused here on APL cases without RARA translocation to elucidate the molecular etiology of RARA-negative APL. We performed whole-genome sequencing, PCR, and FISH for five APL cases without RARA translocations. Four of five RARA-negative APL cases had translocations involving retinoic acid receptor-beta (RARB) translocations, and TBL1XR1-RARB was identified as an in-frame fusion in three cases; one case had an RARB rearrangement detected by FISH, although the partner gene could not be identified. When transduced in cell lines, TBL1XR1-RARB homodimerized and diminished transcriptional activity for the retinoic acid receptor pathway in a dominant-negative manner. TBL1XR1-RARB enhanced the replating capacity of mouse bone marrow cells and inhibited myeloid maturation of human cord blood cells as PML-RARA did. However, the response of APL with RARB translocation to retinoids was attenuated compared with that of PML-RARA, an observation in line with the clinical resistance of RARB-positive APL to ATRA. Our results demonstrate that the majority of RARA-negative APL have RARB translocations, thereby forming a novel, distinct subgroup of APL. TBL1XR1-RARB as an oncogenic protein exerts effects similar to those of PML-RARA, underpinning the importance of retinoic acid pathway alterations in the pathogenesis of APL.Significance: These findings report a novel and distinct genetic subtype of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by illustrating that the majority of APL without RARA translocations harbor RARB translocations.

We aimed to investigate characteristics of hospitalized children with varicella in Brazil in the prevaccine period and to identify predictors for requiring intensive care treatment. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from May 2011 to April 2014. Patients up to 13 years of age with varicella diagnosis were included. Information was collected through interview and review of medical records. Logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 669 patients were admitted. The median age of subjects was 2.7 years (range 0-14 years) with a predominance of boys (56.6%). The main causes of hospitalization were bacterial complications (77.7%), viral complications (11.4%), and at-risk patients (10.9%). Main bacterial complications were skin infection and pneumonia. Main viral complications were herpes zoster, cerebellitis, and encephalitis. Most at-risk patients used corticosteroids or had a diagnosis of leukemia. At-risk patients were hospitalized earlier (P < .01) and remained hospitalized for longer periods (P = .03). A total of 44 patients (6.6%) were admitted to the ICU, and 5 (0.8%) died of septic shock. Thrombocytopenia was associated with more severe illness in patients with bacterial infections (P = .001).

The evaluation was carried out independently by seven experienced haematologists/haematopathologists who were blinded to the diagnosis. The majority of the dyserythropoietic features listed in the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues were validated, although karyorrhexis was found to be infrequent and lacking in specificity; multinuclearity and megaloblastosis were more often observed but also lacked specificity. Good majority agreement on the identification of dysplastic features was obtained. Despite this, it was demonstrated that a reliable diagnosis of MDS can often not be made on the basis of erythroid morphology alone. Interpretation of dyserythropoiesis must be carried out with full knowledge of other clinicopathological features and with a constant awareness of the other conditions that can be confused with MDS.

Our present study aimed to explore the expression pattern and prognostic value of a newly discovered lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of SNHG5 was determined using Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in bone marrow and plasma obtained from AML patients and healthy controls. The correlation between SNHG5 expression and clinical features were statistically analyzed. The association between SNHG5 expression and overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the prognostic significance of SNHG5 expression. RESULTS: SNHG5 expression levels were consistently higher in the bone marrow and plasma of AML patients than those in the healthy controls (p<0.01). Furthermore, SNHG5 upregulation more frequently occurred in AML patients with advanced FAB classification (p<0.005) and unfavorable cytogenetics (p=0.001). In addition, the data of Kaplan-Meier method revealed that overall patient survival for those with high plasma SNHG5 expression was significantly shorter than those patients with low SNHG5 expression (p<0.0070). Importantly, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis identified increased SNHG5 expression as an independent factor predicting poor prognosis for AML patients.

Enhanced expression or function of ERK1 is important for leukemia. Abnormal down-regulation of microRNA (miR)-143 is correlated with leukemia pathogenesis, indicating possible tumor-suppressing role. Bioinformatics analysis showed the existence of complementary binding sites between miR-143 and ERK1. This study aims to investigate whether the miR-143 plays a role in mediating ERK1 expression and proliferation and apoptosis of leukemia cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dual luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed targeted regulation between miR-143 and ERK1. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure and compare the peripheral miR-143 and ERK1 expression between healthy and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients to analyze the effect of miR-143 and MEK1 on survival and prognosis. Cultured HL-60 cells were treated with miR-143 mimic or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-ERK1, followed by qRT-PCR to measure miR-143 expression. Western blot quantified expression of ERK1 and p-ERK1, flow cytometry measured apoptosis, and EdU staining measured proliferation. RESULTS: MiR-143 targeted and modulated ERK1. APL patients presented lower miR-143 and higher ERK1 in peripheral blood. Those with miR-143 down-regulation displayed worse prognosis than those with high miR-143 expression (chi2 = 5.198, p = 0.039). Patients with ERK1 mRNA low-expression presented better prognosis than those a having higher expression (Log-rank test, chi2 = 5.873, p = 0.028). Transfection of miR-143 mimic or siRNA-ERK1 remarkably suppressed ERK1 and p-ERK1 expression in HL-60 cells, inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-143 down-regulation and ERK1 up-regulation are correlated with APL pathogenesis. Their expression level affected patient's prognosis.

Here, we add to emerging evidence that all six H3K4 methyltransferases play essential roles in the hematopoietic system by showing that conditional mutagenesis of Setd1b in adult mice provoked aberrant homeostasis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Using both ubiquitous and hematopoietic-specific deletion strategies, the loss of Setd1b resulted in peripheral thrombo- and lymphocytopenia, multilineage dysplasia, myeloid-biased extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, and lethality. By transplantation experiments and expression profiling, we determined that Setd1b is autonomously required in the hematopoietic lineages where it regulates key lineage specification components, including Cebpa, Gata1, and Klf1. Altogether, these data imply that the Set1/Trithorax-type epigenetic machinery sustains different aspects of hematopoiesis and constitutes a second framework additional to the transcription factor hierarchy of hematopoietic homeostasis.","['(c) 2018, Schmidt et al.']","['Schmidt, Kerstin', 'Zhang, Qinyu', 'Tasdogan, Alpaslan', 'Petzold, Andreas', 'Dahl, Andreas', 'Arneth, Borros M', 'Slany, Robert', 'Fehling, Hans Jorg', 'Kranz, Andrea', 'Stewart, Adrian Francis', 'Anastassiadis, Konstantinos']","['Schmidt K', 'Zhang Q', 'Tasdogan A', 'Petzold A', 'Dahl A', 'Arneth BM', 'Slany R', 'Fehling HJ', 'Kranz A', 'Stewart AF', 'Anastassiadis K']","['Stem Cell Engineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Deep Sequencing Group, DFG - Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Deep Sequencing Group, DFG - Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiochemistry, Molecular Diagnostics, Hospital of the Universities Giessen and Marburg, Giessen, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics, Friedrich Alexander Universitat Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Stem Cell Engineering, Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180619,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, mouse)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/deficiency/*genetics', 'Homeostasis/*genetics', 'Isoenzymes/deficiency/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphopenia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/deficiency/*genetics', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Thrombocytopenia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2018/06/20 06:00,2019/04/09 06:00,['2018/06/20 06:00'],"['2017/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.27157 [doi]', '27157 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2018 Jun 19;7. pii: 27157. doi: 10.7554/eLife.27157.,['NOTNLM'],"['*H3K4 methylation', '*Setd1b', '*conditional mutagenesis', '*developmental biology', '*hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells', '*mouse', '*regenerative medicine', '*stem cells']",,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9596-4026', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9793-0970', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2028-9759', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7481-0220', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4754-1707', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9814-0559']",PMC6025962,,"['KS, QZ, AT, AP, AD, BA, RS, HF, AK, AS, KA No competing interests declared']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Silencing of SOCS1 expression as a result of promoter methylation is associated with occurrence and development of solid tumors such as liver, cervical and pancreatic cancer. However, the association between SOCS1 gene methylation and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been well explored. In the present study, we examined whether gene expression and methylation status of SOCS1 was altered in AML, and whether this was related to disease occurrence and development. To assess this hypothesis, we analyzed SOCS1 in four groups of AML patients: i) Initial treatment group (IT); ii) relapsed/refractory group (RR); iii) remission group (RE); and iv) normal control group (NC). We also used leukemia cell lines U937 and THP1 to study the underlying molecular mechanism of SOCS1 in AML, mainly the JAK2/STAT pathway. We used several techniques such as quantitative PCR (qPCR), methylationspecific PCR (MSPCR), western blotting, flow cytometry and cell transfection techniques to analyze the expression and methylation status of SOCS1. We found that the SOCS1 gene methylation rate in the IT and RR groups was significantly higher than that in the RR and NC groups (48, 80 vs. 0 and 0%, respectively). Furthermore, mRNA and protein expression was significantly lower in the IT and RR groups when compared to the RE and NC groups. We also found that the JAK2/STAT signaling pathway was negatively affected by SOCS1. SOCS1 gene methylation caused gene silencing of SOCS1 which overcame the suppression of the downstream JAK2/STAT signaling pathway by SOCS1, and promoted the growth and proliferation of AML cells.",,"['Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Yang, Lin', 'Liu, Xiao-Jun', 'Zhan, Ying', 'Pan, Yu-Xia', 'Wang, Xing-Zhe', 'Luo, Jian-Min']","['Zhang XH', 'Yang L', 'Liu XJ', 'Zhan Y', 'Pan YX', 'Wang XZ', 'Luo JM']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050000, P.R.

The recurrence of the disease causes tension and reduces the quality of life for the family, especially for mothers. Religion is an important humanitarian aspect of holistic care that can be very effective in determining the health level of the patient and the family members. The present study aims at investigating the role of religious coping (RCOPE) in the quality of life for mothers of children with recurrent leukemia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of the descriptive-correlational type. Two-hundred mothers with children aging 1-15 years suffering from leukemia were selected using a continuous sampling method. The data were collected using questionnaires eliciting information about personal information, Persian version of the Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer, and RCOPE. The collected data were analyzed in SPSS using descriptive tests and independent samples t-test. Results: The result of examining the relation between life quality and demographic features of mothers showed that education level, income, and occupation had a significant statistical relationship with general quality of life mothers. The results of examining the relationship between quality of life and RCOPE of mothers showed that RCOPE was positively correlated only with the positive coping dimension quality of life (P < 0/001). Negative RCOPE had a significant reverse statistical correlation with general quality of life and all its aspects. Conclusion: The quality of life for the participants in this study was significantly related to RCOPE. Mothers with negative RCOPE faced low scores for quality of life, and religious support can improve their life quality. Further longitudinal studies are required to investigate the effects of establishing support communities.",,"['Khanjari, Sedigheh', 'Damghanifar, Marjan', 'Haqqani, Hamid']","['Khanjari S', 'Damghanifar M', 'Haqqani H']","['Deptartment of Pediatric Nursing, Nursing Care Research Center, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'MS in Pediatric Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'MS in Pediatric Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biostatistics, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,J Family Med Prim Care,Journal of family medicine and primary care,101610082,,,,2018/06/20 06:00,2018/06/20 06:01,['2018/06/20 06:00'],"['2018/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_236_17 [doi]', 'JFMPC-7-213 [pii]']",ppublish,J Family Med Prim Care. 2018 Jan-Feb;7(1):213-219. doi: 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_236_17.,['NOTNLM'],"['Negative religious coping', 'positive religious coping', 'quality of life', 'recurrence leukemia']",1,,PMC5958572,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They represent the second most common form of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and are characterized by heterogeneous clinical, histological, immunological, and molecular features. The most common type is mycosis fungoides and its leukemic variant, Sezary syndrome. Both diseases are considered T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) diseases. Not only the tumor cells but also the tumor microenvironment can promote Th2 differentiation, which is beneficial for the tumor cells because a Th1 environment enhances antitumor immune responses. This Th2-dominant milieu also underlies the infectious susceptibility of the patients. Many components, such as tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and dendritic cells, as well as humoral factors, such as chemokines and cytokines, establish the tumor microenvironment and can modify tumor cell migration and proliferation. Multiagent chemotherapy often induces immunosuppression, resulting in an increased risk of serious infection and poor tolerance. Therefore, overtreatment should be avoided for these types of lymphomas. Interferons have been shown to increase the time to next treatment to a greater degree than has chemotherapy. The pathogenesis and prognosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) differ markedly among the subtypes. In some aggressive subtypes of CTCLs, such as primary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma and primary cutaneous CD8(+) aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be considered, whereas overtreatment should be avoided with other, favorable subtypes. Therefore, a solid understanding of the pathogenesis and immunological background of cutaneous lymphoma is required to better treat patients who are inflicted with this disease.

It was the first therapeutic antibody approved for oncology patients and was the top-selling oncology drug for nearly a decade with sales reaching $8.58 billion in 2016. Since its initial approval in 1997, it has improved outcomes in all B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Despite widespread use, most mechanistic data have been gathered from in vitro studies while the roles of the various response mechanisms in humans are still largely undetermined. Polymorphisms in Fc gamma receptor and complement protein genes have been implicated as potential predictors of differential response to rituximab, but have not yet shown sufficient influence to impact clinical decisions. Unlike most targeted therapies developed today, no known biomarkers to indicate target engagement/tumor response have been identified, aside from reduced tumor burden. The lack of companion biomarkers beyond CD20 itself has made it difficult to predict which patients will respond to any given anti-CD20 antibody. In the past decade, two new anti-CD20 antibodies have been approved: ofatumumab, which binds a distinct epitope of CD20, and obinutuzumab, a mAb derived from rituximab with modifications to the Fc portion and to its glycosylation. Both are fully humanized and have biological activity that is distinct from that of rituximab. In addition to these new anti-CD20 antibodies, another imminent change in targeted lymphoma treatment is the multitude of biosimilars that are becoming available as rituximab's patent expires. While the widespread use of rituximab itself will likely continue, its biosimilars will increase global access to the therapy. This review discusses current research into mechanisms and potential biomarkers of rituximab response, as well as its biosimilars and the newer CD20 binding mAb therapies. Increased ability to assess the effectiveness of rituximab in an individual patient, along with the availability of alternative anti-CD20 antibodies will likely lead to dramatic changes in how we use CD20 antibodies going forward.",,"['Pierpont, Timothy M', 'Limper, Candice B', 'Richards, Kristy L']","['Pierpont TM', 'Limper CB', 'Richards KL']","['Richards Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.', 'Richards Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.', 'Richards Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180604,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2018/06/20 06:00,2018/06/20 06:01,['2018/06/20 06:00'],"['2018/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00163 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Jun 4;8:163. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00163. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'immunotherapy', 'lymphoma', 'monoclonal antibody', 'rituximab']",,,PMC5994406,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IgG Fc glycosylation is known to be partly regulated by genetics and partly by stimuli in the microenvironment of the B cell. Following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and in the presence of (almost) complete donor chimerism, IgG is expected to be produced by, and glycosylated in, B cells of donor origin. We investigated to what extent IgG glycosylation in patients after transplantation is determined by factors of the donor (genetics) or the recipient (environment). Using an IgG subclass-specific liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method, we analyzed the plasma/serum IgG Fc glycosylation profiles of 34 pediatric patients pre-HSCT and at 6 and 12 months post-HSCT and compared these to the profiles of their donors and age-matched healthy controls. Patients treated for hematological malignancies as well as for non-malignant hematological diseases showed after transplantation a lower Fc galactosylation than their donors. Especially for the patients treated for leukemia, the post-HSCT Fc glycosylation profiles were more similar to the pre-HSCT recipient profiles than to profiles of the donors. Pre-HSCT, the leukemia patient group showed as distinctive feature a decrease in sialylation and in hybrid-type glycans as compared to healthy controls, which both normalized after transplantation. Our data suggest that IgG Fc glycosylation in children after HSCT does not directly mimic the donor profile, but is rather determined by persisting environmental factors of the host.",,"['de Haan, Noortje', 'van Tol, Maarten J D', 'Driessen, Gertjan J', 'Wuhrer, Manfred', 'Lankester, Arjan C']","['de Haan N', 'van Tol MJD', 'Driessen GJ', 'Wuhrer M', 'Lankester AC']","['Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section Immunology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Juliana Children's Hospital, Haga Teaching Hospital, The Hague, Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands."", 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section Immunology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180604,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (glycosylated IgG)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glycosylation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology/metabolism', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Tissue Donors']",2018/06/20 06:00,2018/06/20 06:01,['2018/06/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.01238 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Jun 4;9:1238. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01238. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['*N-glycan', '*fragment crystallizable glycosylation', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*immune reconstitution', '*immunoglobulin G']",,,PMC5994695,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed SDF-1 (CXCL-12), a chemokine readily abundant within the bone marrow microenvironment, induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells that express high levels of the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4. However, differentiating osteoblasts found within this niche protect cocultured AML cells from apoptosis. Additionally, this protection was abrogated upon treatment of the differentiating osteoblasts with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). In this study, we begin to characterize and target the molecular mechanisms that mediate this osteoblast protection. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that HDACi treatment of differentiating osteoblasts (mouse MC3T3 osteoblast cell line) reduced expression of multiple genes required for osteoblast differentiation, including genes important for producing mineralized bone matrix. Interestingly, pretreating differentiating osteoblasts with cyclosporine A, a drug known to inhibit osteoblast differentiation, similarly impaired osteoblast-mediated protection of cocultured AML cells (KG1a and U937 human AML cell lines). Both HDACi and cyclosporine A reduced osteoblast expression of the key mineralization enzyme tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP; encoded by Alpl). Moreover, specifically reducing TNAP expression or activity in differentiating osteoblasts significantly impaired the ability of the osteoblasts to protect cocultured AML cells. Together, our results indicate that inhibiting osteoblast matrix mineralization by specifically targeting TNAP is sufficient to significantly impair osteoblast-mediated protection of AML cells. Therefore, designing combination therapies that additionally target the osteoblast-produced mineralized bone matrix may improve treatment of AML by reducing the protection of leukemic cells within the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Copyright (c) 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Sterner, Rosalie M', 'Kremer, Kimberly N', 'Dudakovic, Amel', 'Westendorf, Jennifer J', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Hedin, Karen E']","['Sterner RM', 'Kremer KN', 'Dudakovic A', 'Westendorf JJ', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Hedin KE']","['Mayo Clinic Medical Scientist Training Program, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN 55905.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN 55905.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN 55905.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN 55905; and.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN 55905; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN 55905.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN 55905; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN 55905.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN 55905; hedin.karen@mayo.edu.']",['eng'],"['F32 AR066508/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR049069/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA194217/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180618,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Calcification, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cellular Microenvironment/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2018/06/20 06:00,2019/06/22 06:00,['2018/06/20 06:00'],"['2018/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1800174 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1800174 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Aug 1;201(3):1086-1096. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800174.

It is known that most of the aetiological factors of NPC trigger oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a potent apoptotic inducer. During apoptosis, chromatin cleavage and DNA fragmentation occur. However, cells may undergo DNA repair and survive apoptosis. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway has been known as the primary DNA repair system in human cells. The NHEJ process may repair DNA ends without any homology, although region of microhomology (a few nucleotides) is usually utilised by this DNA repair system. Cells that evade apoptosis via erroneous DNA repair may carry chromosomal aberration. Apoptotic nuclease was found to be associated with nuclear matrix during apoptosis. Matrix association region/scaffold attachment region (MAR/SAR) is the binding site of the chromosomal DNA loop structure to the nuclear matrix. When apoptotic nuclease is associated with nuclear matrix during apoptosis, it potentially cleaves at MAR/SAR. Cells that survive apoptosis via compromised DNA repair may carry chromosome rearrangement contributing to NPC tumourigenesis. The Abelson murine leukaemia (ABL) gene at 9q34 was targeted in this study as 9q34 is a common region of loss in NPC. This study aimed to identify the chromosome breakages and/or rearrangements in the ABL gene in cells undergoing oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. RESULTS: In the present study, in silico prediction of MAR/SAR was performed in the ABL gene. More than 80% of the predicted MAR/SAR sites are closely associated with previously reported patient breakpoint cluster regions (BCR). By using inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR), we demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial and NPC cells led to chromosomal breakages within the ABL BCR that contains a MAR/SAR. Intriguingly, we detected two translocations in H2O2-treated cells. Region of microhomology was found at the translocation junctions. This observation is consistent with the operation of microhomology-mediated NHEJ. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis may participate in chromosome rearrangements of NPC. A revised model for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis mediating chromosome rearrangement in NPC is proposed.",,"['Tan, Sang-Nee', 'Sim, Sai-Peng', 'Khoo, Alan Soo-Beng']","['Tan SN', 'Sim SP', 'Khoo AS']","['Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia. spsim@unimas.my.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['06-065/Ministry of Health, Malaysia/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180618,England,Hum Genomics,Human genomics,101202210,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes/genetics', 'DNA End-Joining Repair/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry', 'Matrix Attachment Regions/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/*genetics', 'Oxidative Stress/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2018/06/20 06:00,2019/01/31 06:00,['2018/06/20 06:00'],"['2018/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40246-018-0160-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s40246-018-0160-8 [pii]']",epublish,Hum Genomics. 2018 Jun 18;12(1):29. doi: 10.1186/s40246-018-0160-8.,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABL', '*Apoptosis', '*H2O2', '*MAR/SAR', '*NPC', '*Oxidative stress']",1,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0256-2803'],PMC6006577,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progressive exhaustion of T cell functions is considered to facilitate disease progression of BLV infection. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) are immunoinhibitory receptors that contribute to T-cell exhaustion caused by BLV infection in cattle. However, it is unclear whether the cooperation of PD-1 and LAG-3 accelerates disease progression of BLV infection. In this study, multi-color flow cytometric analyses of PD-1- and LAG-3-expressing T cells were performed in BLV-infected cattle at different stages of the disease. The frequencies of PD-1(+)LAG-3(+) heavily exhausted T cells among CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was higher in the blood of cattle with B-cell lymphoma over that of BLV-uninfected and BLV-infected cattle without lymphoma. In addition, blockade assays of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were performed to examine whether inhibition of the interactions between PD-1 and LAG-3 and their ligands by blocking antibodies could restore T-cell function during BLV infection. Single or dual blockade of the PD-1 and LAG-3 pathways reactivated the production of Th1 cytokines, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, from BLV-specific T cells of the infected cattle. Taken together, these results indicate that PD-1 and LAG-3 cooperatively mediate the functional exhaustion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and are associated with the development of B-cell lymphoma in BLV-infected cattle.",,"['Okagawa, Tomohiro', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Nishimori, Asami', 'Maekawa, Naoya', 'Goto, Shinya', 'Ikebuchi, Ryoyo', 'Kohara, Junko', 'Suzuki, Yasuhiko', 'Yamada, Shinji', 'Kato, Yukinari', 'Murata, Shiro', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Okagawa T', 'Konnai S', 'Nishimori A', 'Maekawa N', 'Goto S', 'Ikebuchi R', 'Kohara J', 'Suzuki Y', 'Yamada S', 'Kato Y', 'Murata S', 'Ohashi K']","['Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan. konnai@vetmed.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Osaka Ohtani University, Tondabayashi, 584-8540, Japan.', 'Animal Research Center, Agriculture Research Department, Hokkaido Research Organization, Shintoku, 081-0038, Japan.', 'Division of Bioresources, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 001-0020, Japan.', 'Global Station for Zoonosis Control, Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE), Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 001-0020, Japan.', 'Department of Antibody Drug Development, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8575, Japan.', 'Department of Antibody Drug Development, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8575, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.']",['eng'],"['16817557/Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution/International', '26058B/Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180619,England,Vet Res,Veterinary research,9309551,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD223 antigen)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*genetics/metabolism']",2018/06/20 06:00,2018/10/17 06:00,['2018/06/20 06:00'],"['2017/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13567-018-0543-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13567-018-0543-9 [pii]']",epublish,Vet Res. 2018 Jun 19;49(1):50. doi: 10.1186/s13567-018-0543-9.,,,1,,PMC6006750,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chromosomal region includes the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7) gene which has a crucial role in innate immune signaling and was observed to be functionally and prognostically relevant in different cancer entities. Therefore, we correlated the presence of MAP3K7 deletions with clinical parameters in a cohort of 327 pediatric T-ALL patients and investigated the function of MAP3K7 in the T-ALL cell lines CCRF-CEM, Jurkat and MOLT-4. METHODS: MAP3K7 deletions were detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). T-ALL cell lines were transduced with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors expressing anti-MAP3K7 shRNA or a non-silencing shRNA together with a GFP reporter. Transduction efficiency was measured by flow cytometry and depletion efficiency by RT-PCR and Western blots. Induction of apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry after staining with PE-conjugated Annexin V. In order to assess the contribution of NF-kappaB signaling to the effects of MAP3K7 depletion, cells were treated with TNF-alpha and cell lysates analyzed for components of the NF-kappaB pathway by Western blotting and for expression of the NF-kappaB target genes BCL2, CMYC, FAS, PTEN and TNF-alpha by RT-PCR. RESULTS: MAP3K7 is deleted in approximately 10% and point-mutated in approximately 1% of children with T-ALL. In 32 of 33 leukemias the deletion of MAP3K7 also included the adjacent CASP8AP2 gene. MAP3K7 deletions were associated with the occurrence of SIL-TAL1 fusions and a mature immunophenotype, but not with response to treatment and outcome. Depletion of MAP3K7 expression in T-ALL cell lines by shRNAs slowed down proliferation and induced apoptosis, but neither changed protein levels of components of NF-kappaB signaling nor NF-kappaB target gene expression after stimulation with TNF-alpha. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that the recurrent deletion of MAP3K7/CASP8AP2 is associated with SIL-TAL1 fusions and a mature immunophenotype, but not with response to treatment and risk of relapse. Homozygous deletions of MAP3K7 were not observed, and efficient depletion of MAP3K7 interfered with viability of T-ALL cells, indicating that a residual expression of MAP3K7 is indispensable for T-lymphoblasts.",,"['Cordas Dos Santos, David M', 'Eilers, Juliane', 'Sosa Vizcaino, Alfonso', 'Orlova, Elena', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Borner, Kathleen', 'Grimm, Dirk', 'Muckenthaler, Martina U', 'Kulozik, Andreas E', 'Kunz, Joachim B']","['Cordas Dos Santos DM', 'Eilers J', 'Sosa Vizcaino A', 'Orlova E', 'Zimmermann M', 'Stanulla M', 'Schrappe M', 'Borner K', 'Grimm D', 'Muckenthaler MU', 'Kulozik AE', 'Kunz JB']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Pulmonology, Heidelberg University Children's Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany."", 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Pulmonology, Heidelberg University Children's Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany."", 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Pulmonology, Heidelberg University Children's Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Pulmonology, Heidelberg University Children's Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, MH Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, MH Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'BioQuant Center, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'BioQuant Center, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence CellNetworks, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Pulmonology, Heidelberg University Children's Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany."", 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Pulmonology, Heidelberg University Children's Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany."", 'Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Pulmonology, Heidelberg University Children's Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.

It increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Molt4 cells. The use of ROS scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), suppressed both the production of ROS from mitochondria and cell apoptosis that were induced by heteronemin treatment. Heteronemin upregulated talin and phosphorylated talin expression in Molt4 cells but it only upregulated the expression of phosphorylated talin in HEK293 cells. However, pretreatment with NAC reversed these effects. Talin siRNA reversed the activation of pro-apoptotic cleaved caspases 3 and 9. On the other hand, the downstream proteins including FAK and NF-&kappa;B (p65) were not affected. In addition, we confirmed that heteronemin directly modulated phosphorylated talin expression through ROS generation resulting in cell apoptosis, but it did not affect talin/FAK complex. Furthermore, heteronemin interfered with actin microfilament and caused morphology changes. Taken together, these findings suggest that the cytotoxic effect of heteronemin is associated with oxidative stress and induction of phosphorylated talin expression.

However, in several malignancies, no effective antitumor mAbs are yet available. Identifying therapeutic mAbs that recognize common tumor antigens could render the treatment widely applicable. Here, a human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody library was sequentially affinity selected against a panel of human cancer cell lines and an antibody fragment (named MS5) that bound to solid and blood cancer cells was identified. The MS5 scFv was fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain to generate an antibody (MS5-Fc fusion) that induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages. In addition, the MS5-Fc antibody bound to primary leukemia cells and induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In the majority of analyzed cancer cells, the MS5-Fc antibody induced cell surface redistribution of the receptor complexes, but not internalization, thus maximizing the accessibility of the IgG1 Fc domain to immune effector cells. In vitro stability studies showed that the MS5-Fc antibody was stable after 6 d of incubation in human serum, retaining approximately 60% of its initial intact form. After intravenous injections, the antibody localized into tumor tissues and inhibited the growth of 3 different human tumor xenografts (breast, lymphoma, and leukemia). These antitumor effects were associated with tumor infiltration by macrophages and NK cells. In the Ramos B-cell lymphoma xenograft model, the MS5-Fc antibody exhibited a comparable antitumor effect as rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1 mAb. These results indicate that human antibodies with pan-cancer abilities can be generated from phage display libraries, and that the engineered MS5-Fc antibody could be an attractive agent for further clinical investigation.-Sioud, M., Westby, P., Vasovic, V., Floisand, Y., Peng, Q.

We aimed to clarify the regulation of hepatic PCT expression and the cell sources in ALF. METHODS: Human monocytic leukemia line U937 cells were treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-l3-acetate (PMA) (100 ng/ mL) for 24 h to induce activated macrophages. In the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mug/mL), activated macrophages and human hepatocyte line L02 cells were incubated with LPS or co-cultured for 0, 2, 6, and 24 h. In an in vivo experiment, male C57BL/6 mice were challenged with intraperitoneal LPS/D-galactosamine (LPS/D-GalN). Serum liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured using an automatic chemical analyzer. Inflammatory mediators were measured by real-time PCR and liver histology was examined by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: LPS induced the upregulation of PCT mRNA in U937-activated macrophages but not in L02 cells. When co-cultured with L02 cells, the expression of PCT mRNA of activated macrophages was upregulated compared to controls; however, the activated macrophages did not induce the expression of PCT mRNA in L02 cells in the presence of LPS. Moreover, serum liver enzymes (ALT, AST), inflammation, necrosis, and hepatic expression of PCT were significantly elevated in the LPS/D-GalN-challenged ALF mouse model. IHC revealed that PCT expression was co-localized with hepatic macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic PCT expression is upregulated in ALF.

To reduce the economic loss caused by BLV infection, it is important to clarify the characters associated with BLV transmissibility and pathogenesis in cattle. In this study, we focused on viral characters and examined spontaneous mutations in the virus and viral properties by analyses of whole genome sequences and BLV molecular clones derived from cows with and without EBL. Genomic analysis indicated that all 28 strains harbored limited genetic variations but no deletion mutations that allowed classification into three groups (A, B, and C), except for one strain. Some nucleotide/amino acid substitutions were specific to a particular group. On the other hand, these genetic variations were not associated with the host bovine leukocyte antigen-DRB3 allele, which is known to be related to BLV pathogenesis. The viral replication activity in vitro was high, moderate, and low in groups A, B, and C, respectively. In addition, the proviral load, which is related to BLV transmissibility and pathogenesis, was high in cows infected with group A strains and low in those infected with group B/C strains. Therefore, these results suggest that limited genetic variations could affect viral properties relating to BLV transmissibility and pathogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABT-263 upregulated MCL1 protein expression but did not affect its mRNA level and protein stability. Notably, ABT-263 increased 4EBP1 mRNA decay and thus reduced 4EBP1 expression. Overexpression of 4EBP1 abrogated ABT-263-induced MCL1 upregulation. ABT-263-induced activation of IKKalpha/beta-NFkappaB axis elicited autophagy of U937cells, leading to reduced mRNA stability of 4EBP1. Inhibition of the IKKalpha/beta-NFkappaB axis or autophagy mitigated the effect of ABT-263 on 4EBP1 and MCL1 expression. Amsacrine enhanced the cytotoxicity of ABT-263 in human leukemia U937, HL-60, and Jurkat cells because of its inhibitory effect on the IKKalpha/beta-NFkappaB-mediated pathway. Our data indicate that ABT-263 alleviates the inhibitory effect of 4EBP1 on MCL1 protein synthesis through IKKalpha/beta-NFkappaB-mediated induction of autophagy, and suggest a promising strategy to improve anti-leukemia therapy with ABT-263.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Design, Setting, and Subjects: Biospecimens were obtained from 38 patients enrolled in a clinical trial of acupuncture for aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia in postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer survivors. Methods: We used polymerase chain reaction to genotype the rs4680 (Val158Met) and rs4633 (His62His) variants in the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene and rs2369049 (A > G) and rs7158782 (A > G) variants in the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 A gene. Response to acupuncture was defined by 30% reduction in end-of-treatment average pain, measured by the Brief Pain Inventory. We used Fisher exact tests to evaluate associations between genotype and treatment response. Results: Among participants, all six (15.8%) subjects who expressed AA in locus rs4680 responded to acupuncture. In a combined analysis, the 18 (47.4%) subjects with the responder genotype at either rs4680 (AA) or rs2369049 (GG or AG) were significantly more likely to respond to acupuncture than those without (77.8% vs 45.0%, P = 0.039). Conclusions: Specific genetic variations at loci rs4680 and rs2369049 are associated with response to acupuncture-type intervention for management of arthralgia.

We show that NBL2 conserved repeats are close to the centromeres of most acrocentric chromosomes. NBL2 associates with the perinucleolar region and undergoes severe demethylation in a subset of colorectal cancer (CRC). Upon DNA hypomethylation and histone acetylation, NBL2 repeats are transcribed in tumor cell lines and primary CRCs. NBL2 monomers exhibit promoter activity, and are contained within novel, non-polyA antisense lncRNAs, which we designated TNBL (Tumor-associated NBL2 transcript). TNBL is stable throughout the mitotic cycle, and in interphase nuclei preferentially forms a perinucleolar aggregate in the proximity of a subset of NBL2 loci.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Cancer survivors achieved fewer pregnancies across all cancer types, and the chance of achieving a first pregnancy was also lower. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The diagnosis and treatment of cancer in young females may be associated with reduced fertility but the true pregnancy deficit in a population is unknown. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed a retrospective cohort study relating first incident cancer diagnosed between 1981 and 2012 to subsequent pregnancy in all female patients in Scotland aged 39 years or less at cancer diagnosis (n = 23 201). Pregnancies were included up to end of 2014. Females from the exposed group not pregnant before cancer diagnosis (n = 10 271) were compared with general population controls matched for age, deprivation quintile and year of diagnosis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Scottish Cancer Registry records were linked to hospital discharge records to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for pregnancy, standardized for age and year of diagnosis. Linkage to death records was also performed. We also selected women from the exposed group who had not been pregnant prior to their cancer diagnosis who were compared with a matched control group from the general population. Additional analyses were performed for breast cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, leukaemia, cervical cancer and brain/CNS cancers. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Cancer survivors achieved fewer pregnancies: SIR 0.62 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.63). Reduced SIR was observed for all cancer types. The chance of achieving a first pregnancy was also lower, adjusted hazard ratio = 0.57 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.61) for women >5 years after diagnosis, with marked reductions in women with breast, cervical and brain/CNS tumours, and leukaemia. The effect was reduced with more recent treatment period overall and in cervical cancer, breast cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma, but was unchanged for leukaemia or brain/CNS cancers. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in termination was lower after a cancer diagnosis, and the proportion ending in live birth was higher (78.7 vs 75.6%, CI of difference: 1.1, 5.0). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Details of treatments received were not available, so the impact of specific treatment regimens on fertility could not be assessed. Limited duration of follow-up was available for women diagnosed in the most recent time period. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This analysis provides population-based quantification by cancer type of the effect of cancer and its treatment on subsequent pregnancy across the reproductive age range, and how this has changed in recent decades. The demonstration of a reduced chance of pregnancy across all cancer types and the changing impact in some but not other common cancers highlights the need for appropriate fertility counselling of all females of reproductive age at diagnosis.

ES cell culture in vitro has long been the subject of widespread concerns. Classically, mouse ES cells are maintained in serum and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-containing medium. However, under serum/LIF conditions, cells show heterogeneity in morphology and the expression profile of pluripotency-related genes, and are mostly in a metastable state. Moreover, cultured ES cells exhibit global hypermethylation, but naive ES cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) and primordial germ cells (PGCs) are in a state of global hypomethylation. The hypomethylated state of ICM and PGCs is closely associated with their pluripotency. To improve mouse ES cell culture methods, we have recently developed a new method based on the selectively combined utilization of two small-molecule compounds to maintain the DNA hypomethylated and pluripotent state. Here, we present that the co-treatment of vitamin C (Vc) and PD0325901 can erase about 90% of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) at 5 days in mouse ES cells. The generated 5mC content is comparable to that in PGCs. The mechanistic investigation shows that PD0325901 up-regulates Prdm14 expression to suppress Dnmt3b (de novo DNA methyltransferase) and Dnmt3l (the cofactor of Dnmt3b), by reducing de novo 5mC synthesis. Vc facilitates the conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) catalyzed mainly by Tet1 and Tet2, indicating the involvement of both passive and active DNA demethylations. Moreover, under Vc/PD0325901 conditions, mouse ES cells show homogeneous morphology and pluripotent state. Collectively, we propose a novel and chemical-synergy culture method for achieving DNA hypomethylation and maintenance of pluripotency in mouse ES cells. The small-molecule chemical-dependent method overcomes the major shortcomings of serum culture, and holds promise to generate homogeneous ES cells for further clinical applications and researches.",,"['Li, Cuiping', 'Lai, Weiyi', 'Wang, Hailin']","['Li C', 'Lai W', 'Wang H']","['State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.', 'State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.', 'State Key Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences; hlwang@rcees.ac.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20180601,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '86K0J5AK6M (mirdametinib)', '9N3CBB0BIQ (Diphenylamine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Ascorbic Acid/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Diphenylamine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2018/06/19 06:00,2018/08/07 06:00,['2018/06/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/56391 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2018 Jun 1;(136). doi: 10.3791/56391.,,,136,,PMC6101447,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For patients who are not candidates for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, ACT using tumor antigen-experienced polyclonal T cells may be a treatment option. Since leukemic blasts reside in the bone marrow and bone marrow is a preferred site for homeostatic proliferation of cytotoxic memory CD8 T cells, we hypothesized that bone marrow would be a source of activated T cells. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using bone marrow-derived T cells following postinduction chemotherapy for use in adoptive cell transfer. Matched patient samples of bone marrow and peripheral blood-derived T cells expanded ex vivo and displayed similar apoptotic profiles. Before activation and expansion, there was a significant increase in the percentage of bone marrow-derived CD8 T cells expressing activation markers PD1, CD45RO, and CD69 as compared with peripheral blood CD8 T cells. Considering, melanoma-reactive CD8 T cells reside in the subset of PD1CD8 T cells, the bone marrow may be an enriched source leukemic-specific T cells that can be used for ACT.",,"['Palen, Katie', 'Thakar, Monica', 'Johnson, Bryon D', 'Gershan, Jill A']","['Palen K', 'Thakar M', 'Johnson BD', 'Gershan JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', '*Induction Chemotherapy', '*Leukemia/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*immunology']",2018/06/19 06:00,2020/04/15 06:00,['2018/06/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001244 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Nov;41(8):648-652. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001244.,,,8,,PMC6855330,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to clarify functions of uterine HIF using transgenic mouse models. Mice with deletion of Hif2a in the whole uterus (Hif2a-uKO mice) showed infertility due to implantation failure. Supplementation with progesterone (P4) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) restored decidual growth arrest and aberrant position of implantation sites in Hif2a-uKO mice, respectively, but did not rescue pregnancy failure. Histological analyses in Hif2a-uKO mice revealed persistence of the intact luminal epithelium, which blocked direct contact between stroma and embryo, inactivation of PI3K-AKT pathway (embryonic survival signal), and failed embryo invasion. Mice with stromal deletion of Hif2a (Hif2a-sKO mice) showed infertility with impaired embryo invasion and those with epithelial deletion of Hif2a (Hif2a-eKO mice) showed normal fertility, suggesting the importance of stromal HIF2alpha in embryo invasion. This was reflected in reduced expression of membrane type 2 metalloproteinase (MT2-MMP), lysyl oxidase (LOX), VEGF, and adrenomedullin (ADM) in Hif2a-uKO stroma at the attachment site, suggesting that stromal HIF2alpha regulates these mediators to support blastocyst invasion.

However, the role of SAMHD1 in AML development and progression remains unknown. We have reported that SAMHD1 knockout (KO) in the AML-derived THP-1 cells results in enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that SAMHD1 KO in THP-1 cells increased PI3K activity and reduced expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K activity reduced cell proliferation specifically in SAMHD1 KO cells, suggesting that SAMHD1 KO-induced cell proliferation is mediated via enhanced PI3K signaling. However, PI3K inhibition did not significantly affect SAMHD1 KO-reduced apoptosis, implicating the involvement of additional mechanisms. SAMHD1 KO also led to enhanced phosphorylation of p27 at residue T157 and its mis-localization to the cytoplasm. Inhibition of PI3K activity reversed these effects, indicating that SAMHD1 KO-induced changes in p27 phosphorylation and localization is mediated via PI3K-Akt signaling. While SAMHD1 KO significantly enhanced THP-1 cell migration in vitro, SAMHD1 KO attenuated the ability of THP-1 cells to form subcutaneous tumors in xenografted immunodeficient mice. This effect correlated with significantly increased expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in tumors, which may suggest that TNF-alpha-mediated inflammation could account for the decreased tumorigenicity in vivo. Our findings implicate that SAMHD1 can regulate AML cell proliferation via modulation of the PI3K-Akt-p27 signaling axis, and that SAMHD1 may affect tumorigenicity by downregulating inflammation.",,"['Kodigepalli, Karthik M', 'Bonifati, Serena', 'Tirumuru, Nagaraja', 'Wu, Li']","['Kodigepalli KM', 'Bonifati S', 'Tirumuru N', 'Wu L']","['a Center of Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', ""b Center for Cardiovascular Research , Nationwide Children's Hospital Research Institute , Columbus , OH , USA."", 'a Center of Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'a Center of Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'a Center of Retrovirus Research, Department of Veterinary Biosciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'c Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'd Comprehensive Cancer Center , The Ohio State University , Columbus , OH , USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI104483/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI120209/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM128212/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180717,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAMHD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Movement', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2018/06/19 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/06/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384101.2018.1480218 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2018;17(9):1124-1137. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2018.1480218.

These substances can enter and accumulate in multiple tissue matrices in up to 100% of people assessed. Though animal models strongly identify these compounds as male reproductive toxicants, with exposed rodents experiencing declines in sperm count, alterations in hormones, and DNA damage in spermatids, among other adverse outcomes, human studies report conflicting conclusions as to the reproductive toxicity of these chemicals. Using an innovative, human stem-cell-based model of spermatogenesis, we assessed the effects of the PFASs perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and a mixture of PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA for their impacts on human spermatogenesis in vitro under conditions relevant to the general and occupationally exposed populations. Here, we show that PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, and a mixture of PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA do not decrease in vitro germ cell viability, consistent with reports from human studies. These compounds do not affect mitochondrial membrane potential or increase reactive oxygen species generation, and they do not decrease cell viability of spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, or spermatids in vitro under the conditions examined. However, exposure to PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA reduces expression of markers for spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes. While not having direct effects on germ cell viability, these effects suggest the potential for long-term impacts on male fertility through the exhaustion of the spermatogonial stem cell pool and abnormalities in primary spermatocytes.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to determine which variables were associated with MTX toxicity in children, adolescents and young adults with ALL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 35 patients with newly diagnosed ALL, treated according to the 58951 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Children's Leukemia Group (EORTC-CLG) protocol, were prospectively enrolled. Toxicity data was collected objectively after each high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) course. The risk factors of MTX toxicity were determined using multiple linear regression analysis, with age, gender, immunophenotype, risk group, plasma MTX levels, plasma homocysteine (HCY) levels, and MTHFR C677T included as independent variables. RESULTS: Twenty-five (71.4%) patients experienced toxicity on at least 1 course of HD-MTX. In the univariate linear regression, the global toxicity score was associated with a significant rise in plasma HCY concentrations within 48 h after MTX administration (beta = 0.4; R2 = 0.12; p = 0.02). In the multiple regression model, the global toxicity score was significantly associated with a higher MTX plasma levels at 48 h (beta = 0.5; R2 = 0.38; p = 0.001) and CT 677 MTHFR genotype (beta = 0.3; R2 = 0.38; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Routine monitoring of plasma MTX concentrations is essential to detect patients at a high risk of MTX toxicity.

Furthermore, core-shell-shell CdSeTe@CdS@ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were introduced to sensitize the M-TiO2 film, which can efficiently broaden the absorption spectra range, separate and transfer charge carriers, reduce recombination loss, and improve photovoltaic response, with a sensitization shell of CdS and a passivation shell of ZnS. A multisignal-amplified photoelectrochemical platform was fabricated by further modifying this film with a combination of biotin-DEVD-peptide (Biotin-Gly-Asp-Gly-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-Gly-Cys) (which is specifically cleaved by caspase-3) and streptavidin-labeled alkaline phosphatase (SA-ALP). Under the enzymatic catalysis of ALP with the substrate 2-phospho-L-ascorbic acid trisodium salt (AAP), ascorbic acid (AA) was generated as a better electron donor, leading to increased photocurrent output. The activity of caspase-3, which depends on the amount of residual peptide on the electrode, was inversely proportional to the amount of AA. By monitoring the variation of photocurrent caused by AA, caspase-3 activity and the therapeutic effect of nilotinib (a special medicine of chronic myeloid leukemia, CML) were indirectly detected and evaluated. The photoelectrochemical platform can be used as a potential evaluation system for monitoring caspase-3 activity and drug effects.","['(c) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Most domestic house cats differ from free-roaming cats as they are confined indoors and neutered. Indoor neutered cats have reduced activity and hormonal alterations that may result in lower muscle mass and higher body fat percentages vs outdoor intact cats, despite similar body condition scores. METHODS: Twenty-one outdoor intact cats (10 male, 11 female) were selected from a trap-neuter-return program and 16 indoor neutered domestic cats (10 male, six female) were client-owned. Inclusion criteria included an estimated age between 1 and 6 years, complete blood count, biochemistry panel, urinalysis, total thyroxine, feline leukemia virus/feline immunodeficiency virus screening and a body condition score of 4-5/9. RESULTS: Indoor neutered cats had a higher body fat percentage (22.1% [range 17.3-28.2%]) than outdoor intact cats (17.3% [range 10.0-33.6%]; P = 0.002). Indoor neutered male cats had a higher body fat percentage ( P <0.001) than outdoor intact cats. No difference in body fat percentage was observed in female cats ( P = 0.159). Indoor neutered domestic cats had a higher bone mineral density than outdoor intact cats ( P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest indoor confinement and neutering increase body fat percentage and bone mineral density in cats with an ideal body condition score.",,"['Cline, Martha G', 'Witzel, Angela L', 'Moyers, Tamberlyn D', 'Kirk, Claudia A']","['Cline MG', 'Witzel AL', 'Moyers TD', 'Kirk CA']","['Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine, Knoxville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine, Knoxville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine, Knoxville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine, Knoxville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180618,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon/*veterinary', 'Animals', 'Body Composition/*physiology', 'Cats', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Male']",2018/06/19 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2018/06/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1098612X18780872 [doi]'],ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2019 Jun;21(6):459-464. doi: 10.1177/1098612X18780872.

Methods Mesenchymal stem cells from the dental pulp of a deciduous tooth from a 7-year-old donor were separated from the pulp chamber and processed via enzymatic digestion and centrifugation. DPSCs were passaged and cultured on a 35 x 13 mm culture dish in minimum essential medium-alpha, without supplementation. After reaching 80% confluency, 5 x 10(6) allogeneic DPSCs in 250 microl phosphate buffered saline were seeded onto a dry scaffold of lyophilized collagen-polyvinylpyrrolidone sponge placed in the left lower premolar area of a 61-year-old patient with periodontal disease. Surgical access to the lower premolar area was achieved using the flap technique. Results At 3 and 6 months following allogeneic graft, the patient showed no sign of rejection and exhibited decreases in tooth mobility, periodontal pocket depth and bone defect area.

After LNA-anti-miR-182-5p transfection to cells at different time points, miR-182-5p down regulation and CEBPalpha overexpression was revealed in the LNA-anti-miR group compared to the control groups. The cell viability was meaningfully varied between LNA-anti-miR and control groups.

Regulated Notch function is critical for the generation of T-cells, in which abnormal Notch signaling results in leukemia. Notch activation through trans-activation of the receptor by one of its ligands expressed on adjacent cells has been well defined. In this canonical ligand-dependent pathway, Notch receptor undergoes conformational changes upon ligand engagement, stimulated by a pulling-force on the extracellular fragment of Notch that results from endocytosis of the receptor-bound ligand into the ligand-expressing cell. These conformational changes in the receptor allow for two consecutive proteolytic cleavage events to occur, which release the intracellular region of the receptor into the cytoplasm. It can then travel to the nucleus, where it induces gene transcription. However, there is accumulating evidence that other pathways may induce Notch signaling. A ligand-independent mechanism of Notch activation has been described in which receptor processing is initiated via cell-internal signals. These signals result in the internalization of Notch into endosomal compartments, where chemical changes existing in this microenvironment result in the conformational modifications required for receptor processing. This review will present mechanisms underlying both canonical ligand-dependent and non-canonical ligand-independent Notch activation pathways and discuss the latter in the context of Notch signaling in T-cells.",,"['Steinbuck, Martin Peter', 'Winandy, Susan']","['Steinbuck MP', 'Winandy S']","['Immunology Training Program, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Immunology Training Program, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States.']",['eng'],['R21 CA176811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180601,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism']",2018/06/19 06:00,2018/06/19 06:01,['2018/06/19 06:00'],"['2018/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.01230 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Jun 1;9:1230. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01230. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Notch', '*T-cell', '*T-cell receptor', '*endocytosis', '*ligand-independent', '*protein kinase C']",,,PMC5992298,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growing evidence demonstrates that the alteration of the CRL-NEDD8 pathway in some cancers constitutes an attractive target for therapeutic intervention, but the roles of CRL-NEDD8 pathway in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is still unclear. In the present study, we found that ATRA could decrease the expression of NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 (NAE1) and inhibit the neddylation of cullin1 and cullin3 in the APL cell line NB4. Inactivation of cullin neddylation promoted self-degradation of F-box proteins (Skp2, KLHL20, betaTrCP) and up-regulated the protein expression of p27(kip), DEPTOR and DAPK1. MLN4924, a novel inhibitor of NAE1, significantly suppressed cell growth and enhanced apoptosis of APL cells by blocking cullin neddylation and subsequent accumulation of CRL E3 substrates. Furthermore, MLN4924 effectively enhanced ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells by promoting autophagy. Our findings not only provide further insights into the mechanism of the CRL-NEDD8 axis, but also provide a better understanding of this pathway as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in APL.",,"['Liu, Shuyuan', 'Wan, Jinhua', 'Kong, Yunyuan', 'Zhang, Yonglu', 'Wan, Lagen', 'Zhang, Zhanglin']","['Liu S', 'Wan J', 'Kong Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Wan L', 'Zhang Z']","['Department of Clinical laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, China.', 'Department of Clinical laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, China.', 'Department of Clinical laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, China.', 'Department of Clinical laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, China.', 'Department of Clinical laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, China.', 'Department of Clinical laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180403,Australia,Int J Med Sci,International journal of medical sciences,101213954,"['0 (Cullin Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'China', 'Cullin Proteins/*metabolism', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Rabbits', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitins']",2018/06/19 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2018/06/19 06:00'],"['2017/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijms.23782 [doi]', 'ijmsv15p0674 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Med Sci. 2018 Apr 3;15(7):674-681. doi: 10.7150/ijms.23782. eCollection 2018.,['NOTNLM'],"['ATRA', 'CRL-NEDD8', 'MLN4924', 'differentiation', 'neddylation']",7,,PMC6001416,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and Methods: Children below 12 years, receiving chemotherapy for hematological malignancy having oral temperature more than 100 degrees F and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 500/mm(3) were included. The aim of this study was to observe the clinicohematological profile of FN and utility of serum PCT levels in neutropenic patients. PCT was done by two-step two-site electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Serum PCT values were reported as nanogram/ml. Results: Four categories were made based on serum PCT levels which had negative correlation with ANC but no correlation with microbiologically detected infections. Discussion: PCT is generally used to support the diagnosis of bacterial infection or sepsis in the emergency department or to monitor the treatment of sepsis with regard to reviewing antimicrobial treatment. The use of PCT has been well established as a marker for infection in adults and in nonneutropenic children, but similar data are lacking in pediatric population, more so in children with FN in Indian contexts.

Recent study showed that iASPP could impact the proliferation and apoptosis of leukemia cells by interacting with FHL2. However, whether they have prognostic significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unknown. Eighty-four AML patients with FHL2 and iASPP expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were enrolled in the study. Patients with high expressions of FHL2 and iASPP had significantly shorter event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with low expressions (P = 0.005, P = 0.003, respectively). Univariate analysis indicated that high expressions of FHL2 or iASPP were unfavorable for EFS and OS (all P < 0.05), while multivariate analysis confirmed that high FHL2 expression was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS (all P < 0.05). In patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), however, EFS and OS were not significantly different between FHL2 or iASPP high- and low-expression groups. Our results suggested that high expressions of FHL2 and iASPP were poor prognostic factors for AML, but the prognostic effect might be overcome by allo-HSCT.",,"['Cheng, Zhiheng', 'Dai, Yifeng', 'Pang, Yifan', 'Jiao, Yang', 'Zhao, Hongmian', 'Zhang, Zhihui', 'Qin, Tong', 'Hu, Ning', 'Zhang, Yijie', 'Ke, Xiaoyan', 'Chen, Yang', 'Wu, Depei', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Fu, Lin']","['Cheng Z', 'Dai Y', 'Pang Y', 'Jiao Y', 'Zhao H', 'Zhang Z', 'Qin T', 'Hu N', 'Zhang Y', 'Ke X', 'Chen Y', 'Wu D', 'Shi J', 'Fu L']","['Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Laboratory of Environmental Medicine and Developmental Toxicology, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, 515041, China.', 'Laboratory of Environmental Medicine and Developmental Toxicology, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, 515041, China.', 'Immunoendocrinology, Division of Medical Biology, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, 48073, USA.', 'Life Sciences Institute and Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Stomatology, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Respiratory, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics Division and Center for Synthetic & Systems Biology, TNLIST, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215006, China. wudepei@medmail.com.cn.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China. jinlong_301@163.com.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China. jinlong_301@163.com.', 'Department of Medical Big Data, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China. jinlong_301@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215006, China. fulin022@126.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180618,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (FHL2 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (PPP1R13L protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'LIM-Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2018/06/19 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2018/06/19 06:00'],"['2018/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-018-0027-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-018-0027-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2019 Feb;26(1-2):17-25. doi: 10.1038/s41417-018-0027-0.

Because of their unique biology, developing effective methods to eradicate LSCs has been a significant challenge. In the present study, we demonstrate that intrinsic overexpression of the mitochondrial dynamics regulator FIS1 mediates mitophagy activity that is essential for primitive AML cells. Depletion of FIS1 attenuates mitophagy and leads to inactivation of GSK3, myeloid differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and a profound loss of LSC self-renewal potential. Further, we report that the central metabolic stress regulator AMPK is also intrinsically activated in LSC populations and is upstream of FIS1. Inhibition of AMPK signaling recapitulates the biological effect of FIS1 loss. These data suggest a model in which LSCs co-opt AMPK/FIS1-mediated mitophagy as a means to maintain stem cell properties that may be otherwise compromised by the stresses induced by oncogenic transformation.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This combination effect is shown to be general across diverse tumor histologies (melanoma, lung cancer, and leukemia) and driver mutations (mutant BRAF or EGFR, fusion kinases EML4-ALK and BCR-ABL). Caspase-3-mediated degradation of MEK kinases results in sustained pathway inhibition and substantially delayed or eliminated resistance in cancer cells in a manner far superior to combinations with MEK inhibitors.

The choice of suitable non-CD19 target antigens is challenging and a variety of myeloma-associated surface molecules have been under preclinical investigation. Most recent clinical protocols have focused on targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), and early results are promising. The trials differ in receptor constructs, patient selection, dosing strategies and conditioning chemotherapy and will thus pave the way to eventually define the optimal parameters. Other sources for autologous T-cell therapy of MM include affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor-modified cells and marrow infiltrating lymphocytes.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data on 20 patients diagnosed with TBM between January 2000 and January 2017. Demographics, the period from diagnosis of primary malignancy to TBM diagnosis, the period from TBM diagnosis to death, the type and staging of primary malignancy, otologic manifestations, and TBM sites were assessed. After the primary malignancies were divided into solid cancers and hematologic malignancies, each parameter was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The most common primary malignancy with TBM was lung cancer (45%). The most common otologic symptoms and signs were facial palsy (30.5%) and hearing loss (30.5%). The temporal squama (23%) and the facial nerve (20%) were the most commonly involved. Most TBMs occurred late in the disease process after the primary malignancy first metastasized to other organs. Hematologic malignancies metastasized significantly more frequently to the external auditory canal and the middle ear/mastoid compared to solid cancers (P=0.001 and P=0.004, respectively). CONCLUSION: If otologic manifestations such as facial palsy and hearing loss are presented in patients at advanced stages of malignancy, TBM of primary malignancy should be suspected. In addition, hematologic malignancies tend to metastasize to the external auditory canal and the middle ear cleft more commonly than solid cancers do.",,"['Song, Kunho', 'Park, Ki-Wan', 'Heo, Jae-Hyung', 'Song, Ik-Chan', 'Park, Yong-Ho', 'Choi, Jin Woong']","['Song K', 'Park KW', 'Heo JH', 'Song IC', 'Park YH', 'Choi JW']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chungnam National University Hospital, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chungnam National University Hospital, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chungnam National University Hospital, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chungnam National University Hospital, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chungnam National University Hospital, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Chungnam National University'],['Journal Article'],20180619,Korea (South),Clin Exp Otorhinolaryngol,Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology,101474010,,,,2018/06/19 06:00,2018/06/19 06:01,['2018/06/19 06:00'],"['2018/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/19 06:01 [medline]', '2018/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['ceo.2018.00171 [pii]', '10.21053/ceo.2018.00171 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Otorhinolaryngol. 2019 Feb;12(1):27-32. doi: 10.21053/ceo.2018.00171.

Herein, a facile and precise surface-enhanced scattering (SERS) approach based on coupled plasmonic field has been introduced to evaluate the therapeutic outcomes of antileukemia drug through ultrasensitive assay of caspase-3 activity in apoptotic cells. Caspase-3 as an apoptosis indicator could specifically cleave the N-terminus of biotinylated DEVD-peptide (biotin-Gly-Asp-Gly-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-Gly-Cys) immobilized on the Au nanoparticle-decorated TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2/Au NTAs) substrate. After the enzyme cleavage with caspase-3, Raman-labelled Au nanostar (AuNS) probes captured the residual DEVD-peptides via the recognition between streptavidin and biotin, thus resulting in an enhanced Raman response on the SERS platform. The variation of Raman intensity revealed caspase-3 activity that reflected the chemotherapeutic effect. On this platform, AuNS nanoprobes offered a large number of binding sites and intrinsic ""hot spots"" for Raman reporters, while TiO2/Au NTAs rendered a homogenously coupled electromagnetic field between the adjacent repeated units over the large area. In particular, a spatially expanding plasmonic field formed by coupling AuNSs with TiO2/Au NTAs would further heighten Raman enhancement. Taking these advantages, the strong and uniform Raman signals were achieved. Furthermore, the practicability investigation witnessed that the proposed SERS strategy was available to evaluate the therapeutic effect of dasatinib on CML K562 cells. The developed method possesses fascinating advantages of cost-effectiveness, excellent reproducibility and high sensitivity, which endows it with promising potential in apoptosis monitoring and anticancer drug development.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our results revealed that there was no significant difference in the expression level of THRIL lncRNA between AML patients and healthy individuals (p=0.2, 95% CI=-0.129-28.35). In addition, there was no significant association between male subgroup and THRIL expression as well as females (p=0.08, 95% CI=-0.197-19.251, p=0.4, 95% CI=-0.185-12.041, respectively).

We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study assessing outcomes in treatment-naive patients with sAML treated with fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG, n=40) compared with 7+3 (n=66). Median patient age was 63 years (range: 27-82) in the FLAG group and 60 years (range: 21-76) in the 7+3 group (P=0.968). Patients treated with FLAG achieved higher overall response rates (CR+CRi+MLFS) compared to 7+3 (70% vs. 48%, P=0.043). FLAG was well tolerated, with only one induction death (30-day mortality rate, 3% vs. 8%, P=0.405) and no cases of cerebellar toxicity. Duration of neutropenia was significantly shorter with FLAG (median 16 vs. 23days, P<0.001). Half of the FLAG-treated patients proceeded to consolidative therapy compared with only 27% of those who received 7+3 (P=0.022). Overall survival was comparable between groups (8.5 mos, FLAG vs. 9.1 mos, 7+3; P=0.798). Thus, FLAG may represent a low-cost treatment strategy in sAML that produces higher response rates and promising survival outcomes with minimal treatment-related toxicity. Further studies are required to prospectively compare FLAG to the newly FDA-approved CPX-351 in sAML.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the introduction of haploidentical bone marrow transplant (haplo-BMT) into our pediatric BMT program in 2015, 69.2% of recipients have been minorities. Herein, we describe our experience with the first 13 pediatric and young adult patients with hematologic malignancies who have undergone T cell-replete haplo-BMT after myeloablative conditioning (MAC) at our institution. We have previously documented that in experimental haplo-BMT, post-transplant bendamustine (PT-BEN) is at least as effective as post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and elicits superior graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. We report on, for the first time in humans, 4 patients treated with PT-CY and PT-BEN after haplo-BMT as part of our ongoing institutional phase I/II study (NCT02996773). The remaining 9 patients reviewed in this report received PT-CY. Our findings indicate that MAC haplo-BMT is well tolerated by children and young adults with advanced hematologic malignancies with no observed nonrelapse mortality or grades III to IV GVHD. All patients who underwent haplo-BMT remain alive and disease-free with a median follow-up of 15.6 months (range, 1.5 to 31.2). Preliminary findings from our ongoing clinical trial demonstrate that partial substitution of PT-BEN for PT-CY is feasible and safe after haplo-BMT as an immune modulatory strategy to alleviate GVHD and potentially more effectively preserve GVL.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

Although the combination of chemotherapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is now considered the standard of care in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, little is known about the impact of additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs). Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated 1375 adult patients who underwent their first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the TKI era. In this study, 224 patients had ACAs (16.3%). The ACAs that were seen in more than 20 cases (1.5%) were as follows: -7, der(22), der(9), +8, and +X.

In multivariate analyses there were no statistically significant differences in the risk of overall mortality or risk of relapse between the groups with and without ACAs. In the subgroup analyses of specific ACAs, although the presence of +8 was associated with a higher relapse rate in univariate and multivariate analyses, no specific ACA was associated with poor overall survival.

Genetic study using peripheral blood showed no mutations in the KRAS, PTPN11, NRAS, CBL or BCR-ABL genes, but bone marrow analysis revealed a mutation (p-G12S/c.34 G>A) in the KRAS gene. The karyotype was normal. No KRAS mutations were found using molecular analysis of saliva. The diagnosis of RALD was proposed. The differential diagnosis between RALD and JMML is challenging because there are no established criteria to differentiate between them. The clinical course of RALD is uncertain, so long-term follow-up is recommended.",['(c) 2018 British Association of Dermatologists.'],"['Giacaman, A', 'Bauza Alonso, A', 'Salinas Sanz, J A', 'Dapena Diaz, J L', 'Ramos Asensio, R', 'Ferres Ramis, L', 'Duran Pastor, M A', 'Martin-Santiago, A']","['Giacaman A', 'Bauza Alonso A', 'Salinas Sanz JA', 'Dapena Diaz JL', 'Ramos Asensio R', 'Ferres Ramis L', 'Duran Pastor MA', 'Martin-Santiago A']","['Dermatology Department, Hospital Universitari Son Espases, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Dermatology Department, Hospital Universitari Son Espases, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department, Hospital Universitari Son Espases, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', ""Hematology and Oncology Department, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Anatomical Pathology Department, Hospital Universitari Son Espases, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Universitari Son Espases, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitari Son Espases, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.', 'Dermatology Department, Hospital Universitari Son Espases, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180616,England,Clin Exp Dermatol,Clinical and experimental dermatology,7606847,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome/complications/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Mutation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Diseases/*etiology']",2018/06/17 06:00,2019/01/18 06:00,['2018/06/17 06:00'],"['2017/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ced.13668 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Dermatol. 2018 Dec;43(8):913-916. doi: 10.1111/ced.13668.

PMF samples carry several mutations, but their cell origin and hierarchy in regulating the different waves of clonal and aberrant myeloproliferation from the prime HSC compartment is poorly understood. Genotyping of >2000 colonies from CD133+HSC and progenitors from PMF patients confirmed the complex genetic heterogeneity within the neoplastic population. Notably, mutations in chromatin regulators ASXL1 and/or EZH2 were identified as the first genetic lesions, preceding both JAK2-V617F and CALR mutations, and are thus drivers of clonal myelopoiesis in a PMF subset. HSC from PMF patients with double ASXL1/EZH2 mutations exhibited significantly higher engraftment in immunodeficient mice than those from patients without histone modifier mutations. EZH2 mutations correlate with aberrant erythropoiesis in PMF patients, exemplified by impaired maturation and cell cycle arrest of erythroid progenitors.

Natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity, predicted by missing killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) ligands in the recipient that are present in their donor improves outcome of T cell-depleted haploidentical transplants. We explored the role of KIR ligand mismatching in 444 acute leukemia patients after T cell-replete transplants with PTCy. Thirty-seven percent of all patients had KIR ligand mismatching. Patients were in first remission (CR1) (39%), second remission (CR2) (26%), or active disease (35%). Stem cell source was peripheral blood (PBSC, 46%) or bone marrow (54%).

To determine the importance of mutant JAK2 in B-ALL initiation and maintenance, we developed unique genetically engineered mouse models of B-ALL driven by overexpressed Crlf2 and mutant Jak2, recapitulating the genetic aberrations found in human B-ALL.

Sporadic observations reported the co-incidence of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas during treatment of MPN with JAK1/2 inhibitors. We assessed 626 patients with MPN, including 69 with myelofibrosis receiving JAK1/2 inhibitors for lymphoma development. B-cell lymphomas evolved in 4 (5.8%) of 69 patients receiving JAK1/2 inhibition compared with 2 (0.36%) of 557 with conventional treatment (16-fold increased risk). A similar 15-fold increase was observed in an independent cohort of 929 patients with MPN. Considering primary myelofibrosis only (N = 216), 3 lymphomas were observed in 31 inhibitor-treated patients (9.7%) vs 1 (0.54%) of 185 control patients. Lymphomas were of aggressive B-cell type, extranodal, or leukemic with high MYC expression in the absence of JAK2 V617F or other MPN-associated mutations. Median time from initiation of inhibitor therapy to lymphoma diagnosis was 25 months. Clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were already detected in the bone marrow during myelofibrosis in 16.3% of patients. Lymphomas occurring during JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment were preceded by a preexisting B-cell clone in all 3 patients tested. Sequencing verified clonal identity in 2 patients. The effects of JAK1/2 inhibition were mirrored in Stat1(-/-) mice: 16 of 24 mice developed a spontaneous myeloid hyperplasia with the concomitant presence of aberrant B cells. Transplantations of bone marrow from diseased mice unmasked the outgrowth of a malignant B-cell clone evolving into aggressive B-cell leukemia-lymphoma.

Although cure rates for aggressive malignancies have increased, nowhere has progress been more impactful than in the management of typically incurable forms of haematological cancer. Population-based data have shown that 5-year survival for patients with chronic myelogenous and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, indolent B-cell lymphomas, and multiple myeloma has improved markedly. This improvement is a result of substantial changes in disease management strategies in these malignancies. Several haematological malignancies are now chronic diseases that are treated with continuously administered therapies that have unique side-effects over time. In this Commission, an international panel of clinicians, clinical investigators, methodologists, regulators, and patient advocates representing a broad range of academic and clinical cancer expertise examine adverse events in haematological malignancies. The issues pertaining to assessment of adverse events examined here are relevant to a range of malignancies and have been, to date, underexplored in the context of haematology. The aim of this Commission is to improve toxicity assessment in clinical trials in haematological malignancies by critically examining the current process of adverse event assessment, highlighting the need to incorporate patient-reported outcomes, addressing issues unique to stem-cell transplantation and survivorship, appraising challenges in regulatory approval, and evaluating toxicity in real-world patients. We have identified a range of priority issues in these areas and defined potential solutions to challenges associated with adverse event assessment in the current treatment landscape of haematological malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The aims of this study were to investigate the prognostic impact of the FLT3 protein (CD135) expression and its association with FLT3-ITD mutation, and to identify its role in minimal residual disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CD135 was measured by flow cytometry on leukemic blasts of 257 adults with de novo AML. High expression of CD135 >/= 20% was correlated with clinical, laboratory, and other prognostic factors that influenced treatment outcome. FLT3-ITD mutation was tested by PCR. RESULTS: The frequency of CD135 expression was 138 (53.7%) of 257. FLT3-ITD was detected in (21.4%). Positive CD135 expression was associated with high total leukocyte count (P = .006), platelet count (P = .003), monocytic leukemia (P < .001), and CD34 (P = .008) and CD117 (P = .006) expression. CD135 expression >/= 25% was a predictor of FLT3-ITD mutation (P = .03). CD135 overexpression was a negative predictor of complete remission and of postinduction minimal residual disease at days 14 and 28 (P < .001). CD135 had an adverse impact on overall and disease-free survival (68.5% vs. 15%, P = .002). Multivariate analysis indicated CD135 was the sole independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.855-3.345; P < .001). CONCLUSION: CD135 is emerging as a prognostic factor, a new marker for minimal residual disease, and a potential novel therapeutic target of AML.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, studies concerning the effect of DON on fish intestine are scarce. This study explored the effects of DON on intestinal physical barrier in juvenile grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). A total of 1440 juvenile grass carp (12.17+/-0.01g) were fed six diets containing graded levels of DON (27, 318, 636, 922, 1243 and 1515mug/kg diet) for 60 days. This study for the first time documented that DON caused body malformation in fish, and histopathological lesions, oxidative damage, declining antioxidant capacity, cell apoptosis and destruction of tight junctions in the intestine of fish. The results indicated that compared with control group (27mug/kg diet), DON: (1) increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) content, and up-regulated the mRNA levels of Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1: Keap1a but not Keap1b), whereas decreased glutathione (GSH) content and antioxidant enzymes activities, and down-regulated the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes (except GSTR in MI) and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), as well as the protein levels of Nrf2 in fish intestine. (2) up-regulated cysteinyl aspartic acid-protease (caspase) -3, -7, -8, -9, apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax), Fas ligand (FasL) and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) mRNA levels, whereas down-regulated B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) mRNA levels in fish intestine. (3) down-regulated the mRNA levels of ZO-1, ZO-2b, occludin, claudin-c, -f, -7a, -7b, -11 (except claudin-b and claudin-3c), whereas up-regulated the mRNA levels of claudin-12, -15a (not -15b) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in fish intestine.

The N-terminal domain of p12 binds directly to capsid (CA) and stabilises the mature viral core, whereas defects in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of p12 can be rescued by addition of heterologous chromatin binding sequences (CBSs). We and others hypothesised that p12 tethers the pre-integration complex (PIC) to host chromatin ready for integration. Using confocal microscopy, we have observed for the first time that CA localises to mitotic chromatin in infected cells in a p12-dependent manner. GST-tagged p12 alone, however, did not localise to chromatin and mass-spectrometry analysis of its interactions identified only proteins known to bind the p12 region of Gag. Surprisingly, the ability to interact with chromatin was conferred by a single amino acid change, M63I, in the p12 CTD. Interestingly, GST-p12_M63I showed increased phosphorylation in mitosis relative to interphase, which correlated with an increased interaction with mitotic chromatin. Mass-spectrometry analysis of GST-p12_M63I revealed nucleosomal histones as primary interactants. Direct binding of MLV p12_M63I peptides to histones was confirmed by biolayer-interferometry (BLI) assays using highly-avid recombinant poly-nucleosomal arrays. Excitingly, using this method, we also observed binding between MLV p12_WT and nucleosomes. Nucleosome binding was additionally detected with p12 orthologs from feline and gibbon ape leukemia viruses using both pull-down and BLI assays, indicating that this a common feature of gammaretroviral p12 proteins. Importantly, p12 peptides were able to block the binding of the prototypic foamy virus CBS to nucleosomes and vice versa, implying that their docking sites overlap and suggesting a conserved mode of chromatin tethering for different retroviral genera. We propose that p12 is acting in a similar capacity to CPSF6 in HIV-1 infection by facilitating initial chromatin targeting of CA-containing PICs prior to integration.",,"['Wanaguru, Madushi', 'Barry, David J', 'Benton, Donald J', ""O'Reilly, Nicola J"", 'Bishop, Kate N']","['Wanaguru M', 'Barry DJ', 'Benton DJ', ""O'Reilly NJ"", 'Bishop KN']","['Retroviral Replication Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Advanced Light Microscopy Facility, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Structural Biology of Disease Processes Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Peptide Chemistry, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Retroviral Replication Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['FC001042/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'FC001042/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'FC001042/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180615,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Gag protein p12, moloney murine leukemia virus)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capsid/*metabolism', 'Chromatin/chemistry/*metabolism/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Mitosis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Virion/*genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Integration/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']",2018/06/16 06:00,2018/12/20 06:00,['2018/06/16 06:00'],"['2018/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1007117 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-18-00819 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2018 Jun 15;14(6):e1007117. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1007117. eCollection 2018 Jun.,,,6,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2763-5244', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4204-6491', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3991-614X']",PMC6021111,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,['Microb Cell. 2018 Jul 24;5(8):385-388.

METHODS: We evaluated the expression and prognostic significance of Bmi-1 in HCC by using tissue samples and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets. The relationship between miRNAs and Bmi-1 was verified by bioinformatics prediction and immunofluorescence. Colony formation and apoptosis assays were used to reveal the effect of miR-203 on radiosensitivity. RESULTS: The Bmi-1 mRNA and protein were upregulated in HCC tissues. Cox regression multivariate analyses showed that Bmi-1 overexpression was an independent prognostic parameter for HCC patients. The expression level of Bmi-1 was negatively associated with miR-203 levels in HCC tissues. Dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-203 could target the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Bmi-1 directly. Overexpression of miR-203 in HepG2 and Smmc-7721 cells increases their sensitivity to ionizing radiation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the improved cell radiosensitivity induced by miR-203 could be rescued by restoration of Bmi-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Bmi-1 could improve the predictive accuracy for HCC patients' survival. Moreover, miR-203 enhance cell radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo by targeting Bmi-1 in HCC.",,"['Shao, Yingjie', 'Zhang, Dachuan', 'Li, Xiaodong', 'Yang, Jing', 'Chen, Lujun', 'Ning, Zhonghua', 'Xu, Yun', 'Deng, Guohua', 'Tao, Min', 'Zhu, Yibei', 'Jiang, Jingting']","['Shao Y', 'Zhang D', 'Li X', 'Yang J', 'Chen L', 'Ning Z', 'Xu Y', 'Deng G', 'Tao M', 'Zhu Y', 'Jiang J']","['Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Tumor Immunotherapy , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Tumor Immunotherapy , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Institute of Cell Therapy , Soochow University , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Tumor Immunotherapy , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Institute of Cell Therapy , Soochow University , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Tumor Immunotherapy , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Institute of Cell Therapy , Soochow University , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Tumor Immunotherapy , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Institute of Cell Therapy , Soochow University , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Tumor Immunotherapy , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Tumor Immunotherapy , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Institute of Cell Therapy , Soochow University , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Tumor Immunotherapy , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Institute of Cell Therapy , Soochow University , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Institute of Cell Therapy , Soochow University , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Institute of Cell Therapy , Soochow University , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for Tumor Immunotherapy , Changzhou 213003 , China.', 'Institute of Cell Therapy , Soochow University , Changzhou 213003 , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180628,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN203 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hepatectomy', 'Humans', 'Liver/radiation effects/surgery', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Radiation Tolerance/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Up-Regulation']",2018/06/16 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2018/06/16 06:00'],"['2018/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00302 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2018 Aug 6;15(8):3205-3215. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00302.

Iron overload has been recently identified as one of the important conditions complicating the management of these diverse disorders. The accumulation of iron is mainly related to chronic transfusions; however, evidence suggests a possible role for ineffective erythropoiesis and increased intestinal absorption of iron, related to altered hepcidin and growth differentiation factor-15 levels in the development of hemosiderosis in patients with MDS. In addition to its suggested role in the exacerbation of ineffective erythropoiesis, multiple reports have identified a prognostic implication for the development of iron overload in patients with MDS, with an improvement in overall survival after the initiation of iron chelation therapy.

Despite the therapeutic progress mediated by TKI use, off-target effects, treatment-induced drug resistance, and the limited effect of these drugs on CML stem cells (SCs) are major drawbacks frequently resulting in insufficient or unsustainable treatment. Therefore, intense research efforts have focused on development of improved TKIs and alternative treatment strategies to eradicate CML SCs. Alongside efforts to design superior protein inhibitors, the need to overcome the poor therapeutic effect of TKIs on CML SCs has led to a renaissance of antisense strategies, as they are reported as effective in more primitive cell types. Despite the greater drug design flexibility offered by antisense sequence variability and remarkable chemical improvements, antisense drugs exhibit unacceptable levels of off-target effects, precluding them from large-scale clinical testing. Recent advances in antisense drug design have led to a pioneering mRNA recognition concept that may offer a helping hand in eliminating off-target effects, and has potential to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.",['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Serum and bone marrow stromal cell samples were collected from 33 patients with AML admitted to Wuxi Second People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University between September 2011 and August 2016. ACSDKP levels were measured using a highly specific competitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Bone marrow stromal cells were treated with synthetic ACSDKP (10 microM/ml) or different concentrations of POPi S17092 (25, 50 and 100 microg/ml). Cells that received no treatment were used as control. An MTT assay was conducted to measure the proliferation of bone marrow stromal cells. The results demonstrated that serum levels of ACSDKP in patients with AML were significantly higher than those of controls (P<0.05). Following treatment with ACSDKP, cell proliferation was significantly increased compared with untreated cells (P<0.05). However, following treatment with different concentrations of POPi, the expression of ACSDKP was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Furthermore, the proliferation of bone marrow stromal cells was also decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that ACSDKP levels were increased in the serum and bone marrow stromal cells of patients with AML and that ACSDKP promoted the proliferation of bone marrow stromal cells of these patients, which was inhibited by POPi.

At the onset of degeneration, stressed photoreceptors cause retinal glial cells to secrete neuroprotective factors that slow the pace of degeneration. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is one such factor that is required for endogenous neuroprotection. Photoreceptors are known to release signals of cellular stress, called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) early in degeneration, and we hypothesized that receptors for DAMPs or pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play a key role in the induction of LIF and neuroprotective stress responses in retinal glial cells. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a well-established DAMP receptor. In our experiments, activation of TLR2 protected both male and female mice from light damage, while the loss of TLR2 in female mice did not impact photoreceptor survival. In contrast, induction of protective stress responses, microglial phenotype and photoreceptor survival were strongly impacted in male TLR2(-/-) mice. Lastly, using publicly available gene expression data, we show that TLR2 is expressed highly in resting microglia prior to injury, but is also induced in Muller cells in inherited retinal degeneration.",,"['Hooper, Marcus J', 'Wang, Jiangang', 'Browning, Robert', 'Ash, John D']","['Hooper MJ', 'Wang J', 'Browning R', 'Ash JD']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32610, USA. jash@ufl.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 EY016459/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 EY007132/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180614,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Tlr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ependymoglial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neuroglia/metabolism/pathology', '*Neuroprotection', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/metabolism/pathology', 'Retinal Degeneration/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Sex Characteristics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/genetics/*metabolism']",2018/06/16 06:00,2019/10/09 06:00,['2018/06/16 06:00'],"['2018/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-27479-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-27479-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jun 14;8(1):9115. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-27479-x.,,,1,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8330-7301'],PMC6002365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, there are a number of strategies to generate humanized mice and specific protocols, including techniques to optimize the cytokine environment of recipient mice and drug alternatives or complementary to the standard conditioning regimens, that can be significantly modulated. Unfortunately, the high costs related to the use of sophisticated mouse models may limit the application of these models to studies that require an extensive experimental design. Here, using an affordable and convenient method, we demonstrate that the administration of fludarabine (Fludara(TM)) promotes the extensive and rapid engraftment of human normal hematopoiesis in immunodeficient mice. Quantification of human CD45(+) cells in bone marrow revealed approximately a 10(2)-fold increase in mice conditioned with irradiation plus fludarabine. Engrafted cells in the bone marrow included hematopoietic stem cells, as well as myeloid and lymphoid cells. Moreover, this model proved to be sufficient for robust reconstitution of malignant myeloid hematopoiesis, permitting primary acute myeloid leukemia cells to engraft as early as 8 weeks after the transplant. Overall, these results present a novel and affordable model for engraftment of human normal and malignant hematopoiesis in immunodeficient mice.",,"['Pievani, A', 'Michelozzi, I M', 'Rambaldi, B', 'Granata, V', 'Corsi, A', 'Dazzi, F', 'Biondi, A', 'Serafini, M']","['Pievani A', 'Michelozzi IM', 'Rambaldi B', 'Granata V', 'Corsi A', 'Dazzi F', 'Biondi A', 'Serafini M']","['M.

PARP1 is an enzyme involved in posttranslational protein modification and chromatin structure changes. B and T leukemia cells were treated with Notch and PARP inhibitors, alone or in combination, for a prolonged period. The cells did not show cell proliferation arrest or apoptosis. Analysis of gene and protein expression set involved in Notch and PARP pathways revealed increase in JAGGED1 expression after PARP1 inhibition in B cell lines and changes in Ikaros family members in both B and T cell lines after &gamma;-secretase inhibition.

The ETS variant 6 (ETV6)-neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (NTRK3) (EN) chimeric tyrosine kinase is expressed in mesenchymal, epithelial, and hematopoietic cancers and requires the IGF1R axis for transformation. However, current models of IGF1R-mediated EN activation are lacking mechanistic detail. We demonstrate here that IGF-mediated IGF1R stimulation enhances EN tyrosine phosphorylation and that blocking IGF1R activity or decreasing protein levels of the adaptor protein insulin receptor substrate 1/2 (IRS1/2) results in rapid EN degradation. This was observed both in vitro and in vivo in fibroblast and breast epithelial cell line models and in MO91, an EN-expressing human leukemia cell line. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based MS analysis identified the E3 ligase RING-finger protein 123 (Rnf123, more commonly known as KPC1) as an EN interactor upon IGF1R/insulin receptor (INSR) inhibitor treatment. KPC1/Rnf123 ubiquitylated EN in vitro, and its overexpression decreased EN protein levels. In contrast, KPC1/Rnf123 knockdown rendered EN resistant to IGF1R inhibitor-mediated degradation. These results support a critical function for IGF1R in protecting EN from KPC1/Rnf123-mediated proteasomal degradation. Attempts to therapeutically target oncogenic chimeric tyrosine kinases have traditionally focused on blocking kinase activity to restrict downstream activation of essential signaling pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that IGF1R inhibition results in rapid ubiquitylation and degradation of the EN oncoprotein through a proteasome-dependent mechanism that is reversible, highlighting a potential strategy for targeting chimeric tyrosine kinases in cancer.","['(c) 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Tognon, Cristina E', 'Rafn, Bo', 'Cetinbas, Naniye Malli', 'Kamura, Takumi', 'Trigo, Genny', 'Rotblat, Barak', 'Okumura, Fumihiko', 'Matsumoto, Masaki', 'Chow, Christine', 'Davare, Monika', 'Pollak, Michael', 'Mayor, Thibault', 'Sorensen, Poul H']","['Tognon CE', 'Rafn B', 'Cetinbas NM', 'Kamura T', 'Trigo G', 'Rotblat B', 'Okumura F', 'Matsumoto M', 'Chow C', 'Davare M', 'Pollak M', 'Mayor T', 'Sorensen PH']","['From the Department of Molecular Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'From the Department of Molecular Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'From the Department of Molecular Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan, 812-8582.', 'From the Department of Molecular Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'From the Department of Molecular Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan, 812-8582.', 'the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan, 812-8582.', 'From the Department of Molecular Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'the Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, and.', 'the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research SMBD, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1E2, Canada.', 'the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z4, Canada.', 'From the Department of Molecular Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 1L3, Canada, psor@mail.ubc.ca.']",['eng'],['49520/CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180614,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein, human)', '0 (IGF1R protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Somatomedin)', '120904-94-1 (Polyubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RNF123 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polyubiquitin/*metabolism', '*Proteolysis', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1', 'Receptors, Somatomedin/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",2018/06/16 06:00,2019/02/16 06:00,['2018/06/16 06:00'],"['2017/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)31369-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA117.000321 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2018 Aug 10;293(32):12502-12515. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.000321.

However, emerging data on the immunoevasive tactics employed by AML blasts at diagnosis and at relapse indicate that optimism must be tempered by an understanding of this essential paradox. Furthermore, AML has a low mutational burden, thus presenting few neoantigens for attack by autologous T cells, even after attempted reversal of inhibitory receptor/ligand interactions.

TME5 is comprised of three S-S bonds that divide it into three loops: A (TME5A), B (TME5B), and C (TME5C). Herein we identified the minimum structure of TME5 that produces favorable effects in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). We found that TME5C, composed of 19 amino acids, but not TME5A or TME5B, stimulated the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HHSECs). Matrigel plug assays showed that TME5C stimulates in vivo angiogenesis. In addition, TME5C counteracted calcineurin inhibitor-induced apoptosis and vascular permeability in HUVECs and HHSECs. Western blot analysis indicated that exposure of either HUVECs or HHSECs to TME5C increased the levels of anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia-1 protein in association with the activation of signal transduction pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase, AKT, and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38. Importantly, TME5C did not affect the coagulation pathway in vitro The cytoprotective function of TME5C was mediated by cell surface-expressed GPR15, as TME5C was not able to protect vascular ECs isolated from Gpr15 knock-out (KO) mice. Strikingly, TME5C successfully ameliorated sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in a murine model by counteracting the reduction of sinusoidal EC numbers. Taken together, the cytoprotective and pro-angiogenetic functions of TM are preserved in TME5C. The use of TME5C may be a promising treatment strategy to prevent or treat lethal complications, such as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, whose pathogenesis is based on endothelial insults.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Wang, Xiangmin', 'Pan, Bin', 'Honda, Goichi', 'Wang, Xintao', 'Hashimoto, Yuko', 'Ohkawara, Hiroshi', 'Xu, Kailin', 'Zeng, Lingyu', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki']","['Wang X', 'Pan B', 'Honda G', 'Wang X', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Ohkawara H', 'Xu K', 'Zeng L', 'Ikezoe T']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Japan.', 'Medical Affairs Department, Asahi Kasei Pharma, Kanda Jinbocho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Fukushima Medical University, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China ikezoet@fmu.ac.jp zengly2000@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Fukushima Medical University, Japan ikezoet@fmu.ac.jp zengly2000@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180614,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inducing Agents)', '0 (THBD protein, human)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)']",IM,"['*Angiogenesis Inducing Agents/chemistry/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', '*Cytoprotection', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', '*Thrombomodulin/chemistry/metabolism']",2018/06/16 06:00,2019/10/09 06:00,['2018/06/16 06:00'],"['2017/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.184481 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.184481 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Oct;103(10):1730-1740. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.184481.

The prognosis of older acute myeloid leukemia patients is generally poor. While genetic markers have become important tools for risk stratification and treatment selection in young and middle-aged patients, their applicability in very old patients is less clear. We sought to validate existing genetic risk classification systems and identify additional factors associated with outcomes in intensively treated patients aged >/=75 years. In 151 patients who received induction chemotherapy in the AMLCG-1999 trial, we investigated recurrently mutated genes using a targeted sequencing assay covering 64 genes. The median number of mutated genes per patient was four. The most commonly mutated genes were TET2 (42%), DNMT3A (35%), NPM1 (32%), SRSF2 (25%) and ASXL1 (21%). The complete remission rate was 44% and the 3-year survival was 21% for the entire cohort. While adverse-risk cytogenetics (MRC classification) were associated with shorter overall survival (P=0.001), NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations (present in 18%) did not have a significant impact on overall survival. Notably, none of the 13 IDH1-mutated patients (9%) reached complete remission. Consequently, the overall survival of this subgroup was significantly shorter than that of IDH1-wildtype patients (P<0.001). In summary, even among very old, intensively treated, acute myeloid leukemia patients, adverse-risk cytogenetics predict inferior survival. The spectrum and relevance of driver gene mutations in elderly patients differs from that in younger patients. Our data implicate IDH1 mutations as a novel marker for chemorefractory disease and inferior prognosis.

We reviewed all consecutive cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated at our institution between 2000 and 2017 and identified therapy-related cases - defined as acute lymphoblastic leukemia preceded by prior exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation. Of 1022 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 93 (9.1%) were classified as therapy-related. The median latency for therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia onset was 6.8 years from original diagnosis, and this was shorter for patients carrying the MLL gene rearrangement compared to those with other cytogenetics. When compared to de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia, therapy-related patients were older (P<0.01), more often female (P<0.01), and had more MLL gene rearrangement (P<0.0001) and chromosomes 5/7 aberrations (P=0.02). Although therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia was associated with inferior 2-year overall survival compared to de novo cases (46.0% vs 68.1%, P=0.001), prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy (therapy-related) did not independently impact survival in multivariate analysis (HR=1.32; 95% CI: 0.97-1.80, P=0.08). There was no survival difference (2-year = 53.4% vs 58.9%, P=0.68) between the two groups in patients who received allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation. In conclusion, therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia represents a significant proportion of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnoses, and a subset of cases carry clinical and cytogenetic abnormalities similar to therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Although survival of therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia was inferior to de novo cases, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes were comparable for the two

Most cases are sporadic and acquired. Herein we report a fifth case of PRP-like eruption associated with ponatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 60-year-old woman presented at the dermatology department with an erythemato-squamous eruption present for 2weeks. The patient was also being treated in haematology for recurrence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Treatment with ponatinib had been initiated 6weeks earlier. Despite the low specific cutaneous histology, a diagnosis of induced PRP-like eruption was made based on the characteristic clinical aspect. Treatment with local corticosteroids resolved the eruption. DISCUSSION: The literature contains 6 reported cases of PRP-like eruptions associated with TKI, including 4 with ponatinib. The eruption began from 2weeks to 2-3 months after treatment induction. Prescribed topical corticosteroids have yielded mixed results. A better understanding of the physiopathology of these eruptions associated with TKI could shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms in relation to idiopathic PRP.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Furthermore, the overexpression of CXCR4 has been found to have prognostic significance for disease progression in many type of tumors including lymphoma, leukemia, glioma, and prostate, breast, colorectal, renal, and hepatocellular carcinomas. In leukemia, CXCR4 expression granted leukemic blasts a higher capacity to seed into BM niches, thereby protecting leukemic cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, and was correlated with shorter disease-free survival. In contrast, neutralizing the interaction of CXCL12/CXCR4 with a variety of antagonists induced apoptosis and differentiation and increased the chemosensitivity of lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia cells.

However, its ability to mediate phosphorylation and regulate the important hematopoietic stem cell regulators protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta supports ILK as an attractive target for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the existing knowledge of ILK signaling and its impact on cytokines, paying particular attention to the relevance of ILK signaling in AML.

There is an inevitable need to improve the survival of AML patients. Previous studies show that disulfiram (DSF), an anti-alcoholism drug with a low toxicity profile, demonstrates anticancer behaviors. Here, we evaluated the cytotoxicity and mechanistic action of DSF on the AML cell lines KG-1, NB4, and U937. The microculture tetrazolium test revealed that DSF alone or in combination with copper (Cu) is highly toxic to the AML cells at concentrations lower than those achievable in the clinical setting, with Cu increasing the DSF-induced inhibition of metabolic activity. Flow cytometric analysis and QRT-PCR indicated that in the two cell lines, NB4 and U-937, DSF/Cu increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in association with the induction of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) expression and suppression of catalase (CAT). In the KG-1 cell line, DSF/Cu reduced the ROS levels in agreement with the induction of CAT expression. The cell cycle and apoptosis assessment by flow cytometry demonstrated that DSF/Cu induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These were associated with the increased expression of FOXO tumor suppressors, decreased expression of the MYC oncogene and the modulation of their known target genes related to the cell cycle and apoptosis. Therefore, DSF/Cu caused the disturbance of the ROS balance, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in AML cells in coordination with the modulation in expression of their related genes.

In the present study, we screened the antimalarial drugs, mefloquine, atovaquone, primaquine, and tafenoquine, for their effects on lysosome disruption and cytotoxicity in primary CLL cells. We found that mefloquine and tafenoquine could permeabilize lysosome membranes and induce cell death at doses that are clinically achievable. In contrast, these agents had less effect on normal B cells. Tafenoquine was most effective at inducing cell death, and this was associated with increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Addition of ROS scavengers blocked both tafenoquine- and mefloquine-induced cell death. Moreover, blocking the activity of cathepsins released from the lysosomes decreased tafenoquine-induced cell death.

In cancer, the anomalous transcriptome includes deregulated expression of non-coding RNAs in conjunction with protein-coding mRNAs in human genome. The coding or non-coding RNA transcripts harboring miRNA-binding sites can converse with and regulate each other by explicitly contending for a limited pool of shared miRNAs and act as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). An unifying hypothesis attributing 'modulation of expression of transcripts' in this fashion had been defined as 'competitive endogenous RNA hypothesis'. Network built with ceRNAs evidently offers a platform to elucidate complex regulatory interactions at post-transcriptional level in human cancers. METHODS: Contemplating cancers of human myeloid lineage we constructed ceRNA networks for CML and AML coding and non-coding repertoire utilizing patient sample data. Through functional enrichment analysis we selected the significant functional modules for transcripts being differentially expressed in Blastic phases of each cancer types with respect to Normal. After retrieving free energy of binding and duplex formation of shared miRNAs on ceRNAs, we performed statistical averaging of energy values over the ensemble of populations considering cellular system as in canonical (Iso-thermal) situation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We aimed to shed light on 'Sibling Rivalry' in ceRNA partners from the perspective of statistical thermodynamics, identified major cross-talking tracks and ceRNAs influencing transcripts concerned in myeloid cancer systems.

In the US, over 40% of dairy cows are infected with the virus, and evidence of its economic impact is growing. This study evaluated the performance of a field-deployable automatic nucleic acid-extraction/insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) system for on-site BLV-proviral DNA detection in dairy cows compared with a conventional laboratory real-time PCR (rt-PCR). Assay performance was verified in parallel tests of 36 archived blood samples with 100% agreement (kappa=1.0; n=36) between the iiPCR and conventional rt-PCR systems, and the limit of detection of the iiPCR assay was estimated to be 4 copies (genome equivalent) per reaction. The field-deployable iiPCR system was subsequently used on-farm to test freshly collected blood samples, and showed 100% agreement (kappa=1.0; n=32) with the laboratory rt-PCR system. Fresh blood samples were collected on a second farm and tested on both systems, also with 100% agreement (kappa=1.0; n=34). The field-deployable iiPCR/POCKIT combo system performs as well as a conventional laboratory-based rt-PCR system for detection of BLV proviral DNA in whole blood and may be a useful tool for on-farm evaluation of BLV-infection status in dairy cattle.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Nevertheless, whether circRNA expression is related to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression remains largely unclear. In our study, we investigated the role of circ-CBFB in CLL. We found that circ-CBFB was markedly overexpressed in CLL cells compared to normal controls. Furthermore, we found that circ-CBFB could serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for CLL patients. We also explored the physiological function of circ-CBFB. We found that circ-CBFB knockdown significantly suppressed CLL cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle progression, and induced cellular apoptosis. In terms of its mechanism, we identified circ-CBFB as a sponge of miR-607, which targeted FZD3. By inhibiting miR-607 availability, circ-CBFB promoted FZD3 expression, leading to the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and consequent CLL progression. Taken together, our findings revealed that the circ-CBFB/miR-607/FZD3/Wnt/beta-catenin regulatory signaling cascade contributes to CLL progression.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Since some nutraceuticals (e.g. curcumin, olive oil, and cocoa extract) could alter the function of ABC transporters and /or CYP450 enzymes, DAS bioavailability could potentially be affected following their co-administration. This work aims at studying the possibility of PK interaction between DAS and the selected nutraceuticals in UC rats using UPLC- MS/MS. Chromatographic analysis was carried out using BEH C 18 column (Waters) with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 50% aqueous methanol, 65:35, v/v, each with 0.1% formic acid and using erlotinib (ERL) as an internal standard (IS). DAS quantitation was carried out using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with positive ionization of the transitions at m/z 488.03 > 400.92 (DAS), and m/z 394.29 > 278.19 (ERL). Method validation was assessed as per the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical methods for DAS determination within the concentration range 1-500 ng/mL. No significant effect on the oral bioavailability of DAS was reported with any of the studied nutraceuticals. Thus, the concomitant administration of these nutraceuticals with DAS could be considered safe with a necessity to perform more detailed clinical investigations.",,"['Maher, Hadir M', 'Alzoman, Nourah Z', 'Shehata, Shereen M', 'Abanmy, Norah O']","['Maher HM', 'Alzoman NZ', 'Shehata SM', 'Abanmy NO']","['College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry, University of Alexandria, El-Messalah, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Pharmacy, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20180614,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)'],IM,"['Analytic Sample Preparation Methods', 'Animals', 'Blood Chemical Analysis/*methods', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dasatinib/*blood/*pharmacokinetics', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Limit of Detection', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', '*Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2018/06/15 06:00,2019/01/01 06:00,['2018/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0199208 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-10182 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jun 14;13(6):e0199208. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199208. eCollection 2018.,,,6,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9891-9012'],PMC6002064,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
