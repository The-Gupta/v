Controlled clinical trials have demonstrated a long-term disease-free survival of 40%-50% for patients treated with at least two courses of HIDAC. Other studies have demonstrated that postremission autologous bone marrow transplantation results in a disease-free survival equal to or better than conventional chemotherapy. However, autotransplantation with mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) would now be preferred instead of autologous bone marrow, due to the shorter hematopoietic reconstitution period. The results reviewed in the present article suggest that HIDAC and autologous PBSC transplantation can be combined in the postremission treatment of adult AML, and this combination therapy may also reduce minimal residual disease and the risk of posttransplant relapse. From the available studies it cannot be concluded whether graft purging further reduces the relapse risk. However, the possible advantage of combination therapy with repeated courses of HIDAC and autologous PBSC transplantation needs to be demonstrated in prospective clinical trials before it can be recommended as a part of the routine treatment in AML.","['Bruserud, O', 'Tjonnfjord, G', 'Gjertsen, B T', 'Foss, B', 'Ernst, P']","['Bruserud O', 'Tjonnfjord G', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Foss B', 'Ernst P']","['Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and The University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,['Stem Cells. 2000;18(6):459-60.

In this report, we will describe the identification and characterization of a molecule, BAM11, which binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of Btk. A sequence homology search revealed that BAM11 has 89% homology, at the amino acid level, to human LTG19/ENL, that was originally identified as one of the fusion partners involved in chromosomal translocations of 11q23, MLL/ALL-1/HRX, in leukemia cells. Deletion mutants demonstrated that the region of BAM11 required for binding to Btk was localized between amino acid residues 240 and 256. Forced expression of a truncated form of BAM11 (amino acids 246-368) inhibited IL-5-induced proliferation by 50%, whereas forced expression of full-length BAM11 in Y16 cells did not affect the IL-5 responsiveness. We have also shown that BAM11 (amino acids 246-368) inhibited the kinase activity of Btk. These results suggest that the binding of BAM11 to Btk plays a regulatory role in the Btk signal transduction pathway. A cell fractionation study and analysis using EGFP-fused Btk protein demonstrated that a proportion of Btk is present within the nucleus.","['Kikuchi, Y', 'Hirano, M', 'Seto, M', 'Takatsu, K']","['Kikuchi Y', 'Hirano M', 'Seto M', 'Takatsu K']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (platelet protein P47)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)']",IM,,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,2000/09/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/29 11:00'],"['2000/09/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/29 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/12.10.1397 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 2000 Oct;12(10):1397-408. doi: 10.1093/intimm/12.10.1397.,['GENBANK/AF298887'],,,,,,,,,,

This event correlates with mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, cell cycle arrest, and expression of the Egr-1 transcription factor. We have isolated K562 cells that are resistant to the growth-inhibitory action of PMA. Molecular characterization demonstrates that PMA resistance is downstream from PMA-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Although the levels of Egr-1 expression and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation are comparable in wild-type and PMA-resistant clones in response to PMA, the expression of megakaryocytic cell surface marker CD41 is detected only in the wild-type cells. The lack of differentiation of the PMA-resistant clones correlates with a failure of the PMA-treated cells to induce dephosphorylation and down-regulation of the retinoblastoma protein. These cells may provide a useful model system to distinguish those events that are connected to cell cycle arrest from those involved in the differentiation program initiated by PMA.","['Shelly, C', 'Petruzzelli, L', 'Herrera, R']","['Shelly C', 'Petruzzelli L', 'Herrera R']","['Department of Cell Biology, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division of Warner-Lambert Company, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'K562 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mutation/drug effects/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*drug effects/metabolism']",,2000/09/28 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/28 11:00'],"['2000/09/28 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/28 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 2000 Sep;11(9):501-6.,,"['AR20557/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We describe here a cytogenetic and molecular investigation of a rare case with Ph-positive AML M6 (erythroleukaemia). A 63-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having erythroleukaemia. Leukaemic cells were positive for CD4 and CD7 as well as CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR. They were analyzed by G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses. The karyotypes at diagnosis were as follows: 61, XX, -X, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, t(9;22)(q34;q11)x 2, -15, -16, -17, -18, + 19, +21, +22 [3]/61, idem, -22, +der(22)t(9;22) [36]. FISH with BCR/ABL probes showed that 39% and 57% of interphase nuclei had double and triple BCR/ABL fusion signals, respectively. Chromosome analysis in complete remission showed a normal karyotype in all 20 metaphases, confirming the diagnosis as Ph positive-acute leukaemia. FISH at relapse showed that 92% of interphase nuclei had triple fusion signals. Rearrangement of major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) in the BCR gene and coexpression of p210-type (b2a2) and p190-type (e1a2) BCR/ABL fusion transcripts due to alternative splicing were also detected. We conclude that clonal evolution from double to triple Ph chromosomes may be implicated in the disease progression. Considering other two reported cases, Ph-positive erythroleukaemia appears to be correlated with coexpression of myeloid/T-lymphoid markers and hyperdiploidy with double or triple Ph chromosomes, although breakpoints in the BCR gene are heterogenous.","['Yamamoto, K', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Arai, H', 'Saito, K', 'Furusawa, S']","['Yamamoto K', 'Nakamura Y', 'Arai H', 'Saito K', 'Furusawa S']","['Department of Haematology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan. yam-kat@sa2.so-net.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, CD7/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD13 Antigens/analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/immunology', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",,2000/09/28 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/28 11:00'],"['2000/09/28 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/28 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.90253.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2000 Sep;65(3):182-7. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.90253.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

These included 8 patients with PV, 15 with AMM, 9 with essential thrombocythemia, 5 with chronic myelocytic leukemia, 9 with the 5q-syndrome and 9 with MDS with fibrosis. The findings were compared with those in four patients with reactive erythrocytosis (RE), six with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and five normal controls. Staining intensity (SI) was moderate to strong both in normal controls and in patients with RE or ITP. In contrast, SI was weak in variable proportions of the megakaryocytes in every one of the aforementioned clonal myeloid disorders. The staining pattern (SP) was relatively uniform in MDS and heterogeneous in CMPD. Neither SI nor SP was significantly correlated with certain clinical or laboratory parameters. We concluded that altered megakaryocyte c-Mpl expression may be a nonspecific phenomenon in various subtypes of both CMPD and MDS.

Little data is available addressing the pathology of As2O3 treated APL and whether the antileukemic mechanism of As2O3 is primarily cytolysis or through stimulation of cell differentiation. In this report, we made a morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular evaluation of five ATRA-refractory APL patients who were treated with As2O3. Four of the five patients had morphologic responses after one or two cycles of As2O3 treatment. Of the four responders based on bone marrow morphology, two achieved molecular remission (negative RT-PCR for PML- RAR alpha fusion transcripts) by the end of the second and third cycles of As2O3 therapy. Two patients exhibited marked leukocytosis during the first cycle of As2O3, and at that time point the APL cells were largely replaced by the cells showing partial differentiation towards myelocytes with co-expression of CD11b and CD33. Nevertheless, these ""myelocyte-like"" cells that showed the t(15;17) translocation eventually disappeared with continuous As2O3 therapy. As2O3 treatment appears to be effective therapy for the patients with relapsed APL after the failure of conventional chemotherapy and ATRA therapy. The pathologic findings in these five cases suggest that at low doses As2O3 primarily induces differentiation of the APL cells, generating abnormal myelocytes resembling APL cells treated with ATRA, whereas at higher doses AS2O3 induces marrow necrosis.","['Zhang, T', 'Westervelt, P', 'Hess, J L']","['Zhang T', 'Westervelt P', 'Hess JL']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",,2000/09/28 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/28 11:00'],"['2000/09/28 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/28 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/modpathol.3880174 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2000 Sep;13(9):954-61. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3880174.,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings in generalized neoplasms and the monitoring of therapy].,700-9,"PURPOSE: Methodological work was performed in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) in order to develop suitable tools for non-invasive characterization of hematopoietic bone marrow. The methods were applied for the assessment of normal values in healthy persons and to examine patients with generalized hematological diseases or to monitor effects of therapies influencing the composition of bone marrow. METHODS: Besides standard techniques of MRI as T1- or T2-weighted methods, chemical shift techniques for selective visualization of water or lipid components were applied. The method of magnetization transfer (MT) contrast was used with the intention to differentiate between multiple water containing tissue compartments (intra- vs. extracellular space). A further approach was the determination of the magnetic field distribution within spongy bone marrow. Besides investigations in healthy volunteers, prospective clinical studies were carried out in patients suffering from acute leukemia during their initial treatment and in patients who underwent high-dose therapy with following peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). RESULTS: Especially MR techniques for selective imaging of water of fat signals and proton spectroscopy yielded a high sensitivity to primarily pathological or therapeutically induced changes of hematopoietic bone marrow. Application of MT allowed an improved differentiation of the tissue compartments under PBSCT, which might result in temporary edema. Storage of hemosiderin in bone marrow after blood transfusions and simultaneous hematopoietic insufficiency could be revealed by methods sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneities. CONCLUSIONS: Methods of MRI and MRS allow to non-invasively characterize hematopoietic bone marrow in the course of hematological diseases and during therapy. Marked changes in the composition of hematological bone marrow are detectable for extensive marrow areas. The prognostic relevance of the findings has to be evaluated in future follow-up studies.","['Machann, J', 'Pereira, P L', 'Einsele, H', 'Kanz, L', 'Claussen, C D', 'Schick, F']","['Machann J', 'Pereira PL', 'Einsele H', 'Kanz L', 'Claussen CD', 'Schick F']","['Abteilung fur Radiologische Diagnostik, Eberhard-Karls-Universitat Tubingen.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Radiologe,Der Radiologe,0401257,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/therapy', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging/instrumentation/methods', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Prospective Studies']",,2000/09/28 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/28 11:00'],"['2000/09/28 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/28 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s001170050799 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiologe. 2000 Aug;40(8):700-9. doi: 10.1007/s001170050799.,,,MR-Charakterisierung der Zusammensetzung hamatopoetischen Knochenmarks.

This study examined the localization and expression of IL-11 in human endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle and of prolactin and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in secretory phase endometrium. The mRNA expression of IL-11 receptor alpha and the signalling component, gp130, in endometrial tissue were also determined. Immunoreactive IL-11 was highest in the secretory phase and present in decidualized stromal cells, glandular epithelial cells, endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and the mRNA expression was verified by in-situ hybridization. Decidual cells showed the most intense staining. IL-11 receptor alpha and gp130 mRNA were detected throughout the cycle with minimal variation. Expression of IL-11 mRNA and protein preceded that of prolactin. While immunoreactive prolactin was found in stromal, decidual and glandular epithelial cells, prolactin mRNA was confined to decidual cells. In contrast, endometrial LIF expression preceded IL-11 but was largely confined to the glandular epithelium. The sequence of appearance of LIF, IL-11 and prolactin suggests a synchronized role for each in the differentiation of the endometrium. The cyclical changes and cell type specific expression of IL-11 suggests a potential role in the decidualization of stromal cells.","['Dimitriadis, E', 'Salamonsen, L A', 'Robb, L']","['Dimitriadis E', 'Salamonsen LA', 'Robb L']","[""Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research, 3168 Clayton, Victoria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interleukin-11/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Menstrual Cycle/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Prolactin/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism']",,2000/09/28 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/28 11:00'],"['2000/09/28 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/28 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/molehr/6.10.907 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2000 Oct;6(10):907-14. doi: 10.1093/molehr/6.10.907.,,,,,,,,,,,

IDEC-C2B8 alone induced direct cytotoxicity in four of eight examined CD20-expressing lymphoma cell lines (RAJI, DAUDI, JOK-1, and WT100) at a concentration above 100 ng/ml. Moreover, after 4 h incubation in human serum, only a moderate complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDCC) was observed, whereas cytotoxicity increased markedly after 3 days of culture, indicating that combined direct cytotoxicity and CDCC were responsible. IDEC-C2B8 induced an effective antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in seven of eight tested lymphoma cell lines when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as effector cells. ADCC was moderately enhanced by cytokine interleukin-2, whereas interleukin-12, interferon-alpha, and GM-CSF had no influence. Interestingly, we could demonstrate a correlation between CD32 expression on lymphoma cell lines and IDEC-C2B8-induced direct cytotoxicity, indicating that crosslinking of CD20 with CD32 may be involved in the mechanism of cytotoxicity. We propose that direct cytotoxicity, CDCC, and ADCC result in the marked elimination of CD20-expressing tumor cells observed after treatment with IDEC-C2B8.","['Flieger, D', 'Renoth, S', 'Beier, I', 'Sauerbruch, T', 'Schmidt-Wolf, I']","['Flieger D', 'Renoth S', 'Beier I', 'Sauerbruch T', 'Schmidt-Wolf I']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Allgemeine Innere Medizin, Universitat Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, D-53105 Bonn, Germany.

However, these products have not been shown to be antigenic targets for T-cells, possibly due to immune tolerance. Since carcinogen-induced colon tumor CT26 expresses an envelope protein, gp70, of an endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus that is comparable to human tumor-associated antigens, we examined whether a DNA vaccine containing the gp70 gene induces protective immunity against CT26 cells. Injection of mice with plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding gp70 alone failed to induce anti-gp70 antibody (Ab) or anti-CT26 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. However, immunization with pDNA encoding the beta-galactosidase (beta-gal)/gp70 fusion protein induced anti-gp70 Ab and anti-CT26 CTL responses and conferred protective immunity against CT26 cells. These results indicate that beta-gal acts as an immunogenic carrier protein that helps in the induction of immune responses against the poorly immunogenic gp70. Considering these results, it is possible that potential tolerance to the endogenous retroviral gene products expressed by human tumors may be overcome by DNA vaccines that contain an endogenous retroviral gene fused to genes encoding immunogenic carrier proteins.","['Takeda, J', 'Sato, Y', 'Kiyosawa, H', 'Mori, T', 'Yokoya, S', 'Irisawa, A', 'Miyata, M', 'Obara, K', 'Fujita, T', 'Suzuki, T', 'Kasukawa, R', 'Wanaka, A']","['Takeda J', 'Sato Y', 'Kiyosawa H', 'Mori T', 'Yokoya S', 'Irisawa A', 'Miyata M', 'Obara K', 'Fujita T', 'Suzuki T', 'Kasukawa R', 'Wanaka A']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Fukushina Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima 960-1295, Japan. j-takeda@fmu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/blood', 'Cancer Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Colonic Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines, DNA/*therapeutic use', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/immunology']",,2000/09/28 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/28 11:00'],"['2000/09/28 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/28 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/cimm.2000.1691 [doi]', 'S0008-8749(00)91691-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 2000 Aug 25;204(1):11-8. doi: 10.1006/cimm.2000.1691.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

The direct demonstration of DNA sequences in interphase nuclei and metaphases by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been termed interphase cytogenetics. It has been proven as a powerful technique to detect specific aberrations in a wide variety of cell types, including paraffin-embedded tissue. Nowadays a standard method in leukemia and lymphoma, interphase cytogenetics contributes mainly to the diagnosis in these tumors and helps to classify soft tissue tumors. Therefore FISH is mandatory for the choice of therapy in these tumors. In contrast to the aforementioned, up to now, the value of FISH in solid tumors is mostly limited to pure research and contributes in this way to our understanding of tumor biology. But with the use of paraffin-embedded tissue and the first results obtained, it seems very likely that a direct correlation between histological classification and cytogenetic characteristics of solid tumors can be achieved in the near future. This information might not only provide insights into tumor biology, but could also contribute to a different tumor classification, a sort of risk estimation, where we might predict the possible biological behavior of solid tumors. This could greatly influence further therapeutic decisions thus establishing the FISH technique as an indisputable part in the diagnosis of solid tumors.","['Poetsch, M', 'Dittberner, T', 'Woenckhaus, C', 'Kleist, B']","['Poetsch M', 'Dittberner T', 'Woenckhaus C', 'Kleist B']","['Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Greifswald, Germany. poetsch@mail.uni-greifswald.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Cytogenetics/*methods', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interphase/*genetics', 'Melanoma/*pathology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Squamous Cell/*pathology']",71,2000/09/27 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/09/27 11:00'],"['2000/09/27 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/27 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.14670/HH-15.1225 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2000 Oct;15(4):1225-31. doi: 10.14670/HH-15.1225.,,,,,10.14670/HH-15.1225 [doi],,,,,,

We examined the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules in salivary glands from patients with SS. The labial salivary glands from six human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I-seronegative and eleven HTLV-I-seropositive SS patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In vitro experiments were performed with a human salivary gland cell line (HSG cells). Immunohistologic analyses revealed that Bcl-2 and Bcl-x were preferentially expressed in salivary infiltrating mononuclear cells more than acinar and ductal epithelial cells. In contrast, strong X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression was evident in both acinar and ductal epithelial cells. The pattern of expression of these anti-apoptotic molecules was similar in both HTLV-I-seropositive and HTLV-I -seronegative SS patients. Western blot analysis confirmed expression of XIAP in cultured HSG cells. The expression of XIAP in HSG cells was increased by IL-1beta, TGF-beta1, or IL-10. However, XIAP expression was down-regulated by TNF-alpha, which induced apoptotic cell death of HSG cells with an increase in caspase-3 activity. These effects of TNF-alpha in HSG cells were antagonized by IL-1beta, TGF-beta1, or IL-10.

The idea behind it is to provide a unique look at instructive dermatologic cases being presented at the weekly Dermatology Branch Grand Rounds at the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland. Patients seen at the NIH Clinical Center (which includes the NIH inpatient wards and outpatient clinics) are indeed unusual. To be evaluated here, they must be referred by an outside physician and must be placed in a research protocol. In other words, by this criterion, all NIH patients are considered research subjects. The diseases studied at the NIH range from the common to the obscure. Similarly, the dermatologic manifestations of these diseases are equally as diverse. Thus the purpose of this new section is to share some of these fascinating cases with the dermatologic community at large, as well as to provide a glimpse of exciting translational research that has relevance to clinical dermatologists. The format will be simple. Cases will be presented as unknowns, including relevant results from the history, physical examination, and histopathologic analyses. This will be done to challenge the clinicopathologic skills of the readers; authors will make every attempt to make the color clinical and pathologic photographs of the highest quality possible to assist readers in making the correct diagnoses. The discussion will be brief, focusing on the key teaching points of each case. These teaching points will vary from cases to case, covering clinical and histologic information, treatment issues, and/or novel laboratory advances with clinical relevance. Authors will emphasize brevity and clarity in all subsections of the case report, which I hope will promote a good learning experience for dermatology residents and busy practitioners alike.

In a prospective, longitudinal study on 15 children with ALL, we undertook serial measurements of markers of bone and collagen turnover, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and its binding proteins (IGFBPs)-3 and -2 during the second year of continuing chemotherapy. In eight patients we also measured lower leg length by knemometry. Height SD scores, lower leg length velocity, IGF-I, and markers of bone collagen turnover did not differ significantly from healthy children. However, bone alkaline phosphatase, a marker of the differentiated osteoblast, was lower (mean SD score, -0.64; p < 0.0001), whereas procollagen type III N-terminal propeptide (P3NP, a marker of soft tissue collagen turnover; mean SD score, +0.93, p < 0.05), IGFBP-3 (mean SD score, +0.76; p < 0.01), and IGFBP-2 (mean SD score, +1.24, p = 0.01) were all higher than in healthy children. IGFBP-3 decreased during episodes of afebrile neutropenia (p < 0.05). Within 3 mo after completion of treatment, bone ALP increased in all eight patients, but collagen markers showed little change. IGFBP-2 returned to normal posttreatment, but P3NP and IGFBP-3 remained significantly elevated compared with healthy children (mean SD scores, +1.51 and +1.36, respectively; p < 0.01). We conclude that continuing chemotherapy was associated with normal growth and bone collagen turnover but enhanced soft tissue collagen turnover. Bone bone alkaline phosphatase was low throughout treatment, which suggests impaired osteoblast differentiation resulting from a direct effect of chemotherapy on bone. Although the effect was reversible, the long-term implications for bone health in survivors remain uncertain.","['Crofton, P M', 'Ahmed, S F', 'Wade, J C', 'Elmlinger, M W', 'Ranke, M B', 'Kelnar, C J', 'Wallace, W H']","['Crofton PM', 'Ahmed SF', 'Wade JC', 'Elmlinger MW', 'Ranke MB', 'Kelnar CJ', 'Wallace WH']","['Department of Paediatric Biochemistry, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh EH9 1LF, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Procollagen)', '0 (collagen type I trimeric cross-linked peptide)', '0 (procollagen type I carboxy terminal peptide)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Body Height', '*Bone Development', '*Bone Remodeling', 'Bone and Bones/enzymology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Collagen/blood', 'Collagen Type I', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Peptides/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Procollagen/blood', 'Prospective Studies']",,2000/09/27 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/27 11:00'],"['2000/09/27 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/27 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-200010000-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 2000 Oct;48(4):490-6. doi: 10.1203/00006450-200010000-00012.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cohort study of 95 pediatric patients after chemotherapy with or without surgery or extrapulmonary thoracic radiotherapy. The patients were in remission without treatment and able to undergo pulmonary function testing. Personal history and exposure to risk factors or toxic habits were evaluated. Clinical examination, chest radiographs, pulmonary gammography, basal and stress pulmometry, forced spirometry, whole body phletismography and carbonmonoxide transfer test were performed. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 5 +/- 3.3 years. Treatment duration was 2.4 +/- 1.3 years and time without treatment 4.3 +/- 3. 3 years. Thirty-six patients were reviewed two and a half years after the first control. Thirty-nine patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 57 had solid tumors. Sixty percent showed functional restriction due to chest deformity after undergoing chest surgery. The association between functional restriction and radiotherapy (6 patients) did not produce poorer functional results. Forty-three percent showed initial change in TLCO. Nineteen percent showed basal hemoglobin saturation under 93% which in 16% fell after physical exercise. These alterations improved with time. However, restrictive change initially present in 11.5% persisted at the second evaluation. Thoracic surgery was the main cause of thoracic deformity and therefore of restrictive change. The children under 8 years old and those who received longer treatments tended to show the worst TLCO values. The patients with neuroblastoma showed greater restrictive change while the change in TLCO was more frequent in patients with Burkitt s lymphoma and in those treated with cyclophosphamide. CONCLUSIONS: Neither personal or family history of respiratory disease nor the presence of symptoms such as cough served to identify risk of functional change. Restrictive change in pulmonary function was greater in patients who had undergone thoracic surgery. Functional values were worse in patients with neuroblastoma. Pulmonary function should be followed up in pediatric survivors of malignant neoplasia in order to prevent restrictive alterations.","['Sacristan, A', 'Garcia de Miguel, P', 'Antelo, C', 'Ruza, F', 'Garcia Garcia, S', 'Pino Garcia, J M']","['Sacristan A', 'Garcia de Miguel P', 'Antelo C', 'Ruza F', 'Garcia Garcia S', 'Pino Garcia JM']",['Centro de Salud Pintor Oliva.

Several genes that affect the differentiation of, or are expressed early in, both the endothelial and blood lineages may in fact function at the level of the hemangioblast. For example, the zebrafish cloche mutation disrupts the differentiation of both endothelial and blood cells. The transcription factor gene scl is expressed in both endothelial and blood lineages from an early stage and can regulate their differentiation. Here we report that in zebrafish the homeobox gene hhex (previously called hex) is also expressed in endothelial and blood lineages from an early stage. We find that hhex expression in these lineages is significantly reduced in cloche mutant embryos, indicating that hhex functions downstream of cloche to regulate endothelial and blood differentiation. Ectopic expression of hhex through injection of a DNA construct leads to the premature and ectopic expression of early endothelial and blood differentiation genes such as fli1, flk1 and gata1, indicating that Hhex can positively regulate endothelial and blood differentiation. However, analysis of a hhex deficiency allele shows that hhex is not essential for early endothelial and blood differentiation, suggesting that another gene, perhaps scl, compensates for the absence of Hhex function. Furthermore, we find that hhex and scl can induce each other's expression, suggesting that these two genes cross-regulate each other during early endothelial and blood differentiation. Together, these data provide the initial framework of a pathway that can be used to further integrate the molecular events regulating hemangioblast differentiation.","['Liao, W', 'Ho, C Y', 'Yan, Y L', 'Postlethwait, J', 'Stainier, D Y']","['Liao W', 'Ho CY', 'Yan YL', 'Postlethwait J', 'Stainier DY']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Programs in Developmental Biology, Genetics and Human Genetics, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143-0448, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hhex protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*embryology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Somites', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Telomere', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish/embryology', '*Zebrafish Proteins']",,2000/09/27 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/27 11:00'],"['2000/09/27 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/27 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 2000 Oct;127(20):4303-13.,,,,,,,,,,,

Cardiopulmonary bypass transiently alters lymphocyte subsets, resulting in a reduction in CD4(+) T cells and an increase in CD8(+) T cells. We proposed that cardiovascular operations and human T lymphotropic virus type I infection may act synergistically, resulting in serious damage to cell-mediated immunity. METHODS: A total of 517 consecutive patients who were preoperatively screened for anti-human T lymphotropic virus type I antibody and underwent cardiovascular operations with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled in this study. Of the 517 patients, 82 (16%) had positive test results for anti-human T lymphotropic virus type I antibody. The surgical outcome of patients with positive and negative results for anti-human T lymphotropic virus type I antibody was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: There was no difference between the 2 groups with respect to early mortality. Distribution of survival curve was also not significantly different (P =.5; mean follow-up duration, 2.4 +/- 1.8 years [range, 0-9.4 years] and 3.2 +/- 2.8 years [range, 0-9.8 years]) in the groups with positive and negative antibody results, respectively). In particular, long-term follow-up did not reveal adult T-cell leukemia or human T lymphotropic virus type I-associated myelopathy, and occurrence of neoplasm did not differ between groups. Early infectious complication was, however, significantly higher in the group with positive antibody results than in the group with negative results (P =.02). Logistic regression analysis revealed human T lymphotropic virus type I infection as a significant risk for this complication (P =.04; odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1. 0-5.8). CONCLUSION: A combination of human T lymphotropic virus type I infection and cardiovascular operation is believed to increase the potential risk of infectious complications shortly after the operation. However, this synergistic effect seems to be transient and has little influence on long-term prognosis.","['Masuda, H', 'Moriyama, Y', 'Toda, R', 'Shimokawa, S', 'Iguro, Y', 'Watanabe, S', 'Hisatomi, K', 'Matsumoto, H', 'Taira, A']","['Masuda H', 'Moriyama Y', 'Toda R', 'Shimokawa S', 'Iguro Y', 'Watanabe S', 'Hisatomi K', 'Matsumoto H', 'Taira A']","['Second Department of Surgery, Kagoshima University Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima, Japan. masuda@med6.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,,"['Aged', '*Cardiac Surgical Procedures', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/09/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/26 11:00'],"['2000/09/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/26 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0022522300566835 [pii]', '10.1067/mtc.2000.108594 [doi]']",ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2000 Oct;120(4):699-706. doi: 10.1067/mtc.2000.108594.,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence analysis of RT-PCR products isolated from the mutant brain disclosed that the exon 23 of the mdr-3 gene is deleted or altered in the transcripts. The analysis of the genomic locus revealed an insertion of a solo long terminal repeat (LTR) of the ecotropic murine leukemia virus in the reverse orientation in the intron of the mdr-3 gene, causing abnormal splicing and thereby disrupting the mdr-3 gene function.

Deletion of an intergenic DNA-binding site for this complex from a human beta-globin locus construct results in delayed human gamma- to beta-globin switching in transgenic mice, suggesting that the PYR complex acts to facilitate the switch. We now show that PYR complex DNA-binding activity also copurifies with subunits of a second type of chromatin-remodeling complex, nucleosome-remodeling deacetylase (NuRD), that has been shown to have both nucleosome-remodeling and histone deacetylase activities. Gel supershift assays using antibodies to the ATPase-helicase subunit of the NuRD complex, Mi-2 (CHD4), confirm that Mi-2 is a component of the PYR complex. In addition, we show that the hematopoietic cell-restricted zinc finger protein Ikaros copurifies with PYR complex DNA-binding activity and that antibodies to Ikaros also supershift the complex. We also show that NuRD and SWI/SNF components coimmunopurify with each other as well as with Ikaros. Competition gel shift experiments using partially purified PYR complex and recombinant Ikaros protein indicate that Ikaros functions as a DNA-binding subunit of the PYR complex. Our results suggest that Ikaros targets two types of chromatin-remodeling factors-activators (SWI/SNF) and repressors (NuRD)-in a single complex (PYR complex) to the beta-globin locus in adult erythroid cells. At the time of the switch from fetal to adult globin production, the PYR complex is assembled and may function to repress gamma-globin gene expression and facilitate gamma- to beta-globin switching.","[""O'Neill, D W"", 'Schoetz, S S', 'Lopez, R A', 'Castle, M', 'Rabinowitz, L', 'Shor, E', 'Krawchuk, D', 'Goll, M G', 'Renz, M', 'Seelig, H P', 'Han, S', 'Seong, R H', 'Park, S D', 'Agalioti, T', 'Munshi, N', 'Thanos, D', 'Erdjument-Bromage, H', 'Tempst, P', 'Bank, A']","[""O'Neill DW"", 'Schoetz SS', 'Lopez RA', 'Castle M', 'Rabinowitz L', 'Shor E', 'Krawchuk D', 'Goll MG', 'Renz M', 'Seelig HP', 'Han S', 'Seong RH', 'Park SD', 'Agalioti T', 'Munshi N', 'Thanos D', 'Erdjument-Bromage H', 'Tempst P', 'Bank A']","['Departments of Pathology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CHD4 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Aging/physiology', 'Animals', '*Autoantigens', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/genetics', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",,2000/09/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/26 11:00'],"['2000/09/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.20.7572-7582.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Oct;20(20):7572-82. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.20.7572-7582.2000.,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK25274/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL28381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC86310,,,,,

Signaling is normally initiated through one or more ligand-mediated proteolytic cleavages that permit nuclear translocation of the intracellular portion of the Notch receptor (ICN), which then binds and activates transcription factors of the Su(H)/CBF1 family. Several mammalian Notch receptors are oncogenic when constitutively active, including Notch1, a gene initially identified based on its involvement in a (7;9) chromosomal translocation found in sporadic T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas (T-ALL). To investigate which portions of ICN1 contribute to transformation, we performed a structure-transformation analysis using a robust murine bone marrow reconstitution assay. Both the ankyrin repeat and C-terminal transactivation domains were required for T-cell leukemogenesis, whereas the N-terminal RAM domain and a C-terminal domain that includes a PEST sequence were nonessential. Induction of T-ALL correlated with the transactivation activity of each Notch1 polypeptide when fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, with the exception of polypeptides deleted of the ankyrin repeats, which lacked transforming activity while retaining strong transactivation activity. Transforming polypeptides also demonstrated moderate to strong activation of the Su(H)/CBF1-sensitive HES-1 promoter, while polypeptides with weak or absent activity on this promoter failed to cause leukemia. These experiments define a minimal transforming region for Notch1 in T-cell progenitors and suggest that leukemogenic signaling involves recruitment of transcriptional coactivators to ICN1 nuclear complexes.","['Aster, J C', 'Xu, L', 'Karnell, F G', 'Patriub, V', 'Pui, J C', 'Pear, W S']","['Aster JC', 'Xu L', 'Karnell FG', 'Patriub V', 'Pui JC', 'Pear WS']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Ankyrin Repeat', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor, Notch1', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",,2000/09/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/26 11:00'],"['2000/09/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.20.7505-7515.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Oct;20(20):7505-15. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.20.7505-7515.2000.,,"['R01 CA082308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA82308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC86303,,,,,

These responses include opening of a cation-selective channel/pore that allows entry of the fluorescent dye ethidium and activation of a membrane metalloprotease that sheds the adhesion molecule L-selectin. The surface expression of P2X(7) receptors was measured in normal leucocytes, platelets, and B-CLL lymphocytes and correlated with their functional responses. Monocytes showed four- to fivefold greater expression of P2X(7) than B, T, and NK lymphocytes, whereas P2X(7) expression on neutrophils and platelets was weak. All cell types demonstrated abundant intracellular expression of this receptor. All 12 subjects with B-CLL expressed lymphocyte P2X(7) at about the same level as B lymphocytes from normal subjects. P2X(7) function, measured by ATP-induced uptake of ethidium, correlated closely with surface expression of this receptor in normal and B-CLL lymphocytes and monocytes (n = 47, r = 0.70; P < 0.0001). However, in three patients the ATP-induced uptake of ethidium into the malignant B lymphocytes was low or absent. The lack of P2X(7) function in these B lymphocytes was confirmed by the failure of ATP to induce Ba(2+) uptake into their lymphocytes. This lack of function of the P2X(7) receptor resulted in a failure of ATP-induced shedding of L-selectin, an adhesion molecule that directs the recirculation of lymphocytes from blood into the lymph node.","['Gu, B J', 'Zhang, W Y', 'Bendall, L J', 'Chessell, I P', 'Buell, G N', 'Wiley, J S']","['Gu BJ', 'Zhang WY', 'Bendall LJ', 'Chessell IP', 'Buell GN', 'Wiley JS']","['Department of Medicine, Nepean Hospital, University of Sydney, Penrith, New South Wales 2750, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Using KG-1 with impaired hOGG1, we demonstrated cytotoxicity of 8ohdG probably due to its incorporation into cellular DNA. This new property of KG-1 may allow it to serve as an useful tool for studies of OGG1, oxidative DNA damage and the cytotoxic action of 8ohG.

Data acquisition times were on the order of 1 min for scanning volumes of up to 25 l at a spatial resolution of 31 microl. A survey of 21 patients with leukemia and eight healthy adult volunteers was undertaken to determine the magnitude of the observed effect and its dependence upon specific pathologies. The acquisition methods yielded high-quality segmentation of leukemic bone marrow prior to therapy in seven of seven patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia, and who had hypercellular (>95%) bone marrow at the time of the study. The quality of the segmentation was sufficient to allow the use of maximum intensity projection images which afforded a convenient evaluation of both intra- and extramedullary disease. The measured signal-to-noise ratios agreed with a theoretical estimate that accounted for the percentage cellularity, T(2) relaxation time of water, and self-diffusion coefficient of water in iliac bone marrow. In addition, the mean signal-to-noise ratios from iliac marrow were strongly dependent upon the time after the initiation of chemotherapeutic regimens, implying that the methods may be useful for therapeutic monitoring.","['Ballon, D', 'Dyke, J', 'Schwartz, L H', 'Lis, E', 'Schneider, E', 'Lauto, A', 'Jakubowski, A A']","['Ballon D', 'Dyke J', 'Schwartz LH', 'Lis E', 'Schneider E', 'Lauto A', 'Jakubowski AA']","['Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. ballond@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,NMR Biomed,NMR in biomedicine,8915233,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Diffusion', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2000/09/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/26 11:00'],"['2000/09/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/26 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1099-1492(200010)13:6<321::AID-NBM651>3.0.CO;2-P [pii]', '10.1002/1099-1492(200010)13:6<321::aid-nbm651>3.0.co;2-p [doi]']",ppublish,NMR Biomed. 2000 Oct;13(6):321-8. doi: 10.1002/1099-1492(200010)13:6<321::aid-nbm651>3.0.co;2-p.,,"['R01HL50139/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29HL50139/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,

Transcription of HTLV-1 is controlled through sequences in the promoter and enhancer regions of the long terminal repeat of the integrated provirus. Important among these sequences are three 21 bp imperfect repeats responsive to the viral oncogenic protein Tax (TRE). Members of the CREB/ATF-1/CREM family of transcription factors bind to TRE-1 and are critical for HTLV-1 transcription. Other less studied family members include the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) proteins. ICER proteins lack phosphorylation and activation domains and are potent inhibitors of transcription. The ability of ICER to bind TRE-1 and its effects on HTLV-1 Tax mediated transcription have not been studied in the natural cell targets of the virus, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We show that ICER mRNA levels are low in quiescent PBMC, but rise and remain elevated for up to 18 hr after mitogenic stimulation of these cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using recombinant Tax and ICER demonstrate that ICER binds TRE-1 and that binding is increased in the presence of Tax. Furthermore, over expression of ICER IIgamma suppressed Tax-mediated transcription whereas an anti-sense ICER II plasmid designed to block endogenous ICER enhanced Tax-mediated transcription in activated PBMC. Together our data indicate that ICER inhibits Tax-mediated transcription in activated PBMC and suggest a role for ICER in maintenance of HTLV-1 persistence.","['Newbound, G C', ""O'Rourke, J P"", 'Collins, N D', 'Andrews, J M', 'DeWille, J', 'Lairmore, M D']","['Newbound GC', ""O'Rourke JP"", 'Collins ND', 'Andrews JM', 'DeWille J', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135844-64-3 (Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Latency']",,2000/09/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/26 11:00'],"['2000/09/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1096-9071(200010)62:2<286::AID-JMV22>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2000 Oct;62(2):286-92.,,"['AI01474/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55185/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 1058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

CMV antigenemia was assessed on admission and at the time when the patients had fever higher than 37. 5 degrees C, which did not respond to antibiotics for longer than 3 days. The incidence of CMV antigenemia was 44%. Approximately 90% of patients with CMV antigenemia died of infections with viruses, bacteria, and/or fungi, while approximately 40% of patients without CMV antigenemia died of deterioration of ATLL (P<0.0001). In this study, the patients with CMV antigenemia tended to survive longer than those negative for it (321.4 days vs. 266.2 days), although there was no statistical significance (P=0.09). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that CMV antigenemia was not a poor prognostic factor. When the disease status of ATLL was evaluated by thymidine kinase (TK) and soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R), both had lower titers during CMV antigenemia (TK: P=0.01, sIL-2R: P=0.03, respectively). Therefore, CMV infections in ATLL patients seemed to have bimodal meanings; CMV infection at the end of clinical course were life-threatening, but infection during the first half of clinical course seemed to suppress ATLL activity and to contribute to the longer survival of the patients.","['Fujiwara, H', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Eizuru, Y', 'Matsushita, K', 'Ohtsubo, H', 'Kukita, T', 'Imaizumi, R', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Hidaka, S', 'Arima, N', 'Tei, C']","['Fujiwara H', 'Matsumoto T', 'Eizuru Y', 'Matsushita K', 'Ohtsubo H', 'Kukita T', 'Imaizumi R', 'Matsumoto M', 'Hidaka S', 'Arima N', 'Tei C']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antigens, Viral/blood', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/blood', 'Survival Rate', 'Thymidine Kinase/blood']",,2000/09/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/26 11:00'],"['2000/09/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1096-9071(200010)62:2<140::AID-JMV3>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2000 Oct;62(2):140-3.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

They play a key role in costimulatory mechanisms and during antigen presentation by efficient antigen presenting cells. B7 molecules are usually absent or expressed at low intensity on B lymphocytes from healthy subjects. In this study, the authors addressed the questions of whether B7 molecules are expressed and modulated in vitro on malignant B lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphoproliferative diseases of B-cell type and whether they are able to trigger allogenic T-cell reactions. METHODS: Malignant B cells from the peripheral blood of 32 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and its variant form were investigated for the expression of B7 molecules on the cell surface and for the ability to trigger allogenic T lymphocytes in different experimental conditions. RESULTS: Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that freshly isolated malignant B cells express B7 molecules and that their expression may be up-regulated by the in vitro triggering of the CD40 molecule. Furthermore, freshly isolated malignant B cells induce allogenic T-cell proliferation. The in vitro triggering of malignant B lymphocytes by CD40, alone and in combination with interleukin-4, elicits a strong allogenic T-cell proliferation. This T-cell proliferation is related mainly to the presence of B7 molecules on malignant and normal B lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that malignant B cells are efficient antigen presenting cells. It might be suggested that vaccination with pulsed malignant B cells themselves or dendritic cells with in vitro preactivated tumor B cells may represent an alternative therapeutic approach in these patients to generate an antilymphoma T-cell response in vivo.","['Trentin, L', 'Perin, A', 'Siviero, M', 'Piazza, F', 'Facco, M', 'Gurrieri, C', 'Galvan, S', 'Adami, F', 'Agostini, C', 'Pizzolo, G', 'Zambello, R', 'Semenzato, G']","['Trentin L', 'Perin A', 'Siviero M', 'Piazza F', 'Facco M', 'Gurrieri C', 'Galvan S', 'Adami F', 'Agostini C', 'Pizzolo G', 'Zambello R', 'Semenzato G']","['Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Clinical Immunology Branch, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/09/26 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/26 11:00'],"['2000/09/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(20000915)89:6<1259::AID-CNCR10>3.0.CO;2-G [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Sep 15;89(6):1259-68.,,,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,

By means of direct dephosphorylation, it down-regulates a broad spectrum of growth-promoting receptors, including the Kit tyrosine kinase, activated to elicit a prominent cascade of intracellular events by stem cell factor binding. The pivotal contribution of PTPN6 in modulating myeloid cell signaling has been revealed by the finding that shp-1 mutation is responsible for the overexpansion and inappropriate activation of myelomonocytic populations in motheaten (me/me) and motheaten viable (me(v)/me(v)) mice. Association of PTPN6 with c-Kit and negative modulation of the myeloid leukocyte signal transduction pathways prompted us to examine the expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN6 gene in CD34(+)/CD117(+) blasts from acute myeloid leukemia patients. We identified and cloned cDNAs representing novel PTPN6 mRNA species, derived from aberrant splicing within the N-SH2 domain leading to retention of intron 3. Sequence analysis of cDNA clones revealed multiple A-->G editing conversions. The editing of PTPN6 mRNA mainly occurred as an A-->G conversion of A(7866), which represents the putative branch site in IVS3 of PTPN6 mRNA. Evidence that editing of A(7866) abrogates splicing has been obtained in vitro by using an edited clone and its backward clone generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The level of the aberrant intron-retaining splice variant, evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, was lower in CD117(+)-AML bone marrow mononuclear cells at remission than at diagnosis, suggesting the involvement of post-transcriptional PTPN6 processing in leukemogenesis.","['Beghini, A', 'Ripamonti, C B', 'Peterlongo, P', 'Roversi, G', 'Cairoli, R', 'Morra, E', 'Larizza, L']","['Beghini A', 'Ripamonti CB', 'Peterlongo P', 'Roversi G', 'Cairoli R', 'Morra E', 'Larizza L']","['Department of Biology and Genetics, University of Milan, Medical Faculty, 20133 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Editing', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/09/26 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/09/26 11:00'],"['2000/09/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.hmg.a018921 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2000 Sep 22;9(15):2297-304. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.hmg.a018921.,,,,,,,,,,,

Although AML1 stimulates transcription, TEL-AML1 functions as a repressor of some AML1 target genes. In contrast to the wild type AML1 protein, both TEL and TEL-AML1 interact with N-CoR, a component of the nuclear receptor corepressor complex with histone deacetylase activity. The interaction between TEL and N-CoR requires the central region of TEL, which is retained in TEL-AML1, and TEL lacking this domain is impaired in transcriptional repression.

Currently, the role of viral infection in the transformation of PEL cells is unknown. One possibility is that KSHV, like the lymphotropic viruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human T-cell leukemia virus I (HTLV-I), activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB to promote survival and proliferation of infected lymphocytes. To examine this possibility, we assessed NF-kappaB activity in KSHV-infected PEL cell lines and primary tumor specimens by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). We observed that NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in all KSHV-infected lymphomas, and consists of 2 predominant complexes, p65/p50 heterodimers and p50/p50 homodimers. Inhibition experiments demonstrated that Bay 11-7082, an irreversible inhibitor of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, completely and specifically abrogated the NF-kappaB/DNA binding in PEL cells. PEL cells treated with Bay 11 demonstrated down-regulation of the NF-kappaB inducible cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6), and apoptosis. These results suggest that NF-kappaB activity is necessary for survival of KSHV-infected lymphoma cells, and that pharmacologic inhibition of NF-kappaB may be an effective treatment for PEL.","['Keller, S A', 'Schattner, E J', 'Cesarman, E']","['Keller SA', 'Schattner EJ', 'Cesarman E']","['Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences of Cornell University, and the Departments of Medicine and Pathology of Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY, USA. ecesarm@mail.med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'WIQ1H85SYP (Sodium Salicylate)']",IM,,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aspirin/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival', '*Herpesvirus 8, Human', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*pathology/*virology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi', 'Sodium Salicylate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/09/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/26 11:00'],"['2000/09/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54365-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Oct 1;96(7):2537-42.,,"['CA68939/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82037/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In a previous study, it was demonstrated that Ras activation was involved in thrombopoietin-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. In this study, constitutive Ras activation by H-ras(G12V) evoked megakaryocytic maturation of erythroleukemia cell lines F-36P and K562, but not of myeloid cell line 32D cl3 that lacks GATA-1. However, the introduction of GATA-1 led to reprogramming of 32D cl3 toward erythrocytic/megakaryocytic lineage and enabled it to undergo megakaryocytic differentiation in response to H-ras(G12V). In contrast, the overexpression of PU.1 and c-Myb changed the phenotype of K562 from erythroid to myeloid/monocytic lineage and rendered K562 to differentiate into granulocytes and macrophages in response to H-ras(G12V), respectively. In GATA-1-transfected 32D cl3, the endogenous expression of PU.1 and c-Myb was easily detectable, but their activities were reduced severely. Endogenous GATA-1 activities were markedly suppressed in PU.1-transfected and c-myb-transfected K562. As for the mechanisms of these reciprocal inhibitions, GATA-1 and PU.1 were found to associate through their DNA-binding domains and to inhibit the respective DNA-binding activities of each other. In addition, c-Myb bound to GATA-1 and inhibited its DNA-binding activities. Mutant GATA-1 and PU.1 that retained their own transcriptional activities but could not inhibit the reciprocal partner were less effective in changing the lineage phenotype of 32D cl3 and K562. These results suggested that GATA-1 activities may be crucial for Ras-mediated megakaryocytic differentiation and that its activities may be regulated by the direct interaction with other lineage-specific transcription factors such as PU.1 and c-Myb.","['Matsumura, I', 'Kawasaki, A', 'Tanaka, H', 'Sonoyama, J', 'Ezoe, S', 'Minegishi, N', 'Nakajima, K', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Kanakura, Y']","['Matsumura I', 'Kawasaki A', 'Tanaka H', 'Sonoyama J', 'Ezoe S', 'Minegishi N', 'Nakajima K', 'Yamamoto M', 'Kanakura Y']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan. matsumura@bldon.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ras Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",,2000/09/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/26 11:00'],"['2000/09/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54353-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Oct 1;96(7):2440-50.,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 3676 patients (aged 1 to 15 years) entered into the United Kingdom (UK) Medical Research Council (MRC) trials UKALL X and XI from 1985 to 1997. Of these patients, 473 patients (13%) were classified as very high (VH) risk and were eligible for a transplantation from a matched histocompatible sibling donor (MSD). We tissue-typed 286 patients; 99 patients had a matched related donor, and 76 patients received transplantations. Additionally, 25 children received transplantations from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) despite trial guidelines for MSD transplantations only. The median time to transplantation was 5 months (range, 2 to 19 months), and the median follow-up was 8 years. The 10-year event-free survival (EFS) adjusted for the time to transplantation, diagnostic white blood cell (WBC) count, Ph chromosome status, and ploidy was 6. 0% higher (95% confidence interval (CI), -10.5% to 22.5%) for 101 patients who received a first-remission transplantation (MSD and MUD) than for the 351 patients treated with chemotherapy (transplantation, 45.3%, vs chemotherapy, 39.3%). The transplantation group had fewer relapses (31%) compared to relapses in the chemotherapy group (55%); however, the transplantation group had more remission deaths (18%) compared to remission deaths in the chemotherapy group (3%). In contrast the adjusted 10-year EFS was 10. 7% higher (95% CI, -2.6% to 24.0%) for patients without a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor than for those patients with a donor (no donor, 50.4%, vs donor, 39.7%).

Because of its rarity and the lack of precise diagnostic criteria in the past, few series of adults treated with contemporary therapy have been reported. Twenty among 1649 (1.2%) patients with newly diagnosed AML entered on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trials between 1984 and 1997 were found to have AMegL. The median age was 42.5 years (range 18-70). Marrow fibrosis, usually extensive, was present in the bone marrow. Of the 8 patients who had cytogenetic studies performed, abnormalities of chromosome 3 were the most frequent. The most consistent immunophenotypic finding was absence of myeloperoxidase in blast cells from 5 patients. In the most typical 3 cases, the leukemic cells were positive for one to 2 platelet-specific antigens in addition to lacking myeloperoxidase or an antigen consistent with a lymphoid leukemia. Myeloid antigens other than myeloperoxidase and selected T-cell antigens (CD7 and/or CD2) were frequently expressed. Induction therapy included an anthracycline and cytarabine in all cases. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 10 of 20 patients (50%). Two patients remain alive, one in CR at 160+ months. Resistant disease was the cause of induction failure in all but 3 patients. The median CR duration was 10.6 months (range 1-160+ months). The median survival for all patients was 10.4 months (range 1-160+ months). Although half of the patients achieved CR, the long-term outcome is extremely poor, primarily attributable to resistant disease.

The identification of the apparently unique structural abnormalities was achieved using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome 10- and chromosome 11-specific painting probes as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetics. As is often the case, suboptimal preparations often preclude unequivocal identification of complex rearrangements by conventional banding techniques.

During these decades new observations arising from studies of the biological behaviour of diploid and leukaemic stem cells and, recently, from clinical investigations have received the most attention. From a clinical point of view, allografting is still the only procedure which is able to cure CML. For patients without HLA-compatible donors, current therapeutic options include conventional chemotherapy (hydroxyurea), interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and autografting. While IFN-alpha (+/- low-dose ARA-C) must be considered the first-line therapy, autografting, according to our approach, or other procedures, raises the question of an ideal sequential strategy in the management of CML patients (diploid stem cell mobilization, autografting, IFN-alpha). Because it seems that the diploid haematopoietic reservoir declines with time, it may be desirable to mobilize and collect diploid stem cells in order to store them as soon as diagnosis is possible when the WBC count has been controlled by hydroxyurea.","['Carella, A M', 'Cavaliere, M', 'Lerma, E', 'Corsetti, M T']","['Carella AM', 'Cavaliere M', 'Lerma E', 'Corsetti MT']","['Haematology and ABMT Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera e Cliniche, Universitarie Convenzionate, Ospedale San Martino, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Bailliere's best practice & research.

Although this remains presently uncertain, other advantages of ABSCT, such as a rapid haematopoietic recovery, were immediately recognized. In pilot studies, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were collected after standard induction and consolidation courses of chemotherapy. The actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse rates (RR) at 2-3 years ranged from 28 to 39% and 57 to 60%, respectively. Recently, PBSC collection after high-dose cytarabine, with or without G-CSF, has been associated with DFS ranging from 47 to 57%. Thus, the timing of stem cell collection seems to be crucial in AML and it should be performed following an efficient in vivo purging but before the haematopoietic reserve is exhausted. Clinical results with ABSCT are similar to those seen after autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT), although important issues such as potential contamination of stem cell collections and optimal timing of PBSC harvest remain to be clarified.

Thus, the use of an appropriate T-cell reduction or depletion technique might reduce this risk. The hazards of rejection and of a higher relapse rate should be avoided by maintaining a portion of the T-cells in the graft or by increasing the number of transplanted stem cells. The positive selection of CD34+ cells from peripheral blood preparations simultaneously provides an approximately 1,000-fold reduction of T-cells. Purified CD34+ cells containing committed and pluripotent stem cells are suitable for allogeneic transplantation. In transplantation from HLA-mismatched or three HLA-loci different family donors the amount of stem cells can be increased for reducing the incidence of rejection without increasing the T-cell number. In cases of poor marrow graft function a 'boost' with stem cells from the same family donor can be given. The risk of GvHD in transplantation from volunteer-matched unrelated donors might be reduced by T-cell depletion. If T-cells are used for enhancing the graft-versus-leukaemia effect, CD34+ enriched cells can be given for haematopoietic engraftment.","['Link, H']",['Link H'],"['Department of Internal Medicine I, Westpfalz Medical Centre, Kaiserslautern, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Bailliere's best practice & research.

These various successive improvements resulted in one of the most effective vaccines. Over the past years, different ways of improving the vaccine have been envisaged: change of cellular substrate, purifications, development of a new vaccine through genetical engineering. We will review these different approaches in order to gauge their advantages and drawbacks both from a legislative and pharmaceutical point of view.

The drug hydroxyurea (HU), a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, has been used in the treatment of a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases, such as cancer and sickle cell anaemia. Hydroxyurea has more recently been implicated for use in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, its major limitations have been due to its toxicity. Hydroxyurea selectively inhibits DNA synthesis and due to its brief duration, the drug is only toxic to those cells which are selectively synthesizing DNA during the period of exposure. The most important of these toxicities, and which serves as a dose limiting factor in treatment, is the induction of bone marrow suppression. In this study we investigated the possible beneficial effects of administering lithium (LiCl) to murine leukemia virus (MuLV) infected and non-infected long term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC). These cultures were then treated with either 0.2 mM hydroxyurea, 1.0 mM LiCl, or a combination of both. Samples were collected from LTBMC supernatants at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks post-treatment. Culture supernatants were then monitored to observe their repopulation of hematopoietic progenitors.

In the remaining 4 weeks, numbers of CFU-GM and BFU-E hematopoietic progenitors returned within normal range. The efficacy of Li-GLA in relieving retroviral hematopoietic bone marrow suppression correlates to a reduction in interleukin-4 (IL-4) secretion, normally elevated in association with LP-BMP5 infection. These data indicate that this reduction in bone marrow suppression of LP-BMP5 infected cells may be due to a killing of infected cells by the Li-GLA, rather than stimulating hematopoiesis as with other lithium compounds. To conclude this may indicate the possible dual effect of administration of LiGLA to virally infected individuals in reducing viral titre and to lower the toxicities associated with long term drug therapy.","['Oakley, O R', 'Hughes, N K', 'Birch, N J', 'Winther, M L', 'Horrobin, D F', 'Gallicchio, V S']","['Oakley OR', 'Hughes NK', 'Birch NJ', 'Winther ML', 'Horrobin DF', 'Gallicchio VS']","['Biomedical Research Laboratory, School of Health Sciences, University of Wolverhampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Romania,Rom J Physiol,Romanian journal of physiology : physiological sciences,9437433,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '78YC2MAX4O (gamma-Linolenic Acid)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/metabolism/*pathology/virology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Virus Replication', 'gamma-Linolenic Acid/*pharmacology']",,2000/09/23 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/23 11:00'],"['2000/09/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/23 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rom J Physiol. 1998 Jan-Jun;35(1-2):13-24.,,,,,,,,,,,

These viruses use the related sodium-phosphate symporters Pit1 and Pit2, respectively, as receptors in nonhamster cells, and evidence has suggested that the corresponding transporters of CHO cells may be masked by tunicamycin-sensitive secreted inhibitors. Although the E36 line of Chinese hamster cells was reported to secrete the putative Pit2 inhibitor and to be sensitive to the inhibitory CHO factors, E36 cells are highly susceptible to both GALV and A-MLV in the absence of tunicamycin. Moreover, expression of E36 Pit2 in CHO cells conferred tunicamycin-independent susceptibilities to both viruses. Based on the latter results, it was suggested that E36 Pit2 must functionally differ from the endogenous Pit2 of CHO cells. To test these ideas, we analyzed the receptor properties of CHO Pit1 and Pit2 in CHO cells. Surprisingly, and counterintuitively, transfection of a CHO Pit2 expression vector into CHO cells conferred strong susceptibility to both GALV and A-MLV, and similar overexpression of CHO Pit1 conferred susceptibility to GALV. Thus, CHO Pit2 is a promiscuous functional receptor for both viruses, and CHO Pit1 is a functional receptor for GALV. Similarly, we found that the natural resistance of Mus dunni tail fibroblasts to subgroup C feline leukemia viruses (FeLV-C) was eliminated simply by overexpression of the endogenous FeLV-C receptor homologue. These results demonstrate a novel and simple method to unmask latent retroviral receptor activities that occur in some cells. Specifically, resistances to retroviruses that are caused by subthreshold levels of receptor expression or by stoichiometrically limited masking or interference mechanisms can be efficiently overcome simply by overexpressing the endogenous receptors in the same cells.","['Tailor, C S', 'Nouri, A', 'Kabat, D']","['Tailor CS', 'Nouri A', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon 97201-3098, USA. tailorc@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/*analysis/physiology', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",,2000/09/23 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/23 11:00'],"['2000/09/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.20.9797-9801.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Oct;74(20):9797-801. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.20.9797-9801.2000.,"['GENBANK/AF239675', 'GENBANK/AF239767']","['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA083835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC112417,,,,,

K. Ghosh and D. V. Faller, J. Virol. 73:4931-4940, 1999). Genomic DNA of all healthy feline species also contains LTR-like sequences that are related to exogenous FeLV LTRs. In this study, we evaluated the cellular gene transactivational potential of these endogenous FeLV LTR sequences. Unlike their exogenous FeLV counterparts, neither nearly full-length endogenous FeLV molecular clones (CFE-6 and CFE-16) nor their isolated LTRs were able to activate collagenase IV gene or MCP-1 expression in transient transfection assays. We had also demonstrated previously that production of an RNA transcript from exogenous FeLV LTRs correlates with their transactivational activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that the endogenous FeLV LTRs do not generate LTR-specific RNA transcripts in the feline embryo fibroblast cell line AH927. Furthermore, infection of AH927 cells by an exogenous FeLV subgroup A virus did not induce production of such LTR-specific transcripts from the endogenous proviral genomes, although the LTR-specific transcripts from the exogenous virus were readily detected. Finally, LTR-specific transcripts were not generated in BALB/3T3 cells transiently transfected with isolated CFE-6 LTR, in contrast to transfections with LTRs from exogenous viruses. Our data thus suggest that the inability of endogenous FeLV LTRs in gene transactivation is not due to cell line specificity or presence of any upstream inhibitory cis-acting element. Endogenous, nonleukemogenic FeLV LTRs, therefore, do not transactivate cellular gene expression, and this property appears to be specific to exogenous, leukemogenic FeLVs.","['Ghosh, S K', 'Roy-Burman, P', 'Faller, D V']","['Ghosh SK', 'Roy-Burman P', 'Faller DV']","['Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA. sajal@bu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcriptional Activation']",,2000/09/23 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/23 11:00'],"['2000/09/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.20.9742-9748.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Oct;74(20):9742-8. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.20.9742-9748.2000.,,"['CA50459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P60AR20613/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC112408,,,,,

It is unclear whether R simply serves as a homologous sequence to mediate the strand transfer or contains specific sequences to promote strand transfer. To test the hypothesis that the molecular mechanism by which R mediates strand transfer is based on homology rather than specific sequences, we examined whether nonviral sequences can be used to facilitate minus-strand DNA transfer. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was divided into GF and FP fragments, containing the 5' and 3' portions of GFP, respectively, with an overlapping F fragment (85 bp). FP and GF were inserted into the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats, respectively, of a murine leukemia virus-based vector. Utilization of the F fragment to mediate minus-strand DNA transfer should reconstitute GFP during reverse transcription. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that GFP was expressed in 73 to 92% of the infected cells, depending on the structure of the viral construct. This indicated that GFP was reconstituted at a high frequency; molecular characterization further confirmed the accurate reconstitution of GFP. These data indicated that nonviral sequences could be used to efficiently mediate minus-strand DNA transfer. Therefore, placement and homology, not specific sequence context, are the important elements in R for minus-strand DNA transfer.

To test whether HTLV-1 variation is lower than other retroviruses, a tractable vector system has been developed to measure reverse transcription accuracy in one round of HTLV-1 replication. This system consists of a HTLV-1 vector that contains a cassette with the neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene, a bacterial origin of DNA replication, and the lacZalpha peptide gene region (the mutational target). The vector was replicated by trans-complementation with helper plasmids. The in vivo mutation rate for HTLV-1 was determined to be 7 x 10(-6) mutations per target base pair per replication cycle. The majority of the mutations identified were base substitution mutations, namely, G-to-A and C-to-T transitions, frameshift mutations, and deletion mutations. Mutation of the methionine residue in the conserved YMDD motif of the HTLV-1 reverse transcriptase to either alanine or valine (i.e., M188A or M188V) led to a factor of two increase in the rate of mutation, indicating the role of this motif in enzyme accuracy. The HTLV-1 in vivo mutation rate is comparable to that of bovine leukemia virus (BLV), another member of the HTLV/BLV genus of retroviruses, and is about fourfold lower than that of HIV-1. These observations indicate that while the mutation rate of HTLV-1 is significantly lower than HIV-1, this lower rate alone would not explain the low diversity in HTLV-1 isolates, supporting the hypothesis that HTLV-1 replicates primarily as a provirus during cellular DNA replication rather than as a virus via reverse transcription.","['Mansky, L M']",['Mansky LM'],"['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Arthur James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus 43210, USA. mansky.3@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Replication', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",,2000/09/23 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/23 11:00'],"['2000/09/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.20.9525-9531.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Oct;74(20):9525-31. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.20.9525-9531.2000.,,"['R01 GM056615/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 GM056615/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM56615/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC112382,,,,,

An escalating serious infection in immunocompromised patients.,2659-64,"BACKGROUND: Candida krusei is inherently resistant to fluconazole and is emerging as a frequent cause of fungemia in patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk and prognostic factors associated with C krusei fungemia in comparison with Candida albicans fungemia in patients with cancer. METHODS: Retrospective study of 57 cases of C krusei fungemia occurring at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tex, from 1989 to 1996. The C krusei cases were compared with 57 cases of C albicans fungemia with respect to demographics, underlying cancer, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, immunosuppression status, chemotherapy, and the use of central venous catheters, as well as fluconazole prophylaxis. RESULTS: At our institution, C krusei accounted for 5% of fungemias during 1989 through 1992 and for 10% during 1993 through 1996. Patients with C krusei fungemia more often had leukemia than patients with C albicans (77% vs 11%; P =.02), whereas catheter-related infections were more common among patients with C albicans fungemia (42% vs 0%; P<.001). Patients with C krusei fungemia had a lower response rate (51% vs 69%; P =.05), largely because they more frequently were neutropenic and had disseminated infection. Mortality related to fungemia was 49% in the cases with C krusei vs 28% in C albicans. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that persistent neutropenia (P =.02) and septic shock (P =.002) were predictors of poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: In neutropenic patients, C krusei fungemia is associated with high mortality. It should be suspected in patients with leukemia who are receiving fluconazole prophylaxis and should be treated aggressively with an amphotericin B regimen.","['Abbas, J', 'Bodey, G P', 'Hanna, H A', 'Mardani, M', 'Girgawy, E', 'Abi-Said, D', 'Whimbey, E', 'Hachem, R', 'Raad, I']","['Abbas J', 'Bodey GP', 'Hanna HA', 'Mardani M', 'Girgawy E', 'Abi-Said D', 'Whimbey E', 'Hachem R', 'Raad I']","['The University of Texas M.

New analogues and derivatives have been synthesized from the S16020-2 compound. Preliminary data indicate that S30972-1, one of these S16020-2 derivatives, may exhibit a comparatively higher level of antitumor potency associated with an improved therapeutic index than does S16020-2. The antitumor activities of S16020-2 and S30972-1 were therefore characterized both in vitro and in vivo, with Adriamycin and etoposide chosen as reference compounds. The in vitro data show that S30972-1 is a topoisomerase II inhibitor, mediating its activity through an ATP-dependent mechanism such as S16020-2. The two olivacine derivatives exhibited similar activities in vitro at the levels of the global growth of six human cancer cell lines, of the induction of apoptosis, and of the G2 cell cycle phase arrest. The in vivo antitumor activity characterization included the use of two murine leukemia types (P388-LEU and L1210-LEU), two murine lymphoma-like models (P388-LYM and L1210-LYM), two mammary adenocarcinomas (MXT-HI and MXT-HS), and one melanoma (B16). The data show that S30972-1 is actually more efficient in vivo than S16020-2, a feature that may relate to the fact that S30972-1 is less toxic than S16020-2. The S30972-1 compound exhibited in vivo a level of antitumor activity that was also actually higher than that exhibited by Adriamycin and similar to that exhibited by etoposide.","['Malonne, H', 'Farinelle, S', 'Decaestecker, C', 'Gordower, L', 'Fontaine, J', 'Chaminade, F', 'Saucier, J M', 'Atassi, G', 'Kiss, R']","['Malonne H', 'Farinelle S', 'Decaestecker C', 'Gordower L', 'Fontaine J', 'Chaminade F', 'Saucier JM', 'Atassi G', 'Kiss R']","['Laboratoire de Physiologie et de Pharmacologie Fondamentales, Institut de Pharmacie, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (S 16020-2)', '0 (S30972-1)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2000/09/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/22 11:00'],"['2000/09/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/22 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Sep;6(9):3774-82.,,,,,,,,,,,

We have sought to examine this phenomenon in two lymphoblastoid cell lines. After continuous or short-term exposure to etoposide (final concentration, 0.5 microM), up to 80% of cells accumulated at G2-M by 24 h, and subsequently either underwent apoptosis or re-entered the cell cycle. In this and the other studies undertaken, the CEM and MOLT-4 lines behaved similarly. Progressive accumulation of cells at G2-M was accompanied by increasing levels of cyclin B1. Commitment to apoptosis was assessed by evidence of caspase activation using a number of different criteria. A decreased amount of Mr 32,000 procaspase-3 was evident 24-48 h after drug treatment. However, cleavage of caspase substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamin B indicated caspase activation occurring within 3-6 h of drug treatment. Protease activity in corresponding cell extracts increased progressively from 6 h or earlier to 24 h after the addition of etoposide to the medium. Such increase was consequent on drug treatment and not attributable to cells being at G2-M. Treatment with 1.5 mM caffeine abrogated etoposide-induced G2-M arrest, and in cells so treated, the etoposide-induced increase in protease activity was also abrogated. However, there was no impact of caffeine on cytotoxicity under these conditions. Although mitotic cell death is precipitated subsequent to prolonged G2-M arrest in many cell types, the present data suggest that commitment to apoptosis occurs in parallel to G2-M arrest in leukemic cells.","['Sleiman, R J', 'Stewart, B W']","['Sleiman RJ', 'Stewart BW']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Sydney Children's Hospital, New South Wales.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mitosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/09/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/22 11:00'],"['2000/09/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/22 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Sep;6(9):3756-65.,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, MTA transport was characterized in wild-type L1210 cells and variants with impaired membrane transport or polyglutamation. MTA influx via the reduced folate carrier was somewhat faster (approximately 30%) than that for methotrexate (MTX). Unlike MTX, MTA was rapidly polyglutamated in L1210 cells; hence, a folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase-deficient L1210 variant was used to assess net transport and efflux properties. The MTA transmembrane gradient for exchangeable drug was 2.5 times greater than the MTX gradient, attributable primarily to an efflux rate constant 40% that of MTX. No MTA was bound to dihydrofolate reductase. When grown with folic acid, MTX-resistant L1210 variants with mutations in the reduced folate carrier demonstrated cross-resistance to MTA, markedly reduced MTA accumulation, and only a slightly decreased intracellular folate cofactor pool as compared to L1210 cells. However, when 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was the growth substrate, these MTX-resistant cells were less resistant or negligibly resistant to MTA, accumulated more MTA, and had a lower folate pool as compared to L1210 cells. MTA activity and the intracellular folate pool in L1210 cells were inversely related. These data indicate that MTA polyglutamation in L1210 cells is favored by both the generation of high intracellular drug levels and high MTA affinity for FPGS relative to MTX. Cells resistant to MTX because of impaired transport may retain appreciable sensitivity to MTA because of a concurrent reduction in tetrahydrofolate cofactor transport resulting in cellular folate depletion, which diminishes endogenous folate suppression of MTA polyglutamation.","['Zhao, R', 'Babani, S', 'Gao, F', 'Liu, L', 'Goldman, I D']","['Zhao R', 'Babani S', 'Gao F', 'Liu L', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Prostaglandins A)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VYR271N44P (prostaglandin A1)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacokinetics', 'Glutamates/*pharmacokinetics', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leucovorin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Pemetrexed', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/biosynthesis', 'Prostaglandins A/pharmacology']",,2000/09/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/22 11:00'],"['2000/09/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/22 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Sep;6(9):3687-95.,,"['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-82621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

However, a small minority of patients receiving RTX monotherapy will experience grade III/IV gastrointestinal toxicity that can be life-threatening, particularly if copresenting with neutropenia. Lack of vigilance in recognition and treatment of symptoms of toxicity or violations of protocol have led to treatment-related deaths in some hospitals. The safety of RTX could be improved if an effective rescue agent was available. Leucovorin (LV) is a reduced folate cofactor that competes with RTX for transport and polyglutamation in both tumor and normal tissues and thus has potential as a rescue agent. In vitro cell studies are presented suggesting that the growth-inhibitory, and potentially cytotoxic, effects of RTX on populations of viable cells can be reversed by the delayed administration of LV. The mechanisms involved are inhibition of further drug uptake and polyglutamation and a redistribution and/or reduction in the concentration of preformed raltitrexed polyglutamates. A more clinically relevant in vivo mouse model was used to test the hypothesis further. BALB/c mice treated with 100 mg/kg/day x 4 days of RTX were used as a model for gastrointestinal and bone marrow toxicity. LV (200 mg/kg), which was given after the onset of severe weight loss and diarrhea (twice daily, days 5-7), prevented further weight loss and induced earlier recovery. This was accompanied by improvement in the histological appearance of the intestine (day 7) and the concentration of neutrophils and platelets in the blood (day 9). BALB/c mice could not tolerate 100 mg/kg daily x 5 days unless LV (200 mg/kg twice daily) was given on days 6-8. Measurement of RTX (polyglutamates) by RIA after 100 mg/kg RTX daily (days 1-4) showed less drug in plasma (3-4-fold), liver (8-11-fold), kidney (3-4-fold), and small intestinal epithelium (3-4-fold) on day 7 in LV-treated mice (100 or 200 mg/kg twice daily) compared with controls. A single injection of 100 mg/kg RTX (day 1) gave plasma levels of 3-4 pmol/ml on day 4 that are more clinically relevant. Administration of LV (100 or 200 mg/kg; twice daily on days 4-6) reduced the RTX concentration in the liver 2-4-fold on days 7, 9, and 11 compared with controls. A model is proposed where LV and/or its anabolic products can compete with RTX uptake into tissues and interfere with the homeostatic regulation of RTX polyglutamates. These data support the use of LV rescue in the small minority of patients treated with RTX who present with a severe pattern of antiproliferative toxicities. The use of LV is not recommended routinely because the antitumor activity of RTX may similarly be reversed.","['Farrugia, D C', 'Aherne, G W', 'Brunton, L', 'Clarke, S J', 'Jackman, A L']","['Farrugia DC', 'Aherne GW', 'Brunton L', 'Clarke SJ', 'Jackman AL']","['The CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects/pathology', 'Intestine, Small/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Leucovorin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Polyglutamic Acid/biosynthesis', 'Quinazolines/blood/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Thiophenes/blood/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/prevention & control']",,2000/09/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/22 11:00'],"['2000/09/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/22 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Sep;6(9):3646-56.,,,,,,,,,,,

Ligation of membrane-expressed Fas can induce apoptosis, and Fas-mediated signaling seems to be involved in T-cell-induced apoptosis of human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts. The local release of sFas by AML blasts may then function as a protective mechanism by competing with membrane-bound Fas for binding sites on the common Fas ligand (FasL). sFas was released by AML blasts during in vitro culture, and this release was modulated by several cytokines that can be secreted by activated T cells. Increased levels of sFas could be detected during in vitro activation of T cells in the presence of native AML accessory cells, and this was observed both for (i) mitogenic activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones derived from acute leukemia patients with therapy-induced leukopenia and (ii) allostimulated activation of T cells derived from normal donors. However, local in vivo levels of sFas will also be influenced by variations in systemic levels. High serum levels of sFas were detected in acute leukemia patients during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia, but these levels decreased during complicating bacterial infections. In contrast, serum levels of sFasL were normal in leukopenic patients. The present results support the hypothesis that local release of sFas can function as a protective mechanism against AML-reactive T cells, but the effects of this local release are, in addition, modulated by variations in systemic levels of sFas (but not sFasL).","['Bruserud, O', 'Ulvestad, E']","['Bruserud O', 'Ulvestad E']","['Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology', 'Solubility', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/*blood/immunology']",,2000/09/22 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/09/22 11:00'],"['2000/09/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/22 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002620000133 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2000 Sep;49(7):377-87. doi: 10.1007/s002620000133.,,,,,,,,,,,

Although berberine had been demonstrated to have antineoplastic function by inhibiting DNA-synthesis in activated lymphocytes, there is no available information to address berberine affects on human leukemia cell N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and 2-aminofluorene (AF)-DNA adduct formation. Thus, berberine was tested for inhibition of arylamine NAT activity and AF-DNA adduct formation in human leukemia cells. The NAT activity was measured by a high performance liquid chromatography assaying for the amounts of N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF) and N-acetyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (N-Ac-PABA) and the remaining AF and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). The NAT activity and AF-DNA adduct formation in human leukemia cells were inhibited by berberine in a dose-dependent manner, i.e. the higher the concentration of berberine, the higher the inhibition of NAT activity and AF-DNA adduct. The data also indicate that berberine decreased the apparent values of Km and Vmax from human leukemia cells in both cytosol and intact cells.","['Chung, J G', 'Chen, G W', 'Hung, C F', 'Lee, J H', 'Ho, C C', 'Ho, H C', 'Chang, H L', 'Lin, W C', 'Lin, J G']","['Chung JG', 'Chen GW', 'Hung CF', 'Lee JH', 'Ho CC', 'Ho HC', 'Chang HL', 'Lin WC', 'Lin JG']","['Department of Microbiology, China Medical College, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Fluorenes)', '0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)', '3A69OS195N (2-aminofluorene)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/*drug effects', 'Berberine/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/pharmacology', 'Fluorenes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology']",,2000/09/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/22 11:00'],"['2000/09/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/22 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0192415X00000271 [pii]', '10.1142/S0192415X00000271 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Chin Med. 2000;28(2):227-38. doi: 10.1142/S0192415X00000271.,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to develop a rapid molecular assay for the detection of the two most commonly reported variants of BCR-ABL fusion gene, B2A2 and B3A2 in CML patients. Bone marrow or peripheral blood were used for RNA extraction and reverse-transcribed to cDNA for PCR amplification. 92 per cent of CML patients (91/99) were positive for BCR-ABL gene (61% B3A2 and 31% B2A2). 8/99 CML patients were BCR-ABL-negative. B3A2 and B2A2-positive patients did not have any different clinical and hematological features at presentation although B3A2 patients tended to be slightly older and had higher platelet counts. 71/71 non-CML including other MPD and leukemia cases were all negative for BCR-ABL gene. In conclusion, a rapid RT-PCR assay has now been developed for the detection of this hallmark gene in CML patients. It should be of great value in the differential diagnosis of CML from other diseases. Long-term follow-ups of CML patients with different variants are needed to determine the prognostic importance of each gene variant.","['Udomsakdi-Auewarakul, C', 'U-Pratya, Y', 'Boonmoh, S', 'Vatanavicharn, S']","['Udomsakdi-Auewarakul C', 'U-Pratya Y', 'Boonmoh S', 'Vatanavicharn S']","['Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/blood/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Thailand']",,2000/09/22 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/22 11:00'],"['2000/09/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/22 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2000 Aug;83(8):928-35.,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyt. c that had bound to CL liposomes was liberated on peroxidation of the liposomes by a radical. The generation of CL-OOH in mitochondria occurred before the release of cyt. c in rat basophile leukaemia (RBL)2H3 cells that had been induced to undergo apoptosis by exposure to hypoglycaemia with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). The amount of cyt. c bound to CL prepared from the mitochondria of 2DG-treated cells was lower than that of untreated cells. The release of cyt. c was completely suppressed when the production of CL-OOH in mitochondria was inhibited by the overexpression of mitochondrial phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx). The fluorescence from CL-labelling dye (10-N-nonyl Acridine Orange) decreased on the induction of apoptosis by 2DG. However, no decrease in fluorescence was observed in PHGPx-overexpressing cells. Cyt. c was released from mitochondria that had been isolated from control cells on peroxidation by t-butylhydroperoxide, but no similar liberation of cyt. c from mitochondria isolated from mitochondrial PHGPx-overexpressing cells was observed.

A set of four STR markers was used with a highly discrimative capacity between individuals. STRs were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were analysed by gene scanning (STR-GS). Between June 1990 and December 1998, 52 patients treated with BMT for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) were analysed. Seventeen patients relapsed after BMT and two patients never achieved remission after BMT. Fourteen of the 17 patients achieved a complete donor chimaerism after BMT, as detected by the presence of only donor STR-GS fragments, and in three cases a weak recipient STR-GS signal remained persistently detectable after BMT. A reappearance or increase of recipient STR-GS signals was indicative of relapse, which was mostly detected by STR-GS several months before relapse was diagnosed clinically. Nineteen patients were treated with DLI for reappearance of CML after BMT which resulted in complete remission in 17 patients, concordant with the disappearance of recipient STR-GS signals. More importantly, DLI treatment could be guided based upon the STR-GS data, which prevented unnecessary extra DLI courses that could cause toxicity. This study indicates that STR-GS is an effective and reliable method for monitoring BMT recipients.","['de Weger, R A', 'Tilanus, M G', 'Scheidel, K C', 'van den Tweel, J G', 'Verdonck, L F']","['de Weger RA', 'Tilanus MG', 'Scheidel KC', 'van den Tweel JG', 'Verdonck LF']","['Departments of Pathology and Haematology, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands. r.deweger@lab.azu.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/09/21 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/21 11:00'],"['2000/09/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/21 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2233 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02233.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Sep;110(3):647-53. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02233.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

Alternative stem cell sources have been used more recently, such as unrelated donors, non-identical family members or autologous transplants. This analysis of 1378 transplants reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) addresses the outcome of the varying procedures according to the known risk factors. The estimated disease-free survival (DFS) and estimated relapse risk at 3 years were both 36% for 885 patients transplanted with stem cells from matched siblings. In the multivariate analysis, age and stage of disease had independent prognostic significance for DFS, survival and treatment-related mortality. Patients transplanted at an early stage of disease had a significantly lower risk of relapse than patients transplanted at more advanced stages. The estimated DFS at 3 years was 25% for the 198 patients with voluntary unrelated donors, 28% for the 91 patients with alternative family donors and 33% for the 126 patients autografted in first complete remission. The non-relapse mortality was 58% for patients with unrelated donors, 66% for patients with non-identical family donors and 25% for autografted patients. The relapse rate of 18% was relatively low for patients with non-identical family donors, 41% for patients with unrelated donors and 55% for patients treated with autologous stem cell transplantation. Both allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation have emerged as treatment options for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Transplantation with an HLA-identical sibling donor is the preferred treatment option. Patients without an HLA-identical sibling donor may be treated with either autologous stem cell transplantation or an alternative donor transplantation. Patients younger than 20 years may be treated with an unrelated donor transplantation. Patients older than 40 years, and probably also patients between 20 and 40 years, may benefit most from an autologous stem cell transplantation.","['de Witte, T', 'Hermans, J', 'Vossen, J', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Meloni, G', 'Jacobsen, N', 'Ruutu, T', 'Ljungman, P', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Runde, V', 'Niederwieser, D', 'van Biezen, A', 'Devergie, A', 'Cornelissen, J', 'Jouet, J P', 'Arnold, R', 'Apperley, J']","['de Witte T', 'Hermans J', 'Vossen J', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Meloni G', 'Jacobsen N', 'Ruutu T', 'Ljungman P', 'Gratwohl A', 'Runde V', 'Niederwieser D', 'van Biezen A', 'Devergie A', 'Cornelissen J', 'Jouet JP', 'Arnold R', 'Apperley J']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital St Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. t.dewitte@hemat.azn.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,['Haematologica. 2006 Jun;91(6):723A.

About one in 300 individuals are homozygous for a TPMT mutation associated with very low enzyme activity and severe myelosuppression if treated with standard doses of drug. To validate the use of molecular genetic techniques for the detection of TPMT deficiency, we have determined red blood cell TPMT activity in 240 adult blood donors and 55 normal children. Genotype was determined by restriction fragment length analysis of polymerase chain reaction products in a cohort of 79 of the blood donors and five cases of azathioprine-induced myelosupression, and this confirmed a close relationship between genotype and phenotype. In 17 of the 24 cases in which mutations were found, DNA was also available from remission bone marrow. In one of these cases, DNA from the remission marrow sample indicated the presence of a non-mutated allele that had not been seen in the blast DNA sample obtained at presentation. These results indicate that polymerase chain reaction-based assays give reliable and robust results for the detection of TPMT deficiency, but that caution should be exercised in relying exclusively on DNA obtained from lymphoblasts in childhood leukaemia.","['Coulthard, S A', 'Rabello, C', 'Robson, J', 'Howell, C', 'Minto, L', 'Middleton, P G', 'Gandhi, M K', 'Jackson, G', 'McLelland, J', ""O'Brien, H"", 'Smith, S', 'Reid, M M', 'Pearson, A D', 'Hall, A G']","['Coulthard SA', 'Rabello C', 'Robson J', 'Howell C', 'Minto L', 'Middleton PG', 'Gandhi MK', 'Jackson G', 'McLelland J', ""O'Brien H"", 'Smith S', 'Reid MM', 'Pearson AD', 'Hall AG']","['The LRF Molecular Pharmacology Specialist Programme, Medical School, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Azathioprine/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Blood Donors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Methyltransferases/blood/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Thioguanine/chemistry/pharmacology']",,2000/09/21 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/21 11:00'],"['2000/09/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/21 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2218 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02218.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Sep;110(3):599-604. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02218.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten of the 26 patients treated with intensive chemotherapy achieved complete remission including six out of 16 MRP1+ and four out of ten MRP1- cases (P = NS). In conclusion, MRP1 expression was correlated with disease stage in MDS in our study. As for P-gp, discordant expression/function of MRP1 could be found in some cases, suggesting the existence of non-functional transport proteins in MDS.

This is thought to be as a result of the apoptosis of haematopoietic bone marrow cells resulting in ineffective haematopoiesis. To clarify the relationship between prognosis and apoptosis and/or cell proliferation in the bone marrow, we studied 51 cases with MDS. Bone marrow biopsies were stained immunohistochemically for MIB-1 (marker for proliferating cells) and CD34 (marker for stem cells). Apoptosis was visualized by detection of DNA fragmentation using TdT incorporation of nucleotides on 3' ends of DNA (TUNEL technique) and expressed as the apoptotic rate. MDS patients included 32 with refractory anaemia (RA), one RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) patient, seven RA with excess of blasts (RAEB) patients, eight patients with RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) and three patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMMoL). In addition, we also studied six cases with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) arising from MDS (AML-MDS) and ten control subjects. Fatal pancytopenia was the cause of death in 19 out of 51 patients. The apoptotic rate was higher in MDS patients (5.5%) than in control subjects (0.6%) and AML-MDS patients (0.4%). The percentage of MIB-1 positive cells was higher in MDS and AML-MDS than in control. The percentage of CD34-positive cells was higher in AML-MDS, RAEB, RAEB-t and CMMoL patients than control subjects and RA patients. Our findings indicate the activation of both the proliferative and apoptotic rates in MDS. Poor prognosis correlated significantly with higher apoptotic rates, but not with percentages of MIB-1 and CD34-positive cells.

However, the relatively short follow-up (median 27 months) did not enable the evaluation of the risk of developing secondary malignancies. In this study, we report the long-term outcome of the 114 patients included in the trial: 56 patients randomized to receive HU and 58 patients to receive no cytoreductive therapy. Before randomization, 15 patients had been treated with busulphan. During the observation period, 29 patients (50%) shifted from the control to the HU group mainly because of thrombosis. Median follow-up was 73 months (range 3-94). Analysis was by intention to treat and, when indicated, by treatment. When analysed by intention to treat, 46 out of 54 patients (85%) originally randomized in the HU group are alive, compared with 49 of 58 patients (84%) in the control group [not significant (n.s.)]. Five patients (9%) in the HU group and 26 patients (45%) in the control group had thrombosis (P < 0.0001). Seven patients (13%) in the HU group developed secondary acute leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes or solid tumours, compared with only one of the control group patients (1.7%) (P = 0.032). The occurrence of secondary malignancies was also analysed by treatment: none of the 20 patients who had never been treated with chemotherapy developed neoplasia vs. three of the 77 patients given HU only (3.9% n.s.) and five of the 15 patients given busulphan plus HU (33% P < 0. 0001). This study showed that: (a) HU reduced the risk of thrombosis in ET patients; (b) the sequential use of busulphan and HU significantly increased the risk of second malignancies; and (c) overall survival was not affected by HU therapy.","['Finazzi, G', 'Ruggeri, M', 'Rodeghiero, F', 'Barbui, T']","['Finazzi G', 'Ruggeri M', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Barbui T']","['Divisions of Haematology, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, and Ospedale S.

We analysed SDF-1-induced intracellular calcium fluxes in leukaemic blasts from the peripheral blood of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-lineage ALL), determined the effect of BM stromal cell-conditioned medium on in vitro transendothelial migration (TM) and measured expression of the SDF-1 receptor, CXCR4, by flow cytometry. AML FAB M1/2 blasts did not show calcium fluxes and TM was not stimulated. In myelomonocytic AML (M4/5), however, SDF-1 induced significant calcium fluxes and TM was increased twofold by the conditioned medium. M3 and M4 blasts with eosinophilia (M4eo) showed intermediate activity and M6 blasts showed no functional activity. In ALL, strong calcium fluxes and increased TM (2.5-fold) were observed. Accordingly, expression of CXCR4 was low in undifferentiated (M0) AML, myeloid (M1/2) AML and erythroid (M6) AML, but high [mean fluorescence (MF) > 50] in promyelocytic (M3) AML, myelomonocytic (M4/5) AML and B-lineage ALL. We conclude that, in AML, SDF-1 is preferentially active in myelomonocytic blasts as a result of differentiation-related expression of CXCR4. Functional activity of SDF-1 and high expression of CXCR4 in B-lineage ALL is in accordance with the previously described activity of SDF-1 in early B cells. SDF-1 may contribute to leukaemic marrow infiltration, as suggested by increased CXCR4 expression and migratory response in BM-derived blasts compared with circulating cells.","['Mohle, R', 'Schittenhelm, M', 'Failenschmid, C', 'Bautz, F', 'Kratz-Albers, K', 'Serve, H', 'Brugger, W', 'Kanz, L']","['Mohle R', 'Schittenhelm M', 'Failenschmid C', 'Bautz F', 'Kratz-Albers K', 'Serve H', 'Brugger W', 'Kanz L']","['Department of Medicine II, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, and Department of Medicine A, University of Munster, Germany. rtmoehle@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism']",,2000/09/21 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/21 11:00'],"['2000/09/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/21 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2157 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02157.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Sep;110(3):563-72. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02157.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of the PKC inhibitors on leukaemic cells obtained from three APL patients was also studied. We also evaluated the possible involvement of the caspases in apoptosis induced by PKC inhibitors. Significant time- and concentration-dependent apoptotic changes were demonstrated using Go6976 and safingol. In addition, our results demonstrated that the caspases were involved in the apoptosis induced by the PKC inhibitors.

Fresh tumour material from paediatric patients, negative for the common translocation t(8;14), was analysed using a long-distance (LD) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach.

Its mechanism of action is via specific binding to gp130 and either the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) or oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) systems at the cell surface to form an active signalling complex. RESULTS: We report here the crystal structure of human oncostatin M (hOSM) along with mutagenesis data which map the receptor-binding epitopes of the molecule. The structure was determined to a resolution of 2.2 A and conforms to the haematopoietin cytokine up-up-down-down four-helix bundle topology. The site 2 epitope, responsible for gp130 binding, is centred around Gly120 which forms a 'dimple' on the surface of the molecule located on helices A and C. The site 3 motif, responsible for LIFR and OSMR binding, consists of a protruding Phe160/Lys163 pair located at the start of helix D. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented allow functional dissection of the receptor-binding interfaces to atomic resolution. Modelling suggests that the gp130 residue Phe169 packs into the site 2 dimple in an analogous fashion to structurally equivalent residues at the growth hormone-growth hormone receptor interface, implying that certain key features may underlie recognition across the whole cytokine/receptor superfamily. Conversely, detailed comparison of the available structures suggests that variations on a common theme dictate the specificity of receptor-ligand interactions within the gp130 family of cytokines.","['Deller, M C', 'Hudson, K R', 'Ikemizu, S', 'Bravo, J', 'Jones, E Y', 'Heath, J K']","['Deller MC', 'Hudson KR', 'Ikemizu S', 'Bravo J', 'Jones EY', 'Heath JK']","['Division of Structural Biology, The Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Structure,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",101087697,"['0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,,"['Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Signal Transduction']",,2000/09/21 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/21 11:00'],"['2000/09/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/21 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0969-2126(00)00176-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0969-2126(00)00176-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Structure. 2000 Aug 15;8(8):863-74. doi: 10.1016/s0969-2126(00)00176-3.,['PDB/1EVS'],,,,,,,,,,

The NOPHO Leukemia Cytogenetic Study Group.,194-200,"Different types of leukemia are characterized by different patterns of nonrandom chromosomal aberrations, but the frequencies with which the various karyotypic subtypes are seen differ among cytogenetic laboratories, countries, and geographic regions. During the 12-yr period 1986-1997, a total of 2054 children (< 15 yr of age) were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden). Cytogenetic analyses were successfully performed in 1372 patients, 787 (57%) of whom displayed clonal chromosomal abnormalities. ALL with > or = 47 chromosomes was the most frequent cytogenetic subgroup (63%), with massive hyperdiploidy (> or = 52 chromosomes) and chromosome numbers in the tri- and tetraploid range, constituting 46% of all abnormal cases. ALL-associated translocations were found at low frequencies [11q23 translocations in 3.7%, t(9;22)(q34;q11) or del(22q) in 2.2%, t(4; 11)(q21;q23) in 2.0%, t(11;19)(q23;p13) in 1.40%, t(1;19)(q23;p13) in 1.3%, and t(8;14)(q24;q32) in 1%]. Two rearrangements not previously reported in childhood ALL, but recurrent in this population-based material, were identified: der(7;9)(q10;q10) and t(9;12)(q22;p11-12), the molecular genetic consequences of which are unknown. Hyperdiploid childhood leukemias, especially those with a high hyperdiploid modal number, thus seem to be more frequent and ALL-specific translocations less frequent in the Nordic countries than in other geographic regions. Although technical differences among laboratories cannot be ruled out as a cause of at least some of the frequency differences observed compared with previous studies, systematic differences in exposure to environmental oncogenic factors or in geographic/ethnic origin are an intriguing possibility.","['Forestier, E', 'Johansson, B', 'Borgstrom, G', 'Kerndrup, G', 'Johansson, J', 'Heim, S']","['Forestier E', 'Johansson B', 'Borgstrom G', 'Kerndrup G', 'Johansson J', 'Heim S']","['Department of Clinical Science, University of Umea, Sweden.

First, we found that activation of CXCR4 in human T cell lines (Jurkat and ATL-2) rapidly induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (p44 ERK-1 and p42 ERK-2). Next, we became interested in CXCR4-mediated signaling in normal hematopoietic cells, and employed human megakaryoblasts, which highly express CXCR4 as a model. We found that stimulation of these cells with SDF-1alpha led to the phosphorylation of MAPK and serine/threonine kinase AKT as well. Activation of MAPK further led to the phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor ELK-1. Phosphorylation of ELK-1 in megakaryoblasts implies that phosphorylated MAPK translocate from cytoplasm into the nucleus where they may phosphorylate some nuclear proteins. Note that neither MAPK nor AKT was phosphorylated in normal human platelets after stimulation by SDF-1. We conclude that both MAPK and AKT are involved in signal transduction pathways from the CXCR4 receptor in malignant and normal human hematopoietic cells. The biological consequences of MAPK, ELK-1 and AKT phosphorylation in megakaryoblasts after stimulation with SDF-1alpha require further studies.","['Majka, M', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Kowalska, M A', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Majka M', 'Ratajczak J', 'Kowalska MA', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELK1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ets-Domain Protein Elk-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-1']",,2000/09/21 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/21 11:00'],"['2000/09/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/21 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.90112.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2000 Mar;64(3):164-72. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.90112.x.,,['R01 HL61796-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Hemostatic evaluations showed an earlier reduction of D-dimer in the ATRA group. No cases of morphological resistance were observed in the ATRA group after induction.

The relationship between mortality on-the-job exposure was studied using linear regression methods. Large differences in cancer mortality were seen. In men, the geographical pattern was very stable and reveals a significant association with the distribution of certain high-risk jobs.

Continuous exposure to 50 nM ara-C led to marked induction of p21CIP1 at 48-72 h in empty-vector control cells but not in their antisense-expressing counterparts (p21AS/F4 and B8). Such treatment induced expression of the myelomonocytic differentiation marker CD11b in approximately 35% of control cells, but no evidence of maturation was noted in antisense-expressing lines. However, antisense-expressing cells exposed to low concentrations of ara-C exhibited a reciprocal increase in apoptosis, manifested by the appearance of cells with classic morphologic features and hypodiploid quantities of DNA, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsim), an increase in cytochrome c release into the cytosol, cleavage/activation of procaspases-9 and -3, and degradation of PARP and p27Kip1. Whereas empty-vector control cells exposed to 50 nM ara-C exhibited a decline in Bcl-2 expression, dephosphorylation of pRb, and an initial accumulation in S-phase, antisense-expressing cells did not. However, c-Myc down-regulation induced by low concentrations of ara-C was, if anything, more complete in antisense-expressing cells. Exposure of control but not antisense-expressing cells to ara-C led to phosphorylation/activation of MAP kinase at 24 h; moreover, the specific MEK/MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 enhanced low-dose ara-C-mediated apoptosis only in wild-type cells. Lastly, exposure to 50 nM ara-C for 72 h resulted in detectable levels of cytoplasmic p21CIP1, a phenomenon associated with resistance to apoptosis, only in empty vector controls. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a functional role for p21CIP1 in leukemic cell maturation induced by low concentrations of ara-C. They also indicate that, as in the case of more conventional differentiation-inducers such as phorbol esters, disruption of the p21CIP1 response after exposure to low concentrations of the cytotoxic drug ara-C prevents leukemic cells from engaging a maturation program, but instead directs them along an apoptotic pathway.","['Wang, Z', 'Wang, S', 'Fisher, P B', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Wang Z', 'Wang S', 'Fisher PB', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/09/21 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/21 11:00'],"['2000/09/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/21 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60569-7 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.2000.066001001.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2000 Aug;66(1):1-13. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.2000.066001001.x.,,"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

There is an open reading frame of 398 amino acids, which would encode a protein of 45 kD. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the STORP gene has a ubiquitous pattern of expression similar to that of the PML gene. Hybridization of STORP cDNA probe to genomic DNA from other species demonstrated that the STORP gene is conserved among mammalian vertebrates and that the physical linkage with PML is conserved in mice. Unlike PML, the STORP gene is not induced by interferon alpha (IFNalpha), and thus can be distinctly regulated from the PML gene. STORP is homologous to the EPB72 gene coding for the erythrocyte band 7 integral membrane protein or stomatin, which is deficient in a certain form of hereditary stomatocytosis. The function of STORP is unknown. Further study will focus on studying its potential role in red cell function and disorders.","['Gilles, F', 'Glenn, M', 'Goy, A', 'Remache, Y', 'Zelenetz, A D']","['Gilles F', 'Glenn M', 'Goy A', 'Remache Y', 'Zelenetz AD']","['Molecular Biology Program of Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Hospital, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (STOML2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', '*Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,2000/09/21 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/21 11:00'],"['2000/09/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/21 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.90054.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2000 Feb;64(2):104-13. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.90054.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

Selected CD34+ cells were stimulated with interleukin 1(beta), interleukin IL-3, interleukin IL-6 and stem cell factor. The proliferation observed in patients with CML was similar to that seen in normal donors. CD34+ cells derived from patients with CML are more differentiated than their normal counterparts, as shown by the coexpression of CD34 and CD33 antigens on day 0 (85.6% for CML-BM and 76.8% for CML-PB). The culture conditions allowed a significant expansion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) from NBM (33-fold increase) and MPB (22-fold increase), in contrast with CML-derived BM and PB CD34+ cells (2.3-fold increase).

In the present study we examined the expression of bcl-2 and bax, which has an antagonistic role against the function of bcl-2, in cells from CLL patients at different stages of the disease, by immunoblot analysis. A direct association between the stage of the disease and the level of bcl-2 in the patients' cells was observed. At stages A and B, 33% and 29% of patients, respectively, expressed high levels of bcl-2, as opposed to 80% of patients at stage C (p= 0.019). Bax level was not significantly associated with the stage of the disease, although patients at stage C had higher levels of bax. In this study we found a trend of association between bcl-2 and bax levels. Analysis including all patients revealed that 65% of the patients who expressed high levels of bcl-2 had high levels of bax (p = 0.058). Of patients in stage C, 45% expressed high levels of both bcl-2 and bax while 50% and 42% of patients at stages A and B had low levels of both proteins.","['Aviram, A', 'Rabizadeh, E', 'Zimra, Y', 'Yeshoron, M', 'Marmelstein, M', 'Shaklai, M', 'Bairey, O']","['Aviram A', 'Rabizadeh E', 'Zimra Y', 'Yeshoron M', 'Marmelstein M', 'Shaklai M', 'Bairey O']","['Division of Haematology, Rabin Medical Center, Petach-Tikva, Israel. aviramar@netvision.net.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2000/09/21 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/21 11:00'],"['2000/09/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/21 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.90042.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2000 Feb;64(2):80-4. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.90042.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

All cases were reviewed and classified according to the clinical and morphological FAB criteria. The percentage of CD34-positive (CD34 +) hematopoietic cells and the number of clusters of CD34+ cells in 10 HPF were determined. In most cases the CD34+ cell count was similar to the blast percentage determined morphologically. In RA, however, not only typical blasts but also less immature hemopoietic cells lying morphologically between blasts and promyelocytes were stained with CD34. The CD34+ cell count and cluster values were significantly higher in RA than in BMB with reactive changes (p<0.0001 for both), in RAEB than in RA (p=0.0006 and p=0.0189, respectively), in RAEBt than in RAEB (p=0.0001 and p=0.0038), and in MDS-AML than in RAEBt (p<0.0001 and p=0.0007). Presence of CD34+ cell clusters in RA correlated with increased risk of progression of the disease.

The patient is a 55-year-old woman who complained of left hearing loss of sudden onset. Pure tone audiometry revealed profound sensorineural hearing loss of the left ear at mid and low frequencies. The patient was tentatively diagnosed as idiopathic sudden deafness and admitted for the treatment, but her laboratory data indicated that she was at an advanced stage of leukemia. The patient's hearing loss did not improve subjectively until she deceased 1 year after the admission. The mechanism producing acute hearing loss in leukemic patients is reviewed and discussed, and the importance of differentiating possible underlying diseases before we diagnose idiopathic sudden deafness is stressed.","['Harada, T', 'Namiki, S', 'Kawabata, I']","['Harada T', 'Namiki S', 'Kawabata I']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical School, 1981 Tsujido-cho, Kamoda, Kawagoe-shi, 350-8550, Saitama-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Auris, nasus, larynx",7708170,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Audiometry, Pure-Tone', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hearing Loss, Sensorineural/diagnosis/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2000/09/21 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/21 11:00'],"['2000/09/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/21 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0385814699000747 [pii]', '10.1016/s0385-8146(99)00074-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Auris Nasus Larynx. 2000 Oct;27(4):359-62. doi: 10.1016/s0385-8146(99)00074-7.,,,,,,,,,,,

However it is unknown which are the numerical or structural abnormalities required for leukemic transformation. In this report we studied clinically and cytogenetically 127 patients: 125 with primary MDS and two with AML with a previous history of MDS. Thirty-one patients (24%) showed evolution of the disease during the follow-up study. Chromosomal abnormalities found at diagnosis in patients that progressed toward AML included: del(5)(q15), +6, del(6)(q21), t(5;8)(q32;q22),-7, del(7)(q22), der(7)t(1;7)(q10;p10), t(7;11)(p15;p15), +8, del(11)(q23), del(12p), del(3)(q21), del(20)(q12) and complex karyotypes. Eight of these patients were studied cytogenetically during transformation and showed acquisition of chromosomal alterations involving dup(1q), +8, del(11)(q23), and translocations between chromosomes 1 and 8 or 7 and 17. In addition we also observed gain of ploidy and monosomy 21. These results suggest that chromosomal alterations during evolution of the disease include special chromosome gains or abnormalities of chromosomes 1, 7, 8, 11 and 17 with involvement of ETV-1, Hox-A9, Pax 4, MLL genes besides a putative gene mapped at 17q25. We also applied the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) to 114 patients, excluding those submitted to allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Our patients were classified into four distinct risk groups. The analysis of risk groups presented by 27 patients who showed evolution of the disease revealed 18 at the high risk group and four at the intermediate-2 group. From the intermediate-1 risk group only five patients showed evolution of the disease. Three of these patients evolved from RA to RAEB with gain of a del(11)(q23) or an expansion of a del(12)(p12) clone. Our results suggest that some chromosomal alterations are responsible for each step in the evolution of the disease. As the pathway of evolution is not unique it has been very difficult to define what genetic alteration comes first. However from several results in the literature and our own, it seems that some chromosomal alterations may predict the evolution of the disease and are correlated with short survival, as for example the trisomy of chromosome 8, and might be incorporated in the high risk group in the IPSS. This score system has been proved to be useful for predicting survival and evolution from MDS to AML.","['de Souza Fernandez, T', 'Ornellas, M H', 'Otero de Carvalho, L', 'Tabak, D', 'Abdelhay, E']","['de Souza Fernandez T', 'Ornellas MH', 'Otero de Carvalho L', 'Tabak D', 'Abdelhay E']","['Biophysics Institute Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro 21949-900, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",,2000/09/21 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/21 11:00'],"['2000/09/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/21 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(00)00056-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00056-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Oct;24(10):839-48. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00056-4.,,,,,,,,,,,

The presentation of MAGE antigens by leukemic cell lines and fresh leukemic blasts induced TNF secretion and cytotoxicity by MAGE-specific CD8(+) CTL clones. The amount of peptide presented by the leukemic blasts, more than the level of expression of HLA class I, adhesion or costimulatory molecules, was the major limiting factor for recognition.

The chlorambucil ID(50) values for T-cells from B-CLL patients showed a direct correlation with Bcl-2 expression (P=0.002) and an inverse correlation with CD3 cell count (P<0.0001), suggesting a trend of increasing chemosensitivity and decreasing Bcl-2 expression with an elevated T-cell count.

In the present study, the effects of 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), a relatively specific serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, were examined in the WT and Y8 cells. Both cell lines were equally sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of UCN-01. However, the Y8 cells accumulated in G0/G1 and became apoptotic. Apoptosis induced by UCN-01 in the Y8 cells was mediated by a caspase-3-like activity which could be partially blocked by Ac-DEVD-CHO, a caspase-3 inhibitor.

Loss of chromosome 7q is a recurrent abnormality in hematological malignancies, especially of myeloid lineage, and a common region of 7q deletions has been mapped to 7q31. Thus, it has been suggested that 7q31 harbors a tumor suppressor gene whose functional loss contributes to leukemogenesis. To evaluate the possible involvement of the PPP1R3 gene in the development of hematological malignancies, we examined 72 leukemia and lymphoma cell lines for alterations of the PPP1R3 gene by PCR-SSCP and direct sequence analyses. Mutations were detected in 1 (2.8%) of 36 myeloid cell lines, 4 (20.0%) of 20 B-lineage lymphoid cell lines and none of 16 T-lineage lymphoid cell lines. All the mutations were heterozygous, and they consisted of two missense mutations and three silent mutations. The PPP1R3 gene was expressed in cell lines of various cell lineages. These results indicate that PPP1R3 is not a major target of 7q deletions in myeloid leukemia, however, alterations of the PPP1R3 gene may contribute to the development of a subset of hematological malignancies.","['Inoue, K', 'Kohno, T', 'Takakura, S', 'Morishita, K', 'Takita, J', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Mizoguchi, H', 'Yokota, J']","['Inoue K', 'Kohno T', 'Takakura S', 'Morishita K', 'Takita J', 'Hayashi Y', 'Mizoguchi H', 'Yokota J']","['Biology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (PPP1R3A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/09/21 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/21 11:00'],"['2000/09/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/21 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.17.4.717 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2000 Oct;17(4):717-21. doi: 10.3892/ijo.17.4.717.,,,,,,,,,,,

To study its transforming properties, we retrovirally transduced primary murine hematopoietic progenitors and assessed their growth properties both in vitro and in vivo. MLL-ELL increased the proliferation of myeloid colony-forming cells in methylcellulose cultures upon serial replating, whereas overexpression of ELL alone had no effect. We reconstituted lethally irradiated congenic mice with bone marrow progenitors transduced with MLL-ELL or the control MIE vector encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein. When the peripheral blood of the mice was analyzed 11-13 weeks postreconstitution, we found that the engraftment of the MLL-ELL-transduced cells was superior to that of the MIE controls. At this time point, the contribution of the donor cells was normally distributed among the myeloid and nonmyeloid compartments. Although all of the MIE animals (n = 10) remained healthy for more than a year, all of the MLL-ELL mice (n = 20) succumbed to monoclonal or pauciclonal acute myeloid leukemias within 100-200 days. The leukemic cells were readily transplantable to secondary recipients and could be established as immortalized cell lines in liquid cultures. These studies demonstrate the enhancing effect of MLL-ELL on the proliferative potential of myeloid progenitors as well as its causal role in the genesis of acute myeloid leukemias.","['Lavau, C', 'Luo, R T', 'Du, C', 'Thirman, M J']","['Lavau C', 'Luo RT', 'Du C', 'Thirman MJ']","['Systemix Inc., 3155 Porter Drive, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/*physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Peptide Elongation Factors', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors']",,2000/09/20 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.190167297 [doi]', '190167297 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Sep 26;97(20):10984-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.190167297.,,"['R01 CA078431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC27135,,,,,

In particular, early studies have pointed to the primacy of caspase proteases as mediators of execution. More recently, however, evidence has accumulated that noncaspases, including cathepsins, calpains, granzymes, and the proteasome complex, also have roles in mediating and promoting cell death. An important goal is to understand the importance of distinct noncaspases in various forms of apoptosis, and to determine whether pathways mediated by noncaspase proteases intersect with those mediated by caspases. In this review the roles of noncaspase proteases in the biochemistry of apoptosis will be discussed.","['Johnson, D E']",['Johnson DE'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15213-2582, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.78 (GZMA protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Calpain/metabolism', 'Cathepsins/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism']",162,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401879 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Sep;14(9):1695-703. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401879.,,,,,,,,,,,

In some situations, NO activates the transduction pathways leading to apoptosis, whereas in other cases NO protects cells against spontaneous or induced apoptosis. The redox state of the cells appears to be a crucial parameter for the determination of the ultimate action of NO on cell multiplication and survival. Apoptosis is mostly associated with the delivery of NO by chemical donors and with myelomonocytic cells, whereas antiapoptotic effects seem to be related to the endogenous production of NO by NO synthases and is observed more frequently in cells of the B lymphocyte lineage. Pro-apoptotic effects are often observed when NO reacts with superoxide to produce the highly toxic peroxynitrite. Through the induction of damages to DNA, NO stimulates the expression of enzymes and transcription factors involved in DNA repair and modulation of apoptosis, such as the tumor suppressor p53. The latter molecule transactivates the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, such as bax, and that of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, whereas it down-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2. On the other hand, NO inactivates caspases through oxidation and S-nitrosylation of the active cystein, providing an efficient means to block apoptosis. Other protective effects of NO on apoptosis rely on the stimulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), modulation of the members of the bcl-2/bax family that control the mitochondrial pore transition permeability, induction of the heat shock protein HSP 70 and interaction with the ceramide pathway. A defect in the apoptotic process contributes to the accumulation of tumoral cells in leukemia, notably in B-CLL. A better knowledge of the targets of NO would provide efficient means to control cell apoptosis, and hence would possibly lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches for diseases where an alteration of apoptosis is involved.","['Kolb, J P']",['Kolb JP'],"['U365 INSERM, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)'],IM,,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Nitric Oxide/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",95,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401896 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Sep;14(9):1685-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401896.,,,,,,,,,,,

The resistant phenotype in vitro is always a result of mutational inactivation of dCK, leading to defects in the metabolic pathways of AraC. Although inactivation of dCK has shown to be one of the major mechanism of resistance to AraC in vitro, limited in vivo data are available. To improve research concerning the involvement of dCK inactivation in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we have set up a protocol that allows direct assessment of dCK expression and activity in primary human cells. In this protein activity truncation assay (PAT assay), the complete coding region of dCK is amplified by RT-PCR and a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence is introduced upstream of the coding region in a nested PCR reaction. After in vitro transcription-translation dCK proteins are analyzed for their molecular weight and phosphorylating capacities. We show that this relatively quick method can be used in purified, primary human leukemic blasts. In addition, inactivation of dCK by point mutations, deletions or genomic rearrangements can easily be detected in AraC-resistant cell lines. This novel assay may contribute to further elucidate the mechanism of AraC resistance in vivo.","['Veuger, M J', 'Honders, M W', 'Landegent, J E', 'Willemze, R', 'Barge, R M']","['Veuger MJ', 'Honders MW', 'Landegent JE', 'Willemze R', 'Barge RM']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,['Leukemia. 2001 May;15(5):855-6.

These cells were produced using the VAC and MAK cell processors according to standard operating procedures. DCs and MOs were differentiated from circulating monocytes in gas permeable hydrophobic bags, with 2% autologous serum and in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-13 or GM-CSF alone, respectively. DCs and MOs were then purified by counter flow centrifugation. Phenotypic, morphological and functional analysis showed that cells differentiated from patients with lymphoma present quite similar features to DCs and MOs produced from monocytes of healthy donors. Moreover, we show that MOs, when combined with CD20 antibody (Rituximab), can efficiently engulf tumor cells and propose that a such combination could be used for initiating a clinical trial in lymphoma.

In all 18 patients, plasma was able to recognize baculovirus-expressed Abl protein; in four patients, recognition of baculovirus-expressed Bcr protein was also demonstrated. These observations suggest that a humoral immune response to p210Bcr-Abl is discernible in both Ph-positive and -negative leukemias and in healthy individuals, and is most likely due to autoantibodies which recognize normal Abl and, to a lesser extent, normal Bcr proteins.","['Talpaz, M', 'Qiu, X', 'Cheng, K', 'Cortes, J E', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Talpaz M', 'Qiu X', 'Cheng K', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian H', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoantibodies/blood/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*immunology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins/immunology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr']",,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401870 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Sep;14(9):1661-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401870.,,,,,,,,,,,

LP CD34+ cells showed a significantly stronger migration response to SDF-1alpha (100 ng/ml) than CD34+ cells isolated from the peripheral blood (PB) of CML patients (P < 0.05). The chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha was also reduced in CML BM CD34+ cells in comparison to NBM CD34+ cells but the observed differences were not statistically significant. In analogy to normal CD34+ cells circulating CML PB CD34+ cells were less responsive to SDF-1alpha than their BM counterparts (P < 0.05). Furthermore, SDF-1alpha elicited similar concentration-dependent growth suppressive effects on normal and CML CD34+ cells (P > 0.05) in colony-forming cell assays. We then demonstrated that SDF-1alpha triggers intracellular calcium increases in CD34+ cells and there were no differences in the time course and dose response characteristics of normal and CML CD34+ cells. The reduced migration response to SDF-1alpha in CML CD34+ cells was not due to a down-regulation of the SDF-1alpha receptor CXCR-4 as flow cytometric analysis revealed similar CXCR-4 expression levels on NBM, LP, CML PB and CML BM CD34+ cells (P > 0.05). Finally, no differences in the modulation of CXCR-4 levels in response to SDF-1alpha and serum were observed in CML and normal CD34+ cells. Our data suggest that the impaired chemotactic response of CML CD34+ cells to SDF-1alpha is not caused by a lack or complete uncoupling of CXCR-4, but may be due to an intracellular signalling defect downstream of the receptor.","['Durig, J', 'Rosenthal, C', 'Elmaagacli, A', 'Heyworth, C', 'Halfmeyer, K', 'Kasper, C', 'Novotny, J', 'Duhrsen, U']","['Durig J', 'Rosenthal C', 'Elmaagacli A', 'Heyworth C', 'Halfmeyer K', 'Kasper C', 'Novotny J', 'Duhrsen U']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/*pharmacology', 'Chemotactic Factors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Up-Regulation']",,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401875 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Sep;14(9):1652-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401875.,,,,,,,,,,,

By 3'-RACE and RT-PCR analyses, two kinds of NUP98-HOXD13 fusion transcript were detected. In addition, we identified a novel fusion transcript, NUP98-FN1, in the same patient. Ectopic expression of the wild-type HOXD13 gene was also observed in the patient, suggesting that HOXD13 contributes to the development of this type of leukemia. The NUP98-HOXD13 fusion transcript was predicted to encode a 552 or 569-amino acid protein containing the Phe-Gly (FG) repeat region of NUP98 and the homeodomain of HOXD13. The NUP98-FN1 fusion transcript was predicted to encode a 482 or 499-amino acid protein consisting of the same N-terminal region of NUP98 and a C-terminal region of 12 amino acids derived from a previously unidentified sequence. We isolated and characterized the chromosomal breakpoints. The breakpoint at 11p15 is mapped within a LINE repetitive element in a 9 kb intron of NUP98, and more than 60% of the sequenced 3 kb region surrounding the breakpoint junction consists of repetitive elements. The other breakpoint at 2q31 is in an intron of FN1, which is located 7 kb upstream of HOXD13, and the repetitive sequence content of the breakpoint junction is low. Local sequence duplications at genomic breakpoints suggest that the t(2;11) translocation is mediated through staggered double-strand DNA breaks. These results throw light on the mechanisms responsible for the generation of t(2;11) translocation and on the processes leading to t(2;11) leukemia.","['Arai, Y', 'Kyo, T', 'Miwa, H', 'Arai, K', 'Kamada, N', 'Kita, K', 'Ohki, M']","['Arai Y', 'Kyo T', 'Miwa H', 'Arai K', 'Kamada N', 'Kita K', 'Ohki M']","['Cancer Genomics Division, National Cancer Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (HOXD13 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, recombinant)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Breakage', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401881 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Sep;14(9):1621-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401881.,,,,,,,,,,,

Low expression of the apoptosis inducer Bax correlates with poor response to therapy and shorter overall survival in solid tumors. In the present study, we analyzed the p53/Bax/caspase-3 pathway in a paired and an unpaired sample series of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at initial diagnosis and relapse. The data demonstrate that both Bax expression levels and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio are significantly lower in samples at relapse as compared with samples at initial diagnosis (P=0.013, Wilcoxon signed rank test (paired samples); P=0.0039, Mann-Whitney U test (unpaired samples)). The loss of Bax protein expression was not a consequence of Bax frameshift mutations of the G8 tract and could not be attributed to mutations of the p53 coding sequence (exons 5 to 8) which were detected to a similar extent in de novo ALL samples and at relapse. Analysis of the downstream effector caspase-3 showed loss of spontaneous caspase-3 processing at relapse. Whereas nine out of 14 (64%, paired samples) or 37 out of 77 (48%, unpaired samples) ALL patients at initial diagnosis displayed spontaneous in vivo processing of caspase-3, this was completely absent in patients at relapse (paired samples) or detected in only one out of 34 patients at relapse (2.9%, unpaired samples). We therefore conclude that in ALL relapse a severe disturbance of apoptotic pathways occurs, both at the level of Bax expression and caspase-3 activation.","['Prokop, A', 'Wieder, T', 'Sturm, I', 'Essmann, F', 'Seeger, K', 'Wuchter, C', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Henze, G', 'Dorken, B', 'Daniel, P T']","['Prokop A', 'Wieder T', 'Sturm I', 'Essmann F', 'Seeger K', 'Wuchter C', 'Ludwig WD', 'Henze G', 'Dorken B', 'Daniel PT']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Charite, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401866 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Sep;14(9):1606-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401866.,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the interaction between TPO and its receptor c-Mpl encoded by the c-mpl gene is now known to be implicated in the proliferation and/or differentiation of abnormal myeloid cells and normal hematopoietic stem cells, little is known about a role of the TPO/c-Mpl system in lymphoid leukemia cells. In the present study, we first examined the expression of c-mpl/c-Mpl in 23 human lymphoid leukemic cell lines (T-lineage 4, B-lineage 19) using three distinct methods. The c-mpl mRNA was detectable in as many as 20 cell lines (T-lineage 3, B-lineage 17) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, but its translated product, c-Mpl, was demonstrable by Western blot only in B-lineage cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the surface c-Mpl expression in 13 of 17 B-lineage cell lines, but its higher expression (>40%) was restricted in nine B-precursor cell lines, eight of which had 11q23 translocation or Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1). We also demonstrated that two of eight cell lines with 11q23 translocation or Ph1 exhibited a significant proliferative response to TPO in the 3H-thymidine uptake and colony-forming assays. Triggering of these cell lines by TPO transiently up-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK-2 and Shc, indicating that their receptor is functional. Primary leukemia cells separated from patients with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia with Ph1 or 11q23 translocation also showed the surface c-Mpl expression and a significant responsiveness to TPO. These results suggest that the TPO/c-Mpl interaction may play a physiological role in the growth regulation of B-precursor leukemia cells particularly with specific chromosomal abnormalities.","['Iijima, K', 'Sugita, K', 'Inukai, T', 'Goi, K', 'Tezuka, T', 'Uno, K', 'Sato, H', 'Kagami, K', 'Nakazawa, S']","['Iijima K', 'Sugita K', 'Inukai T', 'Goi K', 'Tezuka T', 'Uno K', 'Sato H', 'Kagami K', 'Nakazawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamanashi Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Thrombopoietin/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401893 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Sep;14(9):1598-605. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401893.,,,,,,,,,,,

In this respect, pharmacological induction of expression of the endogenous gamma-globin gene is a realistic approach to therapy of beta-globin disorders. Erythroid differentiation and inhibition of proliferation of the human CML K562 cell line was induced by guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP). The hemoglobin production in cells was correlated to an increase in alpha- and gamma-globin mRNA expression. At the transcriptional level, we showed that both the expression of the major erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 (protein and mRNA) and its binding capacity to the gamma-globin gene promoter was transiently increased. Moreover, GTP moderately stimulated the gamma-globin gene promoter after 48 h of treatment. At the post-transcriptional level, GTP treatment led to a drastic increase of the gamma-globin mRNA half-life. This stabilizing effect of GTP was mediated via the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the gamma-globin mRNA. In conclusion, mechanism of GTP-mediated differentiation of K562 cells is linked to an early activation of gamma-globin gene transcription followed by a stabilization of its mRNA.","['Morceau, F', 'Dupont, C', 'Palissot, V', 'Borde-Chiche, P', 'Trentesaux, C', 'Dicato, M', 'Diederich, M']","['Morceau F', 'Dupont C', 'Palissot V', 'Borde-Chiche P', 'Trentesaux C', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Recherche sur le Cancer et les Maladies du Sang, Centre Universitaire de Luxembourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Globins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401890 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Sep;14(9):1589-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401890.,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this activity only a minority of patients treated with fludarabine achieve a complete response. We evaluated a new treatment program of sequential therapy with fludarabine followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide in previously untreated patients with CLL. This report details the results in 25 patients with previously untreated CLL. Patients received fludarabine (25 mg/m2/day x 5 days every 4 weeks for six cycles) as induction followed by consolidation with high-dose cyclophosphamide at one of three dose levels 1.5 g/m2, 2.25 g/m2, or 3 g/m2 administered every 2 weeks for three doses. High-dose cyclophosphamide was given with G-CSF support (5 microg/kg/day days 3-12). Complete response (CR) required a normal physical examination, normal CBC, a normal bone marrow evaluation including no residual lymphoid nodules on biopsy. A nodular response was defined as a complete response with the exception of an occasional residual nodule seen on bone marrow biopsy. Flow cytometric analysis for CD5:CD19 dual staining and kappa/lambda clonal excess was performed in all patients as a sensitive measure of minimal residual disease (MRD). Selected patients had patient/tumor-specific oligonucleotides generated that were subsequently used in a polymerase chain reaction as an extremely sensitive measure of MRD. There were no treatment-related deaths and no patient encountered unacceptable toxicity. After completion of this sequential regimen 76% (95% confidence interval: 59-93%) of patients had a major response: eight (32%) achieved a CR, four (16%) a nodular response, seven (28%) a PR, and six patients (24%) failed. Four patients withdrew from study during induction with fludarabine and did not receive at least one cycle of cyclophosphamide. Of the 21 patients who received consolidation with cyclophosphamide 10 (48%) had an improved quality of response when compared to that achieved with fludarabine. Two patients (8%) had no disease detectable by flow cytometry ('flow cytometric' CR) after six cycles of fludarabine. This improved to nine patients (36%) after high-dose cyclophosphamide. Following consolidation with high-dose cyclophosphamide three patients (12%) tested negative by PCR. All of these patients had morphologic evidence of residual disease after six cycles of fludarabine. Consolidation with high-dose cyclophosphamide increased the fraction of patients achieving a nodular response or CR three-fold (16% to 48%). This appears to be clinically relevant because with a median follow-up of 52 (range 34-78) months the projected 6-year survival for patients achieving a CR or NR is 91% compared to 41% for all others (P = 0.012). We conclude that sequential therapy with fludarabine followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide in previously untreated patients with CLL is safe and can improve the quality of response in a large proportion of patients compared to therapy with fludarabine alone.","['Weiss, M A', 'Glenn, M', 'Maslak, P', 'Rahman, Z', 'Noy, A', 'Zelenetz, A', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'Golde, D W']","['Weiss MA', 'Glenn M', 'Maslak P', 'Rahman Z', 'Noy A', 'Zelenetz A', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Golde DW']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401892 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Sep;14(9):1577-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401892.,,['CA 67823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Since 1990, several publications have reported discrepancies between the results of cytogenetic and molecular analysis of t(14;18). Using methods able to explore long DNA fragments, several authors reported breakpoints located outside the usual breakpoint regions. However, these techniques cannot be easily used in routine.

Immunophenotypically, ALCL are of T cell (predominantly) or Null cell type; by definition, cases expressing B cell antigens are officially not included in this entity. The translocation (2;5)(p23;q35) is a recurring abnormality in ALCL; 46% of the ALCL patients bear this signature translocation. This translocation creates a fusion gene composed of nucleophosmin (NPM) and a novel receptor tyrosine kinase gene, named anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). The NPM-ALK chimeric gene encodes a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that has been shown to be a potent oncogene. The exact pathogenetic mechanisms leading to lymphomagenesis remain elusive; however, the synopsis of evidence obtained to date provides an outline of likely scenarios. Several t(2;5) variants have been described; in some instances, the breakpoints have been cloned and the genes forming a new fusion gene with ALK have been identified: ATIC-ALK, TFG-ALK and TPM3-ALK. Cloning the translocation breakpoint and identifying the ALK and NPM genes provided tools for screening material from patients with ALCL using various approaches at the chromosome, DNA, RNA, or protein level: positive signals in the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the immunostaining with anti-ALK monoclonal antibodies (McAb) serve as the most convenient tests for detection of the t(2;5) NPM-ALK since the fusion gene and ALK protein expression do not occur in normal or reactive lymphoid tissue. The wide range of NPM-ALK positivity reported in different series appears to be dependent on the inclusion and selection criteria of the ALCL cases studied. Overall, however, 43% of ALCL cases were NPM-ALK+ (83% of pediatric ALCL vs 31% of adult ALCL). Occasional non-ALCL B cell lymphomas (4%) with diffuse large cell and immunoblastic histology and Hodgkin's disease cases (3%) were NPM-ALK-, but these data are questionable. The aggregate results indicate that, in contrast to primary nodal (systemic) ALCL, the t(2;5) may be present in only 10-20% of primary cutaneous ALCL and rarely, if at all, in lymphomatoid papulosis, a potential precursor lesion; however, these 10-20% positive cases were not confirmed by anti-ALK McAb immunostaining and may represent an overestimate. Positivity for NPM-ALK is associated to various degrees with the following parameters: 44% and 45% of ALCL cases with T cell and Null cell immunophenotype, respectively, are positive, whereas only 8% of cases with a B cell immunoprofile are positive; the mean age of positive patients is significantly younger than that of negative patients; positive cases carry a better overall prognosis (but not in all studies). Recently, the homogenous category of ALK lymphoma ('ALKoma') has emerged as a distinct pathological entity within the heterogenous group of ALCL. The fact that patients with ALK lymphomas experience significantly better overall survival than ALK- ALCL demonstrates further that analysis of ALK expression has important prognostic implications. The term ALK lymphoma signifies a switch in the use of the diagnostic criteria: cases are selected on the basis of a genetic abnormality (the ALK rearrangement), instead of the review of morphological or immunophenotypical features which are clearly more prone to disagreement and controversy. Since its initial description in 1985 ALCL has become one of the best characterized lymphoma entities.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gignac, S M', 'von Wasielewski, R', 'Werner, M', 'Dirks, W G']","['Drexler HG', 'Gignac SM', 'von Wasielewski R', 'Werner M', 'Dirks WG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",303,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401878 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Sep;14(9):1533-59. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401878.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Relative-risk results obtained with a regression model in a recent epidemiologic study were used to estimate leukemia risk for occupational and environmental exposures to BD and to compare these estimates with those previously derived from an analysis of animal bioassay data. RESULTS: The estimates of risk were found to be highly dependent on the model used when low levels of exposure were evaluated that are of environmental concern, but not at the levels of occupational concern. For example, at the level (1 part per million) of the recently revised standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States the estimates of lifetime excess risk ranged from 1 to 8 per 1000 workers. The range of the risk estimates derived from the epidemiologic models was remarkably similar to the range of risk estimates for occupational exposures (1 to 9 per thousand) previously developed by Dankovic et al in 1993 from an analysis of a mouse bioassay study for lymphocytic lymphoma.

We used a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling method for detecting the apoptotic cells. In addition, immunohistochemical staining was performed to examine the expression of the B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 gene (bcl-2) and p53 protein.

In addition, there was no correlation between amyloid deposition and bcl-2 protein expression or between amyloid deposition and p53 protein expression. Our results indicate that the frequency of secondary amyloidosis in BCC among Chinese patients is not higher than that reported in the West.

First results of an evaluation of 49 patients with the PEDQOL questionnaire.,211-5,"BACKGROUND: The assessment of Quality of Life (QoL) in childhood cancer survivors is a new field of research, which is important for a better understanding of how children with cancer feel and how treatment can be optimized. The purpose of our examination in a sample of patients treated in our institution was the evaluation of the questions: How do children with cancer reflect on their QoL in comparison to healthy children of the same age? Are there any significant differences in QoL between children with hematological disorders and children with solid tumors and if that is so, which domains are affected? PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used for the evaluation a pilotversion of a self-rating QoL questionnaire for children between 8 and 18 years (PEDQOL), who was developed for pediatric oncology. 49 children off treatment of whom 51% had leukemia/lymphoma and 49% had solid tumors compared to 62 healthy school children were examined. RESULTS: The PEDQOL questionnaire was a good accepted measure among the examined children. The reliability scores of the pilotform for the evaluated domains were also satisfactory (Cronbach's-Alpha > 0.60). In general QoL was scored good by healthy as well as by ill children. In the group of children with leukemia/lymphoma impairment of QoL was more apparent than in children with solid tumors (domains autonomy, emotional functioning, cognition and familial interactions). Survivors of solid tumors reported less impairment of QoL which was mainly seen in physical functioning and body image. CONCLUSION: In general QoL scored with the PEDQOL pilotquestionnaire was good for most of the childhood cancer survivors. Children with solid tumors show less impairment than children with leukemia/lymphoma. Therefore it could be suggested, that young age at diagnosis and the following longer period of being dependent on familial support, the isolation from peer groups and the longer way to become independent may be reflected by these results. To obtain reliable results how children with cancer express their QoL and what consequences illness, treatment and long term effects of therapy have on the childrens' QoL a multicenter prospective study is needed.

The risk for heterozygous individuals is not clear, epidemiological data are inconsistent. If the risk for heterozygous individuals to develop malignancies was increased, they should be found in groups of patients with AML or MDS at higher proportion than in the normal population. We are currently screening a pediatric population with hematologic malignancies for mutations in the FANCA, FANCC and FANCG gene, and report here on siblings carrying a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the FANCC Gene. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using PCR based single strand conformational analysis we screened the DNA from pediatric patients suffering from 1 degree or 2 degrees MDS, CMML/JMML or AML for mutations in the FANCA (43 exons), FANCC (14 exons) and FANCG (14 exons) gene, and included one patient with refractory T-ALL, being the brother of a patient with T-ALL and MDS transforming into AML. Aberrant PCR products were directly sequenced. Flowcytometric measurement of mitogen-sensitivity and G2-phase arrest is used to evaluate cultured stimulated lymphocytes from individuals carrying FANC-mutations. RESULTS: A novel heterozygous frame-shift mutation, 377-378delGA in the FANCC gene was found in 2 siblings, both suffering from T-ALL with subsequent MDS transforming to AML in one of them. No other mutation was found by direct sequencing of the complete FANCC gene. Both patients died under therapy. The parents (first degree cousins) and one healthy brother are also carriers. Their lymphocytes show a higher mutagen sensitivity than normal, but do not get blocked in G2 phase as being typical for Fanconi Anemia. CONCLUSION: As the mutation causes a premature Stopcodon within exon 4 of the FANCC gene it has to be regarded as a causal FANCC gene defect. The findings within this family support the hypothesis of an increased risk to develop malignancies in heterozygous carriers of FANC-mutations. A systematic screening of further patients is needed, and we are currently examining a larger cohort to get a better estimate of the true risk of heterozygosity.","['Rischewski, J R', 'Clausen, H', 'Leber, V', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Ritter, J', 'Schindler, D', 'Schneppenheim, R']","['Rischewski JR', 'Clausen H', 'Leber V', 'Niemeyer C', 'Ritter J', 'Schindler D', 'Schneppenheim R']","[""University Children's Hospital, Hamburg, Germany. rischewski@uke.uni-hamburg.de""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Fanconi Anemia/complications/*genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', '*Frameshift Mutation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2000-9673 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2000 Jul-Aug;212(4):174-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2000-9673.,,,,,,,,,,,

Several groups showed the predictive value of MRD after 5 weeks of chemotherapy (at the end of induction therapy). Patients with more than 1 leukemic cells in 100 cells (> or = 10(-2)) at this time-point have a significantly higher relapse rate. The MRD measurement has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor at several time points in the BFM study (ALL-BFM 90) as well as in the EORTC study. The aim of our investigations was the detection of MRD at the end of induction therapy within the COALL studies which is different from the above studies. In the COALL studies, therapy starts with a 1 week DNR prephase (24 h infusion on day one) and i.th. MTX. Induction therapy consisted of 3 drugs over a period of 4 weeks (Prednisolone, Vincristine and Daunorubicin), asparaginase is given later in consolidation. At the end of induction therapy, bone marrow was obtained for cytomorphologic and molecular analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated bone marrow samples from 76 patients. All patients were in morphologic remission at the end. of induction therapy. For MRD analysis, DNA was isolated from bone marrow mononuclear cells. Clonal T-cell-receptor (TCR) or immunoglobulin gene (IgH) rearrangements were identified by PCR. Monoclonal products were either sequenced directly (TCR) or after excision from high resolution agarose gels. Subsequently patient-specific oligonucleotides for allele-specific PCR were generated. PCR analysis was performed with 1 microgram DNA for each reaction within a semiquantitative matter. This method reached sensitivities down to 10(-5). RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of the analysed samples were MRD positive at the end of induction therapy. 20 out of 76 patient samples (26%) were highly positive (> or = 10(-2)), 28 patients had levels of about 10(-3) (37%), 16 had levels around 10(-4) (21%) and 12 patients had no detectable residual cells (16%). All analysed 15 T-ALL patients had detectable residual disease at this timepoint. Until now, 5/20 patients with very high MRD level at the end of induction therapy suffered a relapse. DISCUSSION: Patients with very high MRD level at the end of induction therapy showed an elevated risk of relapse, but the predictive value is much poorer than for example in the BFM 90 MRD-study. We suggest, that a high MRD level at this timepoint results from a different induction therapy compared to the BFM 90 study. In the COALL studies asparaginase is given only after induction therapy to decrease the risk of thrombosis. We would like to conclude that this differences were compensated later during therapy as the event free survival of both studies is similar. In conclusion, an optimal information from MRD studies is strongly associated with the given therapy. Therefore we initiated an additional MRD time-point after the first chemotherapy block in consolidation.","['zur Stadt, U', 'Harms, D O', 'Schluter, S', 'Jorch, N', 'Spaar, H J', 'Nurnberger, W', 'Volpel, S', 'Gutjahr, P', 'Schrappe, M', 'Janka, G', 'Kabisch, H']","['zur Stadt U', 'Harms DO', 'Schluter S', 'Jorch N', 'Spaar HJ', 'Nurnberger W', 'Volpel S', 'Gutjahr P', 'Schrappe M', 'Janka G', 'Kabisch H']","['Abt. fur padiatrische Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatskinderklinik Eppendorf, Hamburg. zurstadt@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['ger'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2000-9672 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2000 Jul-Aug;212(4):169-73. doi: 10.1055/s-2000-9672.,,,Minimal Residual Disease Untersuchungen bei der akuten lymphatischen Leukamie im Kindesalter im Rahmen der COALL-Studie: Ergebnisse einer Induktionstherapie ohne Asparaginase.,,,,,,,,

The standard dose used in children and adults is 8-12 mg/m2 during induction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To improve outcome, we increased the IDR dose from 12 mg/m2 (standard dose in study AML-BFM 93), applied over three days during induction therapy (AIE = Ara-C, Idarubicin, Etoposide) to 14 mg/m2 in a pilot study including 17 patients (16 with de novo AML, one with secondary AML). Outcome and toxicities were compared with the other patients of study AML-BFM 93, treated with 3 x 12 mg/m2 IDR or 6 x 30 mg/m2 daunorubicin (DNR). RESULTS: Patients of the pilot study achieved a good blast cell reduction in the bone marrow on day 15, a high CR rate of 94% and a low relapse rate (3/17 pts.), however, not significantly different to the IDR (12 mg/m2) group. Hematological toxicity was high, median duration until neutrophil recovery > 500/microliter was 25.0 (12-66) days, and similar to the IDR (12 mg/m2) and DNR groups. Duration of thrombocytopenia (time to > 20,000/microliter) was 21 (10-66) days in the pilot study compared to 19 (7-26) days in DNR patients (p = 0.08). Four of 17 pilot patients presented with severe WHO grades 3/4 of mucositis during induction. One patient died in long-lasting aplasia after the 3rd treatment block. CONCLUSION: Results of this pilot study show that the IDR 14 mg/m2 regimen was effective but also toxic. According to our results which, however, are based on small patient numbers, an improved outcome compared to the IDR 12 mg/m2 regimen seems to be unlikely, therefore the possibly increased toxicity might not be acceptable.","['Creutzig, U', 'Korholz, D', 'Niemeyer, C M', 'Kabisch, H', 'Graf, N', 'Reiter, A', 'Scheel-Walter, H', 'Bender-Gotze, C', 'Behnisch, W', 'Hermann, J', 'Mann, G', 'Ritter, J', 'Zimmermann, M']","['Creutzig U', 'Korholz D', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Kabisch H', 'Graf N', 'Reiter A', 'Scheel-Walter H', 'Bender-Gotze C', 'Behnisch W', 'Hermann J', 'Mann G', 'Ritter J', 'Zimmermann M']","['Universitats-Kinderkliniken in Deutschland, Munster. ucreutzig@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/09/20 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/20 11:00'],"['2000/09/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/20 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2000-9671 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2000 Jul-Aug;212(4):163-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2000-9671.,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the mechanisms of TGF-beta1 action on primitive hematopoietic cells, we used the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent, multipotent FDCP-Mix cell line. TGF-beta1-mediated growth inhibition was observed in high concentrations of IL-3, while at lower IL-3 concentrations TGF-beta1 induced apoptosis. The proapoptotic effects of TGF-beta1 occur via a p53-independent pathway, since p53(null) FDCP-Mix demonstrated the same responses to TGF-beta1. IL-3 has been suggested to enhance survival via an increase in (antiapoptotic) Bcl-x(L) expression. In FDCP-Mix cells, neither IL-3 nor TGF-beta1 induced any change in Bcl-x(L) protein levels or the proapoptotic proteins Bad or Bax. However, TGF-beta1 had a major effect on Bcl-2 levels, reducing them in the presence of high and low concentrations of IL-3. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in FDCP-Mix cells rescued them from TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis but was incapable of inhibiting TGF-beta1-mediated growth arrest. We conclude that TGF-beta1-induced cell death is independent of p53 and inhibited by Bcl-2, with no effect on Bcl-x(L).

Formal validation, that is the study of the analytical performances of a method, is however recognized as the best safeguard against the generation and publication of data with low reliability. Classical validation parameters were investigated for the determination of an oxidative stress biomarker, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) in cellular DNA, by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to amperometric detection (HPLC-EC); this modified base is increasingly considered as a marker of oxidative damage to DNA, but many questions are still raised on the analytical methods in use. Upon a rigorous statistical evaluation of the quality criteria currently required for assays in biological media, including selectivity, linearity, accuracy, repeatability, sensitivity, limits of detection and quantification, ruggedness and storage at different stop points in the procedure, the HPLC-EC assay method is found mostly reliable. The present validation attempt demonstrates that (i) the HPLC-EC assay of 8-oxo-dG provides consistent data allowing to reliably detect an increase of this biomarker in cellular DNA; (ii) a harsh oxidative stress does not hinder the enzymatic digestion of DNA by nuclease P1; and (iii) the analytical results must be expressed relative to the internal standard dG which significantly improves both repeatability and sensitivity. Whereas the described assay minimizes the artifactual production of the analyte from processing and storage, this cannot be totally ruled out; the true 8-oxo-dG base levels still lack a definitive assay method, which remains a considerable analytical challenge and the object of controversy.","['Duez, P', 'Helson, M', 'Some, T I', 'Dubois, J', 'Hanocq, M']","['Duez P', 'Helson M', 'Some TI', 'Dubois J', 'Hanocq M']","['Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Institute of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Toxicology and Applied Physical Chemistry, Brussels, Belgium. pduez@ulb.ac.be']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,"['0 (Biomarkers)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'DNA Damage', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/*analysis', 'Drug Stability', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Quality Control', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/09/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/19 11:00'],"['2000/09/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/19 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10715760000301411 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2000 Sep;33(3):243-60. doi: 10.1080/10715760000301411.,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the macrophage population, including several subsets and their dynamics in the posttransplant period. In addition to the total CD68+ resident (mature) macrophages the so-called activated fraction identified by its capacity to express alpha-D-galactosyl residues, the pseudo-Gaucher cells (PGCs) and the iron-laden histiocytic reticular cells were also considered. Following immuno- and lectin-histochemical staining morphometric analysis was carried out on sequential postgraft bone marrow specimens at standardized intervals. Compared to the normal bone marrow and calculated per haematopoiesis (cellularity) an overall decrease of about 40-50% in the quantity of CD68+ macrophages and the BSA-I+ subpopulation was detectable in the early posttransplant period (9-45 days after BMT). Noteworthy was the temporal recurrence of PGCs in the engrafted bone marrow, which was not associated with a clonally transformed cell population or leukaemic relapse. Reappearance of postgraft PGCs was most prominent in the first 2 months after BMT. This conspicuous feature was presumed to be functionally associated with a pronounced degradation of cell debris following pretransplant myelo-ablative therapy (scavenger macrophages). Evidence for an activation of the BSA-I+ macrophage subset was derived from the identical carbohydrate-binding capacity shown by the PGCs. In the regenerating haematopoiesis shortly after BMT a significant correlation between the number of BSA-I+ macrophages and erythroid precursor cells was determinable. This result implicates a close functional relationship between postgraft reconstitution of erythropoietic islets and centrally localized activated macrophages. In conclusion, findings emerging from this study included the reappearance of PCGs in the engrafted bone marrow independently of a leukaemic relapse and the significant association of the activated BSA-I+ macrophage subset with the recovery of erythropoiesis.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Beelen, D W', 'Wenzel, P', 'Koepke, M L', 'Leder, L D', 'Schaefer, U W']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Beelen DW', 'Wenzel P', 'Koepke ML', 'Leder LD', 'Schaefer UW']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology/*surgery', 'Macrophages/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Postoperative Period', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/09/19 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/19 11:00'],"['2000/09/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/19 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004280000224 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2000 Aug;437(2):160-6. doi: 10.1007/s004280000224.,,,,,,,,,,,

In three cases the nodal involvement by CLL was demonstrated both by the presence of a predominant background of CD5/CD19/CD23+ small lymphocytes and an IgH monoclonal rearrangement revealed by PCR analysis. Conversely, in the remaining case there was neither immunohistological nor molecular evidence of lymph node involvement by CLL. In all four cases H/RS cells were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein (LMP-1) positive. These findings suggest that the presence of H/RS cells in the first three patients, who had CLL/HD nodal involvement, might be related to transformation or clonal evolution of CLL cells in H/RS cells, which is in keeping with use of the term ""CLL with Hodgkin's transformation"". In the fourth case a de novo HD may be postulated, representing a second malignancy presumably not clonally related to CLL. In all cases a key pathogenetic role of EBV is suggested by the expression of LMP-1 in H/RS cells. Our findings indicate that the presence of typical H/RS cells in lymph node biopsies in CLL patients may reflect a heterogeneous pathogenetic background. The different clinico-pathologic settings should be taken into consideration because of their possible implications for patients' treatment and prognosis.","['Pescarmona, E', 'Pignoloni, P', 'Mauro, F R', 'Cerretti, R', 'Anselmo, A P', 'Mandelli, F', 'Baroni, C D']","['Pescarmona E', 'Pignoloni P', 'Mauro FR', 'Cerretti R', 'Anselmo AP', 'Mandelli F', 'Baroni CD']","['Laboratorio di Istopatologia c/o Ematologia, Rome, Italy. pescarmona@bce.med.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hodgkin Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*pathology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/metabolism']",,2000/09/19 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/19 11:00'],"['2000/09/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/19 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004280000214 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2000 Aug;437(2):129-32. doi: 10.1007/s004280000214.,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of second chronic phase induction in accelerated phase(CML-AP) or blastic crisis of CML(CML-BC) and remission induction in advanced MDS by combining topoisomerase I inhibitor (topotecan) with topoisomerase II inhibitor(mitoxantrone). METHODS: Twenty-four evaluable patients were entered on this study with a median age of 34 years. Eighteen patients with transformed CML(7 CML-AP, 11 CML-BC) and 6 patients with advanced MDS were treated. Topotecan was administered as 1.5 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion over 24 hours daily for 5 days every 4 to 8 weeks until remission. To enhance the tumoricidal effects, mitoxantrone(12 mg/m2/day, Days 1-3) was added. RESULTS: Eight patients(33%) achieved a complete remission(CR). Four of 7 patients with CML-AP(57%), 2 of 4 patients with CML-lymphoid blastic crisis (-LBC)(50%) and 2 of 6 patients with advanced MDS(33%) had CR lasting more than 45 days(45 to 400 days). There was no CR in the patients with CML-myeloid blastic crisis(-MBC). The dose level of 1.5 mg/m2/day(7.5 mg/m2/course) of topotecan was well tolerated in all patients. Mucositis occurred in 69% of patients (severe in 5%) and diarrhea in 67%(severe in 8%). In addition, there were no new or unexpected toxicities in the patients who were treated at this dose(7.5 mg/m2/course). In patients who recovered their neutrophil count, the absolute neutrophil count(ANC) remained below 500/microL for a period of 13 to 58 days(median 21 days) and the time to ANC recovery was associated with pretreatment severity of bone marrow fibrosis(mainly CML patients). Likewise, in the patients who recovered unsupported platelets, the platelets remained below 20,000/microL for a period of 0 to 37 days (median 19 days). CONCLUSION: The combination of topotecan-mitoxantrone has shown modest activity in CML-AP, CML-LBC and advanced MDS with acceptable toxicities.","['Park, S J', 'Kim, D W', 'Kim, H J', 'Eom, H S', 'Min, C K', 'Lee, J W', 'Min, W S', 'Kim, C C']","['Park SJ', 'Kim DW', 'Kim HJ', 'Eom HS', 'Min CK', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Kim CC']","['Catholic Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,['7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Topotecan/*administration & dosage']",,2000/09/19 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/09/19 11:00'],"['2000/09/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/19 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3904/kjim.2000.15.2.122 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2000 Jul;15(2):122-6. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2000.15.2.122.,,,,,,PMC4531761,,,,,

In this work we sought to investigate whether PML-RARA fusion transcripts, characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), could be induced by a clastogenic agent in cells known to have, a priori, a favorable spatial distribution of these genes. A lymphoid-cell line, lacking the t(15;17) but having the PML and RARA genes in close proximity in specific phases of the cell cycle, was irradiated with 10 Gy of (60)Co, and the incidence of PML-RARA transcripts was analyzed by a highly sensitive PCR assay. Despite gene proximity, typical PML-RARA transcripts were only rarely detected in irradiated cells. The same phenomenon was observed at similar frequency in control non-irradiated cells. These findings made us investigate whether such transcripts could also be detected in peripheral blood cells from normal individuals. PML-RARA transcripts were observed at low frequencies in isolated lymphoid and granulocytic cell populations, with similar incidence in both cell types. The data thus indicate that the PML and RARA genes are not particularly susceptible to the clastogenic effects of gamma-irradiation, and that, similar to what has been reported for other chromosomal translocations, transcriptionally active PML-RARA rearrangements can be generated in normal hematopoietic cells of different lineages without apparent oncogenic consequences.","['Quina, A S', 'Gameiro, P', 'Sa da Costa, M', 'Telhada, M', 'Parreira, L']","['Quina AS', 'Gameiro P', 'Sa da Costa M', 'Telhada M', 'Parreira L']","['Institute of Histology and Embryology, Lisbon Medical School, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,,"['Chromosome Aberrations/etiology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Gamma Rays/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/*radiation effects', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Recombination, Genetic/radiation effects', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/09/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/19 11:00'],"['2000/09/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/19 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::AID-GCC1030>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]', '10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1030>3.0.co;2-# [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000 Nov;29(3):266-75. doi: 10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1030>3.0.co;2-#.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

We now report data on sequencing and mapping of TEL-AML1 from an additional 11 patients and, using Monte Carlo statistical methods, have analyzed the intronic distribution of the 24 TEL-AML1 fusion junctions sequenced to date. Compared to a null hypothesis of random breakpoint allocation within TEL intron 5 and AML1 introns 1 and 2, significant microclustering was evident on both TEL and AML1. In contrast to previous reports, the two strongest microclusters on TEL were 3' to an unstable repeat region. AML1 demonstrated four highly significant microclusters, two of which were proximal to exons. We note the necessity of sequencing multiple breakpoints before the description of putative microcluster regions. TEL-AML1 breakpoints may be distributed into microclusters because of specific DNA sequence or chromatin features in susceptible cells. We also report on additional features of breakpoints, including a complex t(12;3;21) in one patient and an inverted sequence in another.","['Wiemels, J L', 'Alexander, F E', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Biondi, A', 'Mayer, S P', 'Greaves, M']","['Wiemels JL', 'Alexander FE', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Biondi A', 'Mayer SP', 'Greaves M']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. jwiemels@epi.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromosome Breakage/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,2000/09/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/19 11:00'],"['2000/09/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/19 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::AID-GCC1028>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1028>3.0.co;2-d [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000 Nov;29(3):219-28. doi: 10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1028>3.0.co;2-d.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficiencies of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into early (23-28 weeks' gestation) and term (37-41 weeks' gestation) umbilical cord blood CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. STUDY DESIGN: CD34(+) cells were purified from cyropreserved early (23-28 weeks' gestation) and term (37-40 weeks' gestation) umbilical cord blood specimens with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The CD34(+) cells were then transduced in virus-containing medium (gibbon ape leukemia virus pseudotype vector LAPSN [PG13]) in wells coated with the recombinant human fibronectin fragment CH-296 and in the presence of multiple hematopoietic growth factors (interleukin 6, stem cell factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and megakaryocyte growth and development factor) and protamine sulfate. The LAPSN (PG13) virus-containing medium was changed every 12 hours for 48 hours, after which time colony-forming cells were assayed in soft agar. The gibbon ape leukemia virus pseudotype vector LAPSN (PG13) contains the human placental alkaline phosphatase and neomycin phosphotransferase (neo ) genes. The efficiency of gene transfer was assessed by histochemical staining of colony-forming cells in agar for expression of heat-stable alkaline phosphatase. RESULTS: Gene transfers, as assessed by alkaline phosphatase staining of colony-forming cells (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and erythroid burst-forming units), were similar for CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells from early (58.4% +/- 11.8%) and term (63.2% +/- 12.5%) gestation fetal umbilical cord blood. CONCLUSION: CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells from midgestation fetal blood can be transduced with high efficiency using techniques optimized for postnatal samples with a gibbon ape leukemia virus pseudotype vector. The early fetus may be a preferable target for gene therapy because of the higher number of circulating CD34(+) and CD38(-) cells relative to term cord blood, their greater proliferative capacity, and the rapid expansion of the fetal hematopoietic system that occurs from the second trimester to delivery. Because in vitro studies of gene transfer into hematopoietic progenitor cells and long-term culture-initiation cells have not been predictive of the efficiency of gene transfer into marrow-repopulating cells in vivo, studies that examine clinically applicable approaches to in utero gene therapy in appropriate animal models are still needed.","['Shields, L E', 'Kiem, H P', 'Andrews, R G']","['Shields LE', 'Kiem HP', 'Andrews RG']","['Division of Perinatal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Washington School of School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195-6460, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Obstet Gynecol,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,0370476,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/genetics', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Gestational Age', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Kanamycin Kinase/genetics', 'Placenta/enzymology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology']",,2000/09/19 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/19 11:00'],"['2000/09/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/19 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9378(00)79893-0 [pii]', '10.1067/mob.2000.106752 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2000 Sep;183(3):732-7. doi: 10.1067/mob.2000.106752.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The Working Group in charge of the study included representatives of French radiation protection institutes, nuclear operators, members of environmental organisations and international experts. The methodology retained developed three steps RESULTS: The reconstructed cohort included 6656 individuals born between 1954 and 1996, who lived in the study area for at least one year between 1978 and 1996 before the age of 25. The number of person-years between 1978 and 1996 is 69 308. On the basis of the calculated doses, the estimated number of radiation-induced leukaemia attributable to releases from local nuclear installations was less than 0.002 for the period 1978-1996. CONCLUSIONS: This result constitutes a best estimate of the risk of radiation-induced leukaemia among young people in the canton of Beaumont-Hague. Nevertheless, this estimation must be interpreted in the light of the limits inherent to the risk assessment process and some participants of the Working Group expressed some reservations. The estimated number of radiation-induced leukaemia attributable to local nuclear installations is low in comparison to the 4 cases of leukaemia observed by epidemiological studies during the same period. It is therefore very unlikely that releases from local nuclear installations could notably explain the high incidence of leukaemia observed among young people in the canton of Beaumont-Hague.","['Laurier, D', 'Rommens, C', 'Drombry-Ringeard, C', 'Merle-Szeremeta, A', 'Degrange, J']","['Laurier D', 'Rommens C', 'Drombry-Ringeard C', 'Merle-Szeremeta A', 'Degrange J']","[""Institut de Protection et de Surete Nucleaire, Departement de Protection de la sante de l'Homme et de Dosimetrie, Service d'Evaluation et de Gestion des Risques.

STI571 selectively inhibits the Abl and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinases in vitro and blocks cellular proliferation and tumor growth of Bcr-abl- or v-abl-expressing cells. We have further investigated the profile of STI571 against related receptor tyrosine kinases. STI571 was found to potently inhibit the kinase activity of the alpha- and beta-PDGF receptors and the receptor for stem cell factor, but not the closely related c-Fms, Flt-3, Kdr, Flt-1, and Tek tyrosine kinases. Additionally, no inhibition of c-Met or nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as Src and Jak-2 has been observed. In cell-based assays, STI571 selectively inhibited PDGF and stem cell factor-mediated cellular signaling, including ligand-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation, inositol phosphate formation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and proliferation. These results expand the profile of STI571 and suggest that in addition to chronic myelogenous leukemia, STI571 may have clinical potential in the treatment of diseases that involve abnormal activation of c-Kit or PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases.","['Buchdunger, E', 'Cioffi, C L', 'Law, N', 'Stover, D', 'Ohno-Jones, S', 'Druker, B J', 'Lydon, N B']","['Buchdunger E', 'Cioffi CL', 'Law N', 'Stover D', 'Ohno-Jones S', 'Druker BJ', 'Lydon NB']","['Novartis Pharma AG, Oncology Research, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland. buchdunger@pharma.novartis.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*drug effects/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Stem Cell Factor/physiology']",,2000/09/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/19 11:00'],"['2000/09/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/19 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2000 Oct;295(1):139-45.,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, observational cohort analysis. SETTING: Forty ICUs in 16 countries. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to one of the participating ICUs in May 1995, except those who stayed in the ICU for less than 48 h after uncomplicated surgery, were included. After the exclusion of 38 patients with a history of chronic renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, a total of 1411 patients were studied. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of the patients, 348 (24.7%) developed ARF, as diagnosed by a serum creatinine of 300 micromol/l (3.5 mg/dl) or more and/or a urine output of less than 500 ml/day. The most important risk factors for the development of ARF present on admission were acute circulatory or respiratory failure; age more than 65 years, presence of infection, past history of chronic heart failure (CHF), lymphoma or leukemia, or cirrhosis. ARF patients developed MOF earlier than non-ARF patients (median 24 vs 48 h after ICU admission, p < 0.05). ARF patients older than 65 years with a past history of CHF or with any organ failure on admission were most likely to develop MOF. ICU mortality was 3 times higher in ARF than in other patients (42.8% vs 14.0%, p < 0.01). Oliguric ARF was an independent risk factor for overall mortality as determined by a multivariate regression analysis (OR = 1.59 [CI 95%: 1.23-2.06], p < 0.01). Infection increased the risk of death associated with all factors. Factors that increased the ICU mortality of ARF patients were a past history of hematologic malignancy, age more than 65 years, the number of failing organs on admission and the presence of acute cardiovascular failure. CONCLUSION: In ICU patients, the most important risk factors for ARF or mortality from ARF are often present on admission.

In murine yolk sac cells obtained on Day 10.5-11.5 of pregnancy and cultured in a modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM-plus/20: the postfix represents the concentration of FBS added in percentage), many cells exhibited strong immunoreactivities to the monoclonal antibodies 4C9 and 2C9 which are known to react with PGC specifically. Both the 4C9- and the 2C9-positive cells were sensitive to the treatment with busulfan added in vitro, supporting the supposition that they were PGCs. The respective numbers of the 4C9- and the 2C9-positive cells increased approximately 4 and 12 times when they were cultured in DMEM-plus/20 fortified with SCF, LIF, bFGF and TNF-alpha (DMEM-NT/20). When the R1 cells were cultured in the yolk sac-conditioned DMEM-NT/20 medium on the laminin substratum, the entire colonies were faintly stained with 4C9 but not with 2C9. At times solitary ES cells migrated out from the colonies, and reacted strongly with 4C9. When yolk sac cells and R1 cells were cultured on the two sides of a collagen-coated membrane, the yolk sac cells being feeder cells, some R1 cell colonies were intensely stained as a whole with either the 4C9 or the 2C9 antibody, suggesting that these colonies might be composed of cells clonally derived from stem cells which either had been destined to become the germ line cells or had already acquired cellular characteristics close to PGCs. It was tentatively concluded that the R1 cell population contained, as judged from the immunoreactivities, germ-cell-like cells, and that the yolk sac cells and/or their secretory products might facilitate the proliferation of, or the conversion of R1 cells to, the germ-cell-like cells.","['Nakagawa, S', 'Saburi, S', 'Yamanouchi, K', 'Tojo, H', 'Tachi, C']","['Nakagawa S', 'Saburi S', 'Yamanouchi K', 'Tojo H', 'Tachi C']","['Department of Animal Resource Sciences, School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Arch Histol Cytol,Archives of histology and cytology,8806082,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,,"['Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism', 'Busulfan/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Combinations', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Germ Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Yolk Sac/*cytology/metabolism']",,2000/09/16 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/16 11:00'],"['2000/09/16 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/16 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1679/aohc.63.229 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Histol Cytol. 2000 Jul;63(3):229-41. doi: 10.1679/aohc.63.229.,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed a similar pattern of chromosome gains and losses detected in typical and atypical B-cell CLL, suggesting they are related disorders. Gain on chromosome 12 material occurred in cases that were apparently normal by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The common region mapped to chromosome 12q21. Gains on chromosome 4 were present in 74% (32) of cases analyzed and were confirmed by interphase FISH in 30% (13) of cases. We previously have shown the strong association between trisomy 12 as detected by FISH and CD11a expression in atypical B-cell CLL.

Activated Ras can stimulate signal transduction cascades, leading to cell proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis. It is also one of the most commonly mutated genes in both solid tumours and haematologic neoplasias. In leukaemia and tumours, aberrant Ras signalling can be induced directly by Ras mutation or indirectly by altering genes that associate with Ras or its signalling pathways. A requisite for Ras function is localization to the plasma membrane, which is induced by the post-translational modification farnesylation. Molecules that interfere with this Ras modification have been used as antitumour agents. Ras is emerging as a dual regulator of cell functions, playing either positive or negative roles in the control of proliferation or apoptosis. The diversity of Ras-mediated effects may be related in part to the differential involvement of Ras homologues in distinct cellular processes or to the expanding array of Ras effectors.","['Ayllon, V', 'Rebollo, A']","['Ayllon V', 'Rebollo A']","['Department of Immunology and Oncology, UAM, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Mol Membr Biol,Molecular membrane biology,9430797,['EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)'],IM,,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",134,2000/09/16 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/16 11:00'],"['2000/09/16 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/16 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09687680050117093 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Membr Biol. 2000 Apr-Jun;17(2):65-73. doi: 10.1080/09687680050117093.,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve patients (10 transfusion dependent) received therapy for a median of 99 days (range 49-284). Toxicity caused four patients to discontinue the drug combination. Six patients fulfilled response criteria. Four patients became transfusion independent, and 50% reduction in the need for blood transfusions was noted in one patient. Blood parameters of one untransfused patient increased by >30%. Blood count remained unsupported in three patients, even at a median of 12 months after trial discontinuation. Apoptosis of marrow cells and selected CD34(+) progenitors was detected in a median of 49.5% (range 3. 6%-90%) and 10.6% (range 3.6%-100%; p < 0.01), respectively.

In the present study, we investigated whether the antineoplastic effects of trimidox (3,4, 5-trihydroxybenzamidoxime), a novel inhibitor of RR, were due to induction of apoptosis.HL-60 cells were incubated with various concentrations of trimidox. Consequently, cell morphology, DNA condensation, annexin binding, DNA fragmentation, and signature type cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase and gelsolin were determined. We also tested the involvement of CD95 and CD95 ligand in apoptosis induction. Furthermore, we examined the c-myc expression of HL-60 cells after incubation with trimidox in order to elucidate a possible association between c-myc expression and induction of apoptosis in the case of trimidox. Trimidox incubation caused a time-dependent increase of c-myc RNA expression and this was accompanied by the induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis was triggered independently of CD95 by the activation of caspases and PARP cleavage. We conclude that trimidox is able to induce programmed cell death. The induction of apoptosis was demonstrated by various biochemical and morphological methods and seems to be associated with the induction of c-myc. Apoptosis was induced by the activation of caspases and without change of the CD95 and CD95 ligand expression.","['Fritzer-Szekeres, M', 'Grusch, M', 'Luxbacher, C', 'Horvath, S', 'Krupitza, G', 'Elford, H L', 'Szekeres, T']","['Fritzer-Szekeres M', 'Grusch M', 'Luxbacher C', 'Horvath S', 'Krupitza G', 'Elford HL', 'Szekeres T']","['Clinical Institute for Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamidoxime)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamidines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'LHQ7J5KV9B (Bisbenzimidazole)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamidines/*pharmacology', 'Bisbenzimidazole', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gelsolin/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, myc', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Propidium', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'fas Receptor/analysis']",,2000/09/16 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/16 11:00'],"['2000/09/16 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/16 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00484-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00484-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Aug;28(8):924-30. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00484-7.,,,,,,,,,,,

Although expression and activation of caspase-3/CPP32 protein have been studied in many tissues and leukemia cell lines, this has not been explored in primitive hematopoietic CD34(+) cells. In this study, we evaluated expression and activation of caspase-3/CPP32 protein in CD34(+) cells from cord blood (CB) during apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, and flow cytometry analysis were used in this study to determine the expression of caspase-3/CPP32 in CD34(+) CB cells during apoptosis. Our results demonstrated that caspase-3/CPP32 mRNA was constitutively expressed at a very low level in freshly isolated CD34(+) cells. Expression of caspase-3/CPP32 mRNA and protein was upregulated when these cells were first expanded in suspension culture with growth factors for 3 days. However, only the 32 kDa inactive caspase-3/CPP32 proenzyme was detected in the freshly isolated CD34(+) cells and after 3 days expansion with cytokines. Within 12 hours after growth factor withdrawal from expanded cells caspase-3/CPP32 was activated and a cleavage 20 kDa protein was detected; a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was cleaved by activated caspase-3/CPP32. Activation of caspase-3/CPP32 and apoptosis upon growth factor withdrawal were inhibited/reduced by the caspase inhibitors, z-VAD-fmk and DEVD-CHO.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Marrow of 5-fluorouracil pretreated donor mice were transfected with a retroviral vector containing the murine IL-2 gene and transplanted into lethally irradiated syngeneic hosts. RESULTS: Productive insertion of the IL-2 gene could be demonstrated at various intervals post-transplant without impairment of hematopoietic engraftment. Endogenously augmented IL-2 release resulted in a selective increase in CD4(+), CD8(+), and NK1.1(+) population in spleen and bone marrow, as well as significant cytolytic activity against syngeneic leukemia cells in vitro. Our results also illustrate the interdependence among the magnitude of systemic IL-2 levels, the number of IL-2-transduced cells in the transplant inoculum, and the appearance of systemic toxicity. Infusion of marrow transduced with high-titer, high-expressing IL-2 retrovirus resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in the recipients. Our studies demonstrate that mortality was secondary to severe lymphocytic infiltration of liver and lung, which was associated with increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1. Reducing the number of IL-2-transduced cells in the bone marrow inoculum, however, resulted in significantly improved survival with no adverse events being evident during the post-transplant period. CONCLUSION: Delivery of IL-2 to the bone marrow can be achieved by transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic cells, however, the overall feasibility is strongly influenced by the number of transduced cells in the bone marrow inocolum and/or the expression pattern of IL-2 in vivo.","['Kuhr, T', 'Bechter, O', 'Dirnhofer, S', 'Geley, S', 'Gachter, A', 'Pall, G', 'Url, M', 'Dietrich, H', 'Oberaigner, P', 'Klima, G', 'Eisterer, W', 'Hilbe, W', 'Lukas, P', 'Thaler, J']","['Kuhr T', 'Bechter O', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Geley S', 'Gachter A', 'Pall G', 'Url M', 'Dietrich H', 'Oberaigner P', 'Klima G', 'Eisterer W', 'Hilbe W', 'Lukas P', 'Thaler J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. thomas.kuehr@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Transfection', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis']",,2000/09/16 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/16 11:00'],"['2000/09/16 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/16 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00487-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00487-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Aug;28(8):895-906. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00487-2.,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the viral determinants of neuropathogenicity of the molecularly cloned PVC-441 MuLV, chimeras were constructed between PVC-441 MuLV and F-MuLV clones at appropriate restriction enzyme sites that divide the viral genome approximately in LTR-non-coding, gag-, pol-, and env-gene regions. Results indicated that the LTR-non-coding and the gag-gene regions of PVC-441 MuLV affected independently the neuropathogenicity in combination with the env gene region as evidenced clinically and pathologically. Studies on the distribution of vacuolar degeneration suggested that the pons and cervical spinal cord areas were the primary targets and the large brain was the latest target of PVC-441 MuLV. Further studies with chimeric viruses that were formed in the LTR-non-coding and the gag gene regions revealed that at least four factors affected the neuropathogenicity of PVC-441 MuLV. Two factors were found in the U3, and R-U5-5'-non-coding regions, and at least two factors in the gag gene region that contained the N-terminal part of the pol gene.

In contrast to this type 1 activity, dose response experiments with okadaic acid (OA), a well characterised inhibitor of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases, indicated that type 2A is the predominant activity detected in host B cells. Furthermore, consistent with polycation-specific activation of the type 2A phosphatase, protamine failed to activate the parasite-associated phosphorylase a phosphatase activity. Moreover, inhibition of phosphorylase a dephosphorylation by phospho-DARPP-32, a specific type 1 inhibitor, clearly demonstrated that a type 1 phosphatase is specifically associated with the parasite, while the type 2A is predominantly expressed in the host lymphocyte. Since an antibody against bovine catalytic protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) subunit only recognised the PP1 in B cells, but not in parasite extracts, we conclude that in parasites the PP1 activity is of parasitic origin.

In a group of healthy volunteers, HU significantly attenuated the decrease in cortisol levels occurring between 09:00 and 11:00 hours with respect to the same subjects receiving placebo. Given the different circadian rhythms of the two species, such an effect of HU in man appeared to be the counterpart of the increase in serum corticosterone occurring in the rat.

One species of Candida, Candida tropicalis, was responsible for 11 of the 12 cases, indicating increased pathogenicity of this organism in CNS disease. The cases were invariably fatal, supporting aggressive treatment of candidal meningitis in immunocompromised patients and further study of the prevention, diagnosis, and management of C. tropicalis meningitis.","['McCullers, J A', 'Vargas, S L', 'Flynn, P M', 'Razzouk, B I', 'Shenep, J L']","['McCullers JA', 'Vargas SL', 'Flynn PM', 'Razzouk BI', 'Shenep JL']","[""Departments of Infectious Diseases and Virology and Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. jon.mccullers@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Candida/*isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Meningitis, Fungal/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Risk Factors']",,2000/09/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/15 11:00'],"['1999/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2000/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2000/09/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/15 11:00 [entrez]']","['CID994190 [pii]', '10.1086/313987 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2000 Aug;31(2):451-7. doi: 10.1086/313987.

Leukocytes are attracted to sites of inflammation by chemokines. One such chemokine is monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, a member of the C-C subfamily of chemokines. We investigated whether HTLV-I infection causes up-regulation of MCP-1, which may in turn cause recruitment of leukocytes to HTLV-I-infected areas. We now report that MCP-1 mRNA levels are elevated in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines, when compared with uninfected ones. We further confirmed secretion of MCP-1 by HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines. MCP-1 mRNA was also expressed in leukemic cells from patients with adult T-cell leukemia. The 5' transcriptional regulatory region of the MCP-1 gene was activated by the HTLV-I-encoded transactivator Tax in the human T-cell line Jurkat, in which endogenous MCP-1 is induced by Tax. By using site-specific point mutations, we have identified two closely spaced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB sites, A1 and A2, to be important for Tax-mediated transactivation of the MCP-1 gene. Through the use of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrated that Tax induced NF-kappaB binding to both MCP-1 kappaB sites. This is the first report to demonstrate that Tax can transactivate the MCP-1 gene through the induction of NF-kappaB. Our results thus reveal how Tax disrupts the normally regulated MCP-1 gene and leads to its constitutive expression in HTLV-I-infected cells. These findings may have important implications for our understanding of HTLV-I-associated diseases.","['Mori, N', 'Ueda, A', 'Ikeda, S', 'Yamasaki, Y', 'Yamada, Y', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Morikawa, S', 'Geleziunas, R', 'Yoshimura, T', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Mori N', 'Ueda A', 'Ikeda S', 'Yamasaki Y', 'Yamada Y', 'Tomonaga M', 'Morikawa S', 'Geleziunas R', 'Yoshimura T', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Japan. n-mori@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-rel)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Chemokine CCL2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/virology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-rel/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/physiology/virology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology']",,2000/09/15 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/09/15 11:00'],"['2000/09/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/15 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Sep 1;60(17):4939-45.,,,,,,,,,,,

Evocarpine-induced apoptosis was markedly inhibited by treatment of the cells with dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Similar results were obtained with other commonly used cyclic adenosine monophosphate analogues, chlorophenylthio-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate-elevating agent, forskolin. In contrast, pretreatment of HL-60 cells with KT5720, an inhibitor of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase A, abrogated the protective effects of cyclic adenosine monophosphate analogues and forskolin on evocrpine-induced apoptosis.

From 1980 to 1997 4,447 CNS tumours in children below 15 years of age have been reported to the registry. From 1988 to 1997 the average annual incidence was 2.5/100,000 children. This corresponds to 19.2% of the registered diseases. Compared with incidence rates reported from other developed countries one can estimate that there is about 25% underreporting of CNS tumours in the GCCR. This is in contrast to the relatively complete ascertainment of other childhood malignancies (above 95%). Based on 3012 incident cases from 1988 to 1997 the Kaplan-Meier-estimate of 5-year-survival probability is 65% for all CNS tumours and 54% for PNETs and gliomas. An active long-term-follow-up shows that 30% of 142 children with secondary neoplasms following primary lymphoid leukaemias developed a CNS tumour. Following any primary childhood malignancies 45 CNS tumours were recorded, amongst these were one third leukaemias. The paper reports first results from a population based case control study which included 466 children with CNS tumours and 2,458 healthy controls.

This method utilizes the high affinity of carbodiimides for both single- and double-stranded nucleic acids. Carbodiimide-mediated end-attachment of driver RNA to microplates allows semisolid phase hybridization between driver RNA and target cDNA, and ensures easy removal of RNA/cDNA hybrids composed of the genes commonly expressed in driver and target. As a result, the target-specific genes are left unhybridized and enriched in the hybridization supernatant. We define the optimal conditions for the method as a target/driver RNA ratio of 1:10 and a period of hybridization of 24 h. There are at least three major advantages with the present method: (1) The entire procedure, which consists of two steps, is very simple; (2) hybridization efficiency can be monitored before further processing of the samples; and (3) rare transcripts can be effectively enriched. This method may be a powerful tool to isolate the genes specifically expressed in particular cell or tissue types, and is easily applicable to many studies in molecular biology and genetics.

Gene transfer of tumor antigen and cytokine genes into DCs could be an important strategy for immunotherapeutic applications. Dendritic cells derived from peripheral blood monocytes do not divide and are therefore poor candidates for gene transfer by Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV)-based retroviral vectors. Lentiviral vectors are emerging as a powerful tool for gene delivery into dividing and nondividing cells. A three-plasmid expression system pseudotyped with the envelope from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) was used to generate lentiviral vector particles expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Peripheral blood monocyte-derived DCs were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 and transduced with lentiviral or Mo-MuLV-based vectors expressing EGFP. FACS analysis of lentiviral vector-transduced DCs derived either from normal healthy volunteers or from melanoma patients demonstrated transduction efficiency ranging from 70 to 90% compared with 2-8% using Mo-MuLV-based vectors pseudotyped with VSV-G. Comparison of lentiviral vectors expressing EGFP driven by CMV or human PGK promoters showed similar levels of transgene expression. Lentiviral vector preparations produced in the absence of HIV accessory proteins transduced DCs at efficiencies equal to vectors produced with accessory proteins. Alu-HIV-1 LTR PCR demonstrated the genomic integration of the lentiviral vector in the transduced DCs. Transduced cells showed characteristic dendritic cell phenotype and strong allostimulatory capacity and maintained the ability to respond to activation signals such as CD40 ligand and lipopolysaccharide. These results provide evidence that lentiviral vectors are efficient tools for gene transfer and expression in monocyte-derived DCs that could be useful for immunotherapeutic applications.,"['Chinnasamy, N', 'Chinnasamy, D', 'Toso, J F', 'Lapointe, R', 'Candotti, F', 'Morgan, R A', 'Hwu, P']","['Chinnasamy N', 'Chinnasamy D', 'Toso JF', 'Lapointe R', 'Candotti F', 'Morgan RA', 'Hwu P']","['Clinical Gene Therapy Branch, NHGRI, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,,"['Alu Elements/genetics', 'Antigens, CD', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*physiology/virology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Melanoma/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Monocytes/*cytology/virology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",,2000/09/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/15 11:00'],"['2000/09/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430340050129512 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2000 Sep 1;11(13):1901-9. doi: 10.1089/10430340050129512.,,,,,,,,,,,

Interaction between monoclonal antibody clones, fluorochromes and sample preparation protocols.",53-65,"Detection of intracellular myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD79a and CD3 has become the most specific tool for the assignment of myeloid, B- and T-lymphoid lineages in acute leukemias. In order to establish the best combination of monoclonal antibody reagent and sample preparation technique for the intracellular detection of these three markers, we compared six different cell fixation-permeabilization kits (Cytofix/Cytoperm, Fix and Perm, Intraprep, Intrastain, Permeacyte and Permeafix) using 12 fluorochrome conjugates derived from seven monoclonal antibody (mAb) clones. A total of 21 samples corresponding to normal peripheral blood (n=4), normal bone marrow (n=3), acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML, n=6), precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n=6) and T-ALL (n=2) cases, were analysed in two centers. All fixation/permeabilization methods resulted in decreased side scatter and mostly increased forward scatter as compared to erythrocyte-lyse-washed and 1% paraformaldehyde fixed samples. The autofluorescence levels of the leukocyte populations was only significantly increased with use of the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit and mildly with the other techniques. In addition, non-specific staining increased significantly for combinations of any anti-MPO mAb with the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit and for the CD3 clone S4.1 combined with any intracellular method. Anti-MPO antibodies gave a stronger fluorescence signal when conjugated to PE than when coupled to FITC. In conclusion, MPO-7-PE, UCHT-1-PE (CD3) and any HM57-PE conjugate (CD79a) in combination with Fix and Perm, Intraprep, Intrastain or Permeafix, provided specific staining of the respective markers in sufficient intensities. Thus, combined selection of fixation/permeabilization kits and monoclonal antibody reagents against CD3, CD79a and MPO is required for obtaining optimal cytoplasmic detection of these antigens.","['Kappelmayer, J', 'Gratama, J W', 'Karaszi, E', 'Menendez, P', 'Ciudad, J', 'Rivas, R', 'Orfao, A']","['Kappelmayer J', 'Gratama JW', 'Karaszi E', 'Menendez P', 'Ciudad J', 'Rivas R', 'Orfao A']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology, University Medical School of Debrecen, P.O.

However there is now increasing evidence to support its value in preventing transfusion transmission of infectious agents and in reducing some of the adverse immunomodulatory effects of allogeneic transfusion. The financial costs of providing universal leucocyte depletion are substantial, but, if it transpires that leucocyte depletion has a beneficial effect in reducing, for example, postoperative infection rates, then the health economic gains in this patient group alone may largely or wholly offset these financial costs. The experience in the UK and other European countries in terms of these collateral clinical benefits will help other countries, where the risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease may not be so great, to decide whether to similarly adopt universal leucocyte depletion.","['Roddie, P H', 'Turner, M L', 'Williamson, L M']","['Roddie PH', 'Turner ML', 'Williamson LM']","['Academic Transfusion Medicine Unit, University of Edinburgh-Leukaemia Research Fund, John Hughes Bennett Laboratory, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,,"['Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Europe', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",88,2000/09/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/15 11:00'],"['2000/09/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/15 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/blre.2000.0130 [doi]', 'S0268-960X(00)90130-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2000 Sep;14(3):145-56. doi: 10.1054/blre.2000.0130.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,,,,

The chronic myeloid disorders include chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (myelofibrosis). These disorders display varying propensities for pathologic enlargement of the spleen which can lead to mechanical discomfort, hypercatabolic symptoms, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and portal hypertension. Splenectomy has been found to be of little benefit in the early stages of chronic myeloid leukemia. Similarly, the benefit of splenectomy in advanced cases is limited to symptomatic palliation and treatment of delayed engraftment after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Although polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are also characterized by splenomegaly, splenectomy is not considered a therapeutic option in the absence of transformation of the disease into myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. Splenectomy has been studied most in myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. Although there is no clear survival advantage to splenectomy in this disorder, the surgical procedure can result in substantial palliation of mechanical discomfort, hypercatabolic symptoms, portal hypertension, and anemia. However, the procedure is associated with an approximately 9% mortality rate, and the postsplenectomy occurrence of extreme thrombocytosis, hepatomegaly, and leukemic transformation is of major concern.","['Mesa, R A', 'Elliott, M A', 'Tefferi, A']","['Mesa RA', 'Elliott MA', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*surgery', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/complications/*surgery', '*Splenectomy']",93,2000/09/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/15 11:00'],"['2000/09/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/15 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/blre.2000.0132 [doi]', 'S0268-960X(00)90132-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2000 Sep;14(3):121-9. doi: 10.1054/blre.2000.0132.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,,,,

Late complications, tobacco use, and health insurance status were assessed. RESULTS: Growth abnormalities were found in 51% of survivors, neurocognitive abnormalities in 30%, transfusion-acquired hepatitis in 28%, endocrine abnormalities in 16%, cataracts in 12%, and cardiac abnormalities in 8%. Younger age at the time of diagnosis or initiation of radiation therapy, higher dose of radiation, and treatment in groups B and C were risk factors for the development of academic difficulties and greater decrease in height Z: score. In addition, treatment in group C was a risk factor for a greater decrease in weight Z: score and the development of growth-hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, infertility, and cataracts.

Groupo Espanol de Trasplante de Medula Osea en Ninos.,3256-61,"PURPOSE: Infants with acute leukemia have a poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy. It is still unknown if stem-cell transplantation (SCT) can improve the outcome of these patients. In the present study, we review our experience with SCT in infant acute leukemia to clarify this issue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the results of 26 infants who were submitted to a SCT for acute leukemia. There were 15 cases of acute myeloid leukemia and 10 cases of acute lymphoid leukemia. One patient had a bilineal leukemia. Twenty-two patients were in their first complete response (CR1), three were in their second CR, and one was in relapse. Eight patients were submitted to allogeneic SCT, and 18 underwent autologous SCT. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 67 months, the 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) are 64% (SE = 9%) and 63% (SE = 10%), respectively. Autologous and allogeneic SCT offered similar outcome. There was not any transplant-related mortality, and all deaths were caused by relapse in the first 6 months after SCT. In multivariate analysis, the single factor associated with better DFS was an interval between CR1 and SCT of less than 4 months (P: <.025). CONCLUSION: SCT is a valid option in the treatment of infant acute leukemia, and it may overcome the high risk of relapse with conventional chemotherapy showing very reduced toxicity. This study suggests that SCT should be performed in CR1 in the early phase of the disease.","['Marco, F', 'Bureo, E', 'Ortega, J J', 'Badell, I', 'Verdaguer, A', 'Martinez, A', 'Munoz, A', 'Madero, L', 'Olive, T', 'Cubells, J', 'Castel, V', 'Sastre, A', 'Maldonado, M S', 'Diaz, M A']","['Marco F', 'Bureo E', 'Ortega JJ', 'Badell I', 'Verdaguer A', 'Martinez A', 'Munoz A', 'Madero L', 'Olive T', 'Cubells J', 'Castel V', 'Sastre A', 'Maldonado MS', 'Diaz MA']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain. fernandomarco@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/09/14 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/14 11:00'],"['2000/09/14 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/14 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.18.3256 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Sep 15;18(18):3256-61. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.18.3256.,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfer of a beta-gluc gene into the liver reduces hepatic pathology as well as storage in other organs via uptake of secreted protein. A Moloney murine leukemia-based retroviral vector expressing the human beta-gluc cDNA was injected intravascularly into MPS VII mice during hepatocyte replication, which was induced with im injection of an adenoviral vector that transiently expressed hepatocyte growth factor (Ad.CMV. HGF). This procedure resulted in transduction of approximately 1% of hepatocytes, 1% of normal liver enzyme activity, and a reduction in lysosomal storage in the liver at 3.5 months. Surprisingly, controls that received retroviral vector without HGF had transduction of nonparenchymal cells in the liver, significant levels of enzyme and RNA in the liver at 2 but not 3.5 months, and reduced lysosomal storage at 3.5 months.

A QSAR study.,100-6,"L1210/VCR-1 and L1210/VCR-2 cell lines are multidrug resistant (MDR) sublines obtained by adaptation of mouse leukemic cell line L1210 to vincristine and, the development of MDR in these cell lines has been found to be associated with an overexpression of P-glycoprotein (PGP). In the present work we studied the relationship between the structure of 15 cytotoxic active substances (drugs) and their cytotoxicities on L1210/VCR-1 and L1210/VCR-2 resistant cell lines. The resistance of these MDR cells to the respective drugs was expressed as the ratio of IC50 values obtained for resistant and sensitive cells. These values of resistance were correlated with the following physico-chemical constants of the test substances: binding energy, Ebind; total energy of the molecule, Esum; aromaticity, Kpi; molecular weight, Mw; acidobasic constant, pKa; partition coefficient in water/octanol two phase system, log(p). It has been found that according to the cytotoxic effects the tested drugs may be divided into three groups: (i) drugs with higher cytotoxicity to the resistant cell lines as to sensitive cells (collateral hypersensitivity); (ii) drugs exhibiting approximately similar effects on sensitive and resistant cell lines; (iii) drugs with weaker cytotoxicity to resistant cells than to sensitive cells. No direct correlations with any physico-chemical constant described above could be established for cell resistance to the drug studied. However, resistance values could be fitted by multiple exponential regression with all described physico-chemical constants implied as six independent variables. The latter procedure made us to conclude that the ability of a drug to be a substrate for PGP is connected with its fulfilling the following criteria: (i) flexible structure of its molecule; (ii) molecular weight lower than approximately 1,300 g/mol; (iii) nonprotonized character at pH 7.0.","['Breier, A', 'Drobna, Z', 'Docolomansky, P', 'Barancik, M']","['Breier A', 'Drobna Z', 'Docolomansky P', 'Barancik M']","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. usrdtylo@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,2000/09/14 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/09/14 11:00'],"['2000/09/14 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/14 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2000;47(2):100-6.,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of the BCR-ABL transcript was determined and normalized using the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping gene product as an endogenous reference. In the single step real-time PCR assay, tenfold serial dilutions of cDNA of the K5652 cell line remained positive down to 100 pg cDNA only. However, molecular relapses of CML after transplant were only safely detectable when a nested real-time PCR assay was performed, which was able to detect 1-10 pg cDNA from a tenfold serial dilution. The median normalized BCR-ABL transcript level was measured as 0.004% in 17 patients with a molecular relapse, 0.4% in 7 patients with a cytogenetic relapse, 2.6% in 36 patients with a stable phase of CML, and 36% in 5 patients with a relapse in a blast crisis. The analyzed median normalized amount of BCR-ABL transcript differed significantly (P<0.001) between the various disease stages. In ten CML patients with relapse, the real-time PCR method was used to monitor the response of various immunotherapies as donor leukocyte infusions, withdrawal of immunosuppression, or interferon-alpha application. The results of the quantitative evaluation of BCR-ABL transcripts reflected very well the clinical effect of the different applied immunotherapies. The new real-time PCR method seems to be a suitable technique for the early detection of relapse after allogeneic transplant in patients with the BCR-ABL transcript.

In some cases, MTX-induced renal failure occurs which may not be prevented by the standard agent folin acid as a specific antidot.

After an increase of the MTX-plasma-level 36 hours following MTX-application, increased serum creatinine levels (maximum 5.07 mg/dl) were found. The application of folinic acid was without any significant effect. Fifty-six hours following MTX, 50 U/kg carboxypeptidase-G2 was infused.

METHODS: Nineteen consecutive patients with refractory metastatic renal-cell carcinoma who had suitable donors received a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by an infusion of a peripheral-blood stem-cell allograft from an HLA-identical sibling or a sibling with a mismatch of a single HLA antigen. Cyclosporine, used to prevent graft-versus-host disease, was withdrawn early in patients with mixed T-cell chimerism or disease progression. Patients with no response received up to three infusions of donor lymphocytes. RESULTS: At the time of the last follow-up, 9 of the 19 patients were alive 287 to 831 days after transplantation (median follow-up, 402 days). Two had died of transplantation-related causes, and eight from progressive disease. In 10 patients (53 percent) metastatic disease regressed; 3 had a complete response, and 7 had a partial response. The patients who had a complete response remained in remission 27, 25, and 16 months after transplantation. Regression of metastases was delayed, occurring a median of 129 days after transplantation, and often followed the withdrawal of cyclosporine and the establishment of complete donor-T-cell chimerism. These results are consistent with a graft-versus-tumor effect. CONCLUSIONS: Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem-cell transplantation can induce sustained regression of metastatic renal-cell carcinoma in patients who have had no response to conventional immunotherapy.","['Childs, R', 'Chernoff, A', 'Contentin, N', 'Bahceci, E', 'Schrump, D', 'Leitman, S', 'Read, E J', 'Tisdale, J', 'Dunbar, C', 'Linehan, W M', 'Young, N S', 'Barrett, A J']","['Childs R', 'Chernoff A', 'Contentin N', 'Bahceci E', 'Schrump D', 'Leitman S', 'Read EJ', 'Tisdale J', 'Dunbar C', 'Linehan WM', 'Young NS', 'Barrett AJ']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1652, USA. childsr@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,['N Engl J Med. 2000 Sep 14;343(11):802-3.

Induction of HGF production may be involved in organ regeneration, wound healing and embryogenesis. We examined the effects of ascorbic acid (AsA), which stimulates the proliferation of fibroblasts, and its stable derivative, 2-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AA-2G), on HGF production by human skin fibroblasts. Basal HGF secretion was significantly stimulated by more than 0.1 mM AsA or AA-2G. Both vitamins synergistically enhanced HGF secretion stimulated by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), cholera toxin and other inducers. Induction by EGF or bFGF was most markedly potentiated by the vitamins. HGF production by the KG-1 human leukemia cell line was also augmented by AsA or AA-2G. Another stable AsA derivative, ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AA-2P) effectively promoted basal and EGF-induced HGF secretion by the fibroblasts, but ascorbic acid 2-sulfate (AA-2S) was much less effective. Intracellular AsA levels increased after the addition of AA-2G and AA-2P as well as AsA, but not after AA-2S. The effect of AA-2G was completely abrogated by the simultaneous addition of castanospermine, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, suggesting that the active form of AA-2G is AsA. Constitutive and EGF-induced HGF gene expression was also up-regulated after adding AsA or AA-2G to the cells. These results indicated that AsA acts alone or in synergy with several inducers to stimulate the production and gene expression of HGF in human skin fibroblasts and that the stable AsA derivative AA-2G is as effective as AsA in promoting HGF production.","['Wu, Y L', 'Gohda, E', 'Iwao, M', 'Matsunaga, T', 'Nagao, T', 'Takebe, T', 'Yamamoto, I']","['Wu YL', 'Gohda E', 'Iwao M', 'Matsunaga T', 'Nagao T', 'Takebe T', 'Yamamoto I']","['Department of Immunochemistry, Okayama University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Scotland,Growth Horm IGF Res,Growth hormone & IGF research : official journal of the Growth Hormone Research Society and the International IGF Research Society,9814320,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Indolizines)', '2V52R0NHXW (ascorbic acid 2-O-glucoside)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'Q0I3184XM7 (castanospermine)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indolizines/pharmacology', 'Skin/cytology']",,2000/09/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/13 11:00'],"['2000/09/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/13 11:00 [entrez]']","['S1096-6374(98)80313-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s1096-6374(98)80313-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Growth Horm IGF Res. 1998 Oct;8(5):421-8. doi: 10.1016/s1096-6374(98)80313-4.,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical course of both ET and PV is frequently complicated by potentially life-threatening thrombotic events and a variable rate of progression to myelofibrosis and leukaemic conversion (the latter in particular for PV). However, due to the relative paucity of randomised clinical trials in both ET and PV, a sound scientific basis for making therapeutic decisions is lacking. The management of patients with ET or PV should probably be addressed by categorising patient populations into groups with either a 'low risk' or 'high risk' for thrombosis after taking into account the risk factors for thrombosis (advanced age and/or previous thrombotic complications, and increased haematocrit). The goal of treatment in PV and ET is, however, not only to reduce the risk of thrombosis but also to reduce the risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukaemia or myelofibrosis. In this review we will discuss in detail the diagnosis, clinical manifestations and epidemiology, rationale for treatment, and the various treatment options for ET and PV with an emphasis on treatment efficacy and therapy-related leukaemic risk.","['van Genderen, P J', 'Troost, M M']","['van Genderen PJ', 'Troost MM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Havenziekenhuis, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,,IM,,"['Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', '*Polycythemia Vera/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Risk Factors', '*Thrombocytosis/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Thrombosis/etiology']",68,2000/09/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/13 11:00'],"['2000/09/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/13 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00002512-200017020-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs Aging. 2000 Aug;17(2):107-19. doi: 10.2165/00002512-200017020-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,

All TCL1 isoforms bind to the Akt pleckstrin homology domain. Both in vitro and in vivo TCL1 increases Akt kinase activity and as a consequence enhances substrate phosphorylation. In vivo, TCL1 stabilizes the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and enhances cell proliferation and survival. In vivo, TCL1 forms trimers, which associate with Akt. TCL1 facilitates the oligomerization and activation of Akt.

STUDY DESIGN: Review of medical records of patients requiring airway intervention during BMT over a 4-year period. RESULTS: During the 4-year period, 832 pediatric BMTs were performed. Of these, 87 patients (10.5%) required mechanical ventilation. Patients had intubation for a mean of 79 days (range, -7-638 d) after BMT. Patients received mechanical ventilation for a mean of 12 days (range, 1-85 d). Duration of ventilation was significantly longer in patients with difficult intubation; in these 54 patients there were 64 intubations. Of these intubations, 19 (30%) were difficult. These difficult intubations occurred in 16 (30%) patients. Patients with Hurler syndrome and congenital immunodeficiencies had significantly more difficult intubations than children with leukemia. The incidence of complications causing difficult intubation were difficulty visualizing cords, because of the presence of blood (63%); difficulty visualizing cords, because of edema (19%); anatomically narrowed airway (13%); limited neck extension (13%); and limited jaw opening (6%). The resulting mortality rate was 82% in children requiring intubation. Survivors were significantly younger than nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric BMT has become increasingly more common. Airway management is rarely required during the engraftment phase, but when intervention is required, it is often difficult, particularly in the nonleukemic child, and may require the skills of an otolaryngologist.

To investigate the expression of p27kip1 in malignant lymphomas and elucidate the role of p27kip1 as a possible prognostic indicator, the authors performed an immunohistochemical staining of p27kip1 correlated with Ki-67 labelling index and clinical parameters. p27kip1 expression was reduced variably in most malignant lymphomas and inversely correlated with Ki-67 labelling index (p=0.0151). Regarding chemotherapeutic response, p271kip1 expression in the complete remission group showed statistically significant difference in expression compared to the progressive disease group (p=0.0021). There were significant differences in survival between cases with low and high p27kip1 expression (p=0.0071). In a multivariate Cox analysis, p27kip1 expression was independent prognostic factors as well as other known prognostic factors including age, grade, stage and chemotherapeutic response. In conclusion, the study suggests that reduced expression of p27kip1 protein may play a role in the pathogenesis and biologically aggressive behavior of malignant lymphomas.","['Oh, Y H', 'Park, C K']","['Oh YH', 'Park CK']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemistry/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*analysis/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/09/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/13 11:00'],"['2000/09/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/13 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3346/jkms.2000.15.4.399 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2000 Aug;15(4):399-406. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2000.15.4.399.,,,,,,PMC3054650,,,,,

One patient developed severe arrhythmia because of hypomagnesemia following long-term therapy with aminoglycosides and amphotericin B. In one AIP patient hyponatremia ending in coma was attributed to the disease activity and infusion therapy. This was the cause of coma.

METHODS: Using data from a completed cohort study, we sought to refine the job-exposure matrix in a case-cohort analysis by regrouping jobs into more homogeneous groups, but without making additional measurements. From the original cohort, we selected the 164 men who died of leukemia, 145 men who died of brain cancer, and a random subcohort of 800 men (0.6% of the cohort). Erroneous job assignments were corrected and job groups were subdivided based on differences in work environments or tasks performed. RESULTS: Magnetic field exposure remained unrelated to leukemia mortality and positively associated with brain cancer mortality based on both cumulative and average magnetic field indices. Although not monotonic across the middle intervals, increased risk of brain cancer was found in relation to career exposure, with risk ratios of 1.8 (95% CI = 0.7-4.7) and 2.5 (95% CI = 1.0-6.3) in the uppermost categories for cumulative and average exposure, stronger for exposure 2-10 years past. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in exposure assignment based only on reassignment of job titles to occupational categories had little impact on the measured associations of magnetic fields with leukemia or brain cancer.","['Savitz, D A', 'Cai, J', 'van Wijngaarden, E', 'Loomis, D', 'Mihlan, G', 'Dufort, V', 'Kleckner, R C', 'Nylander-French, L', 'Kromhout, H', 'Zhou, H']","['Savitz DA', 'Cai J', 'van Wijngaarden E', 'Loomis D', 'Mihlan G', 'Dufort V', 'Kleckner RC', 'Nylander-French L', 'Kromhout H', 'Zhou H']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7400, USA. david.savitz@unc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,,"['Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Causality', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",,2000/09/13 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/13 11:00'],"['2000/09/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/13 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0274(200010)38:4<417::AID-AJIM7>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0274(200010)38:4<417::aid-ajim7>3.0.co;2-w [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2000 Oct;38(4):417-25. doi: 10.1002/1097-0274(200010)38:4<417::aid-ajim7>3.0.co;2-w.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

The site-specific cleavage mediated by RAG1 and RAG2 proteins generates two types of double-strand DNA breaks: blunt signal ends and covalently sealed hairpin coding ends. Although these DNA breaks are mainly resolved into coding joints and signal joints, they can participate in a nonstandard joining process, forming hybrid and open/shut joints that link coding ends to signal ends. In addition, the broken DNA molecules excised from different receptor gene loci could potentially be joined to generate interlocus joints. The interlocus recombination process may contribute to the translocation between antigen receptor genes and oncogenes, leading to malignant transformation of lymphocytes. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of these nonstandard recombination events, we took advantage of recombination-inducible cell lines derived from scid homozygous (s/s) and scid heterozygous (s/+) mice by transforming B-cell precursors with a temperature-sensitive Abelson murine leukemia virus mutant (ts-Ab-MLV). We can manipulate the level of recombination cleavage and end resolution by altering the cell culture temperature. By analyzing various recombination products in scid and s/+ ts-Ab-MLV transformants, we report in this study that scid cells make higher levels of interlocus and hybrid joints than their normal counterparts. These joints arise concurrently with the formation of intralocus joints, as well as with the appearance of opened coding ends. The junctions of these joining products exhibit excessive nucleotide deletions, a characteristic of scid coding joints. These data suggest that an inability of scid cells to promptly resolve their recombination ends exposes the ends to a random joining process, which can conceivably lead to chromosomal translocations.","['Lew, S', 'Franco, D', 'Chang, Y']","['Lew S', 'Franco D', 'Chang Y']","['Department of Microbiology, Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287-2701, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genotype', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/complications/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'VDJ Recombinases']",,2000/09/13 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/13 11:00'],"['2000/09/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/13 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.19.7170-7177.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Oct;20(19):7170-7. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.19.7170-7177.2000.,,"['R01 CA073857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA073857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC86270,,,,,

Although many cytokine receptors have direct binding sites for the p85 subunit of PI-3K, others, such as the interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor beta common chain (betac) and the IL-2 receptor beta chain (IL-2Rbeta), lack such sites, leaving the mechanism by which they activate PI-3K unclear. Here, we show that the protooncoprotein Shc, which promotes Ras activation by recruiting the Grb2-Sos complex in response to stimulation of cytokine stimulation, also signals to the PI-3K/Akt pathway. Analysis of Y-->F and ""add-back"" mutants of betac shows that Y577, the Shc binding site, is the major site required for Gab2 phosphorylation in response to cytokine stimulation. When fused directly to a mutant form of IL-2Rbeta that lacks other cytoplasmic tyrosines, Shc can promote Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation. Mutation of the three tyrosyl phosphorylation sites of Shc, which bind Grb2, blocks the ability of the Shc chimera to evoke Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation. Overexpression of mutants of Grb2 with inactive SH2 or SH3 domains also blocks cytokine-stimulated Gab2 phosphorylation. The majority of cytokine-stimulated PI-3K activity associates with Gab2, and inducible expression of a Gab2 mutant unable to bind PI-3K markedly impairs IL-3-induced Akt activation and cell growth. Experiments with the chimeric receptors indicate that Shc also signals to the PI-3K/Akt pathway in response to IL-2. Our results suggest that cytokine receptors lacking direct PI-3K binding sites activate Akt via a Shc/Grb2/Gab2/PI-3K pathway, thereby regulating cell survival and/or proliferation.","['Gu, H', 'Maeda, H', 'Moon, J J', 'Lord, J D', 'Yoakim, M', 'Nelson, B H', 'Neel, B G']","['Gu H', 'Maeda H', 'Moon JJ', 'Lord JD', 'Yoakim M', 'Nelson BH', 'Neel BG']","['Cancer Biology Program, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. hgu@caregroup.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Gab2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Phosphoproteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/chemistry/drug effects/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/drug effects/physiology', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src Homology Domains']",,2000/09/13 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/13 11:00'],"['2000/09/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/13 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.19.7109-7120.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Oct;20(19):7109-20. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.19.7109-7120.2000.,,"['R01 GM057931/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK050693/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK50693/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM57931/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72144/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA072144/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC86258,,,,,

The GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase (Graf) exhibits GAP activity toward the RhoA and Cdc42 GTPases, but is only weakly active toward the closely related Rac1. We determined the crystal structure of a 231-residue fragment of Graf (GrafGAP), a domain containing the GAP activity, at 2.4-A resolution. The structure clarifies the boundaries of the functional domain and yields insight to the mechanism of substrate recognition. Modeling its interaction with substrate suggested that a favorable interaction with Glu-95 of Cdc42 (Glu-97 of RhoA) would be absent with the corresponding Ala-95 of Rac1. Indeed, GrafGAP activity is diminished approximately 40-fold toward a Cdc42 E95A mutant, whereas a approximately 10-fold increase is observed for a Rac1 A95E mutant. The GrafGAP epitope that apparently interacts with Glu-95(Glu-97) contains Asn-225, which was recently found mutated in some myeloid leukemia patients. We conclude that position 95 of the GTPase is an important determinant for GrafGAP specificity in cellular function and tumor suppression.","['Longenecker, K L', 'Zhang, B', 'Derewenda, U', 'Sheffield, P J', 'Dauter, Z', 'Parsons, J T', 'Zheng, Y', 'Derewenda, Z S']","['Longenecker KL', 'Zhang B', 'Derewenda U', 'Sheffield PJ', 'Dauter Z', 'Parsons JT', 'Zheng Y', 'Derewenda ZS']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics and the Department of Microbiology, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908-0736, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ARHGAP26 protein, human)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/chemistry/metabolism', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/chemistry/metabolism']",,2000/09/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/13 11:00'],"['2000/09/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/13 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M007574200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)55996-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Dec 8;275(49):38605-10. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M007574200.,,"['GM60523/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL48807/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that wild-type EWS protein functions as an adapter molecule coupling transcription to RNA splicing by binding to hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II through the N-terminal domain of EWS and recruiting serine-arginine (SR) splicing factors through the C-terminal domain of EWS. The oncogenic EWS.Fli-1 fusion protein retains the ability to bind to hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II but lacks the ability to recruit SR proteins because of replacement of the C-terminal domain of EWS by Fli-1. In an in vivo splicing assay, the EWS.Fli-1 fusion protein inhibits SR protein-mediated E1A pre-mRNA splicing in a dominant-negative manner. These results indicate that EWS.Fli-1 interferes with the normal function of EWS and implicate uncoupling of gene transcription from RNA splicing in the pathogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma.","['Yang, L', 'Chansky, H A', 'Hickstein, D D']","['Yang L', 'Chansky HA', 'Hickstein DD']","['Medical Research Service, Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, Washington 98108, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (EWS-FLI fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serine/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",,2000/09/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/13 11:00'],"['2000/09/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/13 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M005739200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)88467-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Dec 1;275(48):37612-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M005739200.,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, adult cases were also examined using the same continuous flow blood cell separator to investigate the difference between children and adults. We examined 5 pediatric patients who had undergone chemotherapy before apheresis and 3 adult patients who were scheduled to undergo chemotherapy following apheresis. Collection was performed using a continuous-flow blood cell separator. Patients received granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs), except in the case of acute myelocytic leukemia. The processed blood volume was set to approximately 300 ml in children and 500 ml/kg of body weight in adults and the leukapheresis component was collected when approximately 50 ml of blood was processed. Six sequential samples were taken from each component in pediatric patients and 10 sequential samples from adults to obtain CD34+ cells and CFU-GMs. Counts of mononuclear cells (MNCs) and CD34+ cells in peripheral blood were measured just before and after each apheresis. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet counts in peripheral blood were monitored during apheresis. A total of 11 collections were performed for pediatric patients. The mean total CD34+ cells and CFU-GMs in each fractionated yield did not show a remarkable increase with increasing volume of blood processed. In adults, the kinetics of CD34+ cells in each fractionated yield were determined on a continuous basis and CFU-GMs increased during the course of apheresis. In pediatric patients, circulating MNCs and CD34+ cells were stable during apheresis, whereas in adult patients these cells decreased in the peripheral blood after apheresis. In both pediatric and adult patients, the platelet count in the peripheral blood decreased after apheresis. In contrast to adults, in pediatric patients who had been undergone chemotherapy, the collection efficiency did not appear to increase with increased volume of blood processed. Moreover, there was a marked platelet reduction in peripheral blood following apheresis. We conclude that the kinetics of collecting PBSCs by continuous flow blood cell separator is different between pediatric cases and adults cases. The application of LVL may be prudent in some children with malignancies, including those with a low platelet count and low body weight.","['Yamaguchi, E', 'Yamato, K', 'Miyata, Y']","['Yamaguchi E', 'Yamato K', 'Miyata Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka City University Medical School, Japan. melano@med.osaka-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain Neoplasms/therapy', 'Cell Separation/methods/standards', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Hematocrit', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukapheresis/*methods/standards', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Male', 'Platelet Count']",,2000/09/12 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/09/12 11:00'],"['2000/09/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/152581600419251 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2000 Aug;9(4):565-72. doi: 10.1089/152581600419251.,,,,,,,,,,,

The new CliniMACS system (magnetic-activated cell separation system by Miltenyi Biotech GmbH, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) was recently approved for clinical use in Europe. To evaluate its purging efficiency and engraftment data in the autologous transplant, PBSC from 28 adult patients with various malignant diseases (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, n = 17; chronic lymphocytic leukemia, n = 5; multiple myeloma, n = 4; acute lymphocytic leukemia, n = 1; medulloblastoma, n = 1) were mobilized by chemotherapy and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (10 microg/kg per day). Thirty leukapheresis products from 28 patients with a median of 4.4 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg body weight (bw)(range 0.6-10.8 x 10(8)/kg bw) and a median of 7.1 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg bw (range 2.8 to 18.8 x 10(6)/kg bw) were selected using the Cobe spectra cell separator (Cobe BCT Inc., Lakewood, CO). After the CliniMACS procedure, the median yield of CD34+ selected cells was 4.5 x 10(6)/kg (range 2.2-11.1 X 10(6)/kg bw) with a median recovery of 69.5% (range 46.9-87.3%) and a median purity of 97.7% (range 89.4-99.8%). The procedure did not alter viability of selected cells, which was tested by propidium iodide staining. So far, purified PBSC were used for autologous transplantation in 15 out of 28 patients after total body irradiation and/or high-dose chemotherapy. Median time to reach an absolute neutrophil count > 500/microl was 12 days (range 10-18 days), platelet recovery >50,000/microl occurred at day + 16 (range 11-22).

The present work shows that human T cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II) Mo virions that have originated from the T cell line (C344), but not from the B cell line (BJAB), are critically involved in mediating survival and growth effects on hematopoietic precursors (represented by both the TF-1 CD34+ cell line and by peripheral blood-derived CD34+ cells) through the maintenance or enhancement of telomerase activity and the induction of bcl-2 expression. In addition, using an interleukin-3-dependent TF-1 cell line, it was demonstrated that IL-3 deprivation was sufficient to influence the levels of telomerase activity and Bcl-2 expression in CD34+ cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that, in appropriate conditions, extended hematopoietic progenitor cell survival and proliferation following HTLV-II exposure depends on a synergistic interaction between up-regulation of Bcl-2 and activation of telomerase activity.","['Re, M C', 'Monari, P', 'Gibellini, D', 'Ciancianaini, P', ""Dall'Aglio, P P"", 'Vignoli, M', 'Furlini, G', 'Ramazzotti, E', 'Bertazzoni, U', 'Casoli, C']","['Re MC', 'Monari P', 'Gibellini D', 'Ciancianaini P', ""Dall'Aglio PP"", 'Vignoli M', 'Furlini G', 'Ramazzotti E', 'Bertazzoni U', 'Casoli C']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology/*immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/virology', 'Telomerase/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/virology', 'Virion/physiology']",,2000/09/12 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/09/12 11:00'],"['2000/09/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/152581600419143 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2000 Aug;9(4):481-7. doi: 10.1089/152581600419143.,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of autologous stem cell transplantation is now investigated as an alternative to allotransplantation due to its lower risk of serious complications. However, autotransplantation is associated with a relatively high risk of post-transplant AML relapse that can be derived from contaminating leukemia cells in the autograft. Peripheral blood mobilized stem cell (PBSC) grafts usually contain a higher number of platelets. The degree of platelet contamination is determined by the peripheral blood platelet count at the time of harvesting, and the platelets become activated and release soluble mediators during the ex vivo handling of PBSC grafts. Many of these platelet-derived mediators can bind to specific receptors expressed by AML blasts, and the platelet contamination may then alter AML blast survival and thereby influence the risk of post-transplant leukemia relapse. Therefore, we conclude that the platelet contamination of autologous stem cell grafts is possibly of clinical importance, but the effect of this nonstandardized parameter is difficult to predict in individual patients because the number of graft-contaminating platelets, the degree of platelet activation, and the effects of platelet-derived mediators on AML blasts differ between patients.","['Bruserud, O', 'Foss, B', 'Abrahamsen, J F', 'Gjertsen, B T', 'Ernst, P']","['Bruserud O', 'Foss B', 'Abrahamsen JF', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Ernst P']","['Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and the University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/standards', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects/standards']",101,2000/09/12 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/09/12 11:00'],"['2000/09/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/152581600419099 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2000 Aug;9(4):433-43. doi: 10.1089/152581600419099.,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, specific histologic subtypes of thymic epithelial neoplasms displayed differing patterns of CD74 positivity. Based on these findings, CD74 and MHC class II are useful markers for the classification of thymic epithelial neoplasms.","['Datta, M W', 'Shahsafaei, A', 'Nadler, L M', 'Freeman, G J', 'Dorfman, D M']","['Datta MW', 'Shahsafaei A', 'Nadler LM', 'Freeman GJ', 'Dorfman DM']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (invariant chain)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*biosynthesis', 'CD5 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Genes, MHC Class II/*genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/*diagnosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Thymoma/*diagnosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*metabolism/pathology']",,2000/09/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/12 11:00'],"['2000/09/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00129039-200009000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2000 Sep;8(3):210-5. doi: 10.1097/00129039-200009000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we first demonstrated that growth of TL positive lymphoma is suppressed in mice immunized by skin grafting. Immunization with bone marrow derived dendritic cells (DCs) from Tg.Con.3-1, was also found to be associated with an anti-tumor response, but less potent than skin grafting. Relative CTL precursor frequency with DC immunization was also approximately only one third that of skin grafting. The numbers of IFN-gamma producing cells in responder CD8 and CD4 T cell populations were higher with DC immunization than with skin grafting. However, DC immunization seems to induce non-specific immune responses, as re-stimulation with TL negative C3H spleen cells resulted in induction of almost half the number observed with TL positive cells. Thus, the actual number of IFN-gamma producing cells in specific responses to TL is not necessarily larger than with skin grafting immunization. The present results altogether suggest that DC immunization is capable of inducing an anti-tumor reaction, but also possibly unwanted immune responses. In vitro monitoring of specific and non-specific responses in the immune system, thus, is of particular importance for future development of cancer immunotherapy.","['Iwase, S', 'Tsujimura, K', 'Matsudaira, Y', 'Ozeki, S', 'Onozaki, K', 'Obata, Y', 'Takahashi, T']","['Iwase S', 'Tsujimura K', 'Matsudaira Y', 'Ozeki S', 'Onozaki K', 'Obata Y', 'Takahashi T']","['Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/transplantation', '*Immunotherapy', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Skin Transplantation']",,2000/09/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/12 11:00'],"['2000/09/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.2000.tb02541.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 2000;44(7):609-18. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.2000.tb02541.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the ability of a recently cloned stem cell factor, Flt3-ligand (Flt3L), in combination with interleukin-15 (IL-15), to stimulate CB mononuclear cells (MNCs) to proliferate and differentiate into NK cells, in comparison with adult peripheral blood (APB) MNCs. Unstimulated CB MNCs had low NK and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity compared with APB MNCs. A similar dose-dependent increase in NK and LAK activity and CD16/56 expression was found with IL-15 in CB and APB MNCs after 10 days of culture. The NK cytotoxicity (against K562 cells) of IL-15-treated CB MNCs was lower than that of corresponding APB MNCs, while IL-15-induced LAK activity (against Daudi cells) of CB MNCs was comparable to that of corresponding APB MNCs. IL-15 resulted in greater CD16/56 expression in CB MNCs compared with APB MNCs after 10 days of culture. Flt3L, alone or in combination with IL-15, had little effect on CD16/56 expression and cytotoxicity. Cytotoxic activities and CD16/56 expression did not alter after CD34 depletion of CB MNCs. We therefore concluded that CB NK cells could be greatly activated and expanded with IL-15, but not with Flt3L. The greater expression of CD16/56 induced by IL-15 in CB MNCs may originate from non-CD34+ NK progenitor cells.","['Lin, S J', 'Yang, M H', 'Chao, H C', 'Kuo, M L', 'Huang, J L']","['Lin SJ', 'Yang MH', 'Chao HC', 'Kuo ML', 'Huang JL']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital, Kweishan, Taoyuan, Taiwan. alicehsu@adm.cgmh.com.tw""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pediatr Allergy Immunol,Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,9106718,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Fetal Blood/drug effects/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgG/biosynthesis']",,2000/09/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/12 11:00'],"['2000/09/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/12 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatr Allergy Immunol. 2000 Aug;11(3):168-74.,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors conducted a validation substudy within the framework of a parent case-control study on risk factors for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children aged < or =9 years diagnosed in 1980-1993 in Quebec, Canada. Parental recall bias for two variables was assessed: reported distance from home to power lines compared with measured distance and reported prenatal radiographic examinations compared with hospital medical record data. For reported distance, sensitivity was 62% for a subgroup of cases living in an area in which an excess of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia was perceived and was attributed to power lines. However, for other cases, sensitivity (35%) was similar to that measured for hospital controls (36%) and was relatively close to that for population controls (22%). Specificity was high for all groups except cases from the area with a perceived excess. Sensitivity for reported prenatal radiographic examinations was similar for cases (64%) and population controls (71%) but was lower for hospital controls (50%). Results confirm that under special circumstances, such as those resulting from enhanced public concern, parental recall can be differential but otherwise is most often nondifferential, with low sensitivity.

We identified 2814 individuals with Down syndrome from the Danish Cytogenetic Register, and linked the data to the Danish Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated on the basis of age- and sex-specific cancer rates in the general population. Sixty cases of cancer were observed, with 49.8 expected (SIR = 1.20; CI: 0.92-1.55). Leukaemia constituted 60% of the malignancies overall and 97% of the malignancies in children. The SIR for leukaemia varied considerably with age, being 56 (CI: 38-81) at age 0-4 years and 10 (CI: 4-20) at 5-29 years. No cases of leukaemia were observed after age 29. The cumulative risk of leukaemia by the age of 5 years was 2.1% and that by 30 years was 2.7%. Only 24 solid tumours were observed with 47.8 expected (SIR = 0.50; CI: 0.32-0.75). No cases of breast cancer were observed, with 7.3 expected (p = 0.0007). Increased risks of testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, and retinoblastoma were observed but were not statistically significant. The occurrence of cancer in Down syndrome is unique with a high risk of leukaemia in children and a decreased risk of solid tumours in all age groups.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty CLL patients, in clinical complete remission (CR) after fludarabine, were offered an unmanipulated PBSC transplant and were longitudinally monitored for MRD and immunologic reconstitution. RESULTS: Due to unsatisfactory PBSC collection, 4 patients received bone marrow cells. All patients engrafted. Two patients died, one due to infection and one because of another neoplasia. Thirteen patients are at present in clinical CR after a median follow-up of 17 months and 18 patients are alive with a survival probability of 0.87 (+/-0.04) at 52 months after transplant. Fifteen patients had a molecular remission. Three of them showed a molecular relapse 16-28 months after autograft, followed by a clinical relapse 10-16 months later. Three of the four patients who remained persistently rearranged could be revaluated over time and showed an immunologic relapse 11-26 months after transplant; two of these had a clinical relapse 12 and 7 months later. A marked and persistent impairment of both the B- and T-immunologic compartments was recorded in the horizontal follow-up. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Unmanipulated PBSC autograft is a feasible procedure that produces prolonged molecular remissions in high-risk CLL patients. Persistence or reappearance of a molecular signal after engraftment is predictive of subsequent immunologic and clinical CLL recurrence. The long -lasting impairment of the host immune repertoire after fludarabine followed by autograft has to be taken into account in the patients' management.","['Meloni, G', 'Proia, A', 'Mauro, F', 'Amaranto, P', 'Capria, S', 'Cimino, G', 'Cordone, I', 'de Fabritiis, P', 'Rapanotti, C', 'Reato, G', 'Vignetti, M', 'Foa, R', 'Mandelli, F']","['Meloni G', 'Proia A', 'Mauro F', 'Amaranto P', 'Capria S', 'Cimino G', 'Cordone I', 'de Fabritiis P', 'Rapanotti C', 'Reato G', 'Vignetti M', 'Foa R', 'Mandelli F']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University ""La Sapienza"", Roma, Italy. meloni@bce.med.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/immunology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/toxicity']",,2000/09/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/12 11:00'],"['2000/09/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/12 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Sep;85(9):952-60.,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, both 2'-deoxycoformycin (DCF) and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) induce complete response (CR) in the majority of the patients with HCL. However, fewer data exist on the long-term follow-up of patients who have undergone the characteristically brief exposure to 2-CdA therapy. Thus, it is important to evaluate such long-term outcome data in order to increase understanding of the efficacy of this agent in the management of HCL. DESIGN AND METHODS: We reviewed the long-term follow-up data of 23 HCL patients pretreated with a-interferon and then treated with 2-CdA administered as a single continuous IV infusion for 7 days at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day in our institute between January 1991 and February 1992. RESULTS: Of 23 patients, 19 (83%) achieved a CR and 4 (17%) a partial response (PR), with an overall response rate of 100%. After a median follow-up of 102 months (range: 96-108), there have been 9 (39%) relapses. In the PR subset 100% of patients relapsed within the first 45 months of follow-up. In the group of patients who obtained a CR, 26% relapsed; all these relapses occurred between 54 and 86 months. Overall, the median time to relapse was 54 months (range: 16-86). All relapsed patients were re-treated with 2-CdA at the dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day for 5 days in a 2-hour infusion, and 67% and 22% then obtained CR or PR, respectively. The median duration of this second response was 48 months (range: 22-80). All but one of these patients are still maintaining the second response to 2-CdA. The 9-year overall and the relapse-free survivals are 91% and 70%, respectively. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In HCL patients a single dose of 2-CdA induces a long-term CR with a 9-year survival > 90%. Over 50% of patients appear to be clinically cured by this procedure, but the lack of a long-term plateau in the relapse-free survival curve means caution on this point is still warranted.","['Zinzani, P L', 'Magagnoli, M', 'Bendandi, M', 'Tani, M', 'Stefoni, V', 'Cellini, C', 'Poggi, S', 'Piccioli, M', 'Pileri, S', 'Tura, S']","['Zinzani PL', 'Magagnoli M', 'Bendandi M', 'Tani M', 'Stefoni V', 'Cellini C', 'Poggi S', 'Piccioli M', 'Pileri S', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Ematologia e Oncologia Medica ""Seragnoli"", Policlinico S.Orsola, Via Massarenti 9, 40138 Bologna, Italy. plzinzo@med.unibo.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/09/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/12 11:00'],"['2000/09/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/12 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Sep;85(9):922-5.,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to define better the genetic features of aCLL with t(11;14), which could represent a distinct disease subset, we looked for genetic lesions in the BCL-1 locus and in BCL-2, BCL-6, c-myc and p53 genes. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated a panel of B-lymphoproliferative disorders with translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) including nine aCLL, six MCL and one MM. Southern and Northern blot analysis was used to investigate DNA structure and RNA expression; SSCP and direct sequencing were used to detect and characterize p53 point mutations; cytofluorimetric analysis was used to quantify p53 protein. RESULTS: Alterations of BCL-2, BCL-6 and c-myc were not detected. Conversely, BCL-1 rearrangements were present in 4 out of 7 aCLL and in 2 out of 4 MCL. A high incidence of p53 gene alterations was found, almost equivalent in aCLL and MCL. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the occurrence of BCL-1 locus lesions in aCLL selected for t(11;14) is as high as in MCL. Interestingly, rearrangements in the mTC1 (minor translocation cluster 1) were only found in aCLL. Therefore, the two B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders share similar molecular rearrangements and the t(11;14) identifies a subset of B-CLL sharing molecular features with MCL and characterized by aggressive clinical evolution.","['De Angeli, C', 'Gandini, D', 'Cuneo, A', 'Moretti, S', 'Bigoni, R', 'Roberti, M G', 'Bardi, A', 'Castoldi, G L', 'del Senno, L']","['De Angeli C', 'Gandini D', 'Cuneo A', 'Moretti S', 'Bigoni R', 'Roberti MG', 'Bardi A', 'Castoldi GL', 'del Senno L']","['Centro Interdipartimentale di Biotecnologie-Sezione di Studi Biochimici delle Patologie del Genoma Umano; Universita degli Studi, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, bcl-1', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics', '*Mutation', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,2000/09/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/12 11:00'],"['2000/09/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/12 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Sep;85(9):913-21.,,,,,,,,,,,

The region represented by yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone 755b11 at 11q23 has been shown to be the minimal common region of deletion in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). The aim of the study was to determine the frequencies of 11q23 deletion in different lymphoma subtypes. DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with YAC755b11 on either peripheral blood or lymph node biopsy (LN) specimens of patients diagnosed as having MCL (47), CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) (62), diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) (17), follicular lymphoma (FL) (9), and Hodgkin's disease (HD) (11). Fifteen cases of reactive or normal lymph node biopsies were studied as controls. RESULTS: Forty of the 161 (25%) samples exhibited deletions in the region represented by YAC755b11. The 11q23 deletion was found only in MCL (23, 49%), CLL / SLL (13, 21%) and DLCL (4, 24%). Three cases were classified as Richter's syndrome and they all exhibited the deletion at 11q23. The deletion frequencies in the blood specimens of typical CLL (30%) and lymph node specimens of CLL/SLL (13%) were remarkably different. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the 11q23 deletion is not common in lymphomas other than MCL, CLL and DLCL. It also showed the possible correlation of the 11q23 deletion with the transformation of localized lymphoma to CLL, and with the development of Richter's syndrome.","['Zhu, Y', 'Monni, O', 'Franssila, K', 'Elonen, E', 'Vilpo, J', 'Joensuu, H', 'Knuutila, S']","['Zhu Y', 'Monni O', 'Franssila K', 'Elonen E', 'Vilpo J', 'Joensuu H', 'Knuutila S']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Haartman Institute and Helsinki University Central Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Testing', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2000/09/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/12 11:00'],"['2000/09/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/12 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Sep;85(9):908-12.,,,,,,,,,,,

The normal AF15q14 transcripts of approximately 8.5 kb in size, are expressed in different tumoral cell lines, in a variety of normal tissues, and in all the foetal tissues tested. Sequencing of AF15q14 cDNA revealed a putative open reading frame of 1833 amino acids that had no homology with any other known protein. The C-terminal end of the putative AF15q14 contained a bipartite nuclear localization site. The translocation t(11;15) preserved the open reading frame between MLL and the 3' end of AF15q14.

Previous data has suggested that the inhibition of apoptosis and the deregulation of cell cycle progression as the result of P210Bcr-abl expression might contribute to leukemogenesis. In vitro systems in which Bcr-Abl is over-expressed have concluded that similar growth regulatory pathways are affected as a result of the expression of both P210 and P190Bcr-abl. Here, we utilized an in vitro P190Bcr-abl leukemia mouse model to dissect the early events that contribute to transformation by this isoform of Bcr-Abl. In this mouse model P190Bcr-abl is expressed as a low but physiologically relevant level in that all mice develop pre-B leukemia lymphomas.

We also demonstrate a normal induction of p21WAF-1/CIP1 in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissue as a result of genotoxic stress.

The majority of HERVs is non-coding but a limited set is intact and can express proteins. We have recently identified an almost intact HERV-K(HML-2) provirus on chromosome 7 and have documented that most patients with germ cell tumors (GCTs) display antibodies directed against proteins of HERV-K(HML-2). To address whether these proteins merely represent tumor markers or contribute to neoplastic transformation, we examined the transforming potential of various HERV sequences and studied physical interactions between HERV and cellular proteins by yeast two-hybrid and biochemical assays. cORF, a protein encoded by the C-terminal open reading frame within the env gene, supports tumor growth in nude mice and associates with the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF). The interaction domains map between amino acid residues 21 and 87 of cORF, and between residues 245 and 543 of PLZF. PLZF is critical for spermatogenesis in mice. Abnormal spermatogenesis or maturation of gonocytes is thought to predispose humans to the development of germ cell tumors.

Truncated, constitutively active mutant forms of the Notch receptor appear to be involved in human T-cell leukemia, mammary carcinomas in mice, and a tumorous germline phenotype in C. elegans. Since activated Notch induces solitary tumors in transgenic mice, it is highly likely that collaborating genetic events are required for tumor formation. We have assessed four signal transduction pathways to determine which might play additional roles in malignant transformation in concert with activated Notch4. Our results suggest that transformation by Notch does not, as might have been expected, depend on the Src-like kinases Lck and Fyn, nor upon signals from protein kinase A and C (PKA, PKC).

The transcription factors Wt1 and Eya1, the signalling molecules Gdnf and LIF and the receptors c-Ret and GdnfRalpha have been demonstrated to fulfil fundamental roles in the first step of metanephric induction, the outgrowth of the ureter. Signalling by members of the Wnt, BMP and FGF families, regulated by transcription factors such as Pax2, mediates nephrogenesis by adjusting the balance between the ureteric bud epithelium, stromal and nephrogenic tissues. The stromal tissue, neglected for many years, has been shown to serve important functions in regulating the growth of nephrons.

They were treated orally with various doses of lanoconazole or with fluconazole 10 mg/kg (a positive control) once daily beginning 1 day after the fungal infection and continuing until the end of the experimental period. The number of C. neoformans cells in the lungs and brains of infected mice was determined. Lanoconazole and fluconazole had a similar inhibitory effect on the growth of C. neoformans in the brains and lungs of normal mice. Whereas lanoconazole inhibited the growth of C. neoformans in the brains and lungs of MAIDS mice, the pathogen grew in the brains of MAIDS mice treated with fluconazole. Lanoconazole reduced the number of C. neoformans in the brains of normal mice treated with a type 2 cytokine mixture, whereas fluconazole did not. A predominance of type 2 T-cell responses was demonstrated in MAIDS mice. Splenic T cells from MAIDS mice, but not those from normal mice, released interleukins 4 and 10 into the culture medium when they were stimulated with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody.

Radicicol, a macrocyclic antifungal antibiotic, binds to the N-terminal of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and destabilizes Hsp90-associated proteins such as Raf-1. This study investigated the effect of radicicol, novel oxime derivatives of radicicol (KF25706 and KF58333), and herbimycin A (HA), a benzoquinoid ansamycin antibiotic, on the growth and differentiation of human K562 CML cells. Although KF25706 and KF58333 induced the expression of glycophorin A in K562 cells, radicicol and HA caused erythroid differentiation transiently. Cell cycle analysis showed that G(1) phase accumulation was observed in K562 cells treated with KF58333. KF58333 treatment depleted p210(Bcr-Abl), Raf-1, and cellular tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in K562 cells, whereas radicicol and HA showed transient depletion of these proteins. KF58333 also down-regulated the level of cell cycle-dependent kinases 4 and 6 and up-regulated cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) protein without an effect on the level of Erk and Hsp90 proteins. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that p210(Bcr-Abl) formed multiple complexes with Hsp90, some containing p23 and others Hsp70; KF58333 treatment dissociated p210(Bcr-Abl) from Hsp90/p23 chaperone complexes. Furthermore, KF58333 induced apoptosis in K562 cells and administration of KF58333 prolonged the survival time of SCID mice inoculated with K562 cells. These results suggest that KF58333 may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of CML that involves abnormal cellular proliferation induced by p210(Bcr-Abl).","['Shiotsu, Y', 'Neckers, L M', 'Wortman, I', 'An, W G', 'Schulte, T W', 'Soga, S', 'Murakata, C', 'Tamaoki, T', 'Akinaga, S']","['Shiotsu Y', 'Neckers LM', 'Wortman I', 'An WG', 'Schulte TW', 'Soga S', 'Murakata C', 'Tamaoki T', 'Akinaga S']","['Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Shizuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'I60EH8GECX (monorden)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Erythroblasts/drug effects/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Lactones/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Quinones/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives']",,2000/09/09 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/09 11:00'],"['2000/09/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54421-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Sep 15;96(6):2284-91.,,,,,,,,,,,

One target molecule shared by these oncogenes is known to be STAT5. We generated sublines of Ba/F3 cells in which either wild-type STAT5 or a constitutively active mutant of STAT5 (STAT5-1*6) were expressed under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. These cell lines were compared with a Ba/F3 cell line in which the expression of p210(Bcr/Abl) was made inducible by a similar promoter. Before induction, all cells were dependent on interleukin 3 (IL-3) for growth and survival. Both STAT5-1*6 and Bcr/Abl enhanced viability and induced proliferation in the absence of IL-3. We found that the proviability protein Bcl-X(L), but not Bcl-2, was induced by both p210(Bcr/Abl) and STAT5-1*6. Using a Bcl-X gene promoter construct fused to a luciferase complementary DNA (cDNA), both p210(Bcr/Abl) and STAT5-1*6 were shown to induce transcription of Bcl-X. The increase in transcription of the Bcl-X promoter and the increase in Bcl-X protein, due to p210(Bcr/Abl), were blocked by expression of a dominant negative STAT5 mutant. Interestingly, however, STAT5-1*6 required the continued presence of IL-3 to cause a significant increase in Bcl-X(L) protein, whereas p210(Bcr/Abl) did not need IL-3. Studies with enzyme inhibitors suggest that the extra signal supplied by IL-3 may be supplied by the PI3K pathway. Overall, these data suggest that constitutively activated STAT5 can increase viability and proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. This may contribute to, but is not likely sufficient for, the enhanced viability associated with Bcr/Abl transformation.","['Gesbert, F', 'Griffin, J D']","['Gesbert F', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Adult Oncology, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, abl', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2000/09/09 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/09 11:00'],"['2000/09/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54419-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Sep 15;96(6):2269-76.,,['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

It was found that steady-state retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) protein levels were markedly reduced in these cells after exposure to ATRA. Because the presence of receptors for a hormone ligand is required for its action, differentiation therapy with ATRA may be self-limiting. The combination of G-CSF with ATRA significantly attenuated the loss of RARalpha protein, and synergistic terminal differentiation occurred. LiCl was more effective than G-CSF in preserving RARalpha pools and synergized with ATRA more strongly than G-CSF. These findings suggested that the prevention of RARalpha protein loss by G-CSF or LiCl in ATRA-treated cells functioned to extend the differentiation response to the retinoid and was responsible, at least in part, for the observed synergism. D(+) cells transfected with an expression plasmid containing RARalpha cDNA had a 6- to 8-fold increase in steady-state RARalpha mRNA compared with vector-transfected cells and showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in RARalpha protein. ATRA caused a reduction, but not a complete loss, of RARalpha protein in these transfectants, which were considerably more responsive than parental D(+) cells to ATRA as a single agent, supporting the concept that the protection of RARalpha pools results in a heightened differentiation response to ATRA.","['Finch, R A', 'Li, J', 'Chou, T C', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Finch RA', 'Li J', 'Chou TC', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lithium Chloride/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/09/09 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/09 11:00'],"['2000/09/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54418-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Sep 15;96(6):2262-8.,,['CA02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Residual molecular positivity of clonal immunoglobulin (IG) and T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements allows detection of patients at an increased risk of relapse. If these rearrangements are to be used for universal follow-up, it is important to determine the extent to which they are informative in different BCP-ALL subsets. We show that IGH V-D-J rearrangements occur in 89% of 163 BCP-ALL, with no significant variation according to age or genotype (BCR-ABL, TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4, and E2A-PBX1). In contrast, TCRG rearrangements, which occur in 60% of patients overall, are frequent in BCR-ABL and TEL-AML1, are less so in MLL-AF4, and are virtually absent in infants aged predominantly from 1 to 2 years and in E2A-PBX1 ALLs. Incidence of the predominant TCRD Vdelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangement decreases with age but is independent of genotype. These differences are not due to differential recombination activating gene activity, nor can they be explained adequately by stage of maturation arrest.

First, the results demonstrate that the ectopic expression of the p185 Bcr-Abl fusion protein induced hemoglobin in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) HL-60 cells. Exposure to low-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C; 10 nmol/L) increased hemoglobin levels in HL-60/Bcr-Abl and in the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis K562 cells, which express the p210 Bcr-Abl protein. As compared with HL-60/neo, HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by Ara-C, doxorubicin, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which was associated with reduced processing of caspase-8 and Bid protein and decreased cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c (cyt c). Exposure to CGP57148B alone increased hemoglobin levels and CD11b expression and induced apoptosis of HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells. CGP57148B treatment down-regulated antiapoptotic XIAP, cIAP1, and Bcl-x(L), without affecting Bcl-2, Bax, Apaf-1, Fas (CD95), Fas ligand, Abl, and Bcr-Abl levels. CGP57148B also inhibited constitutively active Akt kinase and NFkappaB in Bcr-Abl-positive cells. Attenuation of NFkappaB activity by ectopic expression of transdominant repressor of IkappaB sensitized HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells to TNF-alpha but not to apoptosis induced by Ara-C or doxorubicin. Importantly, cotreatment with CGP57148B significantly increased Ara-C- or doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells. This was associated with greater cytosolic accumulation of cyt c and PARP cleavage activity of caspase-3. These in vitro data indicate that combinations of CGP57148B and antileukemic drugs such as Ara-C may have improved in vivo efficacy against Bcr-Abl-positive acute leukemia.","['Fang, G', 'Kim, C N', 'Perkins, C L', 'Ramadevi, N', 'Winton, E', 'Wittmann, S', 'Bhalla, K N']","['Fang G', 'Kim CN', 'Perkins CL', 'Ramadevi N', 'Winton E', 'Wittmann S', 'Bhalla KN']","['H.

Except for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), vascularity was significantly higher in all leukemias and MDS compared with control bone marrows. The highest number of blood vessels and largest vascular area were found in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). VEGF, bFGF, and HGF plasma levels were significantly increased in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CML, CLL, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and MDS. HGF, TNF-alpha, and bFGF but not VEGF were significantly increased in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). TNF-alpha levels were significantly increased in all diseases except for AML and MDS. No significant increase was found in TGF-alpha in any leukemia or MDS. The highest plasma levels of VEGF were in CML, and the highest plasma levels of bFGF were in CLL. The levels of HGF were highest in CMML. These data suggest that vascularity and angiogenic factors are increased in leukemias and MDS and may play a role in the leukemogenic process.","['Aguayo, A', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Manshouri, T', 'Gidel, C', 'Estey, E', 'Thomas, D', 'Koller, C', 'Estrov, Z', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Keating, M', 'Freireich, E', 'Albitar, M']","['Aguayo A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Manshouri T', 'Gidel C', 'Estey E', 'Thomas D', 'Koller C', 'Estrov Z', ""O'Brien S"", 'Keating M', 'Freireich E', 'Albitar M']","['Departments of Leukemia, Hematopathology, and Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-4095, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Chronic Disease', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/blood', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/blood', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*physiopathology', 'Lymphokines/blood', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*physiopathology', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2000/09/09 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/09 11:00'],"['2000/09/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54415-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Sep 15;96(6):2240-5.,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify specific cofactors that interact with the RXR/RAR heterodimer in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, a double cistronic construct was used that allowed coexpression of the RXR LBD (ligand binding domain) with the RAR LBD as an affinity matrix to pull down interacting proteins from nuclear extracts prepared from a human APL cell line, NB4. A group of proteins was detected whose interaction with RXR/RAR is ligand inducible. The molecular weight pattern of these proteins is similar to that of a complex of proteins previously identified as DRIP or TRAP, which are ligand-dependent transcription activators of VDR and TR, respectively. The RXR/RAR-interacting proteins from NB4 were confirmed to be identical to the DRIP subunits by comparative electrophoresis, Western blot analysis, and in vitro protein interaction assay. In addition to RXR/RAR, the DRIP component can interact directly with the APL-specific PML-RARalpha fusion protein.

However, the role of CD40L in the pathogenesis of malignant lymphomas is ambiguous. Primary mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells were cultured in the presence of recombinant human CD40L trimer (huCD40LT), and a significant time- and dose-dependent induction of DNA synthesis was observed in thymidine incorporation assays (n = 7, P <.04). The maximal rate of DNA synthesis was reached at huCD40LT doses of 100 ng/mL and above after 4 days of culture, but a significant increase of DNA synthesis was detected already at doses of 1 ng/mL (P =.03). HuCD40LT never inhibited the basal level of DNA synthesis. These findings established 400 ng/mL of huCD40LT for 4 days as standard conditions in the system. Under these conditions, huCD40LT significantly increased the proportion of cells in the S/G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle in 4 of 7 studied cases, while the fraction of apoptotic cells remained unchanged (n = 7). HuCD40LT also induced expression of CD80/B7-1, CD86/B7-2, and CD95/Fas and up-regulated the expression of HLA-DR (n = 6). With the use of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in triple-color flow cytometric analysis, it was found that huCD40LT induced cell-cycle progression in light chain-restricted cells only, of which a median of 14% (range, 0.5% to 29%; n = 4) returned to G(0/1) phase DNA content after bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, demonstrating completion of at least one cell cycle in the presence of huCD40LT.

We also isolated a full-length human MgcRacGAP cDNA, which encodes an additional N-terminal polypeptide of 105 amino acid residues compared with the previously published human MgcRacGAP. In human HL-60 leukemic cells, overexpression of the full-length form of human MgcRacGAP alone induced growth suppression and macrophage differentiation associated with hypervacuolization and de novo expression of the myelomonocytic marker CD14.

The present results indicated that MgcRacGAP plays key roles in controlling growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells through mechanisms other than regulating Rac GTPase activity.","['Kawashima, T', 'Hirose, K', 'Satoh, T', 'Kaneko, A', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Kaziro, Y', 'Nosaka, T', 'Kitamura, T']","['Kawashima T', 'Hirose K', 'Satoh T', 'Kaneko A', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kaziro Y', 'Nosaka T', 'Kitamura T']","['Department of Hematopoietic Factors and Department of Clinical Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (mgcRacGAP)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/isolation & purification', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Sequence Alignment']",,2000/09/09 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/09 11:00'],"['2000/09/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54399-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Sep 15;96(6):2116-24.,['GENBANK/AB030251'],,,,,,,,,,

These knock-in mice died in midgestation because of hemorrhaging in the central nervous system and a block of definitive hematopoiesis during embryogenesis. Therefore, they are not a good model system for the development of acute myeloid leukemia. Therefore, mice were generated in which the expression of AML1-ETO is under the control of a tetracycline-inducible system. Multiple lines of transgenic mice have been produced with the AML1-ETO complementary DNA controlled by a tetracycline-responsive element. In the absence of the antibiotic tetracycline, AML1-ETO is strongly expressed in the bone marrow of AML1-ETO and tet-controlled transcriptional activator double-positive transgenic mice. Furthermore, the addition of tetracycline reduces AML1-ETO expression in double-positive mice to nondetectable levels. Throughout the normal murine lifespan of 24 months, mice expressing AML1-ETO have not developed leukemia. In spite of this, abnormal maturation and proliferation of progenitor cells have been observed from these animals. These results demonstrate that AML1-ETO has a very restricted capacity to transform cells. Either the introduction of additional genetic changes or the expression of AML1-ETO at a particular stage of hematopoietic cell differentiation will be necessary to develop a model for studying the pathogenesis of t(8;21).","['Rhoades, K L', 'Hetherington, C J', 'Harakawa, N', 'Yergeau, D A', 'Zhou, L', 'Liu, L Q', 'Little, M T', 'Tenen, D G', 'Zhang, D E']","['Rhoades KL', 'Hetherington CJ', 'Harakawa N', 'Yergeau DA', 'Zhou L', 'Liu LQ', 'Little MT', 'Tenen DG', 'Zhang DE']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,2000/09/09 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/09 11:00'],"['2000/09/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54398-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Sep 15;96(6):2108-15.,,['CA72009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

There was a significant trend toward decreased severity of acute GVHD across all grades (P =.005). Based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate, the probability of grade II-IV acute GVHD in the tacrolimus group (56%) was significantly lower than in the CSP group (74%; P =.0002). Use of glucocorticoids for the management of GVHD was significantly lower with tacrolimus than with CSP (65% vs 81%, respectively; P =. 019).

Within MDS, 5q- syndrome constitutes a distinct clinical entity characterized by an isolated deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-), a relatively good prognosis, and infrequent transformation to acute leukemia. The cell of origin in 5q- syndrome as well as in other 5q-deleted MDS patients has not been established, but evidence for involvement of multiple myeloid (but not lymphoid) lineages has suggested that a myeloid-restricted progenitor rather than a pluripotent (lympho-myeloid) stem cell might be the primary target in most patients. Although in 9 patients no evidence of peripheral blood T-cell and only 1 case of B-cell involvement was found, the data herein support that 5q deletions occur in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with a combined lympho-myeloid potential. First, in all investigated patients a minimum of 94% of cells in the minor CD34(+)CD38(-) HSC compartment were 5q deleted as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Second, in 3 of 5 patients 5q aberrations were detected in a large fraction (25% to 90%) of purified CD34(+)CD19(+) pro-B cells. Furthermore, extensive functional characterization with regard to responsiveness to early-acting cytokines, long-term culture-initiating cells, and nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency repopulating cells supported that MDS HSCs in 5q-deleted patients are CD34(+)CD38(-), but inefficient at reconstituting hematopoiesis.","['Nilsson, L', 'Astrand-Grundstrom, I', 'Arvidsson, I', 'Jacobsson, B', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, E', 'Hast, R', 'Jacobsen, S E']","['Nilsson L', 'Astrand-Grundstrom I', 'Arvidsson I', 'Jacobsson B', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Hast R', 'Jacobsen SE']","['Stem Cell Laboratory, Institute of Laboratory Medicine, and the Department of Hematology, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Lineage', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology']",,2000/09/09 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/09 11:00'],"['2000/09/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)54384-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Sep 15;96(6):2012-21.,,,,,,,,,,,

Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study.,61-8,"A retrospective analysis of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was performed to evaluate the current status of diagnosis and treatment of ALL in Japanese children. Clinical records of 670 children with ALL were collected and analyzed; these children had been diagnosed between 1991 and 1995 at the 53 institutions in 4 areas participating in the Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study. It was found that T-cell ALL was significantly less frequent in Tokai and Hokkaido than in Kansai and Chu-Shikoku. The overall induction rate was 92.4%. The estimated 7-year overall survival rate and event-free survival (EFS) rate were 76.0% +/- 1.9% and 61.4% +/- 2.1%, respectively. EFS rates were significantly different among the geographic areas. In female patients with B-cell precursor (B-pre) ALL and white blood cell counts at diagnosis (WBCsdiag) below 50.0 x 10(9)/L, favorable outcomes were significant. Favorable outcomes were not significant in B-pre ALL patients with a WBCdiag above 50.0 x 10(9)/L or in T-cell ALL patients. The EFS rate for infants was significantly worse than that for patients over 1 year of age. In B-pre ALL, but not in T-cell ALL, it was found that the higher the WBCdiag, the worse the EFS rate. Multivariate analysis showed that the following factors were significantly unfavorable for EFS: the Philadelphia chromosome, an translocations associated with chromosome 11q23, an acute unclassified leukemia, mixed-lineage leukemia, a WBCdiag above 100.0 x 10(9)/L, and male gender. Hyperdiploidy (> 50 chromosomes) was significantly favorable for EFS. For further tailoring of treatment and to improve the outcome in childhood ALL, a prospective large-scale study should be undertaken in Japan.","['Horibe, K', 'Hara, J', 'Yagi, K', 'Tawa, A', 'Komada, Y', 'Oda, M', 'Nishimura, S', 'Ishikawa, Y', 'Kudoh, T', 'Ueda, K']","['Horibe K', 'Hara J', 'Yagi K', 'Tawa A', 'Komada Y', 'Oda M', 'Nishimura S', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Kudoh T', 'Ueda K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan. khoribe@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors']",,2000/09/09 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/09 11:00'],"['2000/09/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/09 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2000 Jul;72(1):61-8.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction targeting RNA viruses frequently associated with OME (respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus type 3, the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 8 and interleukin 1beta, and RANTES [regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted]) was performed on mucosal biopsy samples and on samples of the liquid and cellular compartments of inflammatory exudates obtained from 26 children (49 ears) with infected middle ears. Ribonucleic acid extracted from rapidly frozen samples was reverse transcribed by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and amplified for 35 cycles using previously validated primers. Amplicons were evaluated by molecular size after agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. RESULTS: Most children had evidence of the presence of an RNA virus in at least one specimen. Respiratory syncytial virus was present in 40% and parainfluenza virus type 3 in 8% of effusions. Interleukin 8 messenger RNA was present in 21% of inflammatory exudates but never in cells from the mucosal biopsy samples.

We investigated the ability of mycophenolate mofetil, a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, to induce differentiation in HL-60 and U937 leukemic cells as well as in fresh leukemia cells from patients with non-lymphocytic leukemia. Treatment with mycophenolate mofetil reduced the intracellular guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) levels and induced morphologic and functional differentiation in HL-60 and U937 cells dose-dependently. HL-60 and U937 cells developed macrophage-like cytoplasm as well as the expression of CD11b and CD14 antigens and the ability to oxidize nitroblue tetrazorium (NBT). These changes became evident when the intracellular GTP levels decreased to approximately 20-30% of the untreated control level and were abrogated by the addition of guanosine. In the fresh leukemic cells, differentiation induction was shown in the cells derived from seven of 13 patients. The fresh leukemia cells responding to mycophenolate mofetil revealed significant higher positivity to CD11b, CD14, and NBT before treatment and significantly reduced intracellular GTP levels after treatment compared to the non-responding cells. These findings suggest that mycophenolate mofetil induces differentiation in HL-60 and U937 cells and some fresh leukemia cells with moderate tendency to maturation, by causing a decrease in the intracellular GTP levels.

Furthermore, activation of the up-regulated trkA receptor by exogenous NGF potentiated the megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells induced by NaBut and PMA. Our results demonstrated that trkA is one of the essential genes that are up-regulated and involved in the megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 leukemia cells triggered by these differentiation inducers.

Differential role of proliferating cell nuclear antigen.,39458-65,"MCL1 (ML1 myeloid cell leukemia 1), a Bcl-2 (B- cell lymphoma-leukemia 2) homologue, is known to function as an anti-apoptotic protein. Here we show in vitro and in vivo that MCL1 interacts with the cell cycle regulator, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This finding prompted us to investigate whether MCL1, in addition to its anti-apoptotic function, has an effect on cell cycle progression. A bromodeoxyuridine uptake assay showed that the overexpression of MCL1 significantly inhibited the cell cycle progression through the S-phase. The S-phase of the cell cycle is also known to be regulated by PCNA. A mutant of MCL1 that lacks PCNA binding (MCL1(Delta)(4A)) could not inhibit cell cycle progression as effectively as wild type MCL1. In contrast, MCL1(Delta)(4A) retained its anti-apoptotic function in HeLa cells when challenged by Etoposide. In addition, the intracellular localization of MCL1(Delta)(4A) was identical to that of wild type MCL1. An in vitro pull-down assay suggested that MCL1 is the only Bcl-2 family protein to interact with PCNA. In fact, MCL1, not other Bcl-2 family proteins, contained the PCNA-binding motif described previously. Taken together, MCL1 is a regulator of both apoptosis and cell cycle progression, and the cell cycle regulatory function of MCL1 is mediated through its interaction with PCNA.","['Fujise, K', 'Zhang, D', 'Liu, J', 'Yeh, E T']","['Fujise K', 'Zhang D', 'Liu J', 'Yeh ET']","['Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Institute of Molecular Medicine for Prevention of Human Diseases, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston 77030, USA.

To improve the pharmacological properties of interferon (IFN) alpha-2b, a long-acting pegylated form (PEG-IFN) has been developed [PEG, monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) with average molecular mass of 12 000 Da]. PEG-IFN is a mixture of pegylated proteins with differing sites of PEG attachment. To identify the major positional isomer in the pegylated material [PEG-IFN(His-34)], NMR studies were conducted on a subtilisin-digested N-acetylated peptide of the major positional isomer [PEG-IFN(His-34)dig], synthetic peptide analogues containing His-34, as well as unmodified IFN and PEG-IFN(His-34). Our studies reveal a novel interferon-polymer attachment site as a histidine-linked interferon conjugate. We show that the major component of PEG-IFN is pegylated in the imidazole side chain of histidine-34. Chemical shift data suggest that pegylation occurs mainly at the N(delta)(1) position in the imidazole side chain of this residue. This positional isomer, PEG-IFN(His-34), comprises approximately 47% of the total pegylated species when PEG-IFN is synthesized under the current experimental conditions at pH 6.5 with an electrophilic derivative of PEG, succinimidyl carbonate PEG. The reversibility of the histidine modification was examined. The PEG-imidazole adduct in the intact protein, PEG-IFN(His-34), is labile but much more stable than in the peptide, PEG-IFN(His-34)dig.

Busulfan is well absorbed after oral administration, exhibits low protein binding and is metabolised through conjugation with glutathione to form a thiophenium ion. At a given dose, there is considerable variability in the systemic exposure of busulfan, typically expressed as area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) or average concentration at steady state (Css). Relative to that in adolescents and adults, patients less than 4 years of age have an increased apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of busulfan and a higher conjugation rate of busulfan with glutathione in the enterocyte. Several investigators have identified relationships between busulfan Css and outcome in patients undergoing HSCT. Busulfan concentration-response relationships are regimen-, age- and disease-dependent. The busulfan/cyclophosphamide (BU/CY) regimen is the only regimen for which substantial concentration-outcome data exist. Generally, the risk of hepatic veno-occlusive disease is increased with busulfan Css > 900 microg/L. The impact of busulfan Css on veno-occlusive disease may be influenced by the age of the patient and the dose of cyclophosphamide. Lower rates of relapse in chronic myelogenous leukaemia occur in patients with a busulfan Css > 917 microg/L without an increased risk of toxicity. Busulfan Css is also related to the engraftment rate in children, and escalating busulfan doses to achieve a target Css > 600 microg/L improves graft retention. Therapeutic drug monitoring of busulfan should be performed to maximise the likelihood of engraftment and minimise the risk of toxicity and relapse in HSCT patients receiving the BU/CY preparative regimen.","['McCune, J S', 'Gibbs, J P', 'Slattery, J T']","['McCune JS', 'Gibbs JP', 'Slattery JT']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Busulfan/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Graft Rejection/drug therapy/*metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",54,2000/09/08 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/08 11:00'],"['2000/09/08 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/08 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003088-200039020-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2000 Aug;39(2):155-65. doi: 10.2165/00003088-200039020-00005.,,['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

However, recent studies have demonstrated that administration of exogenous IL-12 paradoxically inhibits antigen-specific immunity of T cells in vivo, including allogeneic, autoimmune, and viral antigen-initiated T-cell responses. Interestingly, these inhibitory effects are also mediated by IFN-gamma, whose production is induced by IL-12. Thus, IL-12, a potent immunostimulatory cytokine, can paradoxically lead to immunosuppression. Notably, this cytokine has been shown to preserve graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects of allogeneic CD8+ T cells while inhibiting graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in murine allogeneic bone marrow transplantation models. This article will review recent studies concerning the effect of IL-12 and IFN-gamma on the development of GVHD and the induction of GVL effects, and discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for IL-12-mediated separation of GVL effects from the GVHD-promoting activity of allogeneic T cells.","['Yang, Y G']",['Yang YG'],"['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Surgical Service, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston 02129, USA. yongguang.yang@tbrc.mgh.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther,"Cytokines, cellular & molecular therapy",9713367,"['187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Interleukin-12/physiology']",81,2000/09/08 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/08 11:00'],"['2000/09/08 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/08 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13684730050515903 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther. 2000 Mar;6(1):41-6. doi: 10.1080/13684730050515903.,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that SLE patients have an IFN-alpha-inducing factor in blood, probably consisting of complexes containing anti-DNA Abs and immunostimulatory DNA. The DNA component could be derived from apoptotic cells, because SLE patients have been reported to have both increased apoptosis and reduced clearance of apoptotic cell material. In the present study, we therefore investigated whether apoptotic cells, together with IgG from SLE patients, could act as an IFN-alpha inducer in normal PBMC in vitro. We found that apoptotic cells of the myeloid leukemia cell line U937 as well as four other cell lines (MonoMac6, H9, Jurkat, U266) could induce IFN-alpha production in PBMC when combined with IgG from SLE patients. The IFN-alpha production by PBMC was much enhanced when PBMC were costimulated by IFN-alpha2b. The ability of IgG from different SLE patients to promote IFN-alpha induction by apoptotic U937 cells was associated with the presence of anti-ribonucleoprotein Abs, but not clearly with occurrence of anti-DNA Abs. These results suggest that apoptotic cells in the presence of autoantibodies can cause production of a clearly immunostimulatory cytokine, which is IFN-alpha. This mechanism for induction of IFN-alpha production could well be operative also in vivo, explain the IFN-alpha production seen in SLE patients, and be important in the pathogenesis of SLE.","['Bave, U', 'Alm, G V', 'Ronnblom, L']","['Bave U', 'Alm GV', 'Ronnblom L']","['Section of Rheumatology, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Sweden.

In this study we show that the nontoxic B subunit of Shiga toxin fused to a tumor peptide derived from the mouse mastocytoma P815 can induce specific CTL in mice without the use of adjuvant. The Shiga B subunit acts as a vector rather than as an adjuvant, because coinjection of the tumor peptide and the B subunit as separate entities does not lead to CTL induction. We also demonstrated that in vitro the B subunit mediates the delivery of various exogenous CD8 T cell epitopes into the conventional MHC class I-restricted pathway, as this process is inhibited by brefeldin A and lactacystin and requires a functional TAP system. In contrast to other nonviral methods for transport of exogenous Ags into the endogenous MHC class I pathway that involve macropinocytosis or phagocytosis, the Shiga B subunit targets this pathway in a receptor-dependent manner, namely via binding to the glycolipid Gb3. Because this receptor is highly expressed on various dendritic cells, it should allow preferential targeting of the Shiga B subunit to these professional APCs. Therefore, the Shiga B subunit appears to represent an attractive vector for vaccine development due to its ability to target dendritic cells and to induce specific CTL without the need for adjuvant.","['Haicheur, N', 'Bismuth, E', 'Bosset, S', 'Adotevi, O', 'Warnier, G', 'Lacabanne, V', 'Regnault, A', 'Desaymard, C', 'Amigorena, S', 'Ricciardi-Castagnoli, P', 'Goud, B', 'Fridman, W H', 'Johannes, L', 'Tartour, E']","['Haicheur N', 'Bismuth E', 'Bosset S', 'Adotevi O', 'Warnier G', 'Lacabanne V', 'Regnault A', 'Desaymard C', 'Amigorena S', 'Ricciardi-Castagnoli P', 'Goud B', 'Fridman WH', 'Johannes L', 'Tartour E']","[""Unite d'Immunologie Clinique, Institut de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unite 255, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Institut Curie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Shiga Toxins)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tap1 protein, mouse)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/physiology', 'Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/*genetics/immunology', 'Bacterial Toxins/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Brefeldin A/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Intracellular Fluid/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Ovalbumin/administration & dosage/immunology/metabolism', 'Peptides/*immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/genetics/immunology', 'Shiga Toxins', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/09/07 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/07 11:00'],"['2000/09/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['ji_v165n6p3301 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.165.6.3301 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Sep 15;165(6):3301-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.6.3301.,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and their families not only need information to help them understand the cancer experience, but also need support to generate coping strategies as the demands of the illness and its treatment exceed the individual's resources. Structured psycho-educational interventions, based on a strong informational component that aim to improve participants' adaptation to the disease and cancer situation, are one approach to providing such support. This article presents the findings from a recent prospective evaluation of the Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland's educational support course, Taking Control, which is designed for patients with a haematological malignancy and their families. The aim of this study was to record the participants' understanding of the positive and negative aspects and outcomes of course attendance. This is a prospective study of participants' perceptions of their experience with the 'Taking Control' course during the first half of 1999 (n =35; response rate 74.3%), using an author-designed, self-report questionnaire. The findings indicate that participants experience a high level of satisfaction, gain substantially in terms of knowledge, coping skills, and a positive framework within which to view their illness. Many obtain great value from the opportunity to meet and talk with others in similar situations. This study, which builds on previous retrospective research, affirms that this course has much to offer those who are confronted with the life-altering diagnosis of a haematological malignancy. However, the work also points to the need for special consideration to be given to a consistent minority of participants who will find socialising with their peers difficult whilst they are feeling so vulnerable and who have styles of processing information that can easily lead to 'information overload'. It is anticipated that the discussion of these findings will go some way to providing sufficient information and insight for similar courses to be duplicated, with confidence, elsewhere.","['McGrath, P']",['McGrath P'],"['Centre for Public Health Research, Queensland University of Technology, Kelvin Grove, Red Hill, Australia. p.mcgrath@qut.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Information Services', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Education as Topic', '*Patient Satisfaction', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'Social Support']",,2000/09/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/07 11:00'],"['2000/09/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s005200050006 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2000 Sep;8(5):377-84. doi: 10.1007/s005200050006.,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, first-generation (E1-defective) vectors trigger a strong cytotoxicity that impairs the duration of transgene expression. To solve these issues, we have developed a chimeric vector system that uses E1/E4 doubly defective adenoviruses for efficient production of infectious retroviral vectors. The retroviral vector sequences and packaging functions were split into two E1/E3/E4-deleted adenoviral vectors: the Moloney murine leukemia virus gag-pol cistron was expressed from the human EF1 alpha (elongation factor) promoter (AdGAG/POL), whereas the thymidine kinase transgene, embedded in a retroviral vector context, and an amphotropic retroviral envelope cassette were included within a second adenovirus (AdTK/ENV). This chimeric vector system was evaluated with a special emphasis on recombinant retrovirus production in vitro, as well as transgene amplification and persistence in vivo. Retrovirus titers of >10(5) infectious units/mL were routinely obtained in W162 cells coinfected with both recombinant adenoviruses. Long-term transgene persistence (up to 3 months) was demonstrated in vitro in two different cell lines coinfected with AdGAG/POL and AdTK/ENV, and correlated with the detection of specific provirus sequences.

Several groups have shown that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)--mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) obtained from HLA-matched siblings are effective in reconstitution of marrow function after marrow ablative conditioning therapy. To evaluate whether G-CSF treatment before bone marrow harvest leads to enhanced recovery of PBPC counts and recovery from limited graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we assessed the outcome of a sequential cohort of patients treated identically and then given either G-CSF--mobilized PBPCs or G-CSF--stimulated bone marrow from HLA-identical siblings. We show that the time to neutrophil engraftment is identical in the 2 cohorts, whereas platelet engraftment is earlier with the use of PBPCs. The incidence of acute GVHD was decreased, and that of chronic GVHD significantly decreased, in the group receiving bone marrow. Overall survival was not different between the 2 groups. Thus, G-CSF--stimulated bone marrow offers a source of stem cells that allows for early neutrophil engraftment with a decreased risk of GVHD.","['Serody, J S', 'Sparks, S D', 'Lin, Y', 'Capel, E J', 'Bigelow, S H', 'Kirby, S L', 'Gabriel, D A', 'Wiley, J M', 'Brecher, M E', 'Schell, M J', 'Folds, J', 'Shea, T C']","['Serody JS', 'Sparks SD', 'Lin Y', 'Capel EJ', 'Bigelow SH', 'Kirby SL', 'Gabriel DA', 'Wiley JM', 'Brecher ME', 'Schell MJ', 'Folds J', 'Shea TC']","['Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, The Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA. serody@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/09/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/07 11:00'],"['2000/09/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s1083-8791(00)70035-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2000;6(4A):434-40. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(00)70035-8.,,,,,,,,,,,

She initially improved following discontinuation of immunosuppression, but then deteriorated abruptly and died 58 days post-BMT. It is likely that the two separate episodes of PTLD in this patient, one of which was atypical, arose as a result of both the chronic use of cyclosporine and the impairment of cell-mediated immunity associated with autologous BMT.

In 23 cases (92%), either growth stimulation and/or differentiation induction of leukemia cells was observed in response to G-CSF. This suggests that most myeloid leukemia cells are able to respond to G-CSF stimulation. In addition, treatment of cells with low-dose Ara-C alone resulted in the enhancement of myeloid specific antigens expression in 16 cases (64%). Treatment of leukemia cells with higher concentrations of Ara-C (over 50 ng/ml) alone resulted in cytocidal effects but not in the induction of differentiation. Furthermore, 15 cases (60%) showed pronounced myeloid differentiation of leukemia cells after combined exposure to G-CSF plus low-dose Ara-C as compared with cells treated with either G-CSF or Ara-C alone. The enhanced effect of differentiation induction by combining G-CSF plus low-dose Ara-C was also observed in a murine myeloid leukemia cell line WEHI-3B in vitro.

Karyotypic and molecular analysis on evaluable leukapheresis showed that all the harvests were Ph negative and bcr-abl positive: in seven cases the levels of bcr-abl transcript were higher or equal to the pre-apheresis status. In three out of four patients, who underwent more than one leukapheresis procedure, we noticed a decreasing amount of bcr-abl contamination from the first to the last apheresis.

However, CD is rare in Japan. Here, we describe the clinicopathological features of 18 Japanese cases. Lesions were found in the small intestine (n=13), stomach (n=3) and colon (n=2). Seven patients presented with enteropathy but none had a history of CD. Lymphomas appeared as ulceration (n=11), tumour formation (n=6), or polypoid growth (n=1). Histologically (REAL classification), neoplastic lesions were composed of intestinal type T cell lymphoma (ITCL, n=13, including one case with NK type), anaplastic large cell (ALCL, n=2), adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL, n=2), and lymphoblastic type (n=1). Epstein Barr virus infection was detected by EBER-1 in situ hybridization in 6 of 11 cases with ITCL but not in the other types. ALCL expressed CD30. CD56 was expressed in 3 of 11 cases of ITCL but not in other types. Among the 10 examined cases, 8 were alphabeta T cell type [CD2+, CD3+, T cell receptor (TCR)delta-1-, betaF1+], one was gammadelta T cell type [CD2+, CD3+, TCRdelta-1+, betaF1-], and the remaining case expressed natural killer (NK) cell type [CD2+, CD3-, CD56+, TCRdelta-1-, betaF1-]. Among the 8 examined cases, 3 expressed CD103 molecule, which was associated with extrathymic T cells of intraepithelial lymphocytes. All cases except ATLL expressed the cytotoxicity-associated molecule of TIA-1, and 11 of 14 TIA-1 positive cases expressed activated cytotoxic molecules of perforin, granzyme B, and/or Fas ligand. Despite the morphological, genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, prognosis was poor, and 11 of 13 patients with small intestinal lesions died albeit appropriate treatment, but 3 of 4 patients with gastric or colonic lesions were still alive. The main cause of death was intestinal perforation. The latter might be due to the site specificity of small intestine and tumour cytotoxicity.","['Katoh, A', 'Ohshima, K', 'Kanda, M', 'Haraoka, S', 'Sugihara, M', 'Suzumiya, J', 'Kawasaki, C', 'Shimazaki, K', 'Ikeda, S', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Katoh A', 'Ohshima K', 'Kanda M', 'Haraoka S', 'Sugihara M', 'Suzumiya J', 'Kawasaki C', 'Shimazaki K', 'Ikeda S', 'Kikuchi M']","['First Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Poly(A)-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1)', '0 (TIA1 protein, human)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Granzymes', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Japan', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Perforin', 'Poly(A)-Binding Proteins', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', '*Proteins', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics/immunology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/chemistry/immunology/metabolism']",,2000/09/07 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/09/07 11:00'],"['2000/09/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['I308J001002 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009053543 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Sep;39(1-2):97-111. doi: 10.3109/10428190009053543.,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathophysiological process leading to these complications is called leukostasis but the biological mechanisms underlying its development and progression remain unclear. Although traditionally related to ""over-crowding"" of leukemic blasts in the capillaries of the microcirculation, leukostasis is likely to result from direct endothelial cell damage. This damage is probably mediated by soluble cytokines released during the interaction between leukemic cells and vascular endothelium and by the subsequent migration of leukemic blasts in the perivascular space. Leukemic cell's ability to respond to chemotactic cytokines and their expression of specific adhesion molecules are probably more important in determining whether leukostasis will develop than the number of circulating blasts. This could explain why leukostasis does not develop in all patients with AHL. The identification of the adhesion molecules, cytokines and receptors mediating endothelial cell damage in AHL should become a priority if therapeutic improvements are desired. Leukapheresis is widely used but it is unclear whether it provides additional benefit to a simpler and less invasive intervention with allopurinol, hydroxyurea and intravenous fluids. Cranial irradiation is not generally recommended. Induction chemotherapy should be started without delay. It is hoped that specific pharmacological inhibitors of the interaction between leukemic cells and vascular endothelium will result in an improved outcome for this very high-risk population.","['Porcu, P', 'Cripe, L D', 'Ng, E W', 'Bhatia, S', 'Danielson, C M', 'Orazi, A', 'McCarthy, L J']","['Porcu P', 'Cripe LD', 'Ng EW', 'Bhatia S', 'Danielson CM', 'Orazi A', 'McCarthy LJ']","['Ohio State University, Columbus, USA. porcu-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytokines/adverse effects/blood', 'Endothelium, Vascular/injuries/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/complications/pathology', 'Leukostasis/blood/*etiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/complications/pathology']",118,2000/09/07 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/09/07 11:00'],"['2000/09/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['I308J009015 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009053534 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Sep;39(1-2):1-18. doi: 10.3109/10428190009053534.,,,,,,,,,,,

The response to this challenge involves answers to the following questions: I. Who is old? Currently. 70 years of age may he considered the lower limit of senescence because the majority of age-related changes occur after this age. Individual estimates of life expectancy and functional reserve may be obtained by a comprehensive and time-consuming multidimensional geriatric assessment. The current instrument may be fine-tuned and new instruments, including laboratory tests of ageing. may be developed. 2. Why do older persons develop more cancer? It is clear that ageing tissues are more susceptible to late-stage carcinogen. Older persons may represent a natural monitor system for new environmental carcinogens, and may also represent a fruitful ground to study the late stages of carcinogenesis. 3. Is cancer different in younger and older persons? Clearly. the behaviour of some tumors. including acute myeloid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast cancer change with the age of the patient. The mechanisms of these changes that may involve both the tumour cell and the tumour host are poorly understood. 4. Can cancer he prevented in older individuals? Chemoprevention offers a new horizon of possibilities for cancer prevention: older persons may benefit most from chemoprevention due to increased susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. Screening tests may become more accurate in older individuals due to increased prevalence of cancer. hut may he less beneficial due to more limited patient life expectancy. 5. Do older persons benefit from cytotoxic treatment? The answer to this question partly stands on proper patient selection. partly on the development of safer forms of cancer treatment and prudent use of antidotes to chemotherapy toxicity. 6. What is the cost of treating older cancer patients? The treatment of older patients is generally more costly. This cost should be assessed against the cost of not treating cancer and promoting functional dependence. which by itself is extremely costly. 7. What are the endpoints of clinical trials in older cancer patients? With more limited life expectancy. the effect of treatment on quality of life is paramount. Reliable assessment of quality of life is essential for interpreting clinical trials in older individuals. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Postnatally, it may contribute to neuronal maintenance and regeneration. In addition, pharmacological stimulation of the receptor may slow the progression of several neurodegenerative disorders. The widespread nervous system expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor components and the effects of low ciliary neurotrophic factor concentrations on a wide variety of cells in culture combine to suggest that functional ciliary neurotrophic factor receptors are expressed by many classes of neurons in vivo. However, the in vivo signaling properties and distribution of functional ciliary neurotrophic factor receptors have not been directly determined. We developed a novel in vivo assay of functional ciliary neurotrophic factor receptors which revealed that, in the adult nervous system, cranial and spinal motor neurons are very sensitive to ciliary neurotrophic factor and display a rapid, robust increase in phospho-STAT3 in their dendrites, cell bodies and nuclei, which is specifically blocked by the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor antagonist, AADH-CNTF. In distinct contrast, several other classes of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor expressing neurons fail to increase phospho-STAT3 levels following ciliary neurotrophic factor treatment, even when ciliary neurotrophic factor is applied at high concentrations. Leukemia inhibitory factor and epidermal growth factor elicit the same cell-type-dependent pattern of phospho-STAT3 increases. Responsive and non-responsive neurons express comparable levels of STAT3.Therefore, in vivo ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-initiated STAT3 signal transduction is regulated in a very cell-type-dependent manner.

Typical DNA fragmentation and DNA ladder formation were induced in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The half-maximal concentration of dibucaine required to induce apoptosis was 100 microM. These effects were prevented completely by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), thereby implicating the cysteine aspartase (caspase) cascade in the process. Dibucaine activated various caspases, such as caspase-3, -6, -8, and -9 (-like) activities, but not caspase-1 (-like) activity, and induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and the release of cytochrome c (Cyt.c) from mitochondria into the cytosol. Processing of pro-caspase-3, -8, and -9 by dibucaine was confirmed by western blot analysis. Bid, a death agonist member of the Bcl-2 family, was processed by caspases following exposure of cells to dibucaine. However, 100 microM dibucaine scarcely inhibited oxidative phosphorylation, but it induced membrane permeability transition in isolated rat liver mitochondria. Taken together, these data suggest that dibucaine induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells through activation of the caspase cascade in conjunction with Cyt.c release induced by a processed product of Bid and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential.","['Arita, K', 'Utsumi, T', 'Kato, A', 'Kanno, T', 'Kobuchi, H', 'Inoue, B', 'Akiyama, J', 'Utsumi, K']","['Arita K', 'Utsumi T', 'Kato A', 'Kanno T', 'Kobuchi H', 'Inoue B', 'Akiyama J', 'Utsumi K']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Yamaguchi University, 753-8515, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Anesthetics, Local)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'L6JW2TJG99 (Dibucaine)']",IM,,"['Anesthetics, Local/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dibucaine/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Mitochondrial Swelling/drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects']",,2000/09/07 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/07 11:00'],"['2000/09/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(00)00406-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00406-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Oct 1;60(7):905-15. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00406-8.,,,,,,,,,,,

T cells are critical mediators of GVL, but the antigenic targets of this response are unknown. To determine whether patients who respond to DLI also develop B-cell immunity to CML-associated antigens, we analyzed sera from three patients with relapsed CML who achieved a complete molecular remission after infusion of donor T cells. Sera from these individuals recognized 13 distinct gene products represented in a CML-derived cDNA library. Two proteins, Jkappa-recombination signal-binding protein (RBP-Jkappa) and related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK), were recognized by sera from three of 19 DLI responders. None of these antigens were recognized by sera from healthy donors or patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease. Four gene products were recognized by sera from CML patients treated with hydroxyurea and nine were detected by sera from CML patients who responded to IFN-alpha. Antibody titers specific for RAFTK, but not for RBP-Jkappa, were found to be temporally associated with the response to DLI. These results demonstrate that patients who respond to DLI generate potent antibody responses to CML-associated antigens, suggesting the development of coordinated T- and B-cell immunity.

The drpla gene product, atrophin-1, is widely expressed, has no known function or activity, and is found in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of neurons. Truncated fragments of atrophin-1 accumulate in neuronal nuclei in a transgenic mouse model of DRPLA, and may underlie the disease phenotype. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified ETO/MTG8, a component of nuclear receptor corepressor complexes, as an atrophin-1-interacting protein. When cotransfected into Neuro-2a cells, atrophin-1 and ETO/MTG8 colocalize in discrete nuclear structures that contain endogenous mSin3A and histone deacetylases. These structures are sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble and associated with the nuclear matrix. Cotransfection of ETO/MTG8 with atrophin-1 recruits atrophin-1 to the nuclear matrix, while atrophin-1 and ETO/MTG8 cofractionate in nuclear matrix preparations from brains of DRPLA transgenic mice. Furthermore, in a cell transfection-based assay, atrophin-1 represses transcription. Together, these results suggest that atrophin-1 associates with nuclear receptor corepressor complexes and is involved in transcriptional regulation. Emerging links between disease-associated polyglutamine proteins, nuclear receptors, translocation-leukemia proteins, and the nuclear matrix may have important repercussions for the pathobiology of this family of neurodegenerative disorders.","['Wood, J D', 'Nucifora, F C Jr', 'Duan, K', 'Zhang, C', 'Wang, J', 'Kim, Y', 'Schilling, G', 'Sacchi, N', 'Liu, J M', 'Ross, C A']","['Wood JD', 'Nucifora FC Jr', 'Duan K', 'Zhang C', 'Wang J', 'Kim Y', 'Schilling G', 'Sacchi N', 'Liu JM', 'Ross CA']","['Division of Neurobiology, Department of Psychiatry, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. jonwood@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (atrophin-1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Atrophy', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Globus Pallidus/*pathology', 'Histone Deacetylases/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Matrix/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/09/07 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/07 11:00'],"['2000/09/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.150.5.939 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2000 Sep 4;150(5):939-48. doi: 10.1083/jcb.150.5.939.,,"['NS16375/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS38144/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS34172/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2175251,,,,,

In total, 2759 surveillance cultures were taken from the nostrils, throat, urine, stool and perineal region. Seven hundred and ninety-six positive surveillance cultures (28.9%) yielded 968 fungal isolates. The rate of fungal colonization did not differ between patients with acute leukaemia, patients with other haematological malignancies and control patients in the same ward at admission (71% vs. 67% vs. 80%). Patients with acute leukaemia were colonized at a significantly lower rate in samples from the throat (32%), urine (10%), stool (45%) and perineum (29%) taken during hospitalization when compared with other haematological patients (respective values 58%, 21%, 67% and 45%; P-values 0.001). This could be attributed to differences in the use of antifungal drugs. Although 21/42 (50%) of our patients had multiple-site fungal colonization at the end of follow-up, only one systemic Candida infection was diagnosed. Extensive use of antifungal treatment may have influenced the low incidence of systemic fungal infections during the follow-up. In addition to Candida species, Malassezia furfur, Geotrichum candidum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were frequently isolated. The rate of S. cerevisiae isolation increased significantly over time after admission (1%, vs. 18% of isolates, P<0.001), suggesting hospital-acquired transmission. These isolates were highly resistant to azole antifungals (MIC90 128 microg/mL for fluconazole and 16 microg/ml, for itraconazole), and caused persistent multiple site colonization in 12 patients. Extensive use of antifungal agents in a haematological ward may keep the incidence of invasive fungal infections low in spite of heavy fungal colonization. However, there may be a risk of emergence of resistant fungal strains.","['Salonen, J H', 'Richardson, M D', 'Gallacher, K', 'Issakainen, J', 'Helenius, H', 'Lehtonen, O P', 'Nikoskelainen, J']","['Salonen JH', 'Richardson MD', 'Gallacher K', 'Issakainen J', 'Helenius H', 'Lehtonen OP', 'Nikoskelainen J']","['Department of Medicine, Turku University Central Hospital, Finland. juha.salonen@tyks.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hosp Infect,The Journal of hospital infection,8007166,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,['J Hosp Infect. 2001 Jan;47(1):75.

We now show that, in CML, baseline p27(Kip) levels are significantly higher than in NL CD34(+) cells, but adhesion to fibronectin (FN) does not increase p27(Kip) levels. p27(Kip) mRNA levels are similar in CML and NL CD34(+) cells and remain unchanged after adhesion, suggesting posttranscriptional regulation. Despite the elevated p27(Kip) levels, cdk2 kinase activity is similar in CML and NL CD34(+) cells. In NL CD34(+) cells, >90% of p27(Kip) is located in the nucleus, where it binds to cdk2 after integrin engagement. In CML CD34(+) cells, however, >80% of p27(Kip) is located in the cytoplasm even in FN-adherent cells, and significantly less p27(Kip) is bound to cdk2. Thus, presence of BCR/ABL induces elevated levels of p27(Kip) and relocation of p27(Kip) to the cytoplasm, which contributes to the loss of integrin-mediated proliferation inhibition, characteristic of CML.","['Jiang, Y', 'Zhao, R C', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Jiang Y', 'Zhao RC', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Stem Cell Biology Institute and Department of Medicine and Cancer Center, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division/*immunology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation']",,2000/09/06 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/06 11:00'],"['2000/09/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.190104497 [doi]', '190104497 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Sep 12;97(19):10538-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.190104497.,,"['R01 HL049930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL-49930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK-53673/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC27060,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Apr 14;106(15):6423'],,,

This role of p53 is important for its tumour-suppression function and depends, at least in part, on its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences and activate the transcription of target genes. The pathway through which p53 promotes apoptosis is not fully understood. Here we describe a new gene regulated by p53 that encodes a predicted protein of 915 amino acids in mice (910 amino acids in humans), which we have named Pidd. The mouse Pidd cDNA contains a p53 consensus DNA binding sequence upstream of the Pidd-coding region. This sequence element bound to p53 and conferred p53-dependent inducibility on a heterologous reporter gene. Moreover, Pidd RNA was induced by ionizing radiation in a p53-dependent manner and the basal level of Pidd RNA was dependent on Trp53 status. Overexpression of Pidd inhibited cell growth in a p53-like manner by inducing apoptosis. Antisense inhibition of Pidd expression attenuated p53-mediated apoptosis.

However, the intracellular signaling pathways by which growth factors promote survival are still poorly understood. In the present study, using the MIA PaCa-2 cell line, a well-established model of pancreatic cancer cells, we analyzed the roles of ERK1/2 activities in the regulation of cell survival and investigated some of the mechanisms involved. METHODS: The ability of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 to modulate survival of the MIA PaCa-2 cells was evaluated, and the responses were correlated with expression of Bcl-2 homologs and caspases 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9 activities. RESULTS: Herein, we showed that inhibition of ERK1/2 activities caused (1) a G1 arrest; (2) a down-regulation of the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic homologs Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-X(L) without affecting the pro-apoptotic levels of Bax and Bak; (3) a promotion of caspases 3, 6, 8, and 9 activities; (4) a stimulation of PARP cleavage; and (5) a programmed cell death by apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that activation of the ERK pathway functions to protect pancreatic tumor cells from apoptosis as well as to regulate their progression in the cell cycle.","['Boucher, M J', 'Morisset, J', 'Vachon, P H', 'Reed, J C', 'Laine, J', 'Rivard, N']","['Boucher MJ', 'Morisset J', 'Vachon PH', 'Reed JC', 'Laine J', 'Rivard N']","[""Groupe du Conseil de Recherches Medicales sur le Developpement Fonctionnel et la Physiopathologie du Tube Digestif, Departement d'Anatomie et Biologie Cellulaire, Universite de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec, J1H 5N4, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Caspases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/physiology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2000/09/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/06 11:00'],"['2000/09/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-4644(20001201)79:3<355::AID-JCB20>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2000 Sep 7;79(3):355-69.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

In this study, we compared and contrasted F 11782 with three other known inhibitors of both these nuclear enzymes, namely aclarubicin. intoplicin and TAS-103, and established its novel mechanism of action. METHODS: In vitro growth-inhibitory effects against a panel of murine and tumour cell lines were measured by cell counting, clonogenicity or tetrazolium metabolic dye (MTT) assays. In vivo antitumour activities were evaluated against two murine tumour models (i.v. P388 leukaemia and s.c. B16 melanoma). Finally, interactions with either DNA or DNA-topoisomerases were determined using various methodologies: DNA-intercalator displacement, pBR322 DNA relaxation, kDNA decatenation, topoisomerase II extractability measurements, stabilization of topoisomerase-induced cleavable complexes (CC) in vitro and in cells, and gel retardation assays. RESULTS: F 11782 had a different profile of sensitivities and proved generally less cytotoxic than the other dual inhibitors tested in vitro, while showing significantly superior antitumour activity in vivo. F 11782, which did not stabilize CC either in vitro or in cells, was the only compound of this series capable of inhibiting the catalytic activity of both DNA-topoisomerases without interacting with DNA, and of completely impairing the binding of these nuclear proteins to DNA. Moreover, only cotreatment of cells in vitro with F 11782 enhanced the cytotoxic activity of etoposide. CONCLUSION: These results emphasize the novel mechanism of action of F 11782 vis-a-vis the other dual inhibitors of topoisomerases I and II and so augur well for its future clinical development.","['Etievant, C', 'Kruczynski, A', 'Barret, J M', 'Perrin, D', 'van Hille, B', 'Guminski, Y', 'Hill, B T']","['Etievant C', 'Kruczynski A', 'Barret JM', 'Perrin D', 'van Hille B', 'Guminski Y', 'Hill BT']","['Division de Cancerologie Experimentale I, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, Castres, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indenes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'FB2CIN6HMI (intoplicine)', 'QN043X3ZDW (tafluposide)', 'YVC96489QV', '(6-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)amino)-3-hydroxy-7H-indeno(2,1-c)quinolin-7-one)']",IM,,"['Aclarubicin/toxicity', 'Aminoquinolines/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Cell Division', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Indenes/toxicity', 'Indoles/toxicity', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Pyrans/pharmacology/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Pyridines/toxicity', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms']",,2000/09/06 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/09/06 11:00'],"['2000/09/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800000133 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2000;46(2):101-13. doi: 10.1007/s002800000133.,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, the oral absorption of ATRA is highly variable. Its poor aqueous solubility also makes it difficult to be formulated into parenteral formulation. To date, there is no parenteral formulation of ATRA available commercially. OBJECTIVE: To undertake the preformulation work necessary for developing such a product. METHOD: We investigated the solubility and stability profile of ATRA in various formulations. RESULTS: The aqueous solubility of ATRA could be greatly increased by the inclusion of ATRA in 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD). Adjusting the pH value further improved the water solubility of ATRA. The photostability of HP-beta-CD-based formulation of ATRA was evaluated and it was found that inclusion ATRA into HP-beta-CD did improve the photostability of ATRA. CONCLUSION: These results showed that it is possible to develop a parenteral formulation and/or an aqueous oral formulation of all-trans-retinoic acid by using 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin.

After achieving remission, for further maintenance of remission, he was treated with 14 cycles of intensive chemotherapy consisting of 6-MP, 10 mg/kg orally on the first 4 days, and cyclophosphamide, 1200 mg/m2, vincristine, 1.5 mg/m2, epirubicin, 15 mg/m2, and cytosine arabinoside, 40 mg/m2, intravenously on days 4, 11, 39, and 40, respectively. On day 18 of each cycle, he received intravenous methotrexate (MTX) infusion in a total dose of 150 mg/m2 plus oral leucovorin (30 mg/m2 ) rescue 36 h after starting MTX therapy. In addition, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was given regularly to prevent Pneumocystis carinii infection. The patient achieved remission during the first course of treatment, but 8 months later the disease relapsed. He then received four doses of MTX (800 mg intravenously) plus leucovorin rescue in the following 4 months. During the last MTX therapy, small hemorrhagic bullae were found on the lateral side of the right ankle, but subsided after a few days. Due to partial remission of the disease, he was admitted again in January 1999 for high-dose MTX therapy. An initial hemogram on admission revealed hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, white cell count 15,200/mm3, platelet count 153/mm3, blood creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, and alanine leucine aminotransferase (ALT) 20 U/L. He received 8500 mg of MTX (5000 mg/m2 ) as a continuous intravenous infusion for 24 h. Thirty-six hours after the start of MTX infusion, leucovorin (30 mg, intravenous) rescue was initiated every 6 h for 3 days. Another preventive measure to cover MTX toxicity included aggressive intravenous fluid replacement (4 L/m2 /day) and the addition of 25 meq/L sodium bicarbonate to the intravenous fluid to alkalinize the urine. Concurrent medication included 6-MP (50 mg) once daily and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (120 mg, 600 mg) twice daily every other day. Plasma MTX levels were 52.36 micromol/L 24 h after MTX infusion, 1.87 micromol/L after 48 h, 0.57 micromol/L after 72 h, and 0.41 micromol/L after 96 h. These indicated delayed MTX plasma clearance. The blood creatinine level was mildly elevated from 0.5 mg/dL to 0.7 mg/dL. Thirty-six hours after the administration of MTX, the patient developed an erythematous painful swelling on the right middle finger. The erythema, with subsequent large bulla formation, progressed to all the fingers, toes, palms, and the soles of the feet. Some erythematous to hemorrhagic papules also appeared on the bilateral elbows. Subsequently, diffuse tender erythema with extensive erosions and focal tiny pustules developed on the back, abdomen, proximal extremities, and face (Fig. 1a,b). A positive Nikolsky's sign was also present. A biopsy specimen of the right dorsal hand lesion revealed parakeratosis, detached acanthotic epidermis with scattered necrotic keratinocytes, dyskeratotic cells and nuclear atypia, neutrophilic exocytosis, and many neutrophils in the papillary dermis (Fig. 2). The skin condition deteriorated rapidly. Toxic epidermal necrolysis-like lesions involved 90% of the total body surface on the fifth day after MTX infusion. Mucositis, diarrhea, involuntary tremor, fever, and chills were noted. The patient was then sent to the burn unit for intensive skin care. Ten days after MTX therapy, profound agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia (white cell count 100/mm3, platelets 14,000/mm3, and hemoglobin 5.6 g/dL) were found. The patient was then started on granulocyte colony stimulation factor (G-CSF, 5 microg/kg/day), but his general condition deteriorated rapidly and he died 6 days later due to septic shock and multiple organ failure.","['Yang, C H', 'Yang, L J', 'Jaing, T H', 'Chan, H L']","['Yang CH', 'Yang LJ', 'Jaing TH', 'Chan HL']","['Department of Dermatology, and Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. js2925@tpts7.seed.net.tw']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/*etiology/pathology', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*adverse effects']",,2000/09/06 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/06 11:00'],"['2000/09/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['ijd022-3 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-4362.2000.00022-3.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2000 Aug;39(8):621-3. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-4362.2000.00022-3.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, children treated with native Escherichia coli asparaginase in induction therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were switched to the pegylated enzyme for reinduction under drug monitoring. Seventy children, including four patients with allergic reactions during induction, were given one dose of Oncaspar 1,000 U/m2 intravenously. Activity was determined every third or fourth day until it dropped below the limit of quantification. In current reinduction protocols [ALL/NHL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 95 trials], four doses of 10,000 U/m2 E. coli asparaginase deplete asparagine for about 2-3 weeks, therefore activities of >/= 100 U/l up to day 14 and >/= 50 U/l up to day 21 were targeted. In 66 patients without an allergic reaction during induction, the mean activity was 606 +/- 313 U/l, 232 +/- 211 U/l and 44 +/- 50 U/l after 1, 2 and 3 weeks respectively. In 44/66 patients, activity was >/= 100 U/l after 14 d. A rapid decline in activity was seen in the remaining 22 patients, including 8/22 patients who showed no activity after 1 week. Toxicity was low and comparable to the native enzymes but, in contrast to about 30% of hypersensitivity reactions with conventional reinduction therapy, no allergic reaction was seen. Substituting 4 x 10,000 U/m2 asparaginase medac for one dose of 1,000 U/m2 Oncaspar was safe and well tolerated.

Acute Leukaemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT).,308-14,"High-dose cytarabine is currently used in combination with anthracycline in the treatment of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). Moreover, high-dose cytarabine has been reported to produce long-term disease-free survival in a proportion of patients, especially in certain subtypes of AML. However, it remains unknown whether the outcome of patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation is influenced by previous treatment with high-dose cytarabine. To this end, 1672 patients with AML in first remission who were reported to the Acute Leukaemia Working Party registry of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and who were transplanted between 1980 and 1995 were analysed according to the dose intensity of cytarabine given at induction and/or consolidation. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ABMT) was performed in 846 patients and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 826 patients. This study shows that the dose of cytarabine (Ara-C) given at induction and/or consolidation did not influence the relapse incidence in patients subsequently allografted or autografted. In addition, it did not give any advantage in terms of overall outcome. Therefore, high-dose (HD) Ara-C may not be needed for patients who have a planned stem cell transplantation (SCT) as post-remission therapy. Nevertheless, HD Ara-C may be utilized in certain subtypes of AML that are believed to be curable by chemotherapy alone.","['Cahn, J Y', 'Labopin, M', 'Sierra, J', 'Blaise, D', 'Reiffers, J', 'Ferrant, A', 'Bergmann, L', 'Visani, G', 'Cornelissen, J', 'De Witte, T', 'Bosi, A', 'Frassoni, F', 'Gorin, N C']","['Cahn JY', 'Labopin M', 'Sierra J', 'Blaise D', 'Reiffers J', 'Ferrant A', 'Bergmann L', 'Visani G', 'Cornelissen J', 'De Witte T', 'Bosi A', 'Frassoni F', 'Gorin NC']","['Haematology Department, Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France. jean-yves.cahn@ufc-chu.univ-fcomte.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/09/06 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/09/06 11:00'],"['2000/09/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2178 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02178.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Aug;110(2):308-14. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02178.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

Very low seroprevalence in the Jakarta area: antibodies in healthy blood donors and in various nonhematological diseases.,77-9,"Human T lymphotropic virus I (HTLV-I) is a retrovirus associated with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma, tropical spastic paraparesis and possibly with other diseases. The actual incidence of HTLV-I carriers in Asia and Africa is difficult to assess and values of 0-37% have been reported. A study in Papua New Guinea by Yamaguchi et al. [6]found 1.8% positive for antibody to HTLV-I and this area is geographically close to the eastern part of Indonesia. A collaborative study was carried out to establish the seroprevalence of HTLV-I in Indonesia using the same method as that used standardly by Yamaguchi et al. in Japan. In a first step we measured antibody to HTLV-I in 657 subjects including 127 healthy persons around Jakarta, 451 patients with various nonhematological diseases and 79 blood donors. The majority of these healthy persons and patients came from various tribes of west Indonesia. All samples were initially screened for HTLV-I by the aggutination test. Serum that caused agglutination of the final dilution of 1:16 or more and/or showed positivity on ELISA was subjected to immunofluorescence testing using HTLV-I-producing MT-2 cells and Western blot analysis. Of the 657 samples, only 1 sample (0.15%) was found to be positive by the agglutination test, but this sample was negative when subjected to WB. From these result we concluded that there was very low seroprevalence of HTLV-I in the Jakarta area, which was also reflected in the western part of Indonesia.

However, significant divergence and debate continue to exist on the ideal approach to the management of GHD. Despite active controversy, several paradigms have recently emerged which should guide the treatment of GHD patients as we head into the new millennium. The primary objectives of GH therapy remain the normalization of height in childhood and the attainment of normal adult height, but the recognition of the metabolic roles of GH define additional therapeutic benefits. A daily subcutaneous injection of recombinant human GH in a dose range of 25-50 microg/kg/day has been established as the mainstay of therapy. Alternative modes of treatment including GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), GH secretagogues and depot GH have been developed, but evaluation of their clinical utility remains incomplete. Careful monitoring and follow-up of pediatric GHD patients by a pediatric endocrinologist are essential. Accurate determination of height velocity and interval height increases (expressed as the change in height z score) continue to be the most important parameters in monitoring the response to treatment. Monitoring serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-binding protein-3 has gained utility in the assurance of compliance and safety, but does not always correlate well with the growth response. A clear role for a biochemical as well as an auxological monitoring approach has nonetheless been established. The comparison of attained growth response to that which has been calculated by various modeling approaches is also becoming a valuable monitoring tool. Significant side effects of GH therapy are quite rare and are easily identified and addressed during close follow-up. Despite previous concerns, it now appears that in the absence of additional risk factors there is no evidence that long-term recipients of GH are at any increased risk of developing diabetes, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, brain tumor recurrence or leukemia. Although GHD may or may not persist into adult life, adult GHD diagnostic criteria and the importance of GH therapy in adult GHD patients have recently been established. Therefore, the pediatric endocrinologist now has a crucial role in guiding the transition to adult GHD management in collaboration with the adult endocrinologist. In the years to come, with the continued investigation and collaborationof experts from around the world, the approach to GH treatment will undoubtedly continue to evolve and improve.","['Wetterau, L', 'Cohen, P']","['Wetterau L', 'Cohen P']","[""Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Mattel Children's Hospital at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1752, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Horm Res,Hormone research,0366126,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Growth/drug effects', 'Growth Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Growth Hormone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans']",39,2000/09/06 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/09/06 11:00'],"['2000/09/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['23530 [pii]', '10.1159/000023530 [doi]']",ppublish,Horm Res. 2000;53 Suppl 3:31-6. doi: 10.1159/000023530.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 S.

Here, we report on two different strategies that should lead to an improvement of current protocols. A strategy is presented to tag unique chromosomal integration sites by means of retroviral infection, which can be reused for exchange with the gene of interest by action of site-specific recombinases. Targeting exchange is achieved in one step with 100% efficiency by a stringent positive selection, which makes further screening superfluous. With this strategy a predictable gene expression is obtained for foreign genes integrated into a predefined chromatin structure. A second approach aims at the stabilization of mouse retroviruses towards human serum which is a prerequisite for in vivo gene therapy protocols. To stabilize murine leukemia virus-based retroviruses against human serum, complement regulatory proteins were fused to the retroviral ENV proteins. This resulted in infectious and human complement-protected particles.","['Hauser, H', 'Spitzer, D', 'Verhoeyen, E', 'Unsinger, J', 'Wirth, D']","['Hauser H', 'Spitzer D', 'Verhoeyen E', 'Unsinger J', 'Wirth D']","['Department of Gene Regulation and Differentiation, GBF - National Research Institute for Biotechnology, Braunschweig, Germany. hha@gbf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cells Tissues Organs,"Cells, tissues, organs",100883360,"['0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CD55 Antigens/genetics', 'Chromosomes/genetics', 'Complement System Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Therapy/*trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Complement/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/genetics']",11,2000/09/06 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/09/06 11:00'],"['2000/09/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['16770 [pii]', '10.1159/000016770 [doi]']",ppublish,Cells Tissues Organs. 2000;167(2-3):75-80. doi: 10.1159/000016770.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 S.

This translocation has been documented almost exclusively in cases of acute leukemia or myelodysplasia secondary to therapy with drugs that target DNA topo isomerase II. The minimal chimeric protein that is produced fuses MLL to the bromodomain, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, EIA-binding domain and steroid-receptor coactivator binding domains of CBP. We show that transplantation of bone marrow retrovirally transduced with MLL-CBP induces myeloid leukemias in mice that are preceded by a long preleukemic phase similar to the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) seen in many t(11;16) patients but unusual for other MLL translocations. Structure-function analysis demonstrated that fusion of both the bromodomain and HAT domain of CBP to the amino portion of MLL is required for full in vitro transformation and is sufficient to induce the leukemic phenotype in vivo. This suggests that the leukemic effect of MLL-CBP results from the fusion of the chromatin association and modifying activities of CBP with the DNA binding activities of MLL.","['Lavau, C', 'Du, C', 'Thirman, M', 'Zeleznik-Le, N']","['Lavau C', 'Du C', 'Thirman M', 'Zeleznik-Le N']","['Systemix, Inc., 3155 Porter Drive, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. catlav@jupiter.chu-stlouis.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, mouse)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors']",,2000/09/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/06 11:00'],"['2000/09/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/19.17.4655 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2000 Sep 1;19(17):4655-64. doi: 10.1093/emboj/19.17.4655.,,"['P01 CA040046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC302066,,,,,

We report the first case of localized invasive cutaneous infection caused by this fungus in a 53-year-old male from the rural midwestern United States with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia. On admission for induction chemotherapy, the patient was noted to have an abrasive laceration between the fourth and fifth metacarpophalangeal joints and on the dorsum of the right hand, which progressed to frank ulceration following chemotherapy. A biopsy provided an initial diagnosis of an invasive fungal infection consistent with aspergillosis based on the histopathological appearance of the mold in tissue. Multiple positive fungal cultures which were obtained from the biopsied tissue were subsequently identified by microscopic and macroscopic characteristics to be C. lichenicola. The infection resolved following marrow regeneration, aggressive debridement of the affected tissue, and treatment with amphotericin B. This case extends the conditions associated with invasive disease caused by C. lichenicola.","['Iwen, P C', 'Tarantolo, S R', 'Sutton, D A', 'Rinaldi, M G', 'Hinrichs, S H']","['Iwen PC', 'Tarantolo SR', 'Sutton DA', 'Rinaldi MG', 'Hinrichs SH']","['Departments of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198-6495, USA. piwen@unmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,,IM,,"['Dermatomycoses/complications/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Hypocreales/*classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/*diagnosis/microbiology']",,2000/09/02 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/02 11:00'],"['2000/09/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/02 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JCM.38.9.3375-3378.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 2000 Sep;38(9):3375-8. doi: 10.1128/JCM.38.9.3375-3378.2000.,['GENBANK/AF133843'],,,,,PMC87389,,,,,

We have previously established a nested PCR assay using serum samples for detection of both strains. Here we describe a new experimental animal model for investigating the underlying mechanisms of disseminated trichosporonosis. T. asahii (OMU239, a clinical isolate from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia) and 8-week-old ICR male mice were used in all experiments. A suspension of T. asahii (3 x 10(6) CFU/animal) was injected into the caudal vein of each mouse after immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg of body weight/day for 2 days) and prednisolone (30 mg/kg/day for 1 day). Mice were then divided into four subgroups (R0, R1, R2, and R3) based on the time of reimmunosuppression. The latter was performed using the same drugs 1 week (group R1), 2 weeks (group R2), and 3 weeks (group R3) after fungal infection. Reimmunosuppression was not performed in group R0. The 5-week-survival rates of mice after T. asahii infection were 0% for group R1, 50% for group R2, 80% for group R3, and 80% for group R0. There was a significant difference in the survival rates between group R1 and either group R0 or R3 (P < 0.05). Fungal clearance in peripheral blood and various organs of group R1 and R2 was delayed relative to that of group R0 but was similar to the control in group R3 in spite of reimmunosuppression. Our results suggest that the critical period for the development of disseminated trichosporonosis in our model is shorter than 3 weeks after T. asahii infection. We concluded that mice during this critical period were in a state of latent trichosporonemia. Comparison of the survival rates suggests that the nested PCR assay was more useful than blood culture and glucuronoxylomannan antigen assay in the detection of this latent trichosporonemia.","['Yamagata, E', 'Kamberi, P', 'Yamakami, Y', 'Hashimoto, A', 'Nasu, M']","['Yamagata E', 'Kamberi P', 'Yamakami Y', 'Hashimoto A', 'Nasu M']","['The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Oita Medical University, Hasama-machi, Oita 879-5593, Japan. eijiy@oita-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fungemia/*microbiology/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Kidney/microbiology', 'Liver/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mycoses/*microbiology/mortality/physiopathology', 'Trichosporon/*growth & development/isolation & purification']",,2000/09/02 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/02 11:00'],"['2000/09/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/02 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JCM.38.9.3260-3266.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 2000 Sep;38(9):3260-6. doi: 10.1128/JCM.38.9.3260-3266.2000.,,,,,,PMC87371,,,,,

The derivatives were comprised of a spermidine fragment covalently tethered at its N4 position to either an acridine or anthracene nucleus via an aliphatic chain (e.g., spermidine-[aliphatic tether]-acridine). The distance separating the spermidine and aromatic nucleus was altered by using different tethers comprised of four or five methylene units, respectively. These ligands (2-5) were shown to inhibit human DNA topoisomerase-II (TOPO-II) activity at 10 microM. Enzymatic activity was assessed as the ability to unknot (decatenate) and cleave kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). Polyamine conjugation did not disrupt the ability of the acridine-spermidine conjugates 2 and 3 to inhibit TOPO-II activity as compared with the 9-aminoacridine and 9-(N-butyl)aminoacridine controls (at 10 microM). In general, the acridine derivatives (2 and 3) showed higher TOPO-II inhibitory activity than their anthracene counterparts (4 and 5). However, this trend was reversed in a whole cell assay with L1210 (murine leukemia) cells, wherein the anthracene analogues were more potent than their acridine counterparts. In this regard the qualitative enzyme-based assay did not predict the trends in the corresponding IC(50) values. Within either series insertion of an additional methylene unit did not significantly alter activity. While the appended spermidine unit did not disrupt TOPO II inhibition by the tethered DNA intercalator, it did provide an alternative mode of entry into the cell as demonstrated by spermidine protection assays. These results were compared with a spermine-intercalator analogue. Of all the conjugates tested the N(4)-(4-(9-aminoacridinyl)butyl)spermine hexahydrochloride (conjugate 16)resulted in the highest degree of L1210 cell rescue upon cotreatment of the cells with exogenous spermidine. It was concluded that the monoalkylated spermine motif present in 16 holds promise as a better vector than its N4 monoalkylated spermidine counterpart.","['Phanstiel O, I V', 'Price, H L', 'Wang, L', 'Juusola, J', 'Kline, M', 'Shah, S M']","['Phanstiel O IV', 'Price HL', 'Wang L', 'Juusola J', 'Kline M', 'Shah SM']","['Center for Discovery of Drugs and Diagnostics, Department of Chemistry, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida 32816-2366, USA. ophansti@mail.ucf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Org Chem,The Journal of organic chemistry,2985193R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Polyamines)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/09/02 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/02 11:00'],"['2000/09/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/02 11:00 [entrez]']","['jo0002792 [pii]', '10.1021/jo0002792 [doi]']",ppublish,J Org Chem. 2000 Sep 8;65(18):5590-9. doi: 10.1021/jo0002792.,,,,,,,,['J Org Chem 2000 Nov 3;65(22):7710'],,,

The single-positive population is thought to represent an early stage of apoptosis. We have examined the relationship between AV binding and a classical characteristic of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation. Time course studies with Jurkat cells treated for 1, 2, or 4 h with anti-Fas indicated that the proportion of AV-binding cells was increased after 2 h. A significant increase in DNA fragmentation was observed only at 4 h as measured by the mean tail moment determined with the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. This correlation suggests a temporal relationship between the two parameters, but does not provide direct evidence of what happens in individual cells. We developed a method to measure fluorescent markers of cellular structure or function with a laser scanning cytometer and then perform the comet assay on the same cells. Cells in each AV-binding subpopulation were re-examined before and after electrophoresis. Most AV-/PI- cells had no DNA damage, although a few cells showed a pattern of damage characteristic for apoptosis. Double-positive cells all had damaged DNA; approximately half had the apoptotic pattern, and the rest had a pattern typical for necrosis. Nearly all of the single-positive cells had damaged DNA with the apoptotic pattern.

To investigate the mechanism of the synergistic effect of these factors, we examined the effect of GM-CSF on retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) in ML-1 cells. We reveal that GM-CSF induces the expression of RAR alpha mRNA and protein and stimulates the binding of nuclear proteins to direct repeat 5, a consensus sequence with high affinity for RAR-RXR heterodimers. Furthermore, expression of CD38 mRNA mediated through RAR alpha is induced synergistically by treatment with ATRA + GM-CSF. These results suggest that GM-CSF stimulates transcriptional activity mediated via RAR alpha in ML-1 cells. The induction of RAR alpha by GM-CSF may therefore be a mechanism for stimulation by GM-CSF. The induction of RAR alpha by GM-CSF was also detected in other myeloid leukemia cell lines (THP-1 and KG-1) that showed a synergistic effect similar to that seen in ML-1 cells in response to ATRA + GM-CSF. We also found that GM-CSF induced the expression of RAR alpha in blood cells obtained from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. This activity of GM-CSF may serve as a useful adjunct to differentiation therapy for retinoic acid-nonresponsive leukemias.","['Shimizu, T', 'Takeda, K']","['Shimizu T', 'Takeda K']","['Department of Hygiene-Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Science University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Response Elements/drug effects/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2000/09/02 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/09/02 11:00'],"['2000/09/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/02 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Aug 15;60(16):4544-9.,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, CD34+/CD38- leukemia progenitors have been defined as new leukemia-initiating cells less mature than colony-forming cells. Here we show that CD34+/CD38- leukemia precursors have reduced in vitro sensitivity to daunorubicin, a major drug used in leukemia treatment, in comparison with the CD34+/CD38+ counterpart, and increased expression of multidrug resistance genes (mrp/lrp). These precursors show lower expression of Fas/Fas-L and Fas-induced apoptosis than CD34+/CD38+ blasts. Moreover, the CD34+/CD38- leukemic subpopulation induces a weaker mixed leukocyte reaction of responding T-lymphocytes than the CD34+/CD38+ leukemic counterpart, either in a MHC-unmatched or MHC-matched settings. This weaker immunogenicity could be linked to lower expression on CD34+/CD38- leukemia precursors of major immune response molecules (MHC-DR, LFA-3, B7-1, or B7-2) than CD34+/CD38+ leukemic cells. Nonetheless, the susceptibility of the immature CD38- precursors to cytotoxicity was not different from the sensitivity of the CD38+ counterpart. Finally, CD34+/CD38- leukemia precursors, in contrast with CD38+ precursors, failed, under appropriate conditions, to differentiate into dendritic cells, a central step for antigen recognition. This is to our knowledge the first demonstration that the very immature phenotype of CD34+/CD38- leukemic progenitors confers both chemotherapy resistance and decreased capacities to induce an immune response. Because the susceptibility of the immature leukemia cells as cytotoxic targets is maintained, our data underline the importance of improving the initial steps of leukemia recognition, more particularly by defining optimal conditions of dendritic cell transformation of the very immature hematopoietic precursors.","['Costello, R T', 'Mallet, F', 'Gaugler, B', 'Sainty, D', 'Arnoulet, C', 'Gastaut, J A', 'Olive, D']","['Costello RT', 'Mallet F', 'Gaugler B', 'Sainty D', 'Arnoulet C', 'Gastaut JA', 'Olive D']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Universite de la Mediterranee, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Acute Disease', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'CD58 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Gene Expression', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/metabolism/physiology', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'fas Receptor/metabolism/*physiology']",,2000/09/02 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/09/02 11:00'],"['2000/09/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/02 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Aug 15;60(16):4403-11.,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated that treatment of THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells with Z-LLL-CHO, a reversible proteasome inhibitor, induced cell death through an apoptotic pathway. Apoptosis in THP-1 cells induced by Z-LLL-CHO involved a cytochrome c-dependent pathway, which included the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9 and -3, and cleavage of Bcl-2 into a shortened 22-kDa fragment. Induction of apoptosis by protease inhibitor also was detected in U937 and TF-1 leukemia cell lines and cells obtained from acute myelogenous leukemia patients but not in normal human blood monocytes. Treatment of human blood monocytes with Z-LLL-CHO did not induce apoptosis or Bcl-2 cleavage in these cells that rarely proliferate. Interestingly, when THP-1 cells were induced to undergo monocytic differentiation by bryostatin 1, a naturally occurring protein kinase C activator, they were no longer susceptible to apoptosis induced by Z-LLL-CHO. Bryostatin 1-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells was associated with growth arrest, acquisition of adherent capacity, and expression of membrane markers characteristic of blood monocytes. Likewise, differentiated THP-1 cells were refractory to Z-LLL-CHO-induced cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and Bcl-2 cleavage. Resistance to Z-LLL-CHO-induced apoptosis in differentiated THP-1 cells was not due to cell cycle arrest. These findings show that the action of proteasome inhibitors is mediated primarily through a cytochrome c-dependent pathway and induces apoptosis in leukemic cells that are not differentiated.","['Chen, C', 'Lin, H', 'Karanes, C', 'Pettit, G R', 'Chen, B D']","['Chen C', 'Lin H', 'Karanes C', 'Pettit GR', 'Chen BD']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Bryostatins', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/metabolism/pathology', 'Leupeptins/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology']",,2000/09/02 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/09/02 11:00'],"['2000/09/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/02 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Aug 15;60(16):4377-85.,,"['CA 44344-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 73212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), essential for embryo implantation, is up-regulated by IL-4 and progesterone. Moreover, the production of LIF and/or Th2 cytokines by decidual T cells contributes to the maintenance of pregnancy.

To understand better this phenomenon, we have investigated the DNA content of MN induced by Tax. Using an approach that we termed FISHI, fluorescent in situ hybridization and incorporation, we attempted to characterize MN with centric or acentric DNA fragments for the presence or absence of free 3'-OH ends. Free 3'-OH ends were defined as those ends accessible to in situ addition of digoxigenin-dUTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. MN were also assessed for centromeric sequences using standard fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Combining these results, we determined that Tax oncoprotein increased the frequency of MN containing centric DNA with free 3'-OH and decreased the frequency of MN containing DNA fragments that had incorporation-inaccessible 3'-ends. Recently, it has been suggested that intracellular DNA breaks without detectable 3'-OH ends are stabilized by the protective addition of telomeric caps, while breaks with freely detectable 3'-OH are uncapped and are labile to degradation, incomplete replication, and loss during cell division. Accordingly, based on increased detection of free 3'-OH-containing DNA fragments, we concluded that HTLV-I Tax interferes with protective cellular mechanism(s) used normally for stabilizing DNA breaks.","['Majone, F', 'Jeang, K T']","['Majone F', 'Jeang KT']","['Department of Biology, University of Padova, Padova 35131 Italy and the Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. majone@civ.bio.unipd.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Centromere/genetics/ultrastructure', '*DNA Damage', 'Gene Products, tat/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutagens', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Telomere/genetics/ultrastructure']",,2000/09/02 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/02 11:00'],"['2000/09/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/02 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.C000538200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)89180-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Oct 20;275(42):32906-10. doi: 10.1074/jbc.C000538200.,,,,,,,,,,,

Autologous peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cell transplantation (referred here collectively as 'autoBMT') is emerging as a standard consolidative strategy in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We had noted life-threatening bleeding associated with platelet transfusion refractoriness following autoBMT; we therefore retrospectively analyzed 39 AML patients for this complication following BMT. All patients received high-dose chemoradiotherapy, followed by infusion of allogeneic sibling donor (n = 12, alloBMT) or autologous (n = 27, autoBMT) stem cells. HLA alloimmunization was assessed if patients were suspected of immune refractoriness to random donor platelet transfusions. Within 100 days of stem cell infusion, one of three alloBMT and six of 12 autoBMT recipients tested were HLA alloimmunized (not statistically significant, NS). Five of six HLA alloimmunized autoBMT patients experienced delayed bleeding, which contributed to their demise while still in remission (P < 0.001).

Since brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is largely a hormone of cardiac ventricular origin and is released early in the course of ventricular dysfunction, we have examined the value of serial plasma BNP levels for detecting cardiac failure in patients undergoing cytotoxic conditioning for HSCT. Fifteen patients undergoing HSCT were evaluated (10 undergoing autologous HSCT; five undergoing allogeneic HSCT). BNP was measured by radioimmunoassay prior to therapy and weekly for 5 weeks. Seven patients had a significant rise in BNP level (above a previously established threshold of 43 pmol/l associated with cardiac failure), occurring 1-4 weeks post commencement of conditioning. In three of these patients, cardiac failure was subsequently diagnosed clinically 3, 9 and 23 days after a BNP level of 43 pmol/l had been detected. These three patients had the highest peak BNP levels for the group and in each case elevation in BNP level occurred for a period exceeding 1 week. Although numbers were relatively small, a BNP >43 pmol/l was significantly associated with the inclusion of high-dose cyclophosphamide in the preparative regimen (P = 0.02). BNP levels showed no relationship to febrile episodes. In conclusion, these results show that plasma BNP may be used as a marker for early detection of cardiac dysfunction in patients undergoing HSCT, particularly if levels are increased for periods exceeding 1 week. Measurement of BNP during HSCT may be helpful in patients at risk of cardiac failure, in complex clinical situations and in monitoring the cardiotoxicity of preparative regimens.","['Snowden, J A', 'Hill, G R', 'Hunt, P', 'Carnoutsos, S', 'Spearing, R L', 'Espiner, E', 'Hart, D N']","['Snowden JA', 'Hill GR', 'Hunt P', 'Carnoutsos S', 'Spearing RL', 'Espiner E', 'Hart DN']","['South Island Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/therapy', 'Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/blood/therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*blood/etiology']",,2000/09/01 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/01 11:00'],"['2000/09/01 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/01 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702507 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Aug;26(3):309-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702507.,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown in our previous studies that they serve as transplantation antigens, and can be recognized by both TCR alpha beta and TCR gamma delta cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) with TL but not H-2 restriction. Although TL are known to be expressed TAP independently, it is unclear whether peptide loading on TL molecules is necessary for the formation of CTL epitopes. In the present study, we first showed that TL expression is beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m)-dependent but TAP1 independent by flow cytometric analysis of thymocytes from beta(2)m- or TAP1-deficient mice crossed with TL transgenic mice expressing Tla(a)-3-TL on their thymocytes. Subsequently, we investigated the epitope recognized by CTL derived from C3H mice immunized with skin from a transgenic mouse expressing T3(b)-TL ubiquitously. Bulk CTL lines against TL from primary mixed lymphocyte cultures showed comparable cytotoxicity against T3(b)-TL transfectants of TAP2-deficient murine RMA-S grown at 37 degrees C to that against those grown at 25 degrees C. Furthermore, TCR alpha beta and TCR gamma delta CTL clones against TL recognized TL expressed on T3(b)-TL transfectants of RMA-S and Drosophila melanogaster cells having broad defects in peptide loading of MHC, and lysed these target cells. These results together indicate that TL-specific CTL populations primarily recognize epitopes expressed TAP independently.","['Tsujimura, K', 'Obata, Y', 'Iwase, S', 'Matsudaira, Y', 'Ozeki, S', 'Takahashi, T']","['Tsujimura K', 'Obata Y', 'Iwase S', 'Matsudaira Y', 'Ozeki S', 'Takahashi T']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8681, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tap1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tap2 protein, mouse)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '145892-13-3 (TAP2 protein, human)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 3', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/deficiency/genetics']",,2000/09/01 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/09/01 11:00'],"['2000/09/01 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/01 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/12.9.1217 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 2000 Sep;12(9):1217-25. doi: 10.1093/intimm/12.9.1217.,,,,,,,,,,,

Its receptor complex consists of a non-signaling alpha chain, CNTFR, and two signaling beta chains, gp130 and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Striking phenotypic differences between CNTF- and CNTFR-deficient mice suggest that CNTFR serves as a receptor for a second, developmentally important ligand. We have identified this factor as a stable secreted complex of cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) and the soluble receptor cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF). CLF expression was required for CLC secretion, and the complex acted only on cells expressing functional CNTF receptors. The CLF/CLC complex activated gp130, LIFR and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and supported motor neuron survival.

MK800-62F1 did not exhibit antioxidative activity in vitro, suggesting that inhibition of apoptosis by MK800-62F1 was not due to the scavenging of H2O2, rather it was due to the modulation of the downstream event of H2O2 generation.","['Yoshimoto, Y', 'Sawa, T', 'Kinoshita, N', 'Homma, Y', 'Hamada, M', 'Takeuchi, T', 'Imoto, M']","['Yoshimoto Y', 'Sawa T', 'Kinoshita N', 'Homma Y', 'Hamada M', 'Takeuchi T', 'Imoto M']","['Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Antibiot (Tokyo),The Journal of antibiotics,0151115,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (MK 800-62F1)', '0 (Saponins)', '2044-85-1 (diacetyldichlorofluorescein)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Fermentation', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Saponins/*chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Streptomyces/classification/*metabolism']",,2000/08/31 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/31 11:00'],"['2000/08/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/31 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.7164/antibiotics.53.569 [doi]'],ppublish,J Antibiot (Tokyo). 2000 Jun;53(6):569-74. doi: 10.7164/antibiotics.53.569.,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of the menopausal status and of the initial treatment modalities (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) was investigated. RESULTS: Excluding second primary breast cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer, a total of 193 (4.4%) patients developed a SMN between 1973 and 1992, compared with 136 expected (Standardised Incidence Ratio, SIR = 1.4, 95% CI (1.2-1.6)). No trend towards either an increase or a decrease was noted in the SIR with time after treatment (p = 0.2). The greatest increase in the relative risk concerned soft tissue cancers (SIR = 13.0, 95% CI: 6.8-22.3), followed by leukaemia (SIR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.7-5.0), melanoma (SIR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.4-4.8), kidney (SIR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.2-4.5), ovary (SIR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.1) and uterine tumours (SIR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4-2.5). The SIR was 3.0 (95% CI 1.8-4.7) in women under 40 at the time of the breast cancer, 1.9 (95% CI: 1.4-2.4) in those aged 40-49 and 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.4) in those aged 50 or more. In the 2,514 women who had received radiotherapy as initial treatment without chemotherapy, the SIR for all SMN was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.3) fold higher than in those who had not received radiotherapy as initial treatment. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study confirms the increased risk of second malignancies in women treated for a breast cancer, and particularly in those who were younger at the time of treatment for breast cancer. Our results also suggest that radiotherapy may play a role in the onset of these second lesions.","['Rubino, C', 'de Vathaire, F', 'Diallo, I', 'Shamsaldin, A', 'Le, M G']","['Rubino C', 'de Vathaire F', 'Diallo I', 'Shamsaldin A', 'Le MG']","[""Unite de Recherche en Epidemiologie des Cancers de l'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (U521), Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Menopause', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",,2000/08/31 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/31 11:00'],"['2000/08/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/31 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1006489918700 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2000 Jun;61(3):183-95. doi: 10.1023/a:1006489918700.,,,,,,,,,,,

Dispersed cells, actually a mixture of zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata-reticularis (ZF/R) cells, were incubated with glucagon (from 10(-10) to 10(-6) M) alone or in the presence of 10(-9) M angiotensin-II, 10(-10) M ACTH or 10(-5) M forskolin, and the effects on aldosterone, cortisol and cyclic-AMP (cAMP) production were measured by radioimmune assay. Glucagon concentration-dependently inhibited ACTH-stimulated cortisol production and ACTH- or forskolin-enhanced cAMP release, minimal and maximal effective concentrations being 10(-9) and 10(-7) M. The effects of glucagon were suppressed by 10(-5) M Des-His1-[Glu9]glucagon amide, an antagonist of glucagon receptors (glucagon-A). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction did not reveal the presence of specific glucagon-receptor mRNA in the human adrenal cortex. However, autoradiography demonstrated the presence of [125I]glucagon binding sites in the ZF/R, which were displaced by glucagon but not by ACTH. Taken together, these findings suggest that glucagon, through the activation of unidentified receptors located on ZF/R cells, inhibits adenylate cyclase, thereby dampening glucocorticoid response to ACTH.","['Mazzocchi, G', 'Gottardo, L', 'Aragona, F', 'Albertin, G', 'Nussdorfer, G G']","['Mazzocchi G', 'Gottardo L', 'Aragona F', 'Albertin G', 'Nussdorfer GG']","['Department of Human Anatomy and Physiology, University of Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Horm Metab Res,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,0177722,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucagon)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '4964P6T9RB (Aldosterone)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9007-92-5 (Glucagon)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/*metabolism', 'Adrenal Cortex/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/*pharmacology', 'Aldosterone/biosynthesis', 'Angiotensin II/pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Glucagon/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Liver/chemistry', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Receptors, Glucagon/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Zona Fasciculata/drug effects/metabolism', 'Zona Glomerulosa/drug effects/metabolism']",,2000/08/31 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/31 11:00'],"['2000/08/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/31 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-978633 [doi]'],ppublish,Horm Metab Res. 2000 Jul;32(7):265-8. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-978633.,,,,,,,,,,,

Like already clustered monoclonal antibodies, the use of new markers of differentiation provide some new information about their structure and function. Here we consider the role of few selected regulatory proteins that are most frequently involved in the processes of activation, cell differentiation and proliferation of human hematological malignant cells. These molecules, being either lineage-restricted or multi-lineage cell activation ones, are involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix communications. They are involved in various leukocyte functions such as mobility, interaction with endothelium, and homing. Since physiologic cell growth involves not only cell division, but also programmed-cell death, we considered some apoptosis-regulatory molecules implicated in the clinical heterogeneity of hematological malignancies. The presence or absence of staining for these molecules is not only an important discriminatory immunophenotypic feature, but it appears useful also for prognosis and particularly in an experimental therapeutical setting. The prognostic significance of cell-expression of these molecules has not yet been clearly established, but it might be helpful in the evaluation of stability and progression of the disease.","['Milosevic, D']",['Milosevic D'],"['Institute of Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/diagnosis/metabolism/therapy', '*Lymphoma/diagnosis/metabolism/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",59,2000/08/31 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/31 11:00'],"['2000/08/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/31 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Jun;19(2):175-81.,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern-blot analysis using a panel of different probes in combination with densitometry and flow cytometry were used to detect and compare the amount of clonal or CD34-positive BM cells before and after the culturing procedure. A significant reduction of CD34-positive cells after incubation with a cytokine mix [interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-3, IL-6, stem cell factor (SCF), erythropoietin (EP) with granulocyte macrophage/colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, Cytok1) could be achieved in all 16 cases with a CD34-positive blast phenotype studied at diagnosis (P<0.001), in 3 of 10 cases at relapse, and in 8 of 18 cases in complete remission. In healthy donors, an increase of CD34-positive cells was demonstrated in 5 of 5 samples. A reduction of clonal DNA through incubation with Cytok1 was achieved in 5 of 5 (100%) cases studied at diagnosis, in 1 of 4 (25%) cases at relapse, and in 7 of 9 cases (78%) in complete remission. Cytokine cocktails with GM-CSF (Cytok1) were more efficient in reducing (clonal) CD34-positive cells than cocktails without GM-CSF (Cytok2). AML patients at diagnosis and in complete remission had a better survival probability if their CD34-positive or clonal cells could be reduced in vitro by cytokine cultivation (P<0.05). Vitality of BM cells was not influenced by 14-day cytokine treatment; however, the total cell count could be increased by Cytok1 and Cytok2 by 55-174%, but not by the control medium. Our data show that: (1) clonal cell populations can be regularly detected at diagnosis, during complete remission, and at relapse; (2) CD34-positive cells in AML can be demonstrated to be clonal, gene-rearranged cells; (3) incubation of AML BM-cells with Cytokl leads to a reduction of the CD34-positive, clonal cell load in all cases at diagnosis and in 78% of the cases in complete remission of AML, but in only 25% of the cases at relapse; (4) in all healthy BM samples, proportions of 'healthy' CD34-positive cells were increased. Moreover, absolute cell counts were increased by cytokine incubation of cells obtained at diagnosis, relapse, or complete remission of AML and from healthy donors indicating a selective stimulation of healthy, but not of leukemic CD34-positive cells; (5) cytokine cocktails containing GM-CSF are more efficient in reducing leukemic cells than cocktails without GM-CSF; and (6) in vitro reactivity of clonal or CD34-positive BM cells against Cytokl has clinical relevance. We conclude, that Southern-blot analysis and flow cytometry are suitable methods to detect and quantify leukemic disease and to distinguish between clonal or non-clonal CD34-positive cells. The ex vivo or clinical application of specific combinations of cytokines might be a feasible and successful application of immunotherapy in AML that merits further investigations.","['Braun, S', 'Gerhartz, H H', 'Schmetzer, H M']","['Braun S', 'Gerhartz HH', 'Schmetzer HM']","['Charite, Virchow Klinikum, Exp.

This is true for allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation, treatment with interferon alpha (IFN) and Philadelphia-negative stem-cell collections for autografting. Outcome differs according to risk profiles of patients at diagnosis. In addition, molecular techniques for the detection of the BCR-ABL fusion gene or its products, such as the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern blot analysis, or fluorescence in situ hybridization, facilitate accurate diagnosis and the monitoring of residual disease. They allow the individualization of treatment such as early infusion of donor lymphocytes if molecular relapse is detected after allografting, or discontinuation of IFN in the presence of very low BCR-ABL transcript levels). The availability of real-time PCR devices further improves and accelerates the diagnosis and monitoring of residual disease. This article addresses recent developments in drug therapy and allografting, including treatment intensification with low-dose ara C or intensive chemotherapy followed by autografting, introduction of new drugs (such as homoharringtonine or tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571), progress with unrelated donor transplantations, use of peripheral blood stem cells for allografting, and transplantation without myeloablative conditioning. Tradeoffs between the treatment options will be discussed in the context of the evidence-based guidelines for treating CML, as recently published by the American Society of Hematology.

In general the uncomplexed thiosemicarbazones were more potent in the cytotoxic screens than the bis(thiosemicarbazone) except in the murine L1210 and the human colon SW480 screens. Mode of action studies have only demonstrated slight differences in the effects of the two types of compounds on nucleic acid metabolism. The symmetrical and unsymmetrical bis(thiosemicarbazones) complexes of copper, nickel, zinc, and cadmium have been examined to compare them to the heterocyclic N(4)-substituted thiosemicarbazones metal complexes. These new derivatives demonstrated excellent activity against the growth of suspended lymphomas and leukemias although it should be pointed out that generally they were not as active as the copper complexes of N(4)-substituted thiosemicarbazones. Nevertheless, selected bis(thiosemicarbazones) complexes were active against the growth of human lung MB9812, KB nasopharynx, epidermoid A431, glioma UM-86, colon SW480, ovary 1-A9, breast MCK-7, and osteosarcoma Saos-2. In human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells the complexes preferentially inhibited DNA and purine syntheses over 60 min. The regulatory enzyme of the de novo purine pathway, IMP dehydrogenase, appeared to be a major target of the complexes. However, minor inhibition of the activities of DNA polymerase alpha, PRPP-amido transferase, ribonucleotide reductase, and nucleoside kinases occurred over the same time period. No doubt these effects of the complexes on nucleic acid metabolism were additive since the d[NTP] pool levels were reduced after 60 min as was DNA synthesis. The symmetrical and unsymmetrical bis(thiosemicarbazones) and their metal complexes did not cause as severe DNA fragmentation as the heterocyclic N(4)-substituted thiosemicarbazone metal complexes; furthermore, their metabolic effects in the tumor cell were more focused on a single synthetic pathway.","['Hall, I H', 'Lackey, C B', 'Kistler, T D', 'Ives, J S', 'Beraldo, H', 'Ackerman, L J', 'West, D X']","['Hall IH', 'Lackey CB', 'Kistler TD', 'Ives JS', 'Beraldo H', 'Ackerman LJ', 'West DX']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry & Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7360, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Archiv der Pharmazie,0330167,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Metals, Heavy)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Semicarbazones)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Metals, Heavy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organometallic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Semicarbazones/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/31 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/31 11:00'],"['2000/08/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/31 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1521-4184(20007)333:7<217::AID-ARDP217>3.0.CO;2-M [pii]', '10.1002/1521-4184(20007)333:7<217::aid-ardp217>3.0.co;2-m [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pharm (Weinheim). 2000 Jul;333(7):217-25. doi: 10.1002/1521-4184(20007)333:7<217::aid-ardp217>3.0.co;2-m.,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistently, DAD1 binds well to Mcl-1 in COS cells when overexpressed. On deletion analysis, the C-terminal domain of Mcl-1 containing BH(2) (bcl-2 homologous domain) was found to be essential for the interaction with DAD1. On the other hand, the C-terminal half of DAD1 was concluded to be essential for the interaction with Mcl-1. Surprisingly, a DeltaC-DAD1 mutant lacking only 4 amino acid residues from the C-terminus did not complement the tsBN7 mutation, while it interacted well with Mcl-1. In contrast, DeltaN-DAD1 lacking 20 amino acid residues from the N-terminus still exhibited the ability to complement the tsBN7 mutation. Thus, the C-terminus of DAD1 was suggested to play an important role in N-linked glycosylation and to complement the tsBN7 mutation.

Certain chromosomal abnormalities are also strong predictors; in particular, the Philadelphia chromosome and MLL gene rearrangements (especially in infants) are adverse features, while TEL-AML1 is favorable.

The ligand targets the molecule to cells and the toxin enters the cell, inactivates protein synthesis and induces cell death. Diphtheria fusion proteins directed to human myeloid leukemic blasts are a novel class of therapeutics for patients with chemotherapy refractory myeloid leukemia. Because of the presence of interleukin-3 (IL3) receptors on myeloid leukemic progenitors and its absence from mature myeloid cells, we synthesized four bacterial expression vectors encoding DT(388) fused to human IL3. Different molecules were engineered to assess the effects of modifications on yield, purity and potency of product. The constructs differed in the size of the linker peptide between the DT(388) and IL3 domains and in the presence or absence of an oligohistidine tag on the N- or C-terminus. Escherichia coli were transformed and recombinant protein induced and purified from inclusion bodies. Similar final yields of 3-6 mg of purified protein per liter of bacterial culture were obtained with each of the four molecules. Purity ranged from 70 to 90% after partial purification by anion-exchange, size-exclusion chromatography and/or nickel affinity chromatography. Proteins were soluble and stable at 4 degrees C and -80 degrees C in phosphate-buffered saline at 0.03-0.5 mg/ml. The fusion proteins showed predicted molecular weights by SDS-PAGE, HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry and had full ADP-ribosylating activities. Each was immunoreactive with antibodies to DT(388) and IL3. Each of the fusion proteins with the exception of the one with an N-terminal oligohistidine tag showed full IL3 receptor binding affinity (K:(d) = 3 nM) and potent and selective cytotoxicity to IL3 receptor positive human myeloid leukemia cell lines (IC(50) = 5-10 pM). In contrast, the N-terminal histidine-tagged fusion protein bound IL3 receptor with a 10-fold lower affinity and was 10-fold less cytotoxic to IL3 receptor positive blasts. Thus, we report a series of novel, biologically active DT(388)IL3 fusion proteins for potential therapy of patients with receptor positive myeloid leukemias.","['Frankel, A E', 'Ramage, J', 'Kiser, M', 'Alexander, R', 'Kucera, G', 'Miller, M S']","['Frankel AE', 'Ramage J', 'Kiser M', 'Alexander R', 'Kucera G', 'Miller MS']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Protein Eng,Protein engineering,8801484,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'DNA Primers', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*chemistry', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*chemistry', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*chemistry/isolation & purification']",,2000/08/31 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/31 11:00'],"['2000/08/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/31 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/protein/13.8.575 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Eng. 2000 Aug;13(8):575-81. doi: 10.1093/protein/13.8.575.,,['R01CA76178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We have determined the sequence, abundance, and function of human FPGS transcripts and found some striking differences to transcription of the mouse gene that allow production of FPGS isoforms in mouse liver and dividing tissues. Multiple human transcripts were identified, including the homolog of the mouse transcripts that initiate at two upstream exons. However, the human FPGS upstream promoter is infrequently used, and transcripts from this promoter include sequences homologous with only one of the upstream exons found in the mouse. The downstream promoter generates an array of transcripts, some of which do not produce active enzyme, a phenomenon not seen in the mouse. Hence, the dual promoter mechanism directing expression of FPGS isozymes in mouse tissues is not conserved in humans, and, unlike the mouse downstream promoter, the human downstream promoter is active in both dividing and differentiated tissues. This study raises questions about the differences in function served by the two mouse FPGS isozymes and how, or if, human tissues fulfill these functions. How humans and mice produce FPGS in only a subset of tissues using such different promoter structures also becomes a central issue.","['Turner, F B', 'Taylor, S M', 'Moran, R G']","['Turner FB', 'Taylor SM', 'Moran RG']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Exons/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics', 'Liver/enzymology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Peptide Synthases/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Sequence Homology', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/31 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/31 11:00'],"['2000/08/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/31 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M005228200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)88696-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Nov 17;275(46):35960-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M005228200.,"['GENBANK/AY007209', 'GENBANK/AY007210', 'GENBANK/AY007211', 'GENBANK/AY007212']",['CA-39687/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Hexahistidine (His(6)), hemagluttinin (HA), or two consecutive HA sequences (2XHA) were fused to the C-terminus of IN as antigenic markers. These epitope-tagged IN proteins were stably expressed through multiple rounds of infection. The IN-His(6), IN-HA, and IN-2XHA proteins, purified from virus, could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies against His(6) and HA, respectively. An M-MuLV provirus encoding the SV40 large T antigen NLS fused to IN at the same position as the epitope tags was also passaged through cells. In contrast to the stability of the epitope tags, the SV40 NLS sequence was rapidly mutated by a frameshift mutation that introduced negatively charged amino acids into the basic NLS. The instability of the NLS suggests that the strong nuclear localization of the IN-SV40 NLS may have detrimental effects on virus assembly. These observations have implications for studying nuclear transport properties of M-MuLV and for engineering a murine-based retroviral vector for gene therapy.","['Seamon, J A', 'Adams, M', 'Sengupta, S', 'Roth, M J']","['Seamon JA', 'Adams M', 'Sengupta S', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Integrases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics/*physiology', '*Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Simian virus 40', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",,2000/08/31 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/31 11:00'],"['2000/08/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/31 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.2000.0481 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(00)90481-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2000 Sep 1;274(2):412-9. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0481.,,"['R01CA76545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-DK54374/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM8360/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

The isotypes RARalpha,beta and gamma are distinct pharmacological targets for retinoids that are involved in the treatment of various skin diseases and cancers, in particular breast cancer and acute promyelocytic leukemia. Therefore, synthetic retinoids have been developed aiming at isotype selectivity and reduced side-effects. We report the crystal structures of three complexes of the hRARgamma ligand-binding domain (LBD) bound to agonist retinoids that possess selectivity either for RARgamma (BMS184394) or for RARbeta/gamma (CD564), or that are potent for all RAR-isotypes (panagonist BMS181156). The high resolution data (1.3-1. 5 A) provide a description at the atomic level of the ligand pocket revealing the molecular determinants for the different degrees of ligand selectivity. The comparison of the complexes of the chemically closely related retinoids BMS184394 and CD564 shows that the side-chain of Met272 adopts different conformations depending on the presence of a hydrogen bond between its sulfur atom and the ligand. This accounts for their different isotype selectivity. On the other hand, the difference between the pan- and the RARbeta, gamma-selective agonist is probably due to a steric discrimination at the level of the 2-naphthoic acid moiety of CD564. Based on this study, we propose a model for a complex with the RARgamma-specific agonist CD666 that shows the possible applications for structure-based drug design of RAR isotype-selective retinoids.","['Klaholz, B P', 'Mitschler, A', 'Moras, D']","['Klaholz BP', 'Mitschler A', 'Moras D']","['Laboratoire de Biologie et Genomique Structurales, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS/INSERM/ULP, 1, rue Laurent Fries, Illkirch Cedex, BP 163, F-67404, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor gamma)']",IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Isoforms/agonists/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/agonists/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Retinoids/*chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity']",,2000/08/31 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/08/31 11:00'],"['2000/08/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/31 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/jmbi.2000.4032 [doi]', 'S0022-2836(00)94032-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2000 Sep 8;302(1):155-70. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.2000.4032.,"['PDB/1FCX', 'PDB/1FCY', 'PDB/1FCZ']",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

We observed that CD4 T lymphocytes from PL cattle proliferated in the presence of autologous, irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), whereas no proliferation occurred in cell cultures from BLV-infected non-PL cattle. Proliferation required direct contact with metabolically active irradiated PBMC but was not associated with viral protein expression or inhibited by antibodies to BLV. Unexpectedly, B lymphocytes alone failed to account for the irradiated PBMC stimulation of CD4 T lymphocytes. These observations and the magnitude of the proliferative response suggest that activation is polyclonal and involves mechanisms other than BLV antigen-specific stimulation.","['Stone, D M', 'Norton, L K', 'Chambers, J C', 'Meek, W J']","['Stone DM', 'Norton LK', 'Chambers JC', 'Meek WJ']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman, Washington, 99164-7040, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Immunol,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",100883537,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Map protein, Staphylococcus aureus)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Viral/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology/*virology', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology/*pathology', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/radiation effects', 'Lymphocyte Activation']",,2000/08/31 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/31 11:00'],"['2000/08/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/31 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/clim.2000.4900 [doi]', 'S1521-6616(00)94900-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol. 2000 Sep;96(3):280-8. doi: 10.1006/clim.2000.4900.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

However, the role of overexpressed PDPK F(A) in tumor cell differentiation remains unknown and needs to be established. In this report, the authors explore the potential role of PDPK F(A) in cellular differentiation by investigating the effects of partial inhibition of this kinase on erythroid differentiation of chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562). METHODS: PDPK F(A) antisense expression vector and its specific antibody were developed successfully. Two stable, transfected antisense clones of human myeloid leukemia cells were subcloned that expressed approximately 80% and approximately 50% of the total PDPK F(A) existing in control-transfected clones, as determined by both immunoprecipitate activity assay and immunoblot analysis. In sharp contrast, the PDPK F(A) antisense clones expressed no significant suppression of any other related PDPK members' expression, demonstrating the specificity of these two antisense clones. RESULTS: The antisense clones proportionally induced spontaneous erythroid differentiation up to approximately 30% of the total K562 cells. Moreover, antisense suppression of PDPK F(A) expression appeared to potentiate sodium butyrate/hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells to a more complete stage compared with the control. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that specific antisense suppression of overexpressed PDPK F(A) in human myeloid leukemia cells is sufficient to potentiate both spontaneous and drug-induced erythroid differentiation, indicating that PDPK F(A) is an important negative regulator in controlling the erythroid differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells.","['Hsu, C P', 'Yang, C C', 'Yang, S D']","['Hsu CP', 'Yang CC', 'Yang SD']","['Department of Life Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antisense Elements (Genetics))', '0 (Butyrates)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Proline-Directed Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Antisense Elements (Genetics)/genetics/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proline-Directed Protein Kinases', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,2000/08/30 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/30 11:00'],"['2000/08/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(20000901)89:5<1004::AID-CNCR9>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Sep 1;89(5):1004-11.,,,,,,,,,,,

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) composes 51% of malignant tumors and 16% of all salivary gland neoplasms in pediatrics. Prognostic factors in MEC in pediatric patients have not been well defined. Histopathologic features, clinical outcomes and proliferation markers in 26 pediatric patients (median age 11 years; 19F:7M) with salivary gland MECs were evaluated retrospectively. MEC histocytologic grading used a three-tiered system. Proliferation was assessed by determining the percentage of tumor cells immunoreactive for PCNA and Ki-67. Tumor site was 16 parotid, eight submandibular, one base of tongue and one maxillary lip. Median tumor size was 2.5 cm (range 1.5-5 cm). MEC grade was nine low grade (LG), 15 intermediate grade (IG) and two high grade (HG). Metastatic disease and capsular invasion occurred in five cases, while perineural invasion was noted in three cases. Mean percentage of tumor cells immunoreactive for proliferation markers is as follows: PCNA: LG 9%, IG 17%, HG 32%; and Ki-67: LG 7%, IG 12%, HG 26%. Treatment was surgical in 21 cases, and surgery with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in five cases. Two patients with high grade MECs died of disease (21, 44 months). Twenty-four patients had no evidence of disease at a median follow-up of 104 months (range 30-298 months). MECs were second malignancies in two children with prior radiotherapy and chemotherapy for leukemia and histiocytosis. Low and intermediate grade salivary gland MECS in a pediatric population may have a favorable outcome when compared with high grade MECs. Proliferation markers appear to be linked to histocytologic MEC grade and may provide information regarding biologic behavior of salivary gland MECs in children and adolescents.","['Hicks, J', 'Flaitz, C']","['Hicks J', 'Flaitz C']","[""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, MC1-2261, 6621 Fannin Street, Houston, TX 77030-2399, USA. mjhicks@texaschildrenhospital.org""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oral Oncol,Oral oncology,9709118,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid/*chemistry/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Ki-67 Antigen/chemistry', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",,2000/08/30 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/30 11:00'],"['2000/08/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/30 11:00 [entrez]']","['S1368-8375(00)00033-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s1368-8375(00)00033-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Oral Oncol. 2000 Sep;36(5):454-60. doi: 10.1016/s1368-8375(00)00033-6.,,,,,,,,,,,

It is usually characterised by lytic bone lesions located in the metaphysis of long bones or in the axial skeleton. The occurrence of bone lesions reflects a progression of the disease affecting the prognosis that is related to lymphoma histologic features and staging. Bone lesions may occur in some lymphoproliferative disorders such as LLC or Waldenstrom's disease, or in myeloproliferative disorders. They may reflect a progression to a more aggressive disorder with a worse prognosis. The treatment of hematologic malignancies presenting with bone lesions and/or hypercalcemia is similar to the treatment of the systemic disease. In primary lymphomas of bone presenting with an isolated bone lesion, local treatment with radiation therapy and/or surgical ablation is required, and adjuvant chemotherapy may improve the prognosis of these located lymphomas. Glucocorticoid therapy and bisphosphonates are effective in treating associated hypercalcemia. Except for myeloma and ATL, the underlying mechanisms responsible for bone involvement in hematologic malignancies remain poorly understood.

Lymphocytes seem to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disorder. They are rich in, among others, beta-2Microglobulin (beta 2M)--a low molecular weight protein located extracellularly and associated with class 1 antigens of the major histocompatibility complex. beta-2M is considered as a marker for disease activity in immune disorders. Its precise role in pathology remains still unknown, but there is evidence that it may be involved in lymphocyte activation. Cladribine (2-chloro-2-deoxyadenosine, 2-CDA) is a potent lymphocytotoxic agent under investigation in the treatment in MS patients, earlier used in hairy-cell-leukemia therapy. Previous studies in MS populations showed beta 2-microglobulin to be moderately increased. Suspecting that beta 2M levels might indicate inflammatory events in CNS we determined CSF-beta 2M and serum beta 2M concentration in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (n = 15) before and after cladribine treatment as well as in a control group diagnosed as tension type headache (n = 10). There was a significant decrease in the CSF and sera beta 2M level in MS patients after cladribine treatment, associated with a slight but significant clinical improvement measured by Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Scale. We conclude that beta 2M is a sensitive marker of the CDA influence on the immune system in MS patients; however, increase in CSF and sera beta 2M is not specific as there was no statistically significant difference between MS and control patients.","['Niezgoda, A', 'Losy, J']","['Niezgoda A', 'Losy J']",['Zakladu Neuroimmunologii Klinicznej Katedry i Kliniki Neurologii AM w Poznaniu.'],['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Neurol Neurochir Pol,Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,0101265,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy', '*beta 2-Microglobulin/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism']",,2000/08/30 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/08/30 11:00'],"['2000/08/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/30 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neurol Neurochir Pol. 2000 Mar-Apr;34(2):281-7.,,,Wplyw 2-chlorodeoksyadenozyny (kladrybiny) na stezenie beta 2-mikroglobuliny w plynie mozgowo-rdzeniowym i surowicy u chorych ze stwardnieniem rozsianym.,,,,,,,,

We show here that the defect in activation of PI-3k/Akt by BCR/ABL DeltaSH2 mutant (SH2 domain deleted) and of STAT5 by BCR/ABL DeltaSH3+DeltaSH2 mutant (SH3 and SH2 domains deleted) is not permanent and both Akt and STAT5 could be 're-activated' by in vitro culture. This phenomenon was responsible for increased resistance to apoptosis, growth factor-independent proliferation and leukemogenesis in SCID mice. Incubation of cells with BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 abrogated the 're-activation' of Akt or STAT5 by BCR/ABL SH3+SH2 mutants in some clones, in the others Akt and STAT5 activation became independent on BCR/ABL kinase activity. The immediate upstream activators of Akt and STAT5 such as PI-3k and Jak-2 were also activated. In addition, the common beta subunit of IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor was tyrosine phosphorylated in the clones in which 're-activation' was dependent on the BCR/ABL kinase activity. These results suggested that 're-activation' of Akt and STAT5, in the absence of functional BCR/ABL SH3+SH2 domains, may be achieved by two different mechanisms: (i) BCR/ABL kinase-dependent activation of alternative pathway(s) and (ii) additional genetic changes stimulating Akt and STAT5 independently of BCR/ABL.

During this process there was a dramatic increase in the mitochondrial levels of the apoptosis effector, Bak, due to the stabilization of bak mRNA, which was correlated with the sensitization of HCW-2 cells to respond to the apoptotic effect of staurosporine (STS). Treatment of PMA-differentiated, but not undifferentiated, HCW-2 cells induced processing of Bid, substantial efflux of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. The biological significance of the increased mitochondrial Bak in differentiated HCW-2 cells was supported by the finding that transient transfection of a bak cDNA into HCW-2 cells conferred sensitivity to STS-triggered apoptosis, as determined by pro-caspase-3 processing, cytochrome c efflux and DNA fragmentation.

However, less is known on its role in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We thus decided to assess its effectiveness on a panel of 7 patients with refractory or relapsed CLL. Mild (5 patients) or severe (1 patient) adverse reactions were observed during the first hours of Rituximab infusion, almost exclusively at the first course. Symptoms rapidly subsided with temporary drug withdrawal and low dose steroids. All patients could receive the whole scheduled treatment. A striking reduction of peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte counts was observed in all patients (median 93%; range 57-99%). However, Rituximab was poorly effective towards nodal and splenic disease. Patients required additional treatment after a median time of 70 d (range: 20-180 d). Our data show that Rituximab delivery in CLL patients is feasible and has an acceptable toxicity, although it probably does not represent an ideal treatment option when delivered using schedules originally designed for FCL patients. However, responses observed at PB level suggest that Rituximab has an activity which is not negligible and deserves further investigation in CLL.

Thus, the diagnosis and treatment of neoplastic meningitis present challenges for the clinical oncologist. The diagnosis of neoplastic meningitis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid to determine cell count and cytology, and analysis of neuroimaging studies for evidence of leptomeningeal or cranial nerve enhancement. Once diagnosed, conventional treatment regimens may include radiotherapy combined with systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy, often with the antimetabolites cytarabine and/or methotrexate. However, the prognosis for neoplastic meningitis secondary to an underlying solid tumor or recurrent leukemia is poor with conventional treatment regimens. Therefore, novel agents for intrathecal administration, including DepoCyttrade mark, mafosfamide, and topotecan, or novel therapeutic approaches, including conjugated monoclonal antibodies and immunotoxins or gene therapy, are currently under investigation. Such new agents and therapeutic approaches will facilitate the development of effective treatment strategies and will ultimately improve the outcome for patients with this devastating disease.

Apoptosis induced by cPrG * HCl was strongly suppressed when a cell-permeable weak base, imidazole, was present, indicating that cytosol acidification introduced by cPrG * HCl triggered caspase activation, leading to apoptosis. Concomitantly, cell differentiation into monocyte was also induced by cPrG * HCl both morphologically and functionally. However, the cPrG * HCl-induced differentiation was not suppressed by addition of imidazole, indicating that the differentiation process is unrelated to cytosol acidification. Further, the differentiation induced by cPrG * HCl was blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (lavendustin A and HMA) but unaffected by the inhibitors of A-kinase (H-89) or C-kinase (H-7). Taken together, these findings suggest that cPrG * HCl, through apoptosis and differentiation induction, may be useful in leukemia treatment.","['Yamamoto, D', 'Uemura, Y', 'Tanaka, K', 'Nakai, K', 'Yamamoto, C', 'Takemoto, H', 'Kamata, K', 'Hirata, H', 'Hioki, K']","['Yamamoto D', 'Uemura Y', 'Tanaka K', 'Nakai K', 'Yamamoto C', 'Takemoto H', 'Kamata K', 'Hirata H', 'Hioki K']","['Department of Surgery II, Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi, Osaka, Japan. yammamotd@takii.kmu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antiporters)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Faslg protein, rat)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (hydrogen-chloride symporter)', '86797-91-3 (cycloprodigiosin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Antiporters/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology']",,2000/08/30 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/30 11:00'],"['2000/08/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/30 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0215(20001001)88:1<121::AID-IJC19>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(20001001)88:1<121::aid-ijc19>3.0.co;2-c [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Oct 1;88(1):121-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(20001001)88:1<121::aid-ijc19>3.0.co;2-c.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Here, we address these issues and describe an entirely humanized immune receptor for use in adoptive immunotherapy of colorectal carcinoma. The receptor consists of a single-chain antibody (scFv) binding domain specific for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), the IgG hinge and CH2/CH3 (Fc) joining region, and the transmembrane and intracellular CD3 zeta signaling chain. To express the receptor in peripheral blood T cells, both GALV envelope and MuLV 4070A pseudotyped retrovirus turned out to be equally efficient, with transduction efficiencies of about 5% to 40%, depending on the lymphocyte donor. Furthermore, receptor-grafted T cells could be 2- to 6-fold enriched by magnetic activated cell sorting, utilizing an antibody directed to the extracellular IgG domain of the receptor. Upon co-culture with CEA(+) tumor cells, receptor-grafted T cells are specifically and efficiently activated to cytolysis and IFN-gamma secretion, demonstrating their feasibility for the adoptive immunotherapy of CEA(+) carcinomas.","['Hombach, A', 'Schneider, C', 'Sent, D', 'Koch, D', 'Willemsen, R A', 'Diehl, V', 'Kruis, W', 'Bolhuis, R L', 'Pohl, C', 'Abken, H']","['Hombach A', 'Schneider C', 'Sent D', 'Koch D', 'Willemsen RA', 'Diehl V', 'Kruis W', 'Bolhuis RL', 'Pohl C', 'Abken H']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Labor Tumorgenetik, Universitat zu Koln, Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (antigen T cell receptor, zeta chain)', '0 (carcinoembryonic antigen binding protein, human)']",IM,,"['Antibody Specificity', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*immunology/therapy', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/genetics/immunology', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/virology']",,2000/08/30 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/30 11:00'],"['2000/08/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0215(20001001)88:1<115::AID-IJC18>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Oct 1;88(1):115-20.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

This study reports that CML cells effectively inhibit the baseline and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced NK cell cytotoxicity against a CML cell-derived line (K562). A sizable fraction of NK cells subsequently acquired features characteristic of programmed cell death/apoptosis. The CML cell-mediated inhibition of NK cells required triggering of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-mediated formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and was prevented by catalase, a scavenger of ROS, and by histamine, acting via H(2)-receptor-mediated inhibition of ROS production in CML cells. In contrast, nonmalignant neutrophilic granulocytes inhibited NK cells via ROS production without the requirement of exogenous NADPH oxidase-triggering stimuli. We propose that paracrine production of ROS may contribute to the dysfunction of NK cells in CML and that histamine may serve as an autocrine inhibitor of ROS formation in leukemic granulocytes.

This oncogenic event causes a deregulation of apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Although the molecular mechanisms protecting from apoptosis in CML cells are well characterized, the cell cycle regulatory event is poorly understood. An inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases, p27, plays a central role in the regulation of growth factor dependent proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Therefore, we have analyzed the influence of Bcr-Abl in the regulation of p27 expression in various hematopoietic cell systems. An active Bcr-Abl kinase causes down-regulation of p27 expression in murine Ba/F3 cells and human M07 cells. Bcr-Abl blocks up-regulation of p27 after growth factor withdrawal and serum reduction. In addition, p27 induction by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is completely blocked in Bcr-Abl positive M07/p210 cells. This deregulation is directly mediated by the activity of the Bcr-Abl kinase. A Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor completely abolishes p27 down-regulation by Bcr-Abl in both Ba/F3 cells transfected either with a constitutively active Bcr-Abl or with a temperature sensitive mutant. The down-regulation of p27 by Bcr-Abl depends on proteasomal degradation and can be blocked by lactacystin. Overexpression of wild-type p27 partially antagonizes Bcr-Abl-induced proliferation in Ba/F3 cells. We conclude that Bcr-Abl promotes cell cycle progression and activation of cyclin-dependent kinases by interfering with the regulation of the cell cycle inhibitory protein p27.

Stromal cell coculture was shown to sustain the proliferation of B-lineage leukemic cells and to reduce leukemic cell apoptosis when exposed to Ara-C or VP-16. Direct contact with stromal cells was essential for the protection of leukemic cells during chemotherapy, whereas soluble factors had negligible effect. Specifically, signaling mediated through interaction with the stromal cell adhesion molecule VCAM-1 was required to maintain the maximum viability of leukemic cells during Ara-C and VP-16 exposure. In contrast, the interaction of leukemic cells with fibronectin did not confer significant resistance to either chemotherapeutic agent. These observations suggest a role for the bone marrow microenvironment in modulating the response of B-lineage leukemic cells to Ara-C or VP-16, and they indicate specific molecular interactions that may be important in determining the sensitivity of leukemic cells to treatment.

The granule secretory pathway is one of the mechanisms by which these cells exert their cellular cytotoxicity. Recently, it has been reported that GrB and PFN are also present in circulating hemopoietic CD34(+) progenitor cells mobilized by chemotherapy and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, whereas these proteins are undetected in steady-state peripheral CD34(+) cells. In this study, we hypothesized that anticancer agents may increase GrB and PFN expression in immature myeloid leukemic cells and that these treated leukemic cells become cellular effectors through a granule-dependent mechanism. Our results show that KG1a, HEL, and TF-1 CD34(+) acute myeloblastic leukemia cells expressed both GrB and PFN. Moreover, ionizing radiation, aracytine, and etoposide not only increase GrB and PFN expression but also conferred potent cellular cytotoxicity to these cells toward various cellular targets. Cellular cytotoxicity required cell-cell contact, was not influenced by anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha or anti-Fas blocking antibodies, and was abrogated by GrB inhibitors or antisense. These results suggest that, when exposed to genotoxic agents, immature leukemic cells acquire potent GrB- and PFN-dependent cellular cytotoxicity that can be potentially directed against normal residual myeloid progenitors or immune effectors.

It was discovered as a fusion with the E2A gene after chromosomal translocations in a subset of acute leukemias. The resulting E2a-Pbx1 chimeric proteins display potent oncogenic properties that appear to require dimerization with Hox DNA binding partners. To define molecular pathways that may be impacted by E2a-Pbx1, a genetic screen consisting of neonatal retroviral infection was used to identify genes that accelerate development of T-cell tumors in E2A-PBX1 transgenic mice. Retroviral insertions in the Notch1 gene were observed in 88% of tumors arising with a shortened latency. Among these, approximately half created a Notch(IC) allele, encoding the intracellular, signaling portion of Notch1, suggesting a synergistic interaction between the Notch and E2a-Pbx1 pathways in oncogenesis. The remaining proviral insertions involving Notch1 occurred in a more 3' exon, resulting in truncating mutations that deleted the carboxy-terminal region of Notch1 containing negative regulatory sequences (Notch1(DeltaC)). In contrast to Notch(IC), forced expression of Notch1(DeltaC) in transgenic mice did not perturb thymocyte growth or differentiation. However, mice transgenic for both the E2A-PBX1 and Notch1(DeltaC) genes displayed a substantially shortened latency for tumor development compared with E2A-PBX1 single transgenic mice. These studies reveal a novel mechanism for oncogenic activation of Notch1 and demonstrate a collaborative relationship between 2 cellular oncogenes that also contribute to cell fate determination during embryonic development.

However, the underlying mechanism of this synergism of apoptosis prevention is largely unknown. The present study examined the expression of some Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Mcl-1, and Bax, in response to cytokine stimulation in TF-1 and JYTF-1 cells in which SCF costimulation is differentially required for optimal proliferation. The results revealed that only the expression of Mcl-1 highly correlated with the antiapoptotic activity of interleukin-5 (IL-5) and the synergistic effect of SCF. In TF-1 cells, the defect of IL-5 in apoptosis suppression and Mcl-1 induction was associated with the incapability to highly phosphorylate Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Akt/PKB, whereas SCF costimulation restored the potent phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt/PKB, but not STAT5. The importance of MAPK and Akt/PKB signaling pathways in regulating the expression of Mcl-1 and cell survival was further supported by the observation that inhibition of MEK by PD98059 or phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) by LY294002 independently resulted in the reduction of Mcl-1 expression and loss of cell viability. Therefore, the data suggest that Mcl-1 is a common antiapoptotic target of both early-stage cytokine SCF and late-stage cytokine IL-5. Both MEK/MAPK and PI-3K/Akt signaling pathways are essential in the regulation of Mcl-1 expression and apoptosis prevention.

As yet no gene knockout mice have been engineered, and so there is little evidence to show that loss of Mcl-1 expression is sufficient to trigger apoptosis. U937 cells constitutively express the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2; but during differentiation, in response to the phorbol ester PMA (phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate), Mcl-1 is transiently induced. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the functional role played by Mcl-1 in this differentiation program. Mcl-1 expression was specifically disrupted by chimeric methylphosphonate/phosphodiester antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to just 5% of control levels. The depletion of Mcl-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was both rapid and specific, as indicated by the use of control oligodeoxynucleotides and analysis of the expression of other BCL2 family members and PMA-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Specific depletion of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein, in the absence of changes in cellular levels of Bcl-2, results in a rapid entry into apoptosis. Levels of the proapoptotic protein Bax remained unchanged during differentiation, while Bak expression doubled within 24 hours. Apoptosis was detected within 4 hours of Mcl-1 antisense treatment by a variety of parameters including a novel live cell imaging technique allowing correlation of antisense treatment and apoptosis in individual cells. The induction of Mcl-1 is required to prevent apoptosis during differentiation of U937 cells, and the constitutive expression of Bcl-2 is unable to compensate for the loss of Mcl-1.

Adiponectin suppressed colony formation from colony-forming units (CFU)-granulocyte-macrophage, CFU-macrophage, and CFU-granulocyte, whereas it had no effect on that of burst-forming units-erythroid or mixed erythroid-myeloid CFU. In addition, adiponectin inhibited proliferation of 4 of 9 myeloid cell lines but did not suppress proliferation of erythroid or lymphoid cell lines except for one cell line. These results suggest that adiponectin predominantly inhibits proliferation of myelomonocytic lineage cells. At least one mechanism of the growth inhibition is induction of apoptosis because treatment of acute myelomonocytic leukemia lines with adiponectin induced the appearance of subdiploid peaks and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Aside from inhibiting growth of myelomonocytic progenitors, adiponectin suppressed mature macrophage functions. Treatment of cultured macrophages with adiponectin significantly inhibited their phagocytic activity and their lipopolysaccharide-induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha. Suppression of phagocytosis by adiponectin is mediated by one of the complement C1q receptors, C1qRp, because this function was completely abrogated by the addition of an anti-C1qRp monoclonal antibody. These observations suggest that adiponectin is an important negative regulator in hematopoiesis and immune systems and raise the possibility that it may be involved in ending inflammatory responses through its inhibitory functions.

There was a highly significant difference in CR rates between weekly (69 of 71; 97%) and biweekly (60 of 73; 82%) PEG-Asp dosing (P =.003). Grade 3 or 4 infectious toxicity was common (50%), but only 4 pts died of sepsis during induction. Other toxicities were infrequent and hypersensitivity was rare (6 of 144; 4%).

Patients with ALL in first relapse receiving weekly PEG-Asp had a higher rate of second remission compared with biweekly dosing. Low levels of asparaginase were associated with high antibody titers. Increased asparaginase levels may correlate with an improved CR rate. The use of intensive PEG-Asp should be explored further in the treatment of ALL.

Treatment with amphotericin B was started and antimicrobial treatment was continued with liposomal amphotericin B because of an increase in creatinine later. The fever persisted and the patient suddenly developed progressive neurological symptoms. CT scan of the head suggested cerebral infarction and angiography of the extra- and intracranial arteries showed signs of vasculitis. Six days after the onset of neurological symptoms cerebral death was diagnosed. Autopsy revealed non-septate, irregularly branched hyphae in various histologic sections including brain. Absidia corymbifera could be isolated from lung tissue confirming the diagnosis of disseminated mucormycosis. In this case, angiographic findings suggested severe cerebral vasculitis which was in fact caused by thromboembolic dissemination of fungal hyphae.

However, the mechanism for its therapeutic effect is not clearly understood yet. In this study, we have observed an interesting effect of hydroxyurea on tumor cells: an induction of senescence-like changes. Human erythroleukemia K562 cells, when treated with hydroxyurea for 7 days or more, underwent a change into phenotypically senescent cells together with a reduction of hemoglobin generation, a differentiation marker. The hydroxyurea-treated cells showed positive senescence associated-beta-galactosidase staining, a senescence index, and the accumulation of cdk (cyclin dependent kinase) inhibitors, such as p16INK4a, p21Waf1, and p27Kip1, implicated in cellular senescence. Nonetheless, these changes were not accompanied by DNA fragmentation. Taken together, we summarize that the long-term treatment of cancer cells with hydroxyurea can induce cellular senescence different from differentiation or programmed cell death.","['Park, J I', 'Jeong, J S', 'Han, J Y', 'Kim, D I', 'Gao, Y H', 'Park, S C', 'Rodgers, G P', 'Kim, I H']","['Park JI', 'Jeong JS', 'Han JY', 'Kim DI', 'Gao YH', 'Park SC', 'Rodgers GP', 'Kim IH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Pusan, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cellular Senescence/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'beta-Galactosidase/analysis']",,2000/08/29 11:00,2000/09/09 11:01,['2000/08/29 11:00'],"['2000/08/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/09 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/29 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2000 Aug;126(8):455-60.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 72 MRI examinations obtained from 26 children with bone pain selected from a group of 121 children with ALL were evaluated retrospectively. The area of the AON was determined by computer assisted planimetry. Follow-up examinations after 2-5 years were considered. RESULTS: 10/121 (8.3%) of the children had symptomatic AON, the number of lesions varied between 1 and 24 per child. 62/66 lesions were localized within the lower extremities. 58% of the AON were positioned in the epiphysis and 42% in the meta- and diaphysis. The mean area of AON was 7.6 cm2 with a range of 0.5 to 50 cm2. Follow-up examinations revealed a regression in 19 AON, no change in 43 and a progression in 4 lesions. AON within the epiphysis with joint involvement or lesions greater than 9 cm2 more frequently showed a progression of AON with final joint destruction. An elevated risk for AON was seen in children older than 10 years and in children with intensified chemotherapy due to high-risk ALL. CONCLUSION: AON is a common complication in ALL-children under chemotherapy. Most frequently, the course is benign but large AON with joint involvement have an elevated risk for progression of AON with final joint destruction.","['Engelbrecht, V', 'Scherer, A', 'Bruder, M', 'Korholz, D', 'Modder, U']","['Engelbrecht V', 'Scherer A', 'Bruder M', 'Korholz D', 'Modder U']","['Institut fur Diagnostische Radiologie, Universitatskinderklinik Heinrich Heine Universitat Dusseldorf. engelbre@uni-duesseldorf.de']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Rofo,RoFo : Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Rontgenstrahlen und der Nuklearmedizin,7507497,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Infant', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/chemically induced/complications/*diagnosis', 'Pain/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,2000/08/29 11:00,2000/09/09 11:01,['2000/08/29 11:00'],"['2000/08/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/09 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/29 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2000-335 [doi]'],ppublish,Rofo. 2000 Apr;172(4):336-41. doi: 10.1055/s-2000-335.,,,Kernspintomographie von aseptischen Osteonekrosen bei Kindern und Jugendlichen mit einer akuten lymphoblastischen Leukamie.,,,,,,,,

NPML estimates have been compared to other proposed solutions (Maximum Likelihood via Monte Carlo Scoring, Hierarchical Bayesian models) using real examples. Overall, the NPML autoregressive estimates (with weighted term) were closer to the Bayesian estimates. The exchangeable NPML model ranked immediately after, even if it implied a greater shrinkage, while the truncated auto-Poisson showed inadequate for disease mapping. The coefficients of the autoregressive term for the different mixtures have clear interpretations: in the breast cancer example, the larger cities in the region showed high rates and very low correlation with the neighbouring areas, while the less populated rural areas with low rates were strongly positively correlated each other. This pattern is expected since breast cancer is strongly correlated with parity and age at first birth, and the female population of the rural areas experienced a decline in fertility much later than those living in the larger cities. The leukemia example highlighted the failure of the Poisson-Gamma model and other general overdispersion tests to detect high risk areas under specific conditions. The NPML approach in Aitkin is very general, simple and flexible. However the user should be warned against the possibility of local maxima and the difficulty in detecting the optimal number of components.

METHODS: PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells were heat-shocked and then treated with or without diethyl-maleate, etoposide, cycloheximide, or 3 Gray irradiation. Percent apoptosis was assessed by propidium iodide DNA incorporation. Protein was also extracted for analysis by SDS-PAGE Western blotting. RESULTS: Western blotting confirmed an increase in HSP 27 and 72. These cells were resistant to both chemical- and radiation-induced apoptosis. Cycloheximide and specific oligonucleotides to HSP 72 blocked the increased expression of HSP 72 and the resistance to apoptosis. Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) expression were increased in a time-dependent manner after heat shock. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that HSP expression, specifically HSP 72, inhibits apoptosis in prostate tumor cell lines, which may be mediated by the production of survival factors.","['Gibbons, N B', 'Watson, R W', 'Coffey, R N', 'Brady, H P', 'Fitzpatrick, J M']","['Gibbons NB', 'Watson RW', 'Coffey RN', 'Brady HP', 'Fitzpatrick JM']","['Department of Surgery, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Conway Institute of Biomedicine and Biomolecular Research, University College Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPB1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Maleates)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'G81WQB56OL (diethyl maleate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/biosynthesis', 'Glutathione Transferase/biosynthesis', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Maleates/pharmacology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Radiation Tolerance/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2000/08/29 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/29 11:00'],"['2000/08/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0045(20000915)45:1<58::AID-PROS7>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0045(20000915)45:1<58::aid-pros7>3.0.co;2-# [doi]']",ppublish,Prostate. 2000 Sep 15;45(1):58-65. doi: 10.1002/1097-0045(20000915)45:1<58::aid-pros7>3.0.co;2-#.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

The karyotypes of ATLL are very complex in both number and structure, although no specific karyotype abnormalities have been identified. HTLV-I is thought to integrate its provirus into random sites in host chromosomal DNA and induces chromosomal instability. The BUB gene is a component of the mitotic checkpoint in budding yeast. Recently, human homologues of the BUB were identified and mutant alleles of hBUB1 and hBUBR1 were detected in two colorectal tumor cell lines, which showed microsatellite instability (MIN). In vitro, BUB proteins form a complex of monomers. These proteins interact with the human MAD1 gene product, a target of the HTLV-1 tax oncogene. We examined the role of checkpoint gene in the chromosomal abnormalities of ATLL by investigating mutations of hBUB1 and hBUBR1, and MIN of replication errors of BAX, insulin-like growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta type II. We analyzed ten cases with ATLL and eight B-cell lymphomas (five diffuse large cell lymphomas, three follicular lymphomas). Complex chromosomal abnormalities were detected in ATLL, while B-cell lymphomas showed only simple or minimal chromosomal abnormalities. Significant mutations/deletion of hBUB1 or hBUBR1 were detected in four of ten cases with ATLL, including two heterozygous point mutations, one homozygous point mutation, and one with a 47 bp deletion. In contrast, only one of eight B-cell lymphomas showed nonsense mutation of hBUBR1. None of the ATLL and B-cell lymphomas showed MIN. In the multistage process of leukemogenesis of ATLL, our findings indicate that mutations of mitotic checkpoint genes may play an important role in the induction of complex chromosomal abnormalities.","['Ohshima, K', 'Haraoka, S', 'Yoshioka, S', 'Hamasaki, M', 'Fujiki, T', 'Suzumiya, J', 'Kawasaki, C', 'Kanda, M', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Ohshima K', 'Haraoka S', 'Yoshioka S', 'Hamasaki M', 'Fujiki T', 'Suzumiya J', 'Kawasaki C', 'Kanda M', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Nanakuma 7-45-1, Jonan-ku, 814-01, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptor, IGF Type 2)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BUB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bub1 spindle checkpoint protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinases/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Receptor, IGF Type 2/genetics', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2000/08/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/29 11:00'],"['2000/08/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0304383500005127 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(00)00512-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2000 Oct 1;158(2):141-50. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(00)00512-7.,,,,,,,,,,,

In combination with theanine, IDA (0.25 mg/kg per day x4 days, a dose that does not show antitumor activity) had significant antitumor activity in P388-bearing mice. The IDA concentration in the tumors in the theanine plus IDA group increased to twice the level in the IDA alone group. Furthermore, the decrease in tumor weight caused by IDA at 1.0 mg/kg per day x4 days (at this dose IDA exhibits antitumor activity) was significantly amplified by theanine. The numbers of leukocyte and bone marrow cells decreased significantly on IDA injection. Theanine significantly reversed these changes. These results suggest that theanine selectively moderates the IDA-induced toxicities. Until recently, the antitumor activity and related toxicities of this chemotherapeutic agent in leukemia could not be distinguished.

After the transfusion of apheresis platelets from a group O donor, back pain, hemoglobinuria, and hemoglobinemia developed, and her Hb dropped by 2.3 g per dL, despite the transfusion of 2 units of RBCs. RESULTS: Investigation revealed acute intravascular hemolysis with a positive DAT due to anti-A(1) on her RBCs. The donor's titer of anti-A(1) was greater than 16,000.

This treatment approach has been associated with myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia. Because macrocytosis and thrombocytopenia are distinctive features of myelodysplasia, the authors evaluated a cohort of patients treated for ESFT to determine the degree and duration of macrocytosis and thrombocytopenia and their relation with the development of therapy-related hematologic malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 73 patients with ESFT treated on two consecutive protocols (EW92 and EW87). Both chemotherapy regimens incorporated the same agents but differed in cumulative drug dose, dose per course, and the use of G-CSF. Platelet counts and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of erythrocytes were determined at diagnosis and during follow-up visits after completion of treatment. RESULTS: Patients in the EW92 group had significantly greater MCVs after treatment than did the less intensively treated EW87 group. These changes persisted throughout the 40-month observation period. Patients in the EW92 group also had lesser mean platelet counts after treatment than those in the EW87 group. MCV differences (from baseline) were inversely related to platelet counts. The cumulative incidence of treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia was 7.8%+/-4.7% at 4 years in the EW92 group and zero in the EW87 group. CONCLUSION: Patients treated for ESFT with intensive chemotherapy that includes large doses of alkylators, topoisomerase II inhibitors, and G-CSF characteristically have persistently elevated MCVs and decreased platelet counts after completion of therapy. These hematologic abnormalities may represent stem cell damage, predisposing patients to myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia, but further study is needed to establish this relation.","['Rodriguez-Galindo, C', 'Poquette, C A', 'Marina, N M', 'Head, D R', 'Cain, A', 'Meyer, W H', 'Santana, V M', 'Pappo, A S']","['Rodriguez-Galindo C', 'Poquette CA', 'Marina NM', 'Head DR', 'Cain A', 'Meyer WH', 'Santana VM', 'Pappo AS']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Jul-Aug;22(4):302-5.

Although the physiological significance of this phenomenon is not well understood, it has been exploited to a great extent in the therapy of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. In spite of its clinical importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying GC-induced apoptosis and -clinically even more important resistance to this phenomenon are not known. This review summarizes efforts from our and other laboratories addressing these issues in human lymphoblastic leukemia, with particular emphasis on the CCRF-CEM childhood T-cell leukemia model. These studies have shed some light on the downstream execution phase of GC-induced apoptosis but the critical upstream gene regulatory events have remained a mystery. Very recent DNA chip-based expression profile analyses in our laboratory along with data from the literature have, however, suggested that GC receptor auto-upregulation in sensitive target cells might be the critical event leading to persistent downregulation of central metabolic pathways which is incompatible with cell survival. The validity of this hypothesis and its possible clinical implications are currently being investigated in our laboratory.","['Kofler, R']",['Kofler R'],"['Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, University of Innsbruck Medical School, Austria. reinhard.kofler@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Histochem Cell Biol,Histochemistry and cell biology,9506663,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",80,2000/08/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/26 11:00'],"['2000/08/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004180000165 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem Cell Biol. 2000 Jul;114(1):1-7. doi: 10.1007/s004180000165.,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the toxicity of fluoride on human leukemia (HL-60) cells was investigated and the involvement of caspase-3 was also studied. Fluoride induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Annexin staining and DNA ladder formation on agarose gel electrophoresis further revealed that HL-60 cells underwent apoptosis on exposure to 2-5 mM fluoride. Western blotting using polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody and mouse anti-human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) monoclonal antibody was performed to investigate caspase-3 and PARP activity. Fluoride led to the activation of caspase-3 which was evident by the loss of the 32 kDa precursor and appearance of the 17 kDa subunit. Furthermore, intact 116 kDa PARP was cleaved by fluoride treatment as shown by the appearance of a cleaved 89 kDa fragment. The results clearly suggest that fluoride causes cell death in HL-60 cells by causing the activation of caspase-3 which in turn cleaves PARP leading to DNA damage and ultimately cell death.","['Anuradha, C D', 'Kanno, S', 'Hirano, S']","['Anuradha CD', 'Kanno S', 'Hirano S']","['Regional Environment Division, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Cariostatic Agents)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q80VPU408O (Fluorides)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cariostatic Agents/*toxicity', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fluorides/*toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism']",,2000/08/26 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/08/26 11:00'],"['2000/08/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002040000132 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2000 Jul;74(4-5):226-30. doi: 10.1007/s002040000132.,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS: Male Wistar rats were used for the in-vivo and ex-vivo studies. In-vitro studies were performed using human leukemia peripheral blood monocyte cells (THP-1 cells) grown in continuous culture. TREATMENT: Rats were given access to either nicotine (5 or 100 microg/mL) or sulphasalazine (375 microg/mL) in their drinking water for 10 or 2 days respectively before and 3 days after TNBS administration. THP-1 cells were treated with nicotine (10(-14) to 10(-11) M) for 2 h before and after stimulation with 3 microg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: Inflammation in the TNBS model was assessed by measuring the tissue myeloperoxidase activity, leukotriene B4 concentration, inducible nitric oxide protein expression, the ex-vivo production of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), macroscopic damage score, plasma corticosterone levels and by a qualitative histological evolution. The effect of nicotine on TNFalpha production in LPS stimulated THP-1 monocyte cells in-vitro was also determined. Statistical comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney U-test for the macroscopic damage score and an ANOVA for all other parameters. RESULTS: TNBS treated rats given access to 100 microg/mL nicotine in their drinking water had a marked reduction in several of the markers of inflammation compared to control TNBS treated rats, but a greater reduction was found at 5 microg/mL nicotine or 375 microg/mL sulphasalazine, the latter producing comparable reductions in inflammation to the low dose nicotine. Nicotine also caused a significant reduction in TNFalpha release from THP-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine reduced inflammation in the TNBS model of colonic damage confirming the use of nicotine in IBD although the choice of dose requires further investigation. The mechanism of action of nicotine does not involve increased corticosterone levels, but may be a consequence of a reduction in TNFalpha or leukotriene B4 production.","['Sykes, A P', 'Brampton, C', 'Klee, S', 'Chander, C L', 'Whelan, C', 'Parsons, M E']","['Sykes AP', 'Brampton C', 'Klee S', 'Chander CL', 'Whelan C', 'Parsons ME']","['Biosciences Department, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK. a.p.sykes@herts.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

The NUP98 gene on chromosome band 11p15 is involved in several different chromosomal aberrations that have been associated with t-MDS/AML. We have cloned the translocation breakpoints from two cases of t-MDS harboring a t(11;20)(p15;q11). Sequence analysis of the breakpoints from both cases revealed almost perfectly balanced translocations between NUP98 and TOP1. There were no known recombinogenic sequences identified at or near the breakpoints. However, four bp microduplications present at the translocation crossover points suggested that these translocations may have been initiated by 4 bp staggered double-stranded DNA breaks, which are known to be associated with the action of topoisomerase II. Given the history of patient exposure to topoisomerase II poisons, and the fact that these drugs stabilize staggered breaks with a 4 bp overhang, it seems possible that drug-induced topoisomerase II cleavage and subunit exchange was involved in these translocations. These results suggest that NUP98 is a recurrent target for therapy-related malignancies induced by multiagent chemotherapy, and suggest a role for DNA topoisomerase II poisons in the generation of these translocations.

The best-characterised store-operated Ca2+ current is the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC). It is generally believed that high concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ buffer are required to measure ICRAC, due to Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the channels. Recently, we have recorded robust ICRAC in rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-1) cells at physiological levels of Ca2+ buffering when stores were depleted by inhibition of the sarcoplasmic/ endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-activated adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA) pumps. However, the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) was not able to evoke the current under such conditions, despite inducing substantial Ca2+ release. We have therefore suggested that a threshold exists within the Ca2+ stores which has to be overcome for macroscopic ICRAC to activate. To establish whether this is a specific feature of ICRAC in RBL-1 cells or whether it is a more general phenomenon, we investigated whether a threshold is also seen in other cell-types used to study store-operated Ca2+ entry. In Jurkat-T lymphocytes, ICRAC is activated weakly by InsP3 in the presence of low concentrations of Ca2+ buffer, whereas the current is large when SERCA pumps are blocked simultaneously, as in RBL-1 cells. Although the electrophysiological properties of ICRAC in the Jurkat cell are very similar to those of RBL-1 cells, the Na+ conductance in the absence of external divalent cations is quite different. Unexpectedly, we failed consistently to record any store-operated Ca2+ current in macrovascular pulmonary artery endothelia whereas robust ICRAC was seen under the same conditions in RBL-1 cells. Our results show that ICRAC has a similar profile of activation in the presence of physiological levels of Ca2+ buffering for Jurkat T-lymphocytes and RBL-1 cells, indicating that the threshold mechanism may be a general feature of ICRAC activation. Because ICRAC in pulmonary artery endothelia is, at best, very small, additional Ca2+ influx pathways may also contribute to agonist-induced Ca2+ entry.","['Fierro, L', 'Lund, P E', 'Parekh, A B']","['Fierro L', 'Lund PE', 'Parekh AB']","['Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pflugers Arch,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,0154720,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.3.8 (Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*physiology', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Pulmonary Artery', 'Rats', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Temperature', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/25 11:00'],"['2000/08/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/25 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004240000336 [doi]'],ppublish,Pflugers Arch. 2000 Aug;440(4):580-7. doi: 10.1007/s004240000336.,,,,,,,,,,,

Sera from several infected rabbits also reacted with collagen, while antibody reactions with other autoantigens tested, including DNA, were rare and sporadic.

This method is somewhat similar to the method of using a monoclonal antibody Fab fragment complexed to the molecule of interest in order to obtain crystals suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis. Here a novel DNA structure including two G-A mispairs in a pseudo-hexadecamer determined at 2.3 A resolution in a complex with the N-terminal fragment is reported. This structure has an asymmetric unit consisting of the protein molecule bound to the blunt end of a DNA 6/10-mer, which is composed of a six-base strand (5'-CTCGTG-3') and a ten-base strand (3'-GAGCACGGCA-5'). The 6/10-mer is thus composed of a six-base-pair duplex with a four-base single-stranded overhang. In the crystal structure, the bases of the overhang are reciprocally paired (symmetry element -x - 1, -y, z), yielding a doubly nicked pseudo-hexadecamer primarily B-form DNA molecule, which has some interesting A-like structural features. The pairing between the single strands results in two standard (G-C) Watson-Crick pairs and two G-A mispairs. The structural DNA model can accommodate either a standard syn or a standard anti conformation for the 5'-terminal adenine of the ten-base strand of the DNA based on analysis of simulated-annealing omit maps. Although the DNA model here includes nicks in the phosphodiester backbone, modeling of an intact phosphodiester backbone results in a very similar DNA model and indicates that the structure is biologically relevant.","['Cote, M L', 'Yohannan, S J', 'Georgiadis, M M']","['Cote ML', 'Yohannan SJ', 'Georgiadis MM']","['Waksman Institute and Department of Chemistry, Rutgers University, 190 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,"Acta crystallographica.

A valine-to-methionine substitution at amino acid 104 in the reduced folate carrier (RFC1) explains this disparity in drug resistance. Transfection of the V104M cDNA into an RFC1-deficient cell line markedly increased DDATHF influx (32x) but only modestly increased influx of MTX and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (4- and 6-fold, respectively). The growth inhibition or growth requirements for these folates fell by factors of 18, 2, and 4, respectively, in the transfectant. Preservation of DDATHF influx in cells with V104M RFC1 resulted in even greater preservation (60%) of the exchangeable drug level. Another major element in the preservation of DDATHF activity was the impact of the mutated carrier on cellular folate pools. For folic acid, folate pools were essentially unchanged but DDATHF polyglutamate levels decreased in lines that express the V104M carrier. However, with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate as the growth source, there was a marked decrease in folate pools in the lines carrying the mutated carrier, and DDATHF polyglutamate levels were unchanged. Hence, DDATHF activity was preserved in cells with V104M RFC1 due to (a) relative conservation of DDATHF transport, and (b) depletion of cellular THF cofactors with diminishing folate cofactor competition at folylpolyglutamate synthetase and possibly glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. Hence, resistance to one antifolate, in this case MTX, because of a loss of RFC1 transport activity need not exclude the subsequent utility of another antifolate that uses the same carrier.","['Zhao, R', 'Gao, F', 'Babani, S', 'Goldman, I D']","['Zhao R', 'Gao F', 'Babani S', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, and the Albert Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"[""0 (6R-2',5'-thienyl-5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolic acid)"", '0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Tetrahydrofolates/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",,2000/08/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/24 11:00'],"['2000/08/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/24 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Aug;6(8):3304-11.,,"['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-82621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, quantification of this cell compartment seems to be imperative for two reasons: first, the presumed association of immunocompetent lymphocyte subsets in the expansion of the leukemic cell clone; and second, a speculated relationship with the complex generation of myelofibrosis. Therefore, an immunohistological and morphometric study was performed on 219 representative trephine biopsies of the bone marrow derived from 70 patients with repeated examinations during the course of Ph1+-CML. For the identification of the different lymphocyte populations, the monoclonal antibodies UCHL-1 (CD45RO) and L26 (CD20) were applied on formaldehyde-fixed and decalcified specimens. In comparison to a control group and calculated per hematopoietic cells, the CML bone marrow showed about a 50% decrease in the total amount of lymphocytes. Determination of CD45RO+ and CD20+ subsets revealed a significant enhancement during treatment. Because of the different intervals (range, 10 to 25 mo) between first and last biopsy in the various therapeutic groups, results had to be modified by considering dynamic features. This calculation included changes of the lymphocyte subpopulations related to time. Contrasting the CD45RO+ lymphocytes, a relevant increase in the CD20+ subset could be observed after interferon-a treatment or corresponding combination regimens. No significant correlations were found between fiber density at onset (first biopsy) or development of fibrosis and lymphocyte proliferations in the course of CML. Our results are in keeping with the finding that a proper immune response consistent with an increased lymphocyte growth seems to be associated with a regression of the clonally-transformed cell population. Opposed to a repeatedly discussed pathomechanism, we failed to demonstrate any quantitative relationships between the extent of lymphocyte proliferations and occurrence or progression of myelofibrosis.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Schmitt-Graeff, A', 'Cvetanovska, G', 'Blum, N', 'Schaefer, H E']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Cvetanovska G', 'Blum N', 'Schaefer HE']","['Institutes of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",,2000/08/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/24 11:00'],"['2000/08/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/24 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/modpathol.3880159 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2000 Aug;13(8):888-96. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3880159.,,,,,,,,,,,

APL in patients harboring t(15;17) responds well to retinoic acid (RA) treatment and chemotherapy, whereas t(11;17) APL responds poorly to both treatments, thus defining a distinct syndrome. Here, we show that RA, As(2)O(3), and RA + As(2)O(3) prolonged survival in either leukemic PML-RARalpha transgenic mice or nude mice transplanted with PML-RARalpha leukemic cells. RA + As(2)O(3) prolonged survival compared with treatment with either drug alone. In contrast, neither in PLZF-RARalpha transgenic mice nor in nude mice transplanted with PLZF-RARalpha cells did any of the three regimens induce complete disease remission. Unexpectedly, therapeutic doses of RA and RA + As(2)O(3) can induce, both in vivo and in vitro, the degradation of either PML-RARalpha or PLZF-RARalpha proteins, suggesting that the maintenance of the leukemic phenotype depends on the continuous presence of the former, but not the latter. Our findings lead to three major conclusions with relevant therapeutic implications: (i) the X-RARalpha oncoprotein directly determines response to treatment and plays a distinct role in the maintenance of the malignant phenotype; (ii) As(2)O(3) and/or As(2)O(3) + RA combination may be beneficial for the treatment of t(15;17) APL but not for t(11;17) APL; and (iii) therapeutic strategies aimed solely at degrading the X-RARalpha oncoprotein may not be effective in t(11;17) APL.","['Rego, E M', 'He, L Z', 'Warrell, R P Jr', 'Wang, Z G', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Rego EM', 'He LZ', 'Warrell RP Jr', 'Wang ZG', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Department of Human Genetics, Molecular Biology Program, and Department of Medicine, Molecular Therapeutics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects/*genetics', 'Oxides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,2000/08/24 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/08/24 11:00'],"['2000/08/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/24 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.180290497 [doi]', '180290497 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Aug 29;97(18):10173-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.180290497.,,"['CA74031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA071692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA074031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA071692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC27786,,,,,

This agent may induce graft-versus-host reactions (GVHR) as well as graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. OBJECTIVE: We documented the incidence of acute cutaneous GVHR associated with roquinimex immunotherapy. The presence or absence of autologous GVHR was also correlated with a potential GVL effect in patients with CML treated with ABMT and subsequent roquinimex immunotherapy in the period after the transplant. METHODS: Fifteen patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation and roquinimex immunotherapy for CML were followed up, and clinicopathologic data were analyzed. RESULTS: Acute cutaneous GVHRs were observed in 6 of 15 patients (40%) treated with roquinimex. Ten of 11 evaluable patients receiving roquinimex exhibited eccrine sweat gland necrosis (ESGN) (90.9%), which was independent of the acute GVHR. Neither bone marrow engraftment status nor the survival rates of patients with and without GVHR was significantly different. CONCLUSION: Roquinimex immunotherapy enhances the incidence of GVHR and was associated with a high rate of ESGN in patients with CML who were undergoing ABMT. There was no significant association between ESGN and acute GVHR. Acute autologous GVHR caused by roquinimex did not correlate with a GVL effect in our study of 15 patients with CML.","['Ohsuga, Y', 'Rowe, J M', 'Liesveld, J', 'Burns, R P', 'Gaspari, A A']","['Ohsuga Y', 'Rowe JM', 'Liesveld J', 'Burns RP', 'Gaspari AA']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Hydroxyquinolines)', '372T2944C0 (roquinimex)']",IM,,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*chemically induced/etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyquinolines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Necrosis', 'Sweat Gland Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0190-9622(00)45502-7 [pii]', '10.1067/mjd.2000.106366 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2000 Sep;43(3):437-41. doi: 10.1067/mjd.2000.106366.,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent with this result, the deletion mutant showed a 20- to 30-fold drop in the amount of virion RNA in the culture supernatant. The total amount of virion protein in the culture supernatant was comparable for the deletion mutant and the parental virus, suggesting that the mutant construct could release the empty viral particles. These results suggested that the packaging signal sequence might be present at the two extreme sites of the viral genome, one in the region around the splice donor sequence downstream from the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) and the other immediately upstream from the 3' LTR.

While PTX-B inhibited fusion induced by R5 but not that induced by X4 envelopes, it blocked infection of T cells with recombinant HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with R5, X4, and even murine leukemia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus envelopes. It also suppressed HIV-1 RNA synthesis in cultures of infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells when new infections had been inhibited by zidovudine, and it reduced Tat-dependent expression of the luciferase reporter gene controlled by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Surprisingly, PTX-B did not affect expression from the cytomegalovirus promoter, nor did it reduce the basal (Tat-independent) expression from the LTR promoter. These results indicate that PTX-B inhibits HIV-1 infection at both the entry and the post-entry stages of viral replication, with the post-entry activity specifically affecting transcription or stability of Tat-stimulated HIV-1 mRNAs.","['Alfano, M', 'Pushkarsky, T', 'Poli, G', 'Bukrinsky, M']","['Alfano M', 'Pushkarsky T', 'Poli G', 'Bukrinsky M']","['The Picower Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)']",IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Gene Products, tat/genetics', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Membrane Fusion/*drug effects', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'Polymers', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.18.8767-8770.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Sep;74(18):8767-70. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.18.8767-8770.2000.,,['R01 AI 38245/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC116391,,,,,

Though a number of peptide motifs responsible for the structure as well as for the binding and fusion activities of Env have been identified, only a few quantitative data concerning the infection process are available. Using an inducible expression system, we have expressed various amounts of ecotropic and amphotropic Env at the surfaces of Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived vectors and assayed for the infectivity of viral particles. Contrary to the current view that numerous noncooperative Env-viral receptor interactions are required for cell infection, we report here that very small amounts of Env are sufficient for optimal infection. However, increasing Env density clearly accelerates the rate at which infectious attachment to cells occurs. Moreover, our data also show that a surprisingly small number of Env molecules are sufficient to drive infection, albeit at a reduced efficiency, and that, under conditions of low expression, Env molecules act cooperatively. These observations have important consequences for our understanding of natural retroviral infection as well as for the design of cell-targeted infection techniques involving retroviral vectors.","['Bachrach, E', 'Marin, M', 'Pelegrin, M', 'Karavanas, G', 'Piechaczyk, M']","['Bachrach E', 'Marin M', 'Pelegrin M', 'Karavanas G', 'Piechaczyk M']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire, UMR 5535/IFR24, CNRS, BP 5051, 34293 Montpellier Cedex 05, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Products, env/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Protein Binding', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.18.8480-8486.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Sep;74(18):8480-6. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.18.8480-8486.2000.,,,,,,PMC116359,,,,,

Here we report the construction and characterization of highly efficient minimal vectors derived from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac251). High-fidelity PCR amplification of DNA fragments was used to generate a minimal SIV vector formed from a 5' cytomegalovirus early promoter, the 5' viral sequences up to the 5' end of gag required for reverse transcription and packaging, the Rev-responsive element, a gene-expressing cassette, and the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR). Production of SIV vector particles was achieved by transfecting 293T cells with the vector DNA and helper constructs coding for the viral genes and the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G envelope. These SIV vectors were found to have transducing titers reaching 10(7) transducing units/ml on HeLa cells and to deliver a gene without transfer of helper functions to target cells. The central polypurine tract can be included in the minimal vector, resulting in a two- to threefold increase in the transduction titers on dividing or growth-arrested cells. Based on this minimal SIV vector, a sin vector was designed by deleting 151 nucleotides in the 3' LTR U3 region, and this SIV sin vector retained high transduction titers. Furthermore, the minimal SIV vector was efficient at transducing terminally differentiated human CD34(+) cell-derived or monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Results show that up to 40% of human primary DCs can be transduced by the SIV vectors. This opens a new perspective in the field of immunotherapy.","['Mangeot, P E', 'Negre, D', 'Dubois, B', 'Winter, A J', 'Leissner, P', 'Mehtali, M', 'Kaiserlian, D', 'Cosset, F L', 'Darlix, J L']","['Mangeot PE', 'Negre D', 'Dubois B', 'Winter AJ', 'Leissner P', 'Mehtali M', 'Kaiserlian D', 'Cosset FL', 'Darlix JL']","['LaboRetro, Unite de Virologie Humaine (INSERM-ENS no. 412), Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.18.8307-8315.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Sep;74(18):8307-15. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.18.8307-8315.2000.,,,,,,PMC116340,,,,,

Serum antibody in infected animals does not correlate with protection from disease, yet only some animals develop severe disease. While a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response may be responsible for directing BLV pathogenesis, this possibility has been left largely unexplored, in part since the lack of readily established cytotoxic target cells in cattle has hampered such studies. Using long-term naturally infected alymphocytic (AL) cattle, we have established the existence of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response against BLV envelope proteins (Env; gp51/gp30). In vitro-expanded peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cell effector populations consisted mainly of gammadelta(+) (>40%), CD4(+) (>35%), and CD8(+) (>10%) T lymphocytes. Specific lysis of autologous fibroblasts infected with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) delivering the BLV env gene ranged from 30 to 65%. Depletion studies indicated that gammadelta(+) and not CD8(+) T cells were responsible for the cytotoxicity against autologous rVVenv-expressing fibroblasts. Additionally, cultured effector cells lysed rVVenv-expressing autologous fibroblasts and rVVenv-expressing xenogeneic targets similarly, suggesting a lack of genetic restricted killing. Restimulation of effector populations increased the proportion of gammadelta(+) T cells and concomitantly Env-specific cytolysis. Interestingly, culture of cells from BLV-negative or persistently lymphocytic cattle failed to elicit such cytotoxic responses or increase in gammadelta(+) T-cell numbers. These results imply that cytotoxic gammadelta(+) T lymphocytes from only AL cattle recognize BLV Env without a requirement for classical major histocompatibility complex interactions. It is known that gammadelta(+) T lymphocytes are diverse and numerous in cattle, and here we show that they may serve a surveillance role during natural BLV infection.","['Lundberg, P', 'Splitter, G A']","['Lundberg P', 'Splitter GA']","['Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (gp30 envelope transmembrane protein, Bovine leukemia virus)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*immunology/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology/virology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/virology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphopenia/immunology/virology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology/metabolism']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.18.8299-8306.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Sep;74(18):8299-306. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.18.8299-8306.2000.,,['R0I CA59127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC116339,,,,,

In this study, reconstruction experiments with purified avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) IN and retrovirus-like donor substrates containing wild-type and mutant termini were performed to map the internal att DNA sequence requirements for concerted integration, here termed full-site integration. The avian retrovirus mutations were modeled after internal att site mutations studied at the in vivo level with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and murine leukemia virus (MLV). Systematic overlapping 4-bp deletions starting at nucleotide positions 7, 8, and 9 in the U3 terminus had a decreasing detrimental gradient effect on full-site integration, while more internal 4-bp deletions had little or no effect. This decreasing detrimental gradient effect was measured by the ability of mutant U3 ends to interact with wild-type U3 ends for full-site integration in trans. Modification of the highly conserved C at position 7 on the catalytic strand to either A or T resulted in the same severe decrease in full-site integration as the 4-bp deletion starting at this position. These studies suggest that nucleotide position 7 is crucial for interactions near the active site of IN for integration activity and for communication in trans between ends bound by IN for full-site integration. The ability of AMV IN to interact with internal att sequences to mediate full-site integration in vitro is similar to the internal att site requirements observed with MLV and HIV-1 in vivo and with their preintegration complexes in vitro.","['Chiu, R', 'Grandgenett, D P']","['Chiu R', 'Grandgenett DP']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, St. Louis University Health Sciences Center, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '9004-70-0 (Collodion)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Collodion', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Integrases/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Virus Integration']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.18.8292-8298.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Sep;74(18):8292-8. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.18.8292-8298.2000.,,"['R01 CA016312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC116338,,,,,

Tax enhances CREB binding to TRE-1 in vitro, and it promotes dimerization of CREB as well as other bZIP proteins. Using ligation-mediated PCR on in vivo dimethyl sulfate-treated HTLV-1-infected cell lines MT-2 and MT-4, we have compiled a profile of protein occupancy in the HTLV-1 enhancer sequences in the presence of high (MT-2) and low (MT-4) levels of biologically active Tax I. The in vivo footprinting showed that all three TRE-1s were bound by protein(s), but only in MT-2 cells. In MT-2 cells, all TRE-1s showed strong protection of the G residues in the central CRE, and the footprints extended to differing degrees into the GC-rich flanking sequences. This indicated Tax I-dependent loading of transcription factors onto the HTLV-1 TRE-1s in vivo. In vivo footprinting on TRE-2 indicated that this region was bound by proteins regardless of the Tax I status of the cell line. However, the presence of Tax I increased the extent and altered the profile of proteins binding TRE-2 in vivo.","['Datta, S', 'Kothari, N H', 'Fan, H']","['Datta S', 'Kothari NH', 'Fan H']","['Cancer Research Institute and Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Sulfuric Acid Esters)', 'JW5CW40Z50 (dimethyl sulfate)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Footprinting', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', '*Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Sulfuric Acid Esters', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.18.8277-8285.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Sep;74(18):8277-85. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.18.8277-8285.2000.,,"['R01 CA032455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC116336,,,,,

The pathways for granule biogenesis and exocytosis in these cells are still largely obscure. In this study we employed the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)/mast cell line to verify the hypothesis that inflammatory granules share common bioactive molecules and functional properties with lysosomes. We demonstrate that inflammatory granules, as identified by the monoclonal 5G10 antibody (which recognises an integral membrane protein) or by Toluidine Blue staining, have an intralumenal acidic pH, possess lysosomal enzymes and are accessible by fluid-phase and membrane endocytosis markers. In addition, we studied the targeting, subcellular localisation and regulated secretion of the lysosomal aspartic protease cathepsin D (CD) as affected by IgE receptor stimulation in order to obtain information on the pathways for granule biogenesis and exocytosis. Stimulation with DNP-BSA of specific IgE-primed RBL cells led to a prompt release of processed forms of CD, along with other mature lysosomal hydrolases. This release could be prevented by addition of EGTA, indicating that it was dependent on extracellular calcium influx. Antigen stimulation also induced exocytosis of immature CD forms accumulated by ammonium chloride, suggesting the existence of an intermediate station in the pathway for granule biogenesis still sensitive to regulated exocytosis. The targeting of molecules to secretory granules may occur via either a mannose-6-phosphate-dependent or mannose-6-phosphate-independent pathway. We conclude that endosomes and lysosomes in basophils/mast cells can act as regulated secretory granules or actually identify with them.","['Dragonetti, A', 'Baldassarre, M', 'Castino, R', 'Demoz, M', 'Luini, A', 'Buccione, R', 'Isidoro, C']","['Dragonetti A', 'Baldassarre M', 'Castino R', 'Demoz M', 'Luini A', 'Buccione R', 'Isidoro C']","[""Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Medical Sciences, 'A.

However, some researchers showed that c-UFA pretreatment did not affect its cytotoxicity in special cell lines. It is possible that the different results occurred due to different cellular characteristics. We hypothesized that c-UFA treatment might modulate the activities of some antioxidant enzymes to affect the resistance of cells to DOX. In the present study, we examined how c-UFA pretreatment affected DOX cytotoxicity on mouse leukemia cell line, P388, and its resistant subline, P388/DOX, which we found to have significantly higher glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity as well as P-glycoprotein (p-gp) overexpression. We chose two c-UFAs, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) (18:3n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6n-3). Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT (3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and trypan blue exclusion assays. DOX accumulation and p-gp expression were measured by flow cytometry. The activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and GPx were determined for both cell lines with and without treatment with GLA or DHA. Significant DOX accumulation occurred in both cell lines with GLA or DHA pretreatment, but without any change in p-gp expression in either cell line. Sensitivity to DOX cytotoxicity was improved by GLA or DHA pretreatment in P388/DOX in which only SOD activity was significantly increased, but not in the parental cell line P388 in which both SOD and CAT were significantly increased by the pretreatment. However, combined pretreatment of GLA or DHA with antioxidants, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) or Vitamin C, could sensitize not only P388/DOX but also P388 cells to DOX. We conclude that the effects of c-UFA pretreatment on the sensitivity of cancer cells to DOX not only depend on the change in drug accumulation but also the change in the levels of antioxidant enzyme activities, and suggest that combined administration of c-UFAs, antioxidants, and DOX may be more effective in treating leukemia.","['Liu, Q Y', 'Tan, B K']","['Liu QY', 'Tan BK']","[""Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '135467-92-4 (prolinedithiocarbamate)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', '78YC2MAX4O (gamma-Linolenic Acid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proline/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Thiocarbamates/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'gamma-Linolenic Acid/*pharmacology']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0024320500007141 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00714-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2000;67(10):1207-18. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00714-1.,,,,,,,,,,,

Failure of the immune system to eliminate tumor cells may be, among other factors, due to an insufficient presentation of tumor antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs), as professional antigen-presenting cells, therefore, may be therapeutically used to initiate or enhance immune responses in patients with malignancies. In this study we demonstrate that peripheral blood cells of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) can be induced to acquire DC characteristics. Upon culture with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plus interleukin-4 (IL-4) plus tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), CMML cells develop DC morphology and acquire the phenotypic characteristics of DCs. When a CD14+ cell population is used for DC generation, a homogeneous differentiation towards the DC lineage occurs similar to that, observed in normal peripheral blood monocytes. CMML-derived DCs are potent stimulators of the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) when compared with uncultivated cells. The demonstration of a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7, del(7)(q22), in 86% of highly enriched CD1a+ cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicates the leukemic origin of generated DCs. In addition, we present data that generation of CMML-derived DCs is also possible under fetal calf serum-free conditions for a potential clinical use. These DCs may be used as a cellular vaccine to induce anti-tumor immunity in patients with CMML.","['Oehler, L', 'Berer, A', 'Keil, F', 'Weinlander, G', 'Konig, M', 'Haas, O A', 'Lechner, K', 'Geissler, K']","['Oehler L', 'Berer A', 'Keil F', 'Weinlander G', 'Konig M', 'Haas OA', 'Lechner K', 'Geissler K']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Vienna, Austria.

Several recent studies have shown that some metalloproteinase mediates TNF-alpha and FasL processing. We examined the ameliorating effect of a hydroxamic acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitor (KB-R7785) that inhibits TNF-alpha and FasL release in a lethal acuteGVHD model in mice. The ameliorating effect of KB-R7785 was superior to that of anti-TNF-alpha antibody. We also examined the effect of KB-R7785, which we previously demonstrated a potent ameliorating effect on acute GVHD, on graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Administration of KB-R7785 without bone marrow cells and spleen cells (BMS). significantly prolonged the survival of IgE-producing B53 hybridoma cell-inoculated (C57BL/6 x BALB/c) F1 (CBF1) mice by inhibiting the infiltration of B53 cells into the liver and spleen. Transplantation of B6 BMS without KB-R7785 resulted in the death of most recipients due to acute GVHD while efficiently eliminating B53 cells.

BCL6 rearrangement is one of the most common genetic abnormalities in NHL. As a result of translocations, the regulatory region of the BCL6 gene is replaced by an heterologous reciprocal partner such as the immunoglobulin (IG) genes. Promotor substitution leads to deregulation of the BCL6 expression, which may be associated with lymphomagenesis. Recent studies have shown that the 5' non-coding region of the BCL6 gene is also subject to somatic hypermutation physiologically operating in germinal center (GC) B-cells in a similar pattern to that of the IG genes. There is little evidence to show that structural alterations of the BCL6 gene may be caused by mechanisms other than chromosomal translocations. To date, five cases with NHL exhibiting gross BCL6 deletions of the 1.5-2.4 kb have been reported. These deletions occurred in the same region as translocational breakpoints and the somatic hypermutations cluster, but independently of chromosomal rearrangements. The deletions overlapped at the 270 bp region and this region contains a putative protein-binding sequence which may play a role in the regulation of the BCL6 expression. Small separated deletions of 22-101 bp, which may also contain protein-binding sequences, were evident in another NHL case. In contrast to the TAL1 deletion in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the BCL6 deletion is considered to be mediated by a mechanism other than aberrant activity of the IG recombinase. Internal deletion within the BCL6 gene is a recurrent molecular abnormality in B-cell NHL, which is sometimes indistinguishable from rearrangements by chromosomal translocations. At present, the mechanism of DNA recombination and its role in lymphomagenesis remain unknown.","['Nakamura, Y']",['Nakamura Y'],"['Department of Hematology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan. yu-nakam@dokkyomed.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Zinc Fingers']",45,2000/08/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009059269 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Aug;38(5-6):505-12. doi: 10.3109/10428190009059269.,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently found that B-CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) lymphocytes are hypersensitive to apoptotic death activation through specific inhibition of proteasome function by lactacystin. Lactacystin efficiently activates apoptotic death process in B-CLL lymphocytes at doses at which no apoptotic effect can be observed in normal human lymphocytes in which 10-fold higher doses of lactacystin are required to weakly induce apoptosis. This hypersensitivity of B-cell CLL may be a result of an altered ubiquitin pathway and proteasomal proteolysis in these malignant cells, and this alteration could be specific for this malignancy. Together with other published works, these results suggest that lactacystin, though not per se a discriminatory inhibitor of the ubiquitinated protein processing/degradation, can nonetheless be discriminatory in the apoptotic cell response between B-CLL and normal lymphocytes: the property that promises efficacy in clinical trials of B-cell CLL. This hypothesis is documented by the fact that lymphocytes from patients in complete remission become resistant to lactacystin-induced apoptosis as normal lymphocytes do.","['Masdehors, P', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Magdelenat, H', 'Delic, J']","['Masdehors P', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Magdelenat H', 'Delic J']","['Laboratoire de Recherche Correspondant no 2 du CEA (DSV/DRR, Fontenay aux Roses), Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,,"['Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*physiology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitins/*physiology']",49,2000/08/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009059268 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Aug;38(5-6):499-504. doi: 10.3109/10428190009059268.,,,,,,,,,,,

The origin of this disease can be explained by a combination of genetic susceptibility factors and environmental exposures. For the purpose of our study it can be considered as a complex disease, caused by the ""carcinogenic"" effect of the environment modified by a series of genes. In population, these genes tend to occur in allelic forms representing functional polymorphisms thus explaining inter-individual variability in cancer susceptibility. The latter can be evaluated more realistically in childhood ALL than in sporadic cancers of the adult because of its relatively short latency period. We asked therefore, the question about the role of genes controlling the efficiency of xenobiotics metabolism in childhood leukemogenesis. Xenobiotics (drugs and carcinogens) are excreted from the body after metabolic conversion by enzymes mediating oxidation activation (Phase I) and conjugation detoxificaton (Phase II). Functional variants of these enzymes, resulting from known DNA polymorphisms in the corresponding genes, were shown to influence the risk to a variety of solid tumours in adults. A case-control study on ALL patients and healthy controls in a French-Canadian population was carried out by examining the loci of Phase I, CYP1A1 and CYP2D6, as well as Phase II enzymes, GSTM1, GSTT1, NAT1 and NAT2. The NAT2 slow-acetylator, CYP1A1*2A and GSTM1 null genotypes were shown to be significant risk determinants of ALL (OR=1.6, 1.8 and 1.8, respectively), whereas, polymorphisms in CYP2D6 and GSTT1 genes did not seem to play an important role in the aetiology of ALL. Interestingly, the risk associated with NAT2 slow-acetylators was most apparent among males homozygous for NAT1*4 (OR=3.3) whereas girls carrying the CYP1A1*4 allele were significantly underrepresented in the patient group (OR=0.2). These findings point to a gender-specific effect of DNA variants which, at least in part, may explain why ALL is more prevalent among boys. To assess gene-gene interactions, NAT2 slow-acetylators were considered together with GSTM1 null genotypes and CYP1A1*2A alleles. The combined presence of two risk-elevating genotypes appeared to confer an increased risk of ALL among the carriers (OR=2.6). This risk was increased further (OR=3.3) when all three genotypes occurred in the same individuals indicating that the combination of susceptibility variants is more predictive of risk then either of them independently. The association of leukemogenesis in children with metabolising gene variants suggests causal relation to environmental exposures.","['Sinnett, D', 'Krajinovic, M', 'Labuda, D']","['Sinnett D', 'Krajinovic M', 'Labuda D']","[""Service d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Cancerologie Charles-Bruneau, Hopital Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. sinnettd@ere.umontreal.ca""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Xenobiotics)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Xenobiotics/metabolism']",87,2000/08/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009059264 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Aug;38(5-6):447-62. doi: 10.3109/10428190009059264.,,,,,,,,,,,

We wished to systematically compare IRES in the context of a retroviral vector to determine which was the most effective for protein production and viral titre. To do this we monitored expression of IL-12, as co-ordinated expression of both p35 and p40 subunits is required for production of the active heterodimer. METHODS: Retroviral vectors were constructed to express human IL-12 in which an IRES initiates translation of the p40 subunit, with the IRES optimally aligned to the initiation codon of p40. Vectors containing an IRES from either polio virus (PV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) or murine leukaemia virus (MLV) were compared with a vector expressing IL-12 as a single protein (Flexi-12; in which the two IL-12 subunits are linked by a peptide). RESULTS: All vectors produced high titre virus and directed synthesis of IL-12 in target cells. The bicistronic vectors containing the IRES from EMCV and PV were the most effective in infected 3T3 cells, producing up to 40 ng IL-12/10(6) cells/48 h, similar to the 50 ng IL-12/10(6) cells/48 h obtained with Flexi-12. The IRES from PV was the most efficient in human melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Bicistronic retroviral vectors have been constructed that effectively transduce target cells and produce high levels of protein. Target cell specificity of IRES function was observed. The combination of Flexi-12 and the IRES from PV will be useful in the generation of vectors expressing IL-12 with a second protein such as IL-2 for transduction of melanoma cells.","['Harries, M', 'Phillipps, N', 'Anderson, R', 'Prentice, G', 'Collins, M']","['Harries M', 'Phillipps N', 'Anderson R', 'Prentice G', 'Collins M']","['Department of Immunology, University College London, The Windeyer Institute of Medical Sciences, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,['187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)'],IM,,"['Aphthovirus/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Encephalomyocarditis virus/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Poliovirus/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Ribosomes/*genetics']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1521-2254(200007/08)2:4<243::AID-JGM115>3.0.CO;2-Q [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2000 Jul-Aug;2(4):243-9. doi: 10.1002/1521-2254(200007/08)2:4<243::AID-JGM115>3.0.CO;2-Q.,,,,,,,,,,,

Their presence in malignant cells indicates patient for the most intensive antileukaemic therapy regardless of the other criteria. In contrast, the most common non-random chromosomal aberration in paediatric ALL--translocation t(12;21)(q12;q22)--is associated with a favourable prognosis. The examination of these rearrangements is important for the stratification of patients to the risk groups and also provides the most sensitive and specific tool for minimal residual disease (MRD) follow-up. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study comprises 241 patients with ALL from Czech and Slovak Republics younger than 18 years at diagnosis. They were examined for presence of m-RNA of fusion genes BCR/ABL, MLL/AF4 and TEL/AML1 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Seven out of 197 (3.6%) carried MLL/AF4 fusion gene, but among infants it was 56% (5 out of 9). BCR/ABL positivity was found in 2.5% (7 out of 240) and TEL/AML1 in 21.7% (41 out of 189) cases. Event free survival (EFS) curves demonstrate the clinical impact of these hybrid genes on patients' prognosis. Moreover, we present the possibility of the monitoring of MRD levels in follow-up samples of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: All particular rearrangements were found only in a cohort of patients with B-precursor ALL (or hybrid leukaemia), which constitutes 85% of our group. Presence of BCR/ABL or MLL/AF4 fusion gene is associated with poor prognosis and is indispensable condition for correct stratification of patients to the risk groups according to treatment protocols. Hybrid gene TEL/AML1 defines subgroup of children with better prognosis and due to its high frequency provides us with a very useful tool for MRD detection.","['Trka, J', 'Zuna, J', 'Haskovec, C', 'Brabencova, A', 'Kalinova, M', 'Muzikova, K', 'Paukertova, R', 'Hrusak, O', 'Zemanova, Z', 'Michalova, K', 'Stary, J']","['Trka J', 'Zuna J', 'Haskovec C', 'Brabencova A', 'Kalinova M', 'Muzikova K', 'Paukertova R', 'Hrusak O', 'Zemanova Z', 'Michalova K', 'Stary J']","['II. detska klinika 2.

Molecular-cytogenetic techniques which enable examination of dividing and/or non-diving interphase nuclei (I-FISH), proved existence of other chromosomal abnormalities, mainly deletions, which could have in CLL patients relation to the origin, course and prognosis of the disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: During the last two years bone marrow chromosomes of all patients with CLL were examined by G-banding and by I-FISH. The numerical changes of chromosome 12 were followed by centromeric DNA probe in dividing and non-dividing cells. The small deletions were ascertained by locus specific probes for 13q14 (Rb gene), 17p13 (p53 protein) and 11q23 (MLL gene). These genes are responsible for cell division and their function is probably in connection with neoplastic process. It is of interest whether numerical and structural chromosomal rearrangements are primary or secondary changes and what is their impact on etiology of CLL. 93 patients were examined by DNA prove CEP12 and trisomy 12 was found in 24 of them (25.8%), the range of the clone was 2.5-75.5% of the screened cells. Deletion del(13)(q14) was examined by probe D13S319 in 73 patients and proved in 24 of them (32.8%), pathological clone ranged 2.5-80.0% of the cells. Deletion del(17)(p13) was found in 14 patients out of 61 examined by probe LSI p53 (22.9%). The extent of the clone was 2.5-34.0% of examined cells. Deletion 11q23 was not ascertained in any of 11 patients by means of probe LSI 11q23 (MLL). All probes used for FISH were manufactured by VYSIS. CONCLUSIONS: FISH is very sensitive method, suitable for molecular-cytogenetic examination of leukemic patients. With I-FISH the deletion of 13q14 was ascertained as the most frequent chromosomal aberration in series of 73 patients with CLL. We continue to increase the number of patients screened by I-FISH with all eligible DNA probes and start the prospective study on patients with chromosomal pathology.

Blockage of LIF expression or biological function can inhibit in vitro growth and induce differentiation-like phenotypes of medulloblastoma cells (Med-3), suggesting a redifferentiation potential of Med-3 cells when intrinsic dedifferentiation factor(s) is suppressed or external differentiation element(s) is exerted. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) can induce differentiation in some types of cancers but its effect on medulloblastoma cells has not yet been described. To address the above issues, three dosages (5, 8 and 10 mumol/L) of RA were used to treat Med-3 cells and their effects on the target cells were evaluated by multiple approaches. It was found that, in addition to induction of morphological changes and growth inhibition, RA could repress LIF expression as well as the telomerase activity of Med-3 cells in time- and dose-related fashions. Our data thus suggest that the growth inhibitory effect of RA on Med-3 cells may be correlated with the LIF down-regulation. Reduction of telomerase activity by RA indicates that this enzymatic activity is a potential differentiation indicator of medulloblastoma cells.","['Liu, J', 'Guo, L', 'Luo, Y', 'Li, J W', 'Li, H']","['Liu J', 'Guo L', 'Luo Y', 'Li JW', 'Li H']","['Division of Molecular Biology, Shenyang Medical College, P.

We recently demonstrated that the herbal combination PC-SPES, which contains licorice root, had potent estrogenic activity in vitro, in animals, and in patients with prostate cancer. Licochalcone-A (LA) is one flavonoid extracted from licorice root with antiparasitic and anti-tumor activity, but the effect on the human estrogen receptor and mechanism of anti-tumor activity is unknown. Recent studies demonstrated that the mechanism of cytotoxic effect by some estrogens may involve modulation of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2. In the present study, we determined if LA had estrogenic activity, anti-tumor activity, and modulated the apoptotic protein bcl-2 in human cell lines derived from acute leukemia, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. A yeast growth-based assay under the control of the human estrogen receptor (hER) demonstrated that LA was a phytoestrogen. A cell viability assay demonstrated that LA had anti-tumor activity in all cell lines tested and enhanced the effect of paclitaxel and vinblastine chemotherapy. LA induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and HL-60 cell lines, as demonstrated by cleavage of PARP, the substrate of ICE-like proteases. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that LA decreased the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 and altered the bcl-2/bax ratio in favor of apoptosis. In contrast, the parent compound chalcone or estradiol did not decrease bc1-2 expression. Therefore, these data demonstrate that LA is a phytoestrogen with anti-tumor activity and is capable of modulating bcl-2 protein expression. The modulation of bcl-2 may be dependent on specific structural differences between LA and the parent compound chalcone and independent of LA estrogenicity.","['Rafi, M M', 'Rosen, R T', 'Vassil, A', 'Ho, C T', 'Zhang, H', 'Ghai, G', 'Lambert, G', 'DiPaola, R S']","['Rafi MM', 'Rosen RT', 'Vassil A', 'Ho CT', 'Zhang H', 'Ghai G', 'Lambert G', 'DiPaola RS']","['UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Department of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Estrogens, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Phytoestrogens)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5S5A2Q39HX (Chalcone)', 'JTV5467968 (licochalcone A)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Chalcone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Chalcones', 'Estrogens, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Isoflavones', 'Phytoestrogens', 'Plant Preparations', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Yeasts/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Jul-Aug;20(4):2653-8.,,"['CA72720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES05022/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Increased levels of topoisomerase II expression and function in a melphalan-resistant B-CLL cell line.,2569-78,"Previous studies have demonstrated alkylating (melphalan) resistance in the B-CLL derived WSU-CLL cell line as compared to WIL2 B lymphocytic cells. Nuclear extracts from WSU-CLL cells demonstrate a highly significant increase in DNA topoisomerase II activity as compared to WIL2 cells. Western blot analysis showed the level of topoisomerase II proteins expressed in WSU-CLL cells to be increased as compared to WIL2 cells. WSU-CLL cells were 5.24-fold more sensitive than WIL2 cells to the cytotoxic effect of the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin. No difference in topoisomerase I activity or of the level of topoisomerase I protein expression was observed comparing the two cell lines. The sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, did not differ in WSU-CLL and WIL2 cell lines. Pre-incubation with doxorubicin significantly increased melphalan induced interstrand-DNA-crosslink formation and cytotoxicity in WSU-CLL cells as compared to WIL2 cells. The affinity of topoisomerase II for WSU-CLL UV-irradiated-crosslinked DNA was increased 2.84-fold as compared to that of WSU-CLL native DNA. The affinity of topoisomerase II for both UV-irradiated (crosslinked) and for native DNA was significantly decreased after doxorubicin-pretreatment. Measurement of DNA polymerase beta and DNA polymerase beta revealed significant elevations in DNA polymerase beta (58.82 +/- 3.67 units/mg protein in WSU-CLL cells, as compared to 27.82 +/- 4.39 units/mg protein in WIL 2 cells; p < 0.01) but not DNA polymerase beta (0.82 +/- 0.11 units/mg protein in WSU-CLL cells, compared to 0.74 +/- 0.09 units/mg protein in WIL2, p > 0.05). However, exposure to aphidicolin (an inhibitor of DNA polymerase a) failed to increase melphalan induced cytotoxicity suggesting that although DNA polymerase a activity was increased in WSU-CLL cells the mechanisms of resistance does not involve this specific DNA repair pathway. Elevated topoisomerase II activity and the increased affinity of topoisomerase II for crosslinked DNA in melphalan resistant cells appears to be the major factor responsible for alkylator resistance by changing DNA topology and thereby facilitating DNA repair.","['Pu, Q Q', 'Bezwoda, W R']","['Pu QQ', 'Bezwoda WR']","['Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital, Manchester, U.K. qpu@pier.man.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*physiology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Melphalan/*pharmacology']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Jul-Aug;20(4):2569-78.,,,,,,,,,,,

Melphalan transport was inhibited by 2-amino-bicyclo[2,2,1] heptane-2-carboxylic acid(BCH) in both cell lines, indicating that the amino acid transport (System L, which is sodium independent and inhibited by BCH) is functional in these two cell lines. Only a minor degree of inhibition of melphalan transport was noted after sodium depletion (System ASC, which is sodium dependent and unaffected by BCH). Interstrand-DNA-cross-link formation showed a highly significant correlation with in-vitro cytotoxicity in both two cell lines. However, the melphalan concentration at which such interstrand DNA cross-linking occurred differed significantly when WIL2 cells and WSU-CLL cells were compared. The kinetics of interstrand-DNA-cross-link formation and removal following treatment with melphalan also differed significantly, with WSU-CLL cells, showing a much more rapid rate of removal of interstand DNA cross-links as compared to WIL2 cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that melphalan treatment resulted in the progressive arrest of the WSU cells in G1 and G2 phases. But WIL2 cells failed to enter G1 or G2 arrest after melphalan treatment, suggesting an increased rate of DNA repair occurring in melphalan-resistant WSU-CLL cells. There was no significant difference between the two cell lines in regard to either glutathione content or glutathione-S transferase activity. These findings indicate that multiple factors are associated with alkylator resistance in lymphoid cells including alteration of uptake, DNA repair and cell cycle progression. However no evidence for alteration in glutathione content and glutathione-S-transferase activity was found.","['Pu, Q', 'Bianchi, P', 'Bezwoda, W R']","['Pu Q', 'Bianchi P', 'Bezwoda WR']","['Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital, Manchester, U.K. qpu@pier.man.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glutathione/*analysis', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Melphalan/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Jul-Aug;20(4):2561-8.,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the signaling pathway leading to SPP production by the G protein-coupled P2Y(2) receptor and its functional implication in human leukemia (HL-60) cells, which do not respond to extracellular SPP. P2Y(2) receptor activation by UTP or ATP resulted in rapid and transient production of SPP, which was insensitive to pertussis toxin and blocked by the sphingosine kinase inhibitor, DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine. Treatment of HL-60 cells with this inhibitor did not affect activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, but suppressed Ca(2+) mobilization by the P2Y(2) receptor. However, receptor-induced SPP production apparently required an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, but not Ca(2+) influx, and was mimicked by exposure of cells to Ca(2+) ionophores. Taken together, activation of the P2Y(2) receptor stimulates SPP production in HL-60 cells, a process apparently not required for mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, but most likely representing an amplification system for receptor-mediated Ca(2+) signaling.","['Alemany, R', 'Sichelschmidt, B', 'zu Heringdorf, D M', 'Lass, H', 'van Koppen, C J', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Alemany R', 'Sichelschmidt B', 'zu Heringdorf DM', 'Lass H', 'van Koppen CJ', 'Jakobs KH']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (P2RY2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2Y2)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Biological Transport', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Lysophospholipids', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y2', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/*biosynthesis']",,2000/08/23 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/23 11:00'],"['2000/08/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.58.3.491 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2000 Sep;58(3):491-7. doi: 10.1124/mol.58.3.491.,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we hypothesized that functional VEGF receptors may also be expressed in malignant counterparts of hematopoietic stem cells such as leukemias. We demonstrate that certain leukemias not only produce VEGF but also express functional VEGFR-2 in vivo and in vitro, resulting in the generation of an autocrine loop that may support leukemic cell survival and proliferation. Approximately 50% of freshly isolated leukemias expressed mRNA and protein for VEGFR-2. VEGF(165) induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and increased proliferation of leukemic cells, demonstrating these receptors were functional. VEGF(165) also induced the expression of MMP-9 by leukemic cells and promoted their migration through reconstituted basement membrane. The neutralizing mAb IMC-1C11, specific to human VEGFR-2, inhibited leukemic cell survival in vitro and blocked VEGF(165)-mediated proliferation of leukemic cells and VEGF-induced leukemic cell migration. Xenotransplantation of primary leukemias and leukemic cell lines into immunocompromised nonobese diabetic mice resulted in significant elevation of human, but not murine, VEGF in plasma and death of inoculated mice within 3 weeks. Injection of IMC-1C11 inhibited proliferation of xenotransplanted human leukemias and significantly increased the survival of inoculated mice. Interruption of signaling by VEGFRs, particularly VEGFR-2, may provide a novel strategy for inhibiting leukemic cell proliferation.","['Dias, S', 'Hattori, K', 'Zhu, Z', 'Heissig, B', 'Choy, M', 'Lane, W', 'Wu, Y', 'Chadburn, A', 'Hyjek, E', 'Gill, M', 'Hicklin, D J', 'Witte, L', 'Moore, M A', 'Rafii, S']","['Dias S', 'Hattori K', 'Zhu Z', 'Heissig B', 'Choy M', 'Lane W', 'Wu Y', 'Chadburn A', 'Hyjek E', 'Gill M', 'Hicklin DJ', 'Witte L', 'Moore MA', 'Rafii S']","['Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Hematology/Oncology Division, New York, New York, USA.

Interferon (IFN)-gamma induces expression of three catalytically active proteasome subunits (LMP2, LMP7, and MECL-1) and the proteasome-associated activator PA28. These molecules are thought to optimize the generation of MHC class I-presented peptides. However, known information on their contribution in vivo is very limited. Here, we examined the antigen processing of two murine leukemia virus-encoded cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in murine cell lines equipped with a tetracycline-controlled, IFN-gamma-independent expression system. We thus were able to segregate the role of the immunosubunits from the role of PA28. The presence of either immunosubunits or PA28 did not alter the presentation of a subdominant murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-derived CTL epitope. However, the presentation of the immunodominant MuLV-derived epitope was markedly enhanced upon induction of each of these two sets of genes. Thus, the IFN-gamma-inducible proteasome subunits and PA28 can independently enhance antigen presentation of some CTL epitopes. Our data show that tetracycline-regulated expression of PA28 increases CTL epitope generation without affecting the 20S proteasome composition or half-life. The differential effect of these IFN-gamma-inducible proteins on MHC class I processing may have a decisive influence on the quality of the CTL immune response.","['van Hall T', 'Sijts, A', 'Camps, M', 'Offringa, R', 'Melief, C', 'Kloetzel, P M', 'Ossendorp, F']","['van Hall T', 'Sijts A', 'Camps M', 'Offringa R', 'Melief C', 'Kloetzel PM', 'Ossendorp F']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Ki antigen)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Psme1 protein, rat)', '0 (Psme2 protein, rat)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tap1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tap1 protein, rat)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '144416-78-4 (LMP-2 protein)', '5PFN71LP8M (divinyl sulfone)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (LMP7 protein)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Psmb10 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Psmb10 protein, rat)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Autoantigens', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Multienzyme Complexes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tetracycline/pharmacology']",,2000/08/22 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2000/08/22 11:00'],"['2000/08/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/22 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.192.4.483 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 2000 Aug 21;192(4):483-94. doi: 10.1084/jem.192.4.483.,,,,,,PMC2193234,,,,,

Previously, we and others have used partial hepatectomy for induction of hepatocellular proliferation for gene transfer to the liver in vivo by exsanguineous perfusion with rMo-MuLV. We hypothesized that induction of hepatocellular proliferation by combined administration of two hepatocellular mitogens, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and triiodothyronine (T3), should permit rMo-MuLV-mediated gene transfer into liver without invasive approaches. METHODS: HGF (1 mg/kg) was perfused continuously into the portal vein of Wistar male rats and T3 (2 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously. Twenty-four hours after injecting HGF and T3, the state of proliferation of hepatocytes was estimated from the incorporation of 5'-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU). The amphotropic retroviral receptor (Ram-1) expression of liver was evaluated at different time points after injecting HGF and T3 by means of Northern blotting using Ram-1 cDNA probe. In order to evaluate the role of hormone treatment on gene transfer, the liver was perfused exsanguineously with rMoMuLV 24 h after injection with hormones. RESULTS: Rats treated with a combination of HGF and T3 expressed BrdU and beta-galactosidase in 8.3% and 0.7% of hepatocytes, respectively. On the other hand, there was near absence of gene transfer in untreated rats perfused with rMoMuLV Twenty-four hours after the initial manipulation, abundant expression of Ram-1 mRNA was observed in rat hepatocytes treated with HGF plus T3. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation of hepatocellular mitosis and upregulation of Ram-1 expression by HGF and T3 augment retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hepatocytes.","['Minami, H', 'Tada, K', 'Chowdhury, N R', 'Chowdhury, J R', 'Onji, M']","['Minami H', 'Tada K', 'Chowdhury NR', 'Chowdhury JR', 'Onji M']","['The Third Department of Internal Medicine, Ehime University School of Medicine, Japan. hisakami@m.ehime-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,"['06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*administration & dosage/physiology', 'Liver/pathology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Triiodothyronine/*administration & dosage/physiology']",,2000/08/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/22 11:00'],"['2000/08/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/22 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-8278(00)80358-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-8278(00)80358-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 2000 Aug;33(2):183-8. doi: 10.1016/s0168-8278(00)80358-x.,,,,,,,,,,,

Parental occupational exposure to different chemicals and industrial dusts or fumes also was assessed in three German case-control studies that were conducted from 1992-1997. The design and methods of exposure assessment were similar for these studies; therefore, they were pooled for this analysis. In total, these three studies involved 1138 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 2962 controls. We found that maternal exposure to paints or lacquers during the preconception period (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.4) and during the index pregnancy (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.3) was related to an increased risk of childhood ALL. Whereas our findings for exposure to paints or lacquers confirmed observations from the United States study, we failed to confirm associations between risk of ALL and maternal exposure to solvents and parental exposure to plastic materials. Our studies provide some evidence that parental occupational exposure to certain substances may be associated with cancer risk in offspring; however, more specific studies are needed to identify such substances and the doses that may be hazardous.","['Schuz, J', 'Kaletsch, U', 'Meinert, R', 'Kaatsch, P', 'Michaelis, J']","['Schuz J', 'Kaletsch U', 'Meinert R', 'Kaatsch P', 'Michaelis J']","['Institut fur Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation der Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat Mainz, Germany. schuez@imsd.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', '*Maternal Exposure', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Odds Ratio', 'Paint/adverse effects', 'Paternal Exposure', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects']",,2000/08/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/22 11:00'],"['2000/08/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/22 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2000 Aug;9(8):835-8.,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxic activity of MLs against tumor cells is due to programmed cell death (apoptosis). The up- or down-regulation of protein kinase A (PKA) or C (PKC) is known to be associated with the regulation of drug-induced apoptosis. Previously, we isolated cytotoxic MLII from the extract of Korean mistletoe (Viscum album var. Coloratum) and characterized its biochemical properties. The present study was designed to investigate the role of PKA and PKC in MLII-induced apoptosis. Exposure of human leukemia HL-60 cells to various doses of MLII resulted in apoptosis. However, the treatment of these cells with dibutyl-cyclic AMP (DB-cAMP), PKA activator, or 12-O-tertadecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), PKC activator, suppressed MLII-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, KT5720 and staurospoline, PKA and PKC inhibitors, respectively, reversed the suppression by DB-cAMP and TPA in the MLII-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells. These results suggest that the activation of PKA or PKC was involved in the suppression of MLII-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that activation of PKA or PKC in HL-60 cells may confer protection against MLII-induced apoptosis.","['Pae, H O', 'Seo, W G', 'Shin, M', 'Lee, H S', 'Lee, H S', 'Kim, S B', 'Chung, H T']","['Pae HO', 'Seo WG', 'Shin M', 'Lee HS', 'Lee HS', 'Kim SB', 'Chung HT']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wonkwang University School of Medicine, Iksan, Chonbug, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '0 (ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum)', '58HV29I28S (KT 5720)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', '*Carbazoles', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Lectins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Mistletoe', 'Plant Lectins', '*Plant Preparations', '*Plant Proteins', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Toxins, Biological/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",,2000/08/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/22 11:00'],"['2000/08/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/22 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08923970009016421 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2000 May;22(2):279-95. doi: 10.3109/08923970009016421.,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, the TUR cell variant, which is deficient in PKCbeta, failed to respond to TPA with release of cytochrome c and induction of the caspase-3 cascade. Moreover, stable overexpression of PKCbeta in TUR cells reconstituted sensitivity to TPA-induced cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3.

These findings demonstrate that TPA induces cytochrome c release by a PKCbeta-dependent mechanism and that activation of caspase-mediated signaling is required for induction of the differentiated monocytic phenotype.","['Pandey, P', 'Nakazawa, A', 'Ito, Y', 'Datta, R', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Kufe, D']","['Pandey P', 'Nakazawa A', 'Ito Y', 'Datta R', 'Kharbanda S', 'Kufe D']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Caspase 1/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Serpins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Viral Proteins']",,2000/08/22 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/22 11:00'],"['2000/08/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/22 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203751 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Aug 10;19(34):3941-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203751.,,"['CA29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Recently, Pim-1 has been shown to enhance the activities of p100, c-Myb and cdc25a, and in part this might explain reported effects on mitogenesis. In the context of cytokine withdrawal, Pim-1 also can attenuate programmed cell death (PCD). Cytokine withdrawal, however, alters signaling pathways and can complicate the dissection of mitogenic vs apoptotic responses. To better study possible effects of Pim-1 on PCD, a hematopoietic cell model was developed in which proliferation was supported efficiently by SCF plus EPO in the absence of endogenous Pim-1 gene expression. This was provided by factor-dependent FDCW2 cells that express endogenous and functional c-Kit, and were transfected stably with truncated Epo receptor form mutated at a Y343 STAT5 binding site. In proliferating cells, exogenously expressed Pim-1 was observed to efficiently inhibit PCD as induced by either Co60 or adriamycin, and the dose-dependent nature of this effect was established in several independent clones. By comparison, effects of exogenous Pim-1 on mitogenesis were nominal. In addition, in cell fractionation studies an estimated 25% of Mr 34000 Pim-1 (but not Mr 44000 Pim-1) was present in nuclear extracts. Thus, Pim-1 efficiently buffers hematopoietic progenitor cells against death as induced by several clinically important apoptotic agents, and may directly target nuclear effectors.","['Pircher, T J', 'Zhao, S', 'Geiger, J N', 'Joneja, B', 'Wojchowski, D M']","['Pircher TJ', 'Zhao S', 'Geiger JN', 'Joneja B', 'Wojchowski DM']","['Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cobalt/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutagens/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1']",,2000/08/22 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/22 11:00'],"['2000/08/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/22 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203684 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Jul 27;19(32):3684-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203684.,,['HLR0144491/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

All cytokines induced STAT3 phosphorylation to approximately the same level, but only OSM, and to a lesser extent IL-6, induced STAT5 phosphorylation. The cytokines also stimulated phosphorylation of ERK in the order of decreasing effectiveness: OSM > IL-6 > LIF > IL-10. The same order of activity of the cytokines was observed on inhibition of DNA synthesis and accumulation of cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle. These processes were accompanied by a decrease in cyclin A expression and CDK2 activity, and enhanced accumulation of p27kip1. The level of p27kip1 mRNA expression was unaffected by the cytokines, and maintenance of the elevated level of p27kip1 occurred independently of de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, inhibition of proteasomal activity increased the level of p27kip1 in the unstimulated cells to the same level as in OSM-treated cells. Inhibition of MEK activation completely abrogated OSM and IL-6 induced p27kip1 accumulation, while expression of dominant negative STAT5 decreased the OSM and IL-6 mediated inhibition of DNA-synthesis and partially inhibited p27kip1 accumulation.","['Klausen, P', 'Pedersen, L', 'Jurlander, J', 'Baumann, H']","['Klausen P', 'Pedersen L', 'Jurlander J', 'Baumann H']","['Department of Haematology, The Finsen Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cdkn1b protein, rat)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-10)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cytokines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-10', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation']",,2000/08/22 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/22 11:00'],"['2000/08/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/22 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203707 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Jul 27;19(32):3675-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203707.,,['CA 26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In the t(8;21) the AML1 gene on chromosome 21 is fused to ETO on chromosome 8. The resultant hybrid protein is comprised of the DNA binding domain of AML-1 and the majority of ETO. This study examines the subnuclear distributions of ETO, AML-1B and AML-1/ETO proteins fused to green fluorescence protein in living cells using fluorescence microscopy. Further, we identified a 40 amino acid portion of ETO (amino acids 241-280) that was sufficient to cause nuclear import of green fluorescent protein. Mutational analysis demonstrated that lysine 265 and/or arginine 266 were required for nuclear import of ETO, but that the surrounding basic residues were not critical. ETO interacted with the nuclear import proteins importin-alpha and beta in vitro, and mutations in ETO that abolish nuclear localization also abolished the in vitro interaction with importin-alpha and beta. These data suggest that ETO enters the nucleus via an importin-mediated pathway. Additionally, ETO and AML-1/ETO co-localized to punctate nuclear bodies distinct from those containing promyelocytic leukemia protein. Nuclear body formation was dependent upon a region of ETO N-terminal to the nuclear localization signal. Thus, ETO and AML-1/ETO reside in potentially novel subnuclear compartments.","['Odaka, Y', 'Mally, A', 'Elliott, L T', 'Meyers, S']","['Odaka Y', 'Mally A', 'Elliott LT', 'Meyers S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Science Center School of Medicine, Shreveport 71130, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Arginine/genetics/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lysine/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/08/22 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/22 11:00'],"['2000/08/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/22 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203689 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Jul 27;19(32):3584-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203689.,,['CA76186/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LN) are two extracellular matrix (ECM) components that, when combined, promote axon growth in the entubulation model. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal LIF dose and the efficacy of FN plus LN administered either alone or simultaneously with the optimal LIF dose. We found that at 12 weeks following nerve repair, a single 10 ng LIF dose produced the largest medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle mass (P < 0.0001) and maximum force contraction (P < 0.001). The diameter of the axons in the FN plus LN group were significantly greater than for saline (P < 0.001) and the LIF dose groups (P < 0.01). When 10 ng LIF was combined with FN plus LN, the MG muscle mass was significantly greater than the optimal LIF dose (P < 0.05), suggesting an additive effect.

In particular, central nervous system (CNS) leukemia has been well controlled by the presymptomatic administration of intrathecal methotrexate (MTX), high dose systemic MTX, and irradiation. However, the prolonged intrathecal administration and/or the administration of high doses of systemic MTX, especially when combined with irradiation, can lead to leukoencephalopathy (LE), a serious CNS complication of such prophylaxis. Because the mechanisms by which MTX causes this complication have not been elucidated, the authors investigated the transmethylation status of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in two children with ALL and LE to investigate the pathophysiology of that disorder. METHODS: The levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) were measured in the CSF of 2 children with ALL and LE, 7 children with ALL only who were undergoing presymptomatic administration of MTX, and 18 reference children in whom diagnostic lumbar puncture was indicated for other reasons. A sensitive, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used with fluorescence detection. RESULTS: The concentrations of SAM in the CSF were lower in the patients with ALL during treatment with MTX compared with the reference children. The SAM levels in the 2 patients with both ALL and LE were slightly lower than the levels in the 7 patients with ALL only. The SAH concentrations in the CSF were higher in the patients with ALL and LE compared with the patients with ALL only and the reference children. The mean concentration of SAH in the CSF was similar in the reference children to that found in the 7 patients with ALL only. The SAM-to-SAH ratios were lower in the 2 patients with ALL and LE and in the 7 patients with ALL only compared with the reference children. The ratios in the patients with ALL and LE were still lower than in those with ALL only, thus providing supporting evidence of hypomethylation in the 2 patients with ALL and LE. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the treatment of children with ALL using MTX causes subclinical hypomethylation and that progressive hypomethylation in the CNS, as evidenced in the 2 patients with ALL and LE, may be responsible for the demyelination in the LE induced by MTX.","['Kishi, T', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Ueda, K']","['Kishi T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Ueda K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima Memorial Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)']",IM,,"['Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*DNA Methylation', 'Dementia, Vascular/complications/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*genetics/metabolism', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism']",,2000/08/22 11:00,2000/09/09 11:01,['2000/08/22 11:00'],"['2000/08/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/09 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/22 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0142(20000815)89:4<925::AID-CNCR28>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20000815)89:4<925::aid-cncr28>3.0.co;2-w [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Aug 15;89(4):925-31. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20000815)89:4<925::aid-cncr28>3.0.co;2-w.,,,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,

The striking fact was the significant epidermal hyperplasia correlating with leukemia inhibitory factor expression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (r = 0.94, p < 0.001).

It was found that, while the components of both amphotropic and ecotropic vectors were expressed independently of each other in a transient transfection system, increasing the amount of the gag/gag-pol component resulted in a decrease in virus titres for the amphotropic particles but not ecotropic particles. Analyses of the virus stocks produced indicated that the negative effect on titres was closely linked to the availability of envelope proteins for virion incorporation. The negative effect was not observed for ecotropic particle production in 293T cells, where the ecotropic receptor was absent, but was manifested when production was conducted in 293/12 cells expressing the ecotropic receptor. This suggested that the premature interaction between envelope and receptor in producer cells could limit the amount of envelope available for virion incorporation. In designing optimal vector production systems it is essential, therefore, to balance the concentration of the vector components and to ensure that there is never an excess of Gag/Gag-Pol.","['Yap, Melvyn W', 'Kingsman, Susan M', 'Kingsman, Alan J']","['Yap MW', 'Kingsman SM', 'Kingsman AJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QU, UK1.', 'Oxford BioMedica (UK) Ltd, The Medawar Centre, The Oxford Science Park, Oxford OX4 4GA, UK2.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QU, UK1.', 'Oxford BioMedica (UK) Ltd, The Medawar Centre, The Oxford Science Park, Oxford OX4 4GA, UK2.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QU, UK1.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Gene Products, pol/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', '*Virus Replication']",,2000/08/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/22 11:00'],"['2000/08/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/22 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-81-9-2195 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2000 Sep;81(Pt 9):2195-2202. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-81-9-2195.,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-81-9-2195 [doi],,,,,,

The expression of the hybrid gene bcr-abl is regulated by the bcr promoter and results in a translation product with high tyrosine kinase activity. In most CML cases, one of two abl promoters (Pa) is nested within the bcr-abl transcription unit, but appears to be usually silent. Recently, de novo methylation of the Pa region and its correlation with disease progression were reported. As these previous studies were limited to the use of methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases, our aim here was to obtain a complete map of methylcytosines and its variants in CML patients and in model cell lines. To achieve this, bisulfite conversion of cytosines (but not methylcytosines) to uracils in genomic DNA was employed. After modification, the region of interest was PCR-amplified and the products were cloned and sequenced. The results show methylation at a high level and in a homogenous pattern in the BV173 cell line, corresponding to the translocated abl alleles. Variant methylation observed in K562 cells correlates with multiple bcr-abl loci and an intact chromosome 9. Patients that were methylation-positive in restriction analysis showed sporadic and heterogenous occurrence of methylcytosines in bisulfite modification assays. Corresponding results were obtained using a quantitative Southern analysis of the extent of methylation. We conclude that restriction analysis combined with PCR is able to find rare cases of hypermethylation, e. g., for diagnostic purposes, but does not reflect the dominating level of methylation in Ph-positive cells.","['Fajkusova, L', 'Fajkus, J', 'Polackova, K', 'Fulnecek, J', 'Dvorakova, D', 'Krahulcova, E']","['Fajkusova L', 'Fajkus J', 'Polackova K', 'Fulnecek J', 'Dvorakova D', 'Krahulcova E']","['Faculty Hospital Brno, II.

However, AML1 showed a different transcription pattern in the neoplastic tissues with respect to the normal B-cells. The AML1b isoform proved to be peculiar to this lymphoma. Our data support the idea that qualitative and quantitative alterations of AML1 gene expression deriving from deregulating mechanisms other than translocations may be involved in this malignancy. The usage of two differently regulated promoters driving the expression of the transcripts AML1b and AML1c may be one of these mechanisms.

There is the perception that survival is worse in the UK than in other countries. However, it is important to compare survival in different series based on accurate prognostic data. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Cancer and Leukaemia Group B (CALGB) have recently published prognostic scoring systems. We have assessed the prognostic variables, validated the EORTC and CALGB prognostic groups, and evaluated survival in a series of 142 patients. METHODS: Case notes of 142 consecutive patients presenting in Leicester since 1988 were reviewed. Univariate analysis of prognostic variables was performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Statistically significant variables were analysed further in a forward, stepwise multivariate model. EORTC and CALGB prognostic groups were derived, Kaplan-Meier survival curves plotted, and survival rates were calculated from life tables. RESULTS: Significant poor prognostic factors in univariate analysis included male sex, older age, weight loss, chest pain, poor performance status, low haemoglobin, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and non-epithelial cell type (p<0.05). The prognostic significance of cell type, haemoglobin, white cell count, performance status, and sex were retained in the multivariate model. Overall median survival was 5.9 (range 0-34.3) months. One and two year survival rates were 21.3% (95% CI 13.9 to 28.7) and 3. 5% (0 to 8.5), respectively. Median, one, and two year survival data within prognostic groups in Leicester were equivalent to the EORTC and CALGB series. Survival curves were successfully stratified by the prognostic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the EORTC and CALGB prognostic scoring systems which should be used both in the assessment of survival data of series in different countries and in the stratification of patients into randomised clinical studies.","['Edwards, J G', 'Abrams, K R', 'Leverment, J N', 'Spyt, T J', 'Waller, D A', ""O'Byrne, K J""]","['Edwards JG', 'Abrams KR', 'Leverment JN', 'Spyt TJ', 'Waller DA', ""O'Byrne KJ""]","['Department of Respiratory Medicine and Thoracic Surgery, Glenfield Hospital NHS Trust, Groby Road, Leicester LE3 9QP, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Thorax,Thorax,0417353,,IM,['Thorax. 2000 Sep;55(9):725-6.

IL-6, LIF, and CNTF are implicated in skeletal muscle regeneration. However, the cell populations that express these receptor components in regenerating muscles are unknown. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, we examined spatiotemporal expression patterns of gp130, IL-6R, LIFR, and CNTFR mRNAs in regenerating muscles after muscle contusion. At the early stages of regeneration (from 3 hr to Day 2 post contusion), significant signals for gp130 and LIFR mRNAs were detected in myonuclei and/or nuclei of muscle precursor cells (mpcs) and in mononuclear cells located in extracellular spaces between myofibers after muscle contusion, but IL-6R mRNA was expressed only in mononuclear cells. At Day 7 post contusion, signals for gp130, LIFR, and IL-6R mRNAs were not detected in newly formed myotubes, whereas the CNTFR mRNA level was upregulated in myotubes. These findings suggest that the upregulation of receptor subunits in distinct cell populations plays an important role in the effective regeneration of both myofibers and motor neurons.

PML levels increased during both ras-induced arrest and replicative senescence, leading to a dramatic increase in the size and number of PODs. Forced PML expression was sufficient to promote premature senescence. Like oncogenic ras, PML increased the levels of p16, hypophosphorylated Rb, phosphoserine-15 p53, and expression of p53 transcriptional targets. The fraction of Rb and p53 that colocalized with PML markedly increased during ras-induced arrest, and expression of PML alone forced p53 to the PODs. E1A abolished PML-induced arrest and prevented PML induction and p53 phosphorylation in response to oncogenic ras. These results imply that PML acts with Rb and p53 to promote ras-induced senescence and provide new insights into PML regulation and activity.","['Ferbeyre, G', 'de Stanchina, E', 'Querido, E', 'Baptiste, N', 'Prives, C', 'Lowe, S W']","['Ferbeyre G', 'de Stanchina E', 'Querido E', 'Baptiste N', 'Prives C', 'Lowe SW']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,,"['Cellular Senescence/*physiology', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '*Up-Regulation']",,2000/08/19 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/19 11:00'],"['2000/08/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Genes Dev. 2000 Aug 15;14(16):2015-27.,,"['R01 AG016379/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AG016379/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG-16379/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC316863,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins that target cell surface antigens on leukemic blasts are being evaluated for their cytotoxic effects and as a means of delivering chemotherapeutic agents or radiation directly to malignant cells. It is hoped that this strategy might selectively ablate malignant cells without many of the toxic effects commonly associated with conventional chemotherapy. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the cell surface antigens CD33 and CD45 are especially suitable targets. Although CD33 is expressed on AML blast cells from about 90% of patients, normal hematopoietic stem cells lack this antigen, as do essentially all nonhematopoietic tissues. For that reason, anti-CD33 antibodies have been created to target malignant myeloid and immature normal cells selectively while sparing normal stem cells. Anti-CD33 antibodies have also been used to deliver radiation or a cytotoxic agent directly to leukemic cells. Since the vast majority of leukemias and normal stem cells express the cell surface antigen CD45, another targeting approach allows the delivery of myeloablative radiation to bone marrow and spleen, common sites of leukemic involvement. Consequently, 131I-labeled anti-CD45 antibody has been combined with traditional preparative regimens for patients receiving bone marrow transplantation for acute leukemia. Finally, fusion proteins such as those combining diphtheria toxin with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to target the GM-CSF receptor are now being evaluated in clinical trials. Both unconjugated and conjugated antibodies have shown promise in early clinical trials, and may represent appealing therapeutic alternatives for patients with AML.","['Sievers, E L']",['Sievers EL'],"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle 98109-1024, USA. esievers@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*therapy']",24,2000/08/19 11:00,2000/09/09 11:01,['2000/08/19 11:00'],"['2000/08/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/09 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/pl00014043 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2000;46 Suppl:S18-22. doi: 10.1007/pl00014043.,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a process for purifying specific transfer factors to apparent homogeneity. This allowed us to separate individual transfer factors from mixtures containing several transfer factors and to demonstrate the antigen-specificity of transfer factors. Transfer factors have been shown to be an effective means for correction of deficient cellular immunity in patients with opportunistic infections, such as candidiasis or recurrent Herpes simplex and to provide prophylactic immunity against varicella-zoster in patients with acute leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transfer factors of bovine and murine origin were purified by affinity chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. Cyanogen bromide digests were sequenced. The properties of an apparently conserved sequence on expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity by transfer factor recipients were assessed. RESULTS: A novel amino acid sequence, LLYAQDL/VEDN, was identified in each of seven transfer factor preparations. These peptides would not transfer expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity to recipients, which indicates that they are not sufficient for expression of the specificity or immunological properties of native transfer factors. However, administration of the peptides to recipients of native transfer factors blocked expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity by the recipients. The peptides were not immunosuppressive. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the peptides may represent the portion of transfer factors that binds to the ""target cells"" for transfer factors. Identification of these cells will be helpful in defining the mechanisms of action of transfer factors.","['Kirkpatrick, C H']",['Kirkpatrick CH'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Transfer Factor)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', '*Conserved Sequence', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Ferritins/immunology', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed/*immunology', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Ovalbumin/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Simplexvirus/immunology', 'Spleen/chemistry/immunology', 'Transfer Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/*immunology/isolation & purification']",,2000/08/19 11:00,2000/09/09 11:01,['2000/08/19 11:00'],"['2000/08/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/09 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Med. 2000 Apr;6(4):332-41.,,,,,,PMC1949950,,,,,

In population of peripheral B cells CD43 occurs only on activated B cells and CD5 positive B cells. These last cells create neoplasm population in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Anti-CD43 monoclonal antibodies are used routinely in investigations of tissue fragments in cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, whereas we did not find publication on theme of CD43 expression on peripheral blood B cells in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Wherefore advisable appeared estimation CD43 expression on B-CLL cells and comparison it with expression of typical B-CLL markers--such as CD5 and CD6. Immunological phenotype of peripheral blood and bone marrow lymphocytes has been evaluated using flow cytometry (Cytoron Absolute Ortho-Diagnostic Systems) and two-color staining. Twenty six untreated patients with B-CLL were studied. Because on well-known correlations between CD43 expression and metastasis potential of tumor, patients were divided on two groups differing score of total tumor mass (score TTM). Score TTM was evaluated according to criterion of Jaksic and Vitale. Twelve patients whose TTM score was equal or lower than 9 and median lymphocytosis was 24.6 x 10(9) in microliter were included in group I. 14 patients whose TTM score was higher than 9 were included in group II. Median lymphocytosis in these patients was 152.6 x 10(9) in microliter. The median percentage of CD43+/CD19+ cells in peripheral blood was 62.6% in the group I, and 75% in the group II (p < 0.05). Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD43 antigen was 87.7 in the I group comparing to 77.4 in the group II. So one observed tendency to lowering MFI during tumor growing but the difference was not significant (p = 0.25). In peripheral blood during progression of disease more clearly than CD43+ cells increased percentage of CD5+ and CD6+ cells. The median percentage of CD19+/CD5+ cells was 62.7% in the group I, 82.4% in the group II and the difference was significant (p < 0.002). The difference in the median percentages CD6+/CD19+ cell 71.8% in group I and 84.3% in the II one were also significant (p < 0.03). MFI of CD5 and also CD6 antigens did not change in course of disease. Moreover, examination of CD43 and CD5 expression in marrow additionally to blood study were performed in 12 cases (6 from group I, 2 from group II and 4 new not included). The median percentage of CD43+/CD19+ cell was 35.1% in blood and 43.7% In marrow, in contrast to these results was the median percentage of CD19+/CD5+ cell, which was higher in peripheral blood (70.4%) than in bone marrow (60.9%). The results of this study indicate that CD43 is present on peripheral blood B-CLL cells. Moreover, percentage of these cell increases during progression of disease however more weakly than percentage of CD5 and CD6 positive cells. Expression of CD43 is independent from expression CD5 and CD6 and diminishes during tumor mass increasing, what can depended from releases exocellular domains of CD43.

Confirming and extending previous results of our laboratory, histological studies have revealed that two temporally separate peaks of CR can be detected throughout tumor evolution. The first peak induced by immunogenic small tumors, in euthymic but not in nude mice, is associated with extensive necrosis of the secondary tumor implant and a profuse infiltration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes and mononuclear cells resulting in its final destruction; these features correspond to a typical immunological rejection. The second peak of CR induced by both immunogenic and non-immunogenic large tumors, in euthymic as well as in nude mice, is characterized by a dormant tumor stage with scarce or null mononuclear infiltration, associated with a significant reduction of tumor mitotic index and of the number of PCNA+ cells along with an increase in apoptosis and an arrest in S phase. In previous reports we suggested that a 1000 D serum fraction from mice bearing large tumors could be responsible for the induction of this dormant tumor stage. In this study tumor cells incubated in vitro with that serum factor mimicked the inhibition and cellular alterations observed in vivo in the secondary tumor inhibited by the second peak of CR. Moreover, the passive transfer of this factor by the intra-peritoneal (i.p.) route induced an in vivo inhibition of an i.p. tumor reproducing the image characteristic of the second peak of CR. This represents a direct proof that this serum factor can restrain tumor growth in vivo and that it is, most probably, the effector of the second peak of CR.","['Franco, M', 'Bustuoabad, O D', 'Di Gianni, P D', 'Meiss, R P', 'Vanzulli, S', 'Buggiano, V', 'Pasqualini, C D', 'Ruggiero, R A']","['Franco M', 'Bustuoabad OD', 'Di Gianni PD', 'Meiss RP', 'Vanzulli S', 'Buggiano V', 'Pasqualini CD', 'Ruggiero RA']","['Division Medicina Experimental, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas and Instituto de Estudios Oncologicos, Academia Nacional de Medicina, 1425 Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,['0 (Blood Proteins)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blood Proteins/immunology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Female', 'Fibrosarcoma/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Immunity, Innate/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/immunology/prevention & control']",,2000/08/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/19 11:00'],"['2000/08/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.7.5.1053 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2000 Sep-Oct;7(5):1053-63. doi: 10.3892/or.7.5.1053.,,,,,,,,,,,

However, experimental evidence indicates that, in practice, under biologically relevant conditions, the spatial resolution of CLSM is limited to about 300 nm in the lateral direction and about 700 nm in the axial direction. To overcome this shortcoming, the use of a recently developed light microscopical approach, spectral precision distance microscopy (SPDM) is established. This approach is based on the precise localization of small labelling sites of a given target in spectrally differential images. By means of quantitative image analysis, the bary centres (intensity weighted centroid analogous to the centre of mass) of these independently registered labelling sites can be used as point markers for distance and angle measurements after appropriate calibration of optical aberrations (here, polychromatic shifts). In combination with specific labelling of very small chromatin target sites with dyes of different spectral signatures by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), SPDM presently allows us to analyse the nuclear topology in three-dimensionally conserved nuclei with a 'resolution equivalent', many times smaller than the conventional optical resolution. Chronic myelogeneous leukaemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the fusion of parts of the BCR and ABL genes on chromosomes 22 and 9, respectively. In most cases, the fusion leads to a translocation t(9; 22) producing the Philadelphia chromosome. SPDM was applied to analyse the 3D chromatin structure of the BCR region on the intact chromosome 22 and the BCR-ABL fusion gene on the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) by using a new triple-colour FISH protocol: two different DNA probes were used to detect the BCR region and the third DNA probe was used to identify the location of the ABL gene. Consistent 3D distance measurements down to values considerably smaller than 100 nm were performed. The angle distributions between the three labelled sites on the Philadelphia chromosome territory were compared to two state-of-the-art computer models of nuclear chromatin structure. Significant differences between measured and simulated angle distributions were obtained, indicating a complex and non-random angle distribution.","['Esa, A', 'Edelmann, P', 'Kreth, G', 'Trakhtenbrot, L', 'Amariglio, N', 'Rechavi, G', 'Hausmann, M', 'Cremer, C']","['Esa A', 'Edelmann P', 'Kreth G', 'Trakhtenbrot L', 'Amariglio N', 'Rechavi G', 'Hausmann M', 'Cremer C']","['Applied Optics and Information Processing, Kirchhoff Institute for Physics (KIP), University of Heidelberg, Albert-Ueberle-Str. 3-5, 6920 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Microsc,Journal of microscopy,0204522,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Chromatin/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/*ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Microscopy/methods', 'Models, Molecular', '*Philadelphia Chromosome']",,2000/08/18 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/18 11:00'],"['2000/08/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['jmi707 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2818.2000.00707.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Microsc. 2000 Aug;199(Pt 2):96-105. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2818.2000.00707.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

Of particular interest is the effect of ATP on leukaemia-derived HL-60 and NB4 cell lines, which are induced to mature to neutrophil-like cells. The differentiation process appears to be mediated by ATP binding to a cell-surface purinergic P2Y receptor, resulting in the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, elevation of cAMP levels and activation of protein kinase A. In 1997, a novel ATP-selective P2Y receptor, P2Y11, was cloned and shown to be linked to both cAMP and Ca2+ signalling pathways. The pharmacological profile of ATP analogues used by P2Y11 for cAMP production in transfected cells is reviewed in the present paper and shown to be closely similar to the profiles for cAMP production and differentiation of myeloblastic HL-60 cells and promyelocytic NB4 cells, both of which express P2Y11. Additional data are provided showing that HL-60 mature to neutrophil-like cells in response to extracellular ATP, as measured by upregulation of the N-formyl peptide receptor, N-formyl peptide-mediated actin polymerization and superoxide production. It is proposed that P2Y11 is responsible for the ATP-mediated differentiation of these cells lines and that this receptor may play a role in the maturation of granulocytic progenitors in the bone marrow.","['van der Weyden, L', 'Conigrave, A D', 'Morris, M B']","['van der Weyden L', 'Conigrave AD', 'Morris MB']","['Faculty of Pharmacy and Department of Biochemistry, The University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (P2RY11 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Actins/analysis', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Superoxides/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",68,2000/08/18 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/18 11:00'],"['2000/08/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['icb918 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1440-1711.2000.00918.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 2000 Aug;78(4):369-74. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1711.2000.00918.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to obtain effective oligonucleotides of the desired function in vivo is still a difficult task. RESULTS: To evaluate the usefulness of synthesized DNA/RNA hammerhead ribozymes targeting AML1-MTG8 (ETO) leukaemic fusion transcripts in vivo, we analysed their effects on cell growth and the mechanism of action using isolated cell nuclei. These ribozymes inhibited the growth of leukaemic cell lines expressing the AML1 -MTG8 and degraded AML1-MTG8 mRNA in isolated nuclei of these cells. However, the reactions gave rise to additional cleavage products. Systematic cleavage analyses using an anti-sense oligonucleotide array revealed that the cleavage was induced by endogenous RNase H at specific sites, in accordance with their calculated melting temperature (Tm) values. With suppression of RNase H by sulfhydryl agents, the DNA/RNA ribozyme had a ribozyme catalytic activity. In addition, the ribozymes and anti-sense oligonucleotides suppressed the AML1-MTG8 protein in the leukaemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: The DNA/RNA ribozymes inhibited cell growth primarily via anti-sense effects, the main role of which was the activation of RNase H-digestion by their DNA arms. In addition, the isolated nuclei provided a useful assay system for modelling in vivo conditions for the quantitative evaluation of anti-sense/ribozyme activity.","['Kozu, T', 'Sugio, Y', 'Fukuyama, T', 'Sueoka, E', 'Otsuka, T', 'Akagi, K']","['Kozu T', 'Sugio Y', 'Fukuyama T', 'Sueoka E', 'Otsuka T', 'Akagi K']","['Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Ina, Saitama 362-0806, Japan. kozu@cancer-c.pref.saitama.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antisense Elements (Genetics))', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,,"['Antisense Elements (Genetics)', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes/*pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Catalytic/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,2000/08/18 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/18 11:00'],"['2000/08/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['gtc353 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2443.2000.00353.x [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2000 Aug;5(8):637-47. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2443.2000.00353.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

All the resulting plasmids were tested by transfection in HeLa and CHO cells. In the bicistronic mRNAs without IRES, the expression of the CAT gene was dependent on the distance between the two cistrons. The maximum efficiency in the expression of the second cistron was obtained when the intercalating RNA was composed of 30 to 90 nucleotides. This expression was deeply reduced when the intercalating fragment contained 8 or 300 nucleotides and was undetectable with 500 nucleotides. Unexpectedly, the luciferase mRNA was almost not expressed when the intercalating RNA was of 8 or 30 nucleotides. Expression of the luciferase gene occurred when the intercistronic RNA fragment was of 80 nucleotides and it became lower at 300 and 500 nucleotides. The same observations were done when the poliovirus or the SUR IRESs were added after the intercistronic spacers. However, expression of the CAT gene was amplified by both IRESs. When the CAT cistron preceded by the poliovirus or SUR IRES was introduced within luciferase cistron, 316 nucleotides before its termination codon, the IRESs were able to initiate translation of the following CAT gene irrespectively of the mRNA luciferase reading frame. Moreover, with all these constructs the highest expression level of the CAT cistron did not exceed 10% of that obtained with the same vector carrying only the CAT cistron. To identify a possible relation between the IRESs and the cap site, the CAT cistron preceded or not with an IRES was introduced 210 nucleotides downstream of the AUG codon of the luciferase gene (i.e., 258 nucleotides from the cap site) and 100 nucleotides after an added UAG termination codon. Expression of the CAT gene was not modified by the addition of the poliovirus IRES but it was strongly stimulated by the SUR IRES (the level of expression corresponded to 65% of that obtained with the same vector carrying only the CAT cistron). These results suggest that there is a cooperation between the cap and the SUR IRES and not the poliovirus IRES to stimulate translation. These data indicate that IRESs must be introduced in precise position to allow an efficient expression of the second cistron in bicistronic mRNAs.","['Attal, J', 'Theron, M C', 'Puissant, C', 'Houdebine, L M']","['Attal J', 'Theron MC', 'Puissant C', 'Houdebine LM']","['Unite de Differenciation Cellulaire, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Jouy en Josas, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Gene Expr,Gene expression,9200651,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Poliovirus/genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Ribosomes/genetics']",,2000/08/18 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/18 11:00'],"['2000/08/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/18 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gene Expr. 1999;8(5-6):299-309.,,,,,,PMC6157382,,,,,

The cephalic vein cutdown approach is used only infrequently. Although the technique has been well described, few prospective data are available on the cephalic vein cutdown approach. METHODS: From September 9, 1998, to July 20, 1999, the cephalic vein cutdown approach was attempted in 100 consecutive cancer patients taken to the operating room with the intention of placing CICVAD. Median patient age was 54.5 years (range 18-88), with 46 men and 54 women. Twenty-five patients had gastrointestinal malignancies, 17 had breast cancer, 15 had lymphoma, 13 had lung cancer, 12 had leukemia, 5 had multiple myeloma, and 13 had other malignancies. Patients were followed prospectively for immediate and long-term outcome. RESULTS: CICVAD placement via the cephalic vein cutdown approach was successful in 82 patients; the remaining 18 patients required conversion to a percutaneous subclavian vein approach. The reasons for inability to place CICVAD via cephalic vein cutdown approach were a cephalic vein that was too small (10 patients), an absent cephalic vein (7 patients), and inability to traverse the angle of insertion of the cephalic vein into the subclavian vein (1 patient). There were 56 subcutaneous ports and 26 tunneled catheters. Median operating time was 44 minutes (range, 26-79 minutes). No postoperative pneumothorax occurred. Median catheter duration was 198 days (range, 0-513 days). Long-term complications included catheter-related bacteremia (6%), site infection (2%), deep venous thrombosis (5%), port pocket hematoma (1%), and superior vena cava stricture (1%). Thirty-seven percent of patients have died since CICVAD placement. Twenty-nine percent of the CICVADs have been removed. CONCLUSIONS: The cephalic vein cutdown approach was successful in 82% of patients. This approach is a safe and useful alternative to the percutaneous subclavian vein approach.","['Povoski, S P']",['Povoski SP'],"['Department of Surgery, West Virginia University, Robert C.

Cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal karyotype, and no p53 mutation in exons 5-9 was detected. This cell line is tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. Histological findings by light and electron microscopy, such as the absence of follicular structures and the existence of intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions and psammoma bodies, indicated transplanted tumors to be a poorly differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. A low expression level of thyroglobulin was detected by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 and PAX-8 was also detected. No mRNA expression of TSH receptors, thyroid peroxidase, or Na+/I- symporter was detected. Interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor were secreted into the medium. These findings suggest this cell line to be functionally poorly differentiated. Moreover, all-trans-retinoic acid increased the mRNA expression of thyroglobulin and decreased both the mRNA expression and secretion of interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor while significantly stimulating growth. RT-PCR analysis of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) revealed that KTC-1 cells express a moderate level of RARalpha and -gamma, but a low level of RARbeta.

SHP2 is a two-SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase that is activated by many cytokines and growth factors. SHP2 counteracts the activation of transcription factors of the STAT family and the induction of IL-6-responsive genes. Tyrosine 759 of gp130, the signal transducing subunit of the IL-6R complex, is essential for the phosphorylation of SHP2. Mutation of tyrosine 759 to phenylalanine leads to an enhanced inducibility of IL-6-dependent genes. Here we demonstrate that no further tyrosines in the cytoplasmic part of gp130 are required for the phosphorylation of SHP2. We also tested whether the tyrosine 759 motifs in both subunits of the gp130 dimer are required for SHP2 association and tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, one SHP2-recruiting phosphotyrosine motif in a single chain of the gp130 dimer is sufficient to mediate SHP2 association to the gp130 receptor subunit and its tyrosine phosphorylation as well as to attenuate IL-6-dependent gene induction. Furthermore, we show that repression of gene induction via Y759 does not require the presence of the SHP2 and STAT recruitment sites within the same receptor subunit, but within the same receptor complex. The Y759 motif in gp130 also attenuates gene induction mediated by the oncostatin M and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor complexes, which both contain gp130 as the shared subunit.","['Anhuf, D', 'Weissenbach, M', 'Schmitz, J', 'Sobota, R', 'Hermanns, H M', 'Radtke, S', 'Linnemann, S', 'Behrmann, I', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Schaper, F']","['Anhuf D', 'Weissenbach M', 'Schmitz J', 'Sobota R', 'Hermanns HM', 'Radtke S', 'Linnemann S', 'Behrmann I', 'Heinrich PC', 'Schaper F']","['Department of Biochemistry, Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule (RWTH), Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/chemistry/physiology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Dimerization', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tyrosine/chemistry/genetics', 'src Homology Domains/immunology']",,2000/08/18 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/18 11:00'],"['2000/08/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['ji_v165n5p2535 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.165.5.2535 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Sep 1;165(5):2535-43. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.5.2535.,,,,,,,,,,,

Using NCI-N417 as a tester, we obtained 28 differentially expressed cDNA clones from a total of 60 arbitrarily picked clones. Among the 28 cDNA clones, 4 were unknown genes, 2 were fatty acid binding protein (FABP) with specific identification of mRNA for mammary-derived growth inhibitor (MDGI), 1 was human alpha-enolase, 4 were ribosomal proteins, 2 were structural genes, vimentin and moesin (membrane-organizing extension spike protein), and 9 were homologous with murine leukemia viruses, whereas 2 others had enhanced expression in NCI-H69 and A549 cell lines, and 4 were cell surface proteins and murine type C retrovirus. Expression of FABP/MDGI was significantly high in NCI-H417, which may influence mitosis and cell growth as implicated in other tissues, contrary to the conclusion drawn for the role of MDGI in human breast cancer. Higher expression of ribosomal proteins in NCI-N417 compared to NCI-H69 may have a role in differential tumorigenicity and metastatic ability. Further, we obtained 14 differentially expressed cDNA clones by reversing the tester and driver, using NCI-H69 as a tester. Of these 14 differential cDNAs, 5 were unknown genes, 2 were specific for keratins, others had similarities with protease inhibitor, human BAC clone, Alu RNA binding protein, and tumor expression-enhanced gene.

One possibility is the phosphorylation of a 78-kDa mast cell protein, two fragments of which are homologous to moesin, a member of the ezrin, radixin, moesin family. These proteins appear to be involved in signal transduction by regulating functional associations between the cell surface and the cytoskeleton. Moesin cDNA was cloned from rat basophil leukemia cells, which are similar to mucosal mast cells, and polyclonal antiserum was prepared against recombinant moesin expressed in Escherichia coli. Moesin phosphorylated in mast cells treated with cromolyn shifted from the soluble to the precipitable fraction and associated with Sepharose-linked beta-actin. Recombinant moesin also associated with Sepharose-linked beta-actin, and so did purified RBL moesin, but only if the latter was first denatured. Moesin thus appears to have actin binding sites that are not exposed under normal conditions but may become available by in vivo phosphorylation or by denaturation. Immunocytochemistry using confocal microscopy showed moesin to be primarily localized on the inner aspect of the plasma membrane and around secretory granules. Double immunocytochemistry for moesin and actin colocalized them in most areas. Ultracryoimmunoelectron microscopy to preserve the antigenicity of moesin identified the protein close to the plasma and secretory granule membranes.

Cytogenetic and phenotypic analysis confirmed that the cells were derived from the patient's leukemic cells. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) acts as an autocrine growth factor in these cells. In addition, OPM-6 cells were particularly sensitive to dexamethasone (DEX), when endogenous IGF-1 was blocked. Under these conditions, >95% of the DEX-treated cells died within 36 h. Therefore, OPM-6 represents a potentially powerful tool for the analysis of the molecular mechanisms of DEX-induced apoptosis, because it is possible to easily analyze the direct effects of DEX using this system. Using this culture system of OPM-6, we demonstrated that the treatment with DEX plus a monoclonal antibody to the human IGF-1 receptor (alphaIGF-1R) leads to the down-regulation of the gene expression of Bcl-xL, an antiapoptotic gene, and the activation of CPP32 during this apoptotic process. IFN-alpha as well as IL-6 prevented DEX plus alphaIGF-1R-induced apoptosis, and this prevention was blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, PD098059, or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Therefore, both IL-6 and IFN-alpha blocked DEX plus alphaIGF-1R-induced apoptosis through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways.","['Ogawa, M', 'Nishiura, T', 'Oritani, K', 'Yoshida, H', 'Yoshimura, M', 'Okajima, Y', 'Ishikawa, J', 'Hashimoto, K', 'Matsumura, I', 'Tomiyama, Y', 'Matsuzawa, Y']","['Ogawa M', 'Nishiura T', 'Oritani K', 'Yoshida H', 'Yoshimura M', 'Okajima Y', 'Ishikawa J', 'Hashimoto K', 'Matsumura I', 'Tomiyama Y', 'Matsuzawa Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Molecular Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism/physiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/*pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta', 'Receptors, Interferon/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*pathology']",,2000/08/17 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/17 11:00'],"['2000/08/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/17 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Aug 1;60(15):4262-9.,,,,,,,,,,,

Because such resistance is likely to result from impaired drug-induced apoptosis, it is clearly important to understand the mechanisms involved in this process. Whereas p53 can contribute to the nucleoside-induced killing of CLL cells, recent work from this laboratory and elsewhere has shown that such killing can also occur by p53-independent mechanisms. Because poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-mediated NAD+/ATP depletion has been implicated in the nucleoside-induced killing of normal resting lymphocytes, we postulated that this mechanism might account for the p53-independent component of nucleoside cytotoxicity in CLL. To address this question, we used 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) at a concentration (200 microM) known to produce selective inhibition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in intact cells and examined nucleoside-induced killing using a number of different end points (cell membrane disruption, cell shrinkage, mitochondrial depolarization, exposure of phosphatidyl serine, morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, and PARP-1 cleavage). In 27 of the 30 cases of CLL examined, 3AB delayed nucleoside-induced cell membrane disruption without inhibiting other manifestations of cytotoxicity. This indicates that PARP activity, rather than contributing to the induction of cell killing, was accelerating cell membrane disruption during the late stages of apoptosis. This novel observation has important implications for previous studies of PARP-mediated cytotoxicity. However, in cells from one CLL patient, 3AB inhibited all manifestations of nucleoside cytotoxicity; this was the only case in the study known to have a p53 gene defect affecting both alleles. This indicates that PARP activity can occasionally be central to nucleoside-induced killing and that such PARP-mediated killing is p53 independent.","['Pettitt, A R', 'Sherrington, P D', 'Cawley, J C']","['Pettitt AR', 'Sherrington PD', 'Cawley JC']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/physiology', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2000/08/17 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/17 11:00'],"['2000/08/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/17 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Aug 1;60(15):4187-93.,,,,,,,,,,,

This synthetic drug has a broad spectrum of antitumor activity against many human solid tumor xenografts and is currently undergoing clinical trials. We investigated the induction of apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia cells treated with TAS-103. The treatment of proliferating human leukemia cells for 24 h with various concentrations of the drug induces significant variations in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta(psi)mt) measured by flow cytometry using the fluorochromes 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide, Mitotracker Red, and tetrachloro-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide. The collapse of delta(psi)mt is accompanied by a marked decrease of the intracellular pH. Cleavage experiments with the substrates N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-pNA, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and pro-caspase-3 reveal unambiguously that caspase-3 is a key mediator of the apoptotic pathway induced by TAS-103. Caspase-8 is also cleaved, and the bcl-2 oncoprotein is underexpressed. Drug-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the externalization of phosphatidylserine residues in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane were also characterized. The cell cycle perturbations produced by TAS-103 can be connected with the changes in deltapsi(mt). At low concentrations (2-25 nM), the drug induces a marked G2 arrest and concomitantly provokes an increase in the potential of mitochondrial membranes. In contrast, treatment of the HL-60 cells with higher drug concentrations (50 nM to 1 microM) triggers massive apoptosis and a collapse of deltaP(mt) that is a signature for the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pores. The discovery of a correlation between the G2 arrest and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential provides an important mechanistic insight into the action of TAS-103.","['Kluza, J', 'Lansiaux, A', 'Wattez, N', 'Mahieu, C', 'Osheroff, N', 'Bailly, C']","['Kluza J', 'Lansiaux A', 'Wattez N', 'Mahieu C', 'Osheroff N', 'Bailly C']","['INSERM U-524 and Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, IRCL, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Indenes)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'YVC96489QV', '(6-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)amino)-3-hydroxy-7H-indeno(2,1-c)quinolin-7-one)']",IM,,"['Aminoquinolines/*toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Activators/toxicity', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Indenes/*toxicity', 'Intercalating Agents/*toxicity', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",,2000/08/17 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/17 11:00'],"['2000/08/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/17 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Aug 1;60(15):4077-84.,,['GM33944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The results showed that PDT with 5-ALA plus PH-1126 at a low dose (2.5 mg/kg.bw) were well tolerated by both animal models, with resultant synergistically enhanced inhibition of tumor growth and/or survival advantage for the treated animals. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the usefulness of the combination of a low dose PH-1126 with 5-ALA for PDT of experimental tumors in vivo.","['Jin, Z H', 'Miyoshi, N', 'Ishiguro, K', 'Takaoka, K', 'Udagawa, T', 'Tajiri, H', 'Ueda, K', 'Fukuda, M', 'Kumakiri, M']","['Jin ZH', 'Miyoshi N', 'Ishiguro K', 'Takaoka K', 'Udagawa T', 'Tajiri H', 'Ueda K', 'Fukuda M', 'Kumakiri M']","['Department of Dermatology, Fukui Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '1406-65-1 (Chlorophyll)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'IA2WNI2HO2 (pheophorbide a)']",IM,,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chlorophyll/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Leukemia L5178/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis']",,2000/08/17 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/17 11:00'],"['2000/08/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/17 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 2000 Jul-Aug;14(4):529-33.,,,,,,,,,,,

Consecutively registered newly diagnosed adult AML patients were randomized to receive either daunorubicin (40 mg/m2/day x 4 or more), behenoyl cytarabine (200 mg/m2/day x 10 or more) and 6-mercaptopurine (70 mg/m2/day x 10 or more) (BH-AC-DM), or the same three drugs plus etoposide (100 mg/m2/day x 5) (BH-AC-EDM) for response-oriented individualized induction therapy. The patients achieving complete remission (CR) received the same 3 courses of consolidation therapy followed by 6 courses of maintenance/intensification therapy. M3 was excluded and M0 was included. Of 667 patients registered, 655 were evaluable. The median age was 49 years (range, 15 to 85). CR rates were 77% in the BH-AC-DM group and 75% in the BH-AC-EDM group.

Ninety-two previously untreated adult AML patients admitted to our hospital were analyzed for the dose of DNR required for complete remission (CR), the CR rate, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The induction therapy consisted of DNR (40 mg/m2/d, i.v., from D 1 until the marrow was hypoplastic), Ara-C, prednisolone, and/or 6-thioguanine. Eighty-three out of 92 patients were assessable. Sixty-three patients entered CR (76%), of whom 52 attained CR with the first course of induction therapy. The 10-year DFS and OS rates were 31.2% and 42.3%, respectively. The median total dose of DNR in the induction therapy was 280 mg/m2 (120-480 mg/m2), which was not influenced by initial WBC count, or FAB type. These results indicate that when the dose is linked to the observed tumor response, the optimal dose of DNR in the induction therapy is around 280 mg/m2 (40 mg/m2 x 7 times), which is higher than the conventional dose of 40-60 mg/m2 for 3 days.

We conducted a pooled analysis based on individual records from nine studies, including the most recent ones. Studies with 24/48-hour magnetic field measurements or calculated magnetic fields were included. We specified which data analyses we planned to do and how to do them before we commenced the work. The use of individual records allowed us to use the same exposure definitions, and the large numbers of subjects enabled more precise estimation of risks at high exposure levels. For the 3203 children with leukaemia and 10 338 control children with estimated residential magnetic field exposures levels < 0.4 microT, we observed risk estimates near the no effect level, while for the 44 children with leukaemia and 62 control children with estimated residential magnetic field exposures >/= 0.4 microT the estimated summary relative risk was 2.00 (1.27-3.13), P value = 0.002). Adjustment for potential confounding variables did not appreciably change the results. For North American subjects whose residences were in the highest wire code category, the estimated summary relative risk was 1.24 (0.82-1.87). Thus, we found no evidence in the combined data for the existence of the so-called wire-code paradox. In summary, the 99.2% of children residing in homes with exposure levels < 0.4 microT had estimates compatible with no increased risk, while the 0.8% of children with exposures >/= 0.4 microT had a relative risk estimate of approximately 2, which is unlikely to be due to random variability. The explanation for the elevated risk is unknown, but selection bias may have accounted for some of the increase.","['Ahlbom, A', 'Day, N', 'Feychting, M', 'Roman, E', 'Skinner, J', 'Dockerty, J', 'Linet, M', 'McBride, M', 'Michaelis, J', 'Olsen, J H', 'Tynes, T', 'Verkasalo, P K']","['Ahlbom A', 'Day N', 'Feychting M', 'Roman E', 'Skinner J', 'Dockerty J', 'Linet M', 'McBride M', 'Michaelis J', 'Olsen JH', 'Tynes T', 'Verkasalo PK']","['Division of Epidemiology, National Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Bias', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk']",,2000/08/17 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/17 11:00'],"['2000/08/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/17 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/bjoc.2000.1376 [doi]', 'S0007092000913764 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2000 Sep;83(5):692-8. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2000.1376.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Cancer Research Campaign.'],,PMC2363518,,,,,

Recently, it has been reported that a broad spectrum inhibitor of caspases, the tripeptide Z-VAD-fmk, induced a switch from apoptosis to necrosis in dexamethasone-treated B lymphocytes and thymocytes. As such a cell death conversion could increase the efficiency of radiation therapy and in order to identify the caspases involved in this cell death transition, we investigated the effects of caspase-3-related proteases inhibition in irradiated MOLT-4 cells. Cells were pretreated with Ac-DEVD-CHO, an inhibitor of caspase-3-like activity, and submitted to X-rays at doses ranging from 1 to 4 Gy. Our results show that the inhibition of caspase-3-like activity prevents completely the appearance of the classical hallmarks of apoptosis such as internucleosomal DNA fragmentation or hypodiploid particles formation and partially the externalization of phosphatidylserine. However, this was not accompanied by any persistent increase in cell survival. Instead, irradiated cells treated by this inhibitor exhibited characteristics of a necrotic cell death. Therefore, functional caspase-3-subfamily not only appears as key proteases in the execution of the apoptotic process, but their activity may also influence the type of cell death following an exposure to ionizing radiation.","['Coelho, D', 'Holl, V', 'Weltin, D', 'Lacornerie, T', 'Magnenet, P', 'Dufour, P', 'Bischoff, P']","['Coelho D', 'Holl V', 'Weltin D', 'Lacornerie T', 'Magnenet P', 'Dufour P', 'Bischoff P']","['Laboratoire de Cancerologie Experimentale et de Radiobiologie, IRCAD, Hopitaux Universitaires, BP 426, Strasbourg Cedex, F-67091, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '1FN9YD6968 (resazurin)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,,"['Annexin A5/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Death/*radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Necrosis', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', '*Oxazines', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Propidium/pharmacology', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Rays', '*Xanthenes']",,2000/08/17 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/17 11:00'],"['2000/08/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/17 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/bjoc.2000.1322 [doi]', 'S0007092000913223 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2000 Sep;83(5):642-9. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2000.1322.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Cancer Research Campaign.'],,PMC2363500,,,,,

These results suggest that inhibition of IL-1alpha activity by either neutralizing antibody against IL-1alpha or chemical inhibitor of IL-1alpha processing may prevent invasion and metastasis of breast cancer.","['Nozaki, S', 'Sledge, G W Jr', 'Nakshatri, H']","['Nozaki S', 'Sledge GW Jr', 'Nakshatri H']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 3.4.24.17 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 3)']",IM,,"['Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Autocrine Communication/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Interleukin-8/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 3/genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Paracrine Communication/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2000/08/17 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/17 11:00'],"['2000/08/17 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/17 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2000.3241 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(00)93241-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 Aug 18;275(1):60-2. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.3241.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 445 children (1975 through 1995) diagnosed with NHL (small noncleaved cell NHL/B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [SNCC NHL/B-ALL], 201 patients; lymphoblastic, 113; large cell, 119; other, 12). Tumor burden was estimated by serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) measurement and reclassification of disease stage irrespective of CNS involvement (modified stage). RESULTS: Thirty-six of 445 children with newly diagnosed NHL had CNS involvement (lymphoma cells in the CSF [n = 23], cranial nerve palsy [n = 9], both features [n = 4]), representing 13%, 7%, and 1% of small noncleaved cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and large-cell cases, respectively. By univariate analysis, CNS disease at diagnosis did not significantly impact event-free survival (P =. 095), whereas stage and LDH did; however, children with CNS disease at diagnosis were at 2.0 times greater risk of death than those without CNS disease at diagnosis. In a multivariate analysis, CNS disease was not significantly associated with either overall or event-free survival, whereas both serum LDH and stage influenced both overall and event-free survival. Among cases of SNCC NHL/B-ALL, CNS disease was significantly associated with event-free and overall survival (univariate analysis); however, in multivariate analysis, only LDH had independent prognostic significance. Elevated serum LDH or higher modified stage were associated with a trend toward poorer overall survival among children with CNS disease. CONCLUSION: A greater tumor burden at diagnosis adversely influences the treatment outcome of children with NHL and CNS disease at diagnosis, suggesting a need for ongoing improvement in both systemic and CNS-directed therapy.","['Sandlund, J T', 'Murphy, S B', 'Santana, V M', 'Behm, F', 'Jones, D', 'Berard, C W', 'Furman, W L', 'Ribeiro, R', 'Crist, W M', 'Greenwald, C', 'Chen, G', 'Walter, A', 'Pui, C H']","['Sandlund JT', 'Murphy SB', 'Santana VM', 'Behm F', 'Jones D', 'Berard CW', 'Furman WL', 'Ribeiro R', 'Crist WM', 'Greenwald C', 'Chen G', 'Walter A', 'Pui CH']","[""Departments of Hematology/Oncology, Radiation Therapy, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, and University of Tennessee at Memphis, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN, USA. john.sandlund@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/cerebrospinal fluid/*etiology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cranial Nerve Diseases/*etiology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intralesional', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/cerebrospinal fluid/complications/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*cerebrospinal fluid/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid/complications/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/08/16 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/16 11:00'],"['2000/08/16 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/16 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.16.3018 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Aug;18(16):3018-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.16.3018.,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Paclitaxel at 175 mg/m(2) given over 3 hours and carboplatin at an area under the curve of 5 were administered on day 1 followed by oral etoposide 50 mg/m(2)/d beginning on day 2. The number of days of etoposide therapy was escalated on the basis of toxicity. Toxicity end points included neutropenic sepsis, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or grade 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia during etoposide administration. Cycles were repeated every 21 days for a maximum of six courses. Due to hematologic toxicity, the duration of the paclitaxel infusion was decreased to 1 hour for a second stage of accrual. RESULTS: Of 52 patients studied, 29 were in the first stage of accrual. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred with 8 days of oral etoposide, making the MTD six days of therapy. Twenty-three patients were entered into the second stage of accrual. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 12 days of oral etoposide, making the MTD 10 days of therapy. Three patients developed acute myeloid leukemia 16, 27, and 35 months after receiving a cumulative dose of 200 mg/m(2), 1,200 mg/m(2), and 2,400 mg/m(2), respectively. CONCLUSION: One-hour paclitaxel, carboplatin, and oral etoposide at 50 mg/m(2)/d for 10 days is tolerable without supportive therapy.

Conditioning prior to transplantation consisted either of a combination of chemotherapy and total body irradiation (TBI) (n = 21) or of chemotherapy only (n = 8). TBI was given in one fraction of 7.5 Gy. Nine patients had received previous cranial irradiation. The patients were followed for 4-10y (median 8 y) after transplantation. Of 29 patients, 22 developed PSC, all within 4 y after BMT. With the exception of one patient who developed unilateral PSC, all had received TBI. Conversely, 100% of those who received TBI developed PSC. In this group (+TBI), eight patients (38%) developed significant PSC, defined as best corrected visual acuity <0.8 in either eye. Six patients (10 eyes) have since needed surgical repair consisting of extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. There was no clear relationship between previous cranial irradiation and cataract development, nor any other obvious baseline differences between those in the +TBI group who developed significant PSC and those who did not. Although effects of previous therapy cannot be ruled out, TBI appears to be the main cause of PSC in this group of patients. Twelve patients in the +TBI group had well-preserved visual acuity throughout the study, reflecting a slow progression of PSC. This compares favourably with previous reports of allogeneic BMT, possibly owing to less need for corticosteroids after autologous BMT. We conclude that the incidence of PSC was high after autologous BMT where the conditioning regimen included total body irradiation.","['Frisk, P', 'Hagberg, H', 'Mandahl, A', 'Soderberg, P', 'Lonnerholm, G']","['Frisk P', 'Hagberg H', 'Mandahl A', 'Soderberg P', 'Lonnerholm G']","[""Uppsala University Children's Hospital, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cataract/*etiology', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Visual Acuity', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",,2000/08/16 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2000/08/16 11:00'],"['2000/08/16 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/16 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2000 Jul;89(7):814-9.,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean in vitro survival of leukemia cells in children with acute lymphoblast cell leukemia (ALCL) was 1.9 times less than that in acute myeloblast cell leukemia (AMCL) (p < 0.001), that in new cases of ALL was 2.3 times less than in relapses (p = 0.024). The stimulating effect of GM-KSF on the survival rates of leukemia cells was seen in 64.7% of patients with AML. That of GM-KSF was recorded in 21.4% of cases.

In the last years an impressive amount of progress has been made in clarifying the pathogenesis of lung diseases, particularly those occurring in conditions of severe immunosuppression such as bone marrow transplantion, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or leukemia. Peculiar anatomical characteristics render the lung parenchyma highly susceptible to infections, but the clinical outcome is due not only to the injury induced by the pathogens but also to their interactions with inflammatory cells and particularly to the effects of a wide network of secreted cytokines. Polymorphonuclear cells, macrophages, lymphocytes and structural pulmonary cells (epithelial cells, interstitial cells) generate a variety of cytokines and growth factors which, in turn, may be responsible for the majority of the clinical effects in response to infections, such as those of Pneumocystis carinii and cytomegalovirus, but also to certain drugs or to radiation. The pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is still poorly understood, but animal models seem to demonstrate the involvement of a number of cytokines and growth factors, together with toxic effects induced by conditioning regimens.","['Poletti, V', 'Salvucci, M', 'Zanchini, R', 'Molinari, A L', 'Zuffa, E', 'Poletti, G', 'Zaccaria, A']","['Poletti V', 'Salvucci M', 'Zanchini R', 'Molinari AL', 'Zuffa E', 'Poletti G', 'Zaccaria A']","['Department of Thoracic Medicine, Bellaria/Maggiore Hospital, Azienda USL Citt di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",IM,,"['Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Growth Substances/physiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lung/immunology/*pathology', 'Lung Diseases/chemically induced/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/physiology', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'Pneumonia/etiology/microbiology/virology', 'Pulmonary Eosinophilia/etiology', 'Radiation Pneumonitis/etiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects']",94,2000/08/16 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/16 11:00'],"['2000/08/16 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/16 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Aug;85(8):855-64.,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most studied resistance mechanisms is mediated by P-glycoprotein, which can be modulated by calcium channel blockers. Here we investigated whether the Ca(2+) channel blockers verapamil and nifedipine are toxic alone and in combination with P-glycoprotein-independent anticancer drugs against chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in vitro. DESIGN AND METHODS: Verapamil cytotoxicity was investigated in peripheral blood samples of 35 patients with B-cell CLL and 10 healthy control subjects. Cytotoxicity was assessed in in vitro 4-day cultures using 14C-leucine incorporation as an indicator of cell viability. Interactions were tested with Ca2+ channel blockers and cyclosporine or 7 anticancer drugs: (i) chlorambucil, (ii) 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, (iii) cisplatin, (iv) fludarabine, (v) prednisolone, (vi) adriamycin, and (vii) vincristine. The mode of cell death was assessed by annexin binding and DNA ladder formation. RESULTS: Verapamil induced dose- and time -dependent death of CLL cells in vitro. A statistically significant effect (p = 0.0085) was noted with as little as 4 microM verapamil. The mode of cell death was apoptotic as determined by annexin positivity and condensation of verapamil-treated cells. Verapamil effectively potentiated the toxicity of cyclosporine and all the anticancer drugs mentioned above. Furthermore, nifedipine, a more specific L-type calcium channel antagonist, significantly potentiated the effect of chlorambucil against CLL cells. Interpretation and Conclusions. Calcium channel blockers enhance the effect of P-glycoprotein-independent anticancer drugs remarkably. This indicates that the death signals initiated by calcium depletion and anticancer drugs together facilitate cell death. This novel finding opens a new avenue to modulate, by using calcium channel antagonists, the effect of traditional anticancer drugs having different mechanisms of P-glycoprotein-independent action.","['Vilpo, J', 'Koski, T', 'Vilpo, L']","['Vilpo J', 'Koski T', 'Vilpo L']","['Tampere University Hospital, FM2, P.O.

VBP does not heterodimerize with B-ZIP domains from C/EBP alpha, JUND, or FOS. We describe a dominant negative protein, A-VBP, that contains the VBP leucine zipper and an acidic amphipathic protein sequence that replaces the basic region critical for DNA binding. The acidic extension forms a coiled coil structure with the VBP basic region in the VBP.A-VBP heterodimer. This new alpha-helical structure extends the leucine zipper N-terminally, stabilizing the complex by 2.0 kcal/mol. A-VBP abolishes DNA binding of VBP in an equimolar competition assay, but does not affect DNA binding even at 100-fold excess of CREB, C/EBP alpha, or FOS/JUND. Likewise, proteins containing the acidic extension appended to seven other leucine zippers do not inhibit VBP DNA binding. We show that conserved g <--> e' or i, i' +5 salt bridges are sufficient to confer specificity to VBP by mutating the C/EBPalpha leucine zipper to contain the g <--> e' salt bridges that characterize VBP. A-VBP heterodimerizes with this mutant C/EBP, preventing it from binding to DNA.

Historically, EBV has been thought to be aetiologically linked to human malignancies such as EBV genome-positive Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Furthermore, studies using recent developments in molecular and immunological diagnostic approaches have suggested that this virus has a causative role in a spectrum of human diseases of previously unknown pathogenesis, including chronic active EBV infection syndrome (CAEBV), EBV-related haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and certain disorders such as EBV genome-positive T-cell lymphoma, natural killer (NK) cell leukaemia/lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease (HD) and gastric carcinoma.

EAT/mcl-1 (EAT), an anti-apoptotic bcl-2-related gene, was isolated during the early differentiation of a human embryonal carcinoma cell line, an event which serves as a model of early embryogenesis. EAT is involved in apoptotic regulation and is believed to also function as an immediate-early gene. Thus it was hypothesized that EAT would be expressed during early embryogenesis and would be involved in the regulation of apoptosis during this critical period. To clarify this early expression, two antibodies to EAT were generated by use of immunizing oligopeptide (aa 37-55) and recombinant protein (aa 31-229) for use in immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, respectively. With these antibodies, we then determined EAT expression during murine embryogenesis and in human development, using human fetal tissue of 6 to 23 gestational weeks. During murine embryogenesis, the EAT protein was found to be rapidly induced after fertilization, to peak at the 2-cell stage, to remain constant until the 8-cell stage, and then to decrease to below unfertilized egg levels in blastocysts. EAT expression patterns in early human development were found to essentially overlap those observed in adult tissues which suggest that EAT expression continues until adulthood in terminally differentiated tissues. Among tissues distinct to fetal development, EAT was detected in the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct and paramesonephric (Mullerian) duct. It is also noteworthy that prominent EAT immunoreactivity was also observed in large primary oocytes in 21-week fetal ovary, but was not detected in primordial germ cells in 23-week fetal testis. In summary, EAT expression was detected in hematopoietic, epithelial, neural, endocrine, and urogenital cells; this provides evidence that EAT, as an anti-apoptotic molecule, possibly functions to regulate apoptosis during development in these systems.","['Sano, M', 'Umezawa, A', 'Suzuki, A', 'Shimoda, K', 'Fukuma, M', 'Hata, J']","['Sano M', 'Umezawa A', 'Suzuki A', 'Shimoda K', 'Fukuma M', 'Hata J']","['Department of Pathology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Laboratory Animal Center, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Embryonal', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*physiology', 'Female', 'Fertilization/physiology', 'Fetus/chemistry/cytology/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Genes, Immediate-Early/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*genetics/immunology', 'Oocytes/chemistry/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/16 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/16 11:00'],"['2000/08/16 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/16 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2000.4977 [doi]', 'S0014482700949772 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2000 Aug 25;259(1):127-39. doi: 10.1006/excr.2000.4977.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

A decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and cleavage of procaspase-9 to its active form preceded the activation of caspase-3 and, moreover, all of these events began earlier and/or proceeded faster in cells treated with AD plus CL or CD than in cells treated with AD only. These results suggest that cytoskeletal disruption in the apoptotic cells promotes damage of the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in the enhanced release of cytochrome c necessary for the activation of caspase-9 that initiates the caspase cascade. On the other hand, apoptotic bodies were rapidly formed from cells treated with AD and CL, but were suppressed when treated with AD and CD. Intracellular membranes and the actin system were reorganized to surround the nuclear fragments in the AD- and CL-treated cells, but such a membrane system was not formed in the presence of CD, implying that the apoptotic bodies are formed via reorganization of intracellular membranes under regulation by actin polymerization. Thus, the cytoskeletal change in CMK-7 cells has a strong effect on the early biochemical process as well as on the later morphologic process in AD-induced apoptosis.","['Yamazaki, Y', 'Tsuruga, M', 'Zhou, D', 'Fujita, Y', 'Shang, X', 'Dang, Y', 'Kawasaki, K', 'Oka, S']","['Yamazaki Y', 'Tsuruga M', 'Zhou D', 'Fujita Y', 'Shang X', 'Dang Y', 'Kawasaki K', 'Oka S']","['National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, 1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8566, Japan. yamazaki@nibh.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Actins/analysis/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Cytotoxins/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/*physiology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Electrophysiology', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Intracellular Membranes/*enzymology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Organelles/enzymology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology/ultrastructure']",,2000/08/16 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/16 11:00'],"['2000/08/16 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/16 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2000.4970 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(00)94970-X [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2000 Aug 25;259(1):64-78. doi: 10.1006/excr.2000.4970.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

Spermine oxidation exerts potent immunosuppressive effects in animal cells, but the cell death mechanism involved remains unclear. We compared biochemical and morphological parameters of SAO-mediated cell death in L1210 mouse leukemia cells with normal or amplified ornithine decarboxylase gene expression with those observed during apoptosis induced by deregulated polyamine uptake or by okadaic acid. None of the characteristic features of apoptotic cell death (e.g., chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, internucleosomal DNA cleavage, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage) were observed during spermine oxidation-mediated cell death, which was clearly necrotic by morphological criteria. Inhibition of a wide spectrum of caspases did not prevent SAO-dependent cell death, whereas N-acetylcysteine completely abolished the cytotoxic effects of spermine oxidation. Catalase only delayed spermine oxidation-induced cell death without affecting its modality or preventing depletion of intracellular glutathione, suggesting that both H(2)O(2) and aminoaldehydes generated by SAO-mediated spermine oxidation contribute to SAO-induced necrosis. Interestingly, redistribution of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, usually a diagnostic feature of apoptosis, preceded necrotic cytolysis triggered by spermine oxidation. Thus, L1210 cell death caused by SAO-mediated spermine oxidation has all the attributes of primary necrosis, but is also accompanied by loss of phospholipid asymmetry, indicating that the latter phenomenon may not be unique to apoptosis. Phosphatidylserine exposure, a potent engulfment signal for phagocytes, might contribute to the immunosuppressive effects of plasma polyamines through a controlled and rapid necrotic process involving SAO.","['Bonneau, M J', 'Poulin, R']","['Bonneau MJ', 'Poulin R']","['Laboratory of Oncology and Molecular Endocrinology, Department of Anatomy and Physiology, CHUQ Research Center, CHUL Building, 2705 Laurier Boulevard, Ste.

To address this issue, an in vitro model to study the biologic activity of leukemogenic proteins was established. Highly purified human hematopoietic progenitor cells/stem cells (HPC/HSC) in bulk cells or single cells are transduced with retroviral vectors carrying cDNA of the fusion protein and the green fluorescent protein (GFP), purified to homogeneity and induced into multilineage or unilineage differentiation by specific hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) combinations. Expression of PML/RAR alpha fusion protein in human HPC/HSC dictates the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) phenotype, largely through these previously unreported effects: rapid induction of HPC/HSC differentiation to the promyelocytic stage, followed by maturation arrest, which is abolished by retinoic acid; reprogramming of HPC commitment to preferential granulopoietic differentiation, irrespective of the HGF stimulus (transduction of single sibling HPC formally demonstrated this effect); HPC protection from apoptosis induced by HGF deprivation. A PML/RAR alpha mutated in the co-repressor N-CoR/histone deacetylase binding region lost these biologic effects, showing that PML/RAR alpha alters the early hematopoietic program through N-CoR-dependent target gene repression mechanisms. These observations identify the cellular mechanism underlying development of the APL phenotype, showing that the fusion protein directly dictates the specific lineage and differentiation stage of leukemic cells.

However, the mechanism by which As(2)O(3) exerts its antileukemic effect remains uncertain. Emerging data suggest that the endothelium and angiogenesis play a seminal role in the proliferation of liquid tumors, such as leukemia. We have shown that activated endothelial cells release cytokines that may stimulate leukemic cell growth. Leukemic cells, in turn, can release endothelial growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that As(2)O(3) may interrupt a reciprocal loop between leukemic cells and the endothelium by direct action on both cell types. We have shown that treatment of proliferating layers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with a variety of concentrations of As(2)O(3) results in a reproducible dose- and time-dependent sequence of events marked by change to an activated morphology, up-regulation of endothelial cell adhesion markers, and apoptosis. Also, treatment with As(2)O(3) caused inhibition of VEGF production in the leukemic cell line HEL. Finally, incubation of HUVECs with As(2)O(3) prevented capillary tubule and branch formation in an in vitro endothelial cell-differentiation assay. In conclusion, we believe that As(2)O(3 )interrupts a reciprocal stimulatory loop between leukemic cells and endothelial cells by causing apoptosis of both cell types and by inhibiting leukemic cell VEGF production.

In control samples from healthy donors (PHA T cells and bone marrow), only wild-type dCK complementary DNA (cDNA) was amplified.

Deletion of exons 3 to 6 was also identified in 6 of 12 PHA T cells generated from the patients with resistant AML.

However, previous studies have shown that in the presence of 2'-deoxyadenosine (dAd), human monocytoid leukemia cell lines are much more sensitive to dCF with regard to the inhibition of cell proliferation. Thus, dCF might be useful for treating monocytoid leukemia with the aid of dAd analogs. The antiproliferative effects of dCF in combination with dAd or its derivatives were examined on normal and malignant blood and bone marrow cells. In the presence of 10 micromol/L dAd, the concentration of dCF required to inhibit the viability of primary monocytoid leukemia cells was much lower than that required to inhibit normal or non-monocytoid leukemic cells. Among the dAd analogs, 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (AraA) was also effective in combination with dCF. Athymic nude mice were inoculated with human monocytoid leukemia U937 cells and treated with dCF or a dAd analog or both. Although dCF alone slightly but significantly prolonged the survival of mice inoculated with U937 cells, combined treatment with dCF and AraA markedly prolonged their survival.

A total of 169 genes, including 8 novel ones, were modulated by ATRA. The ATRA-induced gene expression profiles were in high accord with the differentiation and proliferation status of the NB(4) cells. The time courses of their modulation were interesting. Among the 100 up-regulated genes, the induction of expression occurred most frequently 12-48 hours after ATRA treatment, while 59 of 69 down-regulated genes found their expression suppressed within 8 hours. The transcriptional regulation of 8 induced and 24 repressed genes was not blocked by cycloheximide, which suggests that these genes may be direct targets of the ATRA signaling pathway.

WT1 is also detectable in many types of lung, thyroid, breast, testicular, and ovarian cancers and melanoma in humans. Initial studies evaluated whether immune responses to murine WT1 can be elicited in mice. Murine and human WT1 are similar. Thus, mouse models might lead to resolution of many of the critical issues for developing WT1 vaccines. C57/BL6 (B6) mice were injected with synthetic peptides from the natural sequence of WT1 containing motifs for binding to major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules. Immunization induced helper T-cell responses specific for the immunizing WT1 peptides and antibody responses specific for WT1 protein. Screening of multiple murine cancer cell lines identified 2 murine cancers, TRAMP-C and BLKSV40, that ""naturally"" overexpress WT1. Immunization with MHC class I binding peptides induced WT1 peptide-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) that specifically lysed TRAMP-C and BLKSV40. WT1 specificity of lysis was confirmed by cold target inhibition. No toxicity was noted by histopathologic evaluation in the WT1 peptide-immunized animals. WT1 peptide immunization did not show any effect on TRAMP-C tumor growth in vivo. Immunization of B6 mice to syngeneic TRAMP-C elicited WT1-specific antibody, demonstrating that WT1 can be immunogenic in the context of cancer cells. To evaluate whether WT1 might be similarly immunogenic in humans, serum from patients with leukemia was evaluated for pre-existing antibody responses. Western blot analyses showed WT1-specific antibodies directed against the N-terminus portion of the WT1 protein in the sera of 3 of 18 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Vectors for efficient gene delivery to primary human leukemia cells are required to translate this approach to clinical trials. In this study, second-generation lentiviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus 1 were evaluated, with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter driving expression of granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and CD80 in separate vectors or in a bicistronic vector. The vectors were pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein and concentrated to high titers (10(8)-10(9) infective particles/mL). Human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines transduced with the monocistronic pHR-CD80 vector or the bicistronic pHR-GM/CD vector became 75% to 95% CD80 positive (CD80(+)). More important, transduction of primary human ALL and AML blasts with high-titer lentiviral vectors was consistently successful (40%-95% CD80(+)). The average amount of GM-CSF secretion by the leukemia cell lines transduced with the pHR-GM-CSF monocistronic vector was 2182.9 pg/10(6) cells per 24 hours. Secretion was markedly lower with the bicistronic pHR-GM/CD vector (average, 225.7 pg/10(6) cells per 24 hours). Lower amounts of CMV-driven messenger RNA were detected with the bicistronic vector, which may account for its poor expression of GM-CSF. Primary ALL cells transduced to express CD80 stimulated T-cell proliferation in an autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction. This stimulation was specifically blocked with monoclonal antibodies reactive against CD80 or by recombinant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-immunoglobulin fusion protein. These results show the feasibility of efficiently transducing primary leukemia cells with lentiviral vectors to express immunomodulators to elicit antileukemic immune responses.

Recently, it has been shown that lentiviral vectors are capable of transferring genes into nondividing and terminally differentiated cells. We used human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-based vectors expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) driven by different promoters (CMV, MPSV, or PGK) and investigated their ability to transduce human T- and B-cell lines, as well as resting or activated primary peripheral and umbilical cord blood lymphocytes. The effects of the presence or the absence of HIV-1 accessory proteins (Vif, Vpr, Vpu, and Nef) in the vector system were also assessed. Flow cytometry analysis showed no differences in the ability of these vectors of transferring the reporter gene into lymphocytic lines and mitogen-stimulated primary lymphocytes in the presence or the absence of HIV-1 accessory proteins (APs). Similarly, viral supernatants generated in the presence of accessory genes could efficiently transduce various subsets of resting lymphocytes and provide long-term expression of the transgene. No significant transduction-induced changes in cell activation or cycling status were observed and Alu-HIV-1 long terminal repeat polymerase chain reaction (LTR PCR) analysis demonstrated integration of the vector sequences at the molecular level. In contrast, in the absence of HIV-1 APs, lentiviral vectors failed to integrate and express the transgene in resting lymphocytes. These results show that transduction of primary resting lymphocytes with HIV-1-based vectors requires the presence of viral accessory proteins.

However, a sizeable minority of APL cases lack the classic t(15;17), prompting the establishment of the European Working Party to further characterize this group. Such cases were referred to a workshop held in Monza, Italy and subjected to morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular review, yielding 60 evaluable patients. In the majority (42 of 60), molecular analyses revealed underlying PML/RAR alpha rearrangements due to insertions (28 of 42) or more complex mechanisms, including 3-way and simple variant translocations (14 of 42). Metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated that insertions most commonly led to formation of the PML-RAR alpha fusion gene on 15q. In 11 of 60 workshop patients, PLZF/RAR alpha rearrangements were identified, including 2 patients lacking the t(11;17)(q23;q21). In one case with a normal karyotype, FISH analysis revealed insertion of RAR alpha into 11q23, and PLZF-RAR alpha was the sole fusion gene formed. Two patients were found to have t(5;17), one with a diffuse nuclear NPM staining pattern and with NPM-RAR alpha and RAR alpha-NPM transcripts detected. In the other with an unbalanced der(5)t(5;17)(q13;q21) and a nucleolar NPM localization pattern, an NPM/RAR alpha rearrangement was excluded, and FISH revealed deletion of one RAR alpha allele. In the remaining 5 workshop patients, no evidence was found for a rearrangement of RAR alpha, indicating that in rare instances, alternative mechanisms could mediate the differentiation block that typifies this disease. This study highlights the importance of combining morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular analyses for optimal management of APL patients and better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.

However, approximately 10% of all APL cases lack the classic t(15;17).

A key issue is how to rapidly distinguish subtypes of APL that demand distinct treatment approaches. To address this issue, a European workshop was held in Monza, Italy, during June 1997, and a morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular review was undertaken in 60 cases of APL lacking t(15;17). This process led to the development of a novel morphologic classification system that takes into account the major nuclear and cytoplasmic features of APL. There were no major differences observed in morphology or immunophenotype between cases with the classic t(15;17) and those with the cryptic PML/RARA gene rearrangements. Auer rods were absent in the t(5;17) case expressing NPM/RARA. Interestingly, this classification system distinguished 9 cases with t(11;17)(q23;q21) and, in addition, successfully identified 2 cases lacking t(11;17), which were subsequently shown to have underlying PLZF/RARA fusions. The PLZF/RARA cases were characterized by a predominance of blasts with regular nuclei, an increased number of Pelger-like cells, and by expression of CD56 in 4 of 6 cases tested. Use of this classification system, combined with an analysis for CD56 expression, should allow early recognition of APL cases requiring tailored molecular investigations.

To better investigate these studies and the prognostic factors influencing relapse risk, this study analyzed the updated results of 217 patients with PML/RAR alpha-positive APL enrolled in GIMEMA (n = 108) and PETHEMA (n = 109). All patients received identical induction (AIDA schedule) and maintenance. For consolidation, GIMEMA patients received 3 courses including idarubicin/cytarabine, mitoxantrone/etoposide, and idarubicin/cytarabine/thioguanine, whereas PETHEMA patients received the same drugs and dose schedule of idarubicin and mitoxantrone with the omission of nonintercalating agents. Depending on whether molecular relapses were classified as censored or uncensored events, the 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of relapse-free survival (RFS) for the combined series were 90 +/- 2% and 86 +/- 2%, respectively. Minor differences observed between the 2 patient cohorts were negligible. Multivariate regression analysis of RFS showed that initial leukocyte (WBC) and platelet counts were the only variables with independent prognostic value. The resulting predictive model for RFS demonstrated its capability of segregating patients into low-risk (WBC count </= 10 x 10(9)/L, platelet count > 40 x 10(9)/L), intermediate-risk (WBC count </= 10 x 10(9)/L, platelets </= 40 x 10(9)/L), and high-risk (WBC count > 10 x 10(9)/L) groups, with distinctive RFS curves (P <.0001). The conclusions are that omission of nonanthracycline drugs from the AIDA regimen is not associated with reduced antileukemic efficacy and a simple predictive model may be used for risk-adapted therapy in this disease.

Numerous strategies for the activation and inhibition of these 'killer' proteases have evolved, including the regulation of caspase expression and function at the transcriptional and post-translational level, as well as the expression of viral and cellular inhibitors of caspases. Emerging evidence in recent years has also implicated the caspases in various, nonapoptotic aspects of cellular physiology, such as cytokine processing during inflammation, differentiation of progenitor cells during erythropoiesis and lens fiber development, and proliferation of T lymphocytes, thus attesting to the pleiotropic functions of these proteases.

These receptors contain an extracellular region containing varying numbers of cysteine-rich domains and an intracellular region that contains the death domain. The death receptors are activated in a ligand-dependent or independent manner and transduce apoptotic signals via their respective intracellular death domains. In addition to death receptors, several decoy molecules have also been identified and include DcR1/TRID, DcR2/TRUNDD, DcR3 and osteoprotegrin (OPG). The decoy molecules do not transduce apoptotic signals but rather compete with the death receptors for ligand binding and thereby inhibit ligand-induced apoptosis. Recent evidence suggests that p53 upregulates the expression of death receptors Fas and DR5, and thus, may mediate apoptosis in part via Fas and/or DR5. However, p53 also regulates the expression of TRAIL decoy receptors DcR1/TRID and DR2/TRUNDD. Although the significance of p53-dependent regulation of decoy receptors remains unclear, evidence suggests that DcR1/TRUNDD appears to inhibit 53-mediated apoptosis. It is, therefore, possible that p53 may blunt its DR5-dependent apoptotic effects by controlling the levels of decoy receptors.","['Sheikh, M S', 'Fornace, A J Jr']","['Sheikh MS', 'Fornace AJ Jr']","['Department of Pharmacology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",49,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401865 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Aug;14(8):1509-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401865.,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, no one single morphological feature is either necessary or sufficient to define apoptosis. The emerging biochemical definition, a cell death with caspase activation, allows the distinction of alternative forms of cell death. Thus, inhibition of caspases delays but does not prevent cell death. Slow cell death without caspase activation may nevertheless be associated with DNA fragmentation. Oncogenic Ras, Raf, and mitogen-activated kinases inhibit apoptosis by affecting the cytochrome C/caspase-9 pathway but may arrest growth and cause slow cell death with delayed DNA fragmentation. Such 'slow' cell death without caspase activation is often caused by chemotherapeutic drugs. Whether a cell will undergo apoptosis or slow death depends not only on a chemotherapeutic agent but also on the readiness of cellular caspases. Therefore, one can distinguish apoptosis-prone (eg leukemia) vs apoptosis-resistant cells. Cell susceptibilities to spontaneous, starvation-induced and drug-induced apoptosis are correlated and characterize an apoptosis-prone phenotype. Finally, distinction of slow cell death allows rephrasing of a question regarding the goal of cancer therapy: apoptosis vs slow cell death, or cancer cell-selectivity regardless of the mode of cell death.","['Blagosklonny, M V']",['Blagosklonny MV'],"['Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Caspases/*physiology', '*Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans']",123,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401864 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Aug;14(8):1502-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401864.,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-three out of 31 MM patients undergoing APBSC transplantation with VDJH segments clonally rearranged detected at diagnosis were included in the study. Samples of the apheresis products were PCR amplified using JH and VH (FRIII and FRII) consensus primers and subsequently analyzed with the heteroduplex technique, and compared with those obtained at diagnosis. 52% of cases yielded positive results (presence of clonally rearranged VDJH segments in at least one apheresis). The presence of positive results in the apheresis products was not related to any pretransplant characteristics with the exception of response status at transplant. Thus, while no one patient with positive apheresis products was in complete remission (CR), negative immunofixation, before the transplant, five cases (46%) with negative apheresis were already in CR at transplant (P = 0.01). The remaining six cases with heteroduplex PCR negative apheresis were in partial remission before transplant. Patients with clonally free products were more likely to obtain CR following transplant (64% vs 17%, P= 0.02) and a longer progression-free survival, (40 months in patients transplanted with polyclonal products vs 20 with monoclonal ones, P = 0.03). These results were consistent when the overall survival was considered, since it was better in those patients with negative apheresis than it was in those with positive (83% vs 36% at 5 years from diagnosis, P= 0.01).

BCL10 was shown to be a proapoptotic-signaling gene encoding a protein that contains an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD). Mutations within the BCL10 coding region resulting in truncated BCL10 proteins with loss of their proapoptotic function and preservation of their NF-kappaB activating function were detected in MALT lymphoma. Based on these findings it was proposed that BCL10 might have tumor suppressor function. Deletions involving 1p22 are commonly observed in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). To investigate its role in MCL we have analyzed a series of 15 MCL for deletion and mutation of BCL10. Monoallelic 1p22 deletions were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization in five of the 15 cases and were shown to affect BCL10 in all cases. BCL10 was screened for mutations by DNA sequencing of RT-PCR amplified transcripts. In none of the 15 MCL cases studied were mutations found in the BCL10 coding region. A previously reported polymorphism exhibiting a silent 24C > G substitution was found in eight MCL cases and in four healthy probands. A missense mutation 13G >T resulting in a substitution of a serine by an alanine was seen in one of the controls.

To assess the proliferative capacity, we cultured MCL cells, using irradiated 3T6 mouse fibroblasts transfected with human CD40L ('CD40 system') in the presence of different cytokines. Proliferation was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation and by CFSE fluorescence. Thirteen out of 16 MCL cases proliferated well in the CD40 system. In 10 cases a strong response upon further addition of IL-10 was seen, whereas IL-4 had an additional effect in only four cases. CFSE staining of cells before and after culture showed an increased number of cell divisions in the IL-10/CD40L stimulated cells. The MCL cells remained CD5+CD19+. Neither plasma cell differentiation nor isotype switching was seen. The light chain expression was strictly monoclonal. IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, G-CSF and GM-CSF did not stimulate MCL proliferation. IL-10 receptor expression correlated with the response to IL-10 in the culture system and the effect of added IL-10 could be blocked by antibodies directed against IL-10 and the IL-10 receptor. Autocrine IL-10 production by the MCL cells was detected in eight of 10 cases tested. IL-10 receptor blocking decreased proliferation when no exogenous IL-10 was used in four of seven cases tested. EBV assessed by EBER in situ hybridization was not detected in six cases tested. In conclusion, MCL can successfully be cultured upon CD40 stimulation if 3T6 CD40L+ cells are used.

Moreover, NAF21 cell proliferation was also supported by glutaraldehyde-fixed 2M-1 cells or highly concentrated MS-5 cell culture supernatant, but not by CSF-1 coated on culture dishes.

Here we demonstrate that MeOSO2(CH2)2-lexitropsin (Me-Lex), a DNA minor groove alkylating compound which generates mainly N3-methyladenine, has cytotoxic and clastogenic effects in mismatch repair-deficient leukemic cells. Moreover, MT-1 cells, which express p53 upon drug treatment and possess low levels of 3-methylpurine DNA glycosylase activity, are more susceptible to cytotoxicity induced by Me-Lex, with respect to p53-null and 3-methylpurine DNA glycosylase-proficient Jurkat cells. In both cell lines, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide, which inhibits base excision repair capable of removing N-methylpurines, increases cytotoxicity and clastogenicity induced by Me-Lex or by temozolomide, which generates low levels of N3-methyl adducts. The enhancing effect is more evident at low Me-Lex concentrations, which induce a level of DNA damage that presumably does not saturate the repair ability of the cells. Nuclear fragmentation induced by Me-Lex + 3-aminobenzamide occurs earlier than in cells treated with the single agent. Treatment with Me-Lex and 3-aminobenzamide results in augmented expression of p53 protein and of the X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 transcript (a component of base excision repair).

Significant elevation of transcript levels of HMG-CoA reductase was observed by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis in more than three lovastatin-sensitive MDR sublines, but not in NB4/MDR compared with the parental cell lines. HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels were up-regulated more than two-fold by the exposure to lovastatin in all of the parental non-Pgp-expressing cell lines. In NB4/MDR, HMG-CoA reductase mRNA level was elevated to a similar extent as in parental NB4, whereas in three other MDR sublines which showed preferential sensitivity to lovastatin, their HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels were not significantly elevated after 24- and 48-h treatment with lovastatin.

Recently, we have shown that 'real-time' quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) can be applied for this purpose using patient-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements as PCR targets with TaqMan probes at the position of the junctional region and two germline primers. Now, we tested an alternative approach on 35 immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene rearrangements, by designing three germline JH TaqMan probes to be used in combination with one of six corresponding germline JH primers and one allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) primer complementary to the junctional region. In nine cases in which both approaches were compared, at least similar (n = 4) or slightly higher (n= 5) maximal sensitivities were obtained using an ASO primer. The ASO primer approach reached maximal sensitivities of at least 10(-4) in 33 out of 35 IGH rearrangements. The reproducible range for accurate quantification spanned four to five orders of magnitude in 31 out of 35 cases. In 13 out of 35 rearrangements the stringency of PCR conditions had to be increased to remove or diminish background signals; this only concerned the frequently occurring JH4, JH5 and JH6 gene rearrangements. After optimization of the conditions (mainly by increasing the annealing temperature), only occasional aspecific amplification signals were observed at high threshold cycle (CT) values above 42 cycles and at least six cycles above the CT value of the detection limit. Hence, these rare aspecific signals could be easily discriminated from specific signals. We conclude that the here presented set of three germline JH Taq-Man probes and six corresponding germline JH primers can be used to develop patient-specific RQ-PCR assays, which allow accurate and sensitive MRD analysis in almost all IGH gene rearrangements. These results will facilitate standardized RQ-PCR analysis for MRD detection in large clinical studies.","['Verhagen, O J', 'Willemse, M J', 'Breunis, W B', 'Wijkhuijs, A J', 'Jacobs, D C', 'Joosten, S A', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Dongen, J J', 'van der Schoot, C E']","['Verhagen OJ', 'Willemse MJ', 'Breunis WB', 'Wijkhuijs AJ', 'Jacobs DC', 'Joosten SA', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ', 'van der Schoot CE']","['Department of Immunohematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,,"['DNA Probes', '*Germ Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology']",,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401801 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Aug;14(8):1426-35. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401801.,,,,,,,,,,,

Inherent quantitating problems are the main drawbacks of traditional PCR technologies. These limitations have been overcome by the recently developed real-time quantitative PCR (RQ PCR) technology. However, clinical application of the few published RQ PCR assays targeting immune gene rearrangements is hampered by the expensive and time-consuming need for individual hybridization probes for each patient. We have developed a new RQ PCR strategy targeting clonally rearranged IgH sequences that solves this problem. The method uses only two different JH hybridization probes and four downstream JH primers homologous to consensus germline JH gene segments. In combination with an allele-specific upstream (ASO) primer the consensus JH probes and primers allow quantitation of about 90% of possible IgH rearrangements. In a series of 22 B-lineage ALL the new assay allowed the detection of one to 10 blasts in a background of 10(5) normal cells. To prove the clinical utility we quantified MRD in 23 follow-up samples of six ALL patients with the new assay in comparison with a published RQ PCR technique that used individually designed primer/probe sets. We showed that the sensitivity of the new RQ PCR assay was slightly higher for four of the six cases and about 100-fold higher for one case, enabling detection of an increasing MRD level as an indicator of subsequent relapse 44 weeks earlier compared to the ASO probe assay in this particular patient. The results suggest, that the novel RQ PCR assay is a rapid, technically simple, reliable, and sensitive alternative to traditional quantification assays and simplifies current approaches of monitoring MRD in clinical trials.","['Bruggemann, M', 'Droese, J', 'Bolz, I', 'Luth, P', 'Pott, C', 'von Neuhoff, N', 'Scheuering, U', 'Kneba, M']","['Bruggemann M', 'Droese J', 'Bolz I', 'Luth P', 'Pott C', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Scheuering U', 'Kneba M']","['II.

The B-CLL samples had a mean microvessel count/high power field (hpf) of 7.64 while the control samples had a mean microvessel count/hpf of 2.11 (P = 0.0001). The mean hotspot density in the B-CLL sections (14.83/hotspot) was also significantly higher (P = 0.0008) than the mean hotspot density in control bone marrow sections (7.09/hotspot). Both the microvessel density and hotspot density correlated positively with the clinical stage of the B-CLL patients. In a separate cohort of B-CLL patients, the median urine level of the angiogenic peptide, basic fibroblast growth factor (2216.5 pg/g, n = 14), was significantly higher (P = 0.0001) than the bFGF level in normal controls (1,084 pg/g, n = 58).

Although the incorporation of fludarabine into DNA is a key event in causing cytotoxicity in proliferating leukemia cells, the precise mechanisms by which fludarabine kills CLL cells remain unclear because of the quiescent nature of this malignancy. The present study demonstrated that inhibition of RNA transcription correlated significantly with the cytotoxic action of fludarabine in CLL cells. In contrast, suppression of the low level of DNA synthesis did not affect the survival of the leukemia cells. In addition, inhibition of fludarabine incorporation into cellular DNA through repair synthesis in CLL cells did not alter the cytotoxicity of this drug. Rather, inhibition of RNA synthesis by fludarabine led to a specific diminishment of certain cellular proteins from CLL cells. The combination of fludarabine with another RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D, or with the protein synthesis inhibitor, puromycin, substantially enhanced the cytotoxic activity against CLL cells. These results suggest that termination of mRNA transcription and the consequent depletion of proteins required for cell survival may be a novel biochemical mechanism of action of fludarabine in CLL cells. Thus, inhibition of RNA/protein synthesis may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CLL patients.","['Huang, P', 'Sandoval, A', 'Van Den Neste, E', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W']","['Huang P', 'Sandoval A', 'Van Den Neste E', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401845 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Aug;14(8):1405-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401845.,,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Thus, amplification of CFU-GM may be a target for IFN-alpha and other agents used in the treatment of CML. Here we examined whether cytarabine (Ara-C) or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) exert similar effects and whether they might in combination with IFN-alpha enhance its efficacy. We found that Ara-C preferentially inhibits the formation of CML CFU-GM compared to normal CFU-GM, but this inhibition was not increased by addition of IFN-alpha. When Ara-C was added to cultures containing IFN-alpha, the inhibition of replating by CML progenitors was abrogated. ATRA increased significantly the plating efficiency of normal CFU-GM. The addition of IFN-alpha to ATRA had no effect on CML or normal colony numbers. However, addition of ATRA to cultures containing IFN-alpha reversed the selective inhibition of CML CFU-GM replating seen in cultures containing IFN-alpha alone. In four IFN-alpha/Ara-C experiments, secondary CML patient-derived colonies were examined by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). All of them were Ph chromosome positive. No significant effects on CFU-GM production were observed when CML primitive haemopoietic progenitor cells were investigated in a delta (delta) assay. Thus we conclude that combining IFN-alpha with Ara-C or ATRA neutralises the effect of IFN-alpha on CML CFU-GM. This observation provides a rationale for treating patients with alternating courses of IFN-alpha and Ara-C or ATRA, rather than giving either of these two agents in combination with IFN-alpha.","['Marley, S B', 'Davidson, R J', 'Goldman, J M', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Marley SB', 'Davidson RJ', 'Goldman JM', 'Gordon MY']","['LFR Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Cell Division', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401860 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Aug;14(8):1396-400. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401860.,,,,,,,,,,,

Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive leukemia has its origin in the hematopoietic stem cell. In the present study, we demonstrated that the proliferation of leukemic cells from chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC) and Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases is frequently stimulated with G-CSF in vitro. We next studied a total of 12 leukemic cell lines established from CML-BC (n= 6) and Ph1-positive acute leukemia (n= 6): four 'myeloid', five 'biphenotypic', and three 'lymphoid' types. All cell lines expressed G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) in flow cytometric analysis, but their proliferative response to G-CSF in 3H-thymidine incorporation assay varied. The 'biphenotypic' cell lines expressed G-CSFR at higher levels and showed the most pronounced response to G-CSF. The 'lymphoid' cell lines showed intermediate G-CSFR expression with the modest response to G-CSF. Unexpectedly, 'myeloid' cell lines showed lower G-CSFR expression and lower G-CSF response compared with 'biphenotypic' cell lines. In three of four 'myeloid' cell lines, proliferation was partially inhibited by an addition of anti-G-CSF neutralizing monoclonal antibody into culture medium. Further, the % inhibition of 3H-thymidine uptake of cell lines positively correlated with the amount of their intracellular G-CSF measured by enzyme immunoassay, suggesting an autocrine growth mechanism via the G-CSF/G-CSFR interaction. These results suggest that G-CSF play an important role in the growth regulation of leukemia cells from Ph1-positive acute leukemia and CML-BC.","['Inukai, T', 'Sugita, K', 'Mitsui, K', 'Iijima, K', 'Goi, K', 'Tezuka, T', 'Kojika, S', 'Kagami, K', 'Mori, T', 'Kinoshita, A', 'Suzuki, T', 'Okazaki-Koyama, T', 'Nakazawa, S']","['Inukai T', 'Sugita K', 'Mitsui K', 'Iijima K', 'Goi K', 'Tezuka T', 'Kojika S', 'Kagami K', 'Mori T', 'Kinoshita A', 'Suzuki T', 'Okazaki-Koyama T', 'Nakazawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamanashi Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401837 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Aug;14(8):1386-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401837.,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose was to investigate quantitative changes of the nucleated erythroid precursor cell population and other associated features such as resident bone marrow macrophages and myelofibrosis and to elucidate their relevance on engraftment parameters. Monoclonal antibodies were applied for the identification of erythroid precursors and the labeling of mature macrophages; argyrophilic (reticulin-collagen) fibers were demonstrated by a silver impregnation technique. Following morphometric analysis of the pregraft bone marrow specimens statistical evaluation was in line with an adverse correlation between early to moderate reticulin fibrosis and amount of erythropoiesis. Moreover, a significant relationship was calculable between numbers of erythroid precursors and CD68+ macrophages. After myelo-ablative therapy and BMT a pronounced decrease in cellularity and in the quantity of erythropoiesis was found. Comparable with the pregraft samples, a significant association between erythroid precursors and macrophages could be determined in the regenerating donor bone marrow. A pretransplant relevant reduction of the red cell lineage and a manifest (reticulin) myelofibrosis indicating an advanced stage of disease were accompanied by a significant delay to reach transfusion independence. This result was further supported by comparable findings in trephine biopsies performed in the early post-transplant period (second month after BMT). Corresponding examinations revealed an enhancement of fiber density and a decrease in erythropoiesis in those patients who did not conform with the usually accepted criteria for successful engraftment. In conclusion, compelling evidence has been produced that a significantly reduced amount of erythroid precursors, which is usually associated with myelofibrosis in the pretransplant bone marrow, exerts an impairment to undisturbed hematopoietic reconstitution. Moreover, a close spatial and numerical relationship between the erythroid lineage and resident (mature) macrophages is observable, in particular in the state of regeneration after BMT.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Beelen, D W', 'Pilgram, B', 'Rose, A', 'Leder, L D', 'Schaefer, U W']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Beelen DW', 'Pilgram B', 'Rose A', 'Leder LD', 'Schaefer UW']","['Institutes of Pathology, Universities of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Reticulin)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology/*therapy', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reticulin/*metabolism']",,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401838 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Aug;14(8):1378-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401838.,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-one patients, diagnosed and monitored from December 1994 to June 1999, were evaluated. The median age was 43 (16-60) years. The morphologic diagnosis was M3 in 40 (78%) and M3v in 11 (22%) patients. In 15 (30%) patients the initial white blood cell counts were > or =5 x 10(9)/l. The cytogenetic or molecular proof of the translocation t(15;17) was a mandatory prerequisite for eligibility. The diagnosis was confirmed by karyotyping in 46 and by RT-PCR of the PML/RARalpha transcript in 45 cases. The rate of complete hematological remission was 92% and the early death rate 8%. Monitoring of minimal residual disease by RT-PCR of PML/RARalpha (sensitivity 10(-4)) showed negativity in 29 of 32 (91%) evaluable cases after induction, in 23 of 25 (92%) after consolidation, and in 27 of 30 (90%) during maintenance, after a median time of 2, 4 and of 18 months after diagnosis, respectively. After a median follow-up of 27 months, the estimated actuarial 2 years overall and event-free survival were both 88% (79, 97), and the 2 years relapse-free survival 96% (90, 100). The high antileukemic efficacy of this treatment strategy is demonstrated by a rapid and extensive reduction of the malignant clone and by a low relapse rate. The results suggest that the intensity of the induction chemotherapy combined with ATRA is one of the factors which may have a critical influence on the outcome of APL.

The purpose of these two pilot studies, conducted between 1986 and 1994, was to explore the feasibility and acceptability of classifying ALL in this manner for selection of treatment rather than using conventional risk for failure factors such as age and initial white blood cell count. The possibility that conventional risk factors would be overcome and survival improved by this approach was also considered. Flow cytometry and chromosome analysis were used to classify the ALL of 150 children into one of five biologic categories as defined by cell surface antigens, DNA index and chromosome number and arrangement. Chemotherapy regimens depended on the assigned category. There was no provision for cranial irradiation and use of alkylating agents, anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxins was restricted in order to reduce risk of late adverse sequelae. All patients are included in the analysis regardless of presenting condition or adherence to protocol. The majority of patients were Mexican-American or African-American. Eight-year event-free survival (EFS) is 60.7% (+/-4%) and 8-year overall survival (OAS) 72.6% (+/-3.7%). EFS and OAS varied significantly among the biologic categories despite differences in chemotherapy regimens. When the patients with B-precursor ALL were retrospectively classified by current Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) criteria, 8-year EFS was 82% (+/-7.3%) for the good risk group, 68.9% (+/-5.9%) for the standard risk and 48.8% (+/-7.6%) for the poor risk, all significant differences. However, when retrospectively classified according to the Rome/NCI prognostic criteria the 8-year EFS for standard risk patients was 69.1% (+/-5.1%) and for high risk 58.8% (+/-6.9%), not a statistically significant difference. Numbers of T cell and B cell patients are too few for comparison. Gender and ethnicity influenced survival as in treatment based on prognostic factors. Initial central nervous system (CNS) relapse occurred in five patients (3%) and combined CNS and hematological relapse in six (3%). Factors significantly associated with CNS and combined relapse were leukemic pleocytosis in the initial CSF sample, pro-B immunophenotype and DNA index <1.16, but not initial white blood cell count. Only three survivors appear to have serious late adverse sequelae, the only neurologic the result of asparaginase-induced cortical vein thrombosis. The results suggest that use of biologic species as defined by immunophenotype and genotype to select therapy of ALL is feasible and acceptable but under the conditions of these studies offered no apparent therapeutic advantage over conventional risk grouping. However, the introduction of molecular genotyping and novel gene targeted therapeutic agents justify further exploration of this approach.","['Manera, R', 'Ramirez, I', 'Mullins, J', 'Pinkel, D']","['Manera R', 'Ramirez I', 'Mullins J', 'Pinkel D']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer, Center Houston, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401835 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Aug;14(8):1354-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401835.,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with AML in second/later relapse or refractory disease were first treated with a combination of high-dose cytarabine and amsacrine. Those who achieved complete remission were then randomized to observation or to receive LDAC, 10 mg/m2 subcutaneously twice a day x2 21 days every 2 months until relapse occurred. Of 86 patients eligible for randomization, 41 patients were assigned to receive LDAC and 45 patients to observation. The median disease-free survival was 7.4 months for patients assigned to LDAC compared to 3.3 months for patients receiving no additional therapy, P= 0.084. The median survival from randomization was 10.9 months and 7.0 months for patients receiving LDAC maintenance chemotherapy and observation, respectively (P= 0.615). The data from this study suggest that LDAC maintenance therapy given to patients with advanced AML who achieve complete remission can increase disease-free survival compared to observation, but does not improve overall survival. Nevertheless, because of the ineffectiveness and toxicity of intensive post-remission chemotherapy in this circumstance, LDAC maintenance therapy, a tolerable outpatient regimen, offers the potential for improved quality of life.","['Robles, C', 'Kim, K M', 'Oken, M M', 'Bennett, J M', 'Letendre, L', 'Wiernik, P H', ""O'Connell, M J"", 'Cassileth, P A']","['Robles C', 'Kim KM', 'Oken MM', 'Bennett JM', 'Letendre L', 'Wiernik PH', ""O'Connell MJ"", 'Cassileth PA']","['University of Miami School of Medicine, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401850 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Aug;14(8):1349-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401850.,,"['CA11083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13650/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

The ability to induce a second complete remission (CR) with the same chemotherapy used in initial induction therapy is limited. Remission inversion rate, defined as achieving a longer second CR than the first CR in response to standard chemotherapy for relapse, is important in assessing studies of novel chemotherapy or immunologic treatment strategies for patients with relapsed disease. One hundred and twenty-four patients entered on two Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) studies for patients with relapsed AML were analyzed to determine the remission inversion rate. Twenty-two of the 124 patients (18%; 95% confidence interval 12-26%) experienced a longer second CR duration than the first CR duration by at least 2 months. Inversion of CR duration is thus not a rare event.

The fact that the levels of other cytokines remained unchanged during treatment suggests that either these cytokines have no effect on reactive thrombocytosis or the change in platelet counts in our patients is in a narrow range and is thus not affected by the cytokine levels.","['Akan, H', 'Guven, N', 'Aydogdu, I', 'Arat, M', 'Beksac, M', 'Dalva, K']","['Akan H', 'Guven N', 'Aydogdu I', 'Arat M', 'Beksac M', 'Dalva K']","['Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey. akanh@pleksus.net.tr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Hypochromic/*complications/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Erythrocyte Indices', 'Erythropoietin/blood', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Growth Inhibitors/blood', 'Hematocrit', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Iron/therapeutic use', '*Iron Deficiencies', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Thrombocytosis/*etiology', 'Thrombopoietin/blood']",,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']","['41038 [pii]', '10.1159/000041038 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;103(3):152-6. doi: 10.1159/000041038.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 S.

Although all the cell lines have a wild-type (wt) p53 gene, the protein is in a mutant conformation detectable by the anti-p53 antibody PAb 240. Exposure of the cell lines to 1.0 microM ATRA for 72 h caused induction of apoptosis detectable by morphology and the annexin V assay. The number of apoptotic cells according to the annexin V assay varied from 16 +/- 8% (OU-AML-7) to 61 +/- 4% (OU-AML-3) in ATRA-treated cells, while it was 7 +/- 6% in control cells. Western blotting and flow cytometry showed down-regulation of the p53 protein by ATRA. The conformation of p53 remained unchanged, being detectable in flow cytometry by PAb 240, but not by PAb 1620 (an antibody which only detects p53 in wt conformation). At the same time bcl-2 was down-regulated as shown by Western blotting and flow cytometry, while no induction of bax was observed by ATRA. On the basis of these results, ATRA-induced apoptosis in these AML cell lines is independent of the p53 pathway, although it is associated with the down-regulation of bcl-2.","['Zheng, A', 'Mantymaa, P', 'Saily, M', 'Savolainen, E', 'Vahakangas, K', 'Koistinen, P']","['Zheng A', 'Mantymaa P', 'Saily M', 'Savolainen E', 'Vahakangas K', 'Koistinen P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']","['41036 [pii]', '10.1159/000041036 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;103(3):135-43. doi: 10.1159/000041036.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 S.

In all cases with promyelocytic leukemia (AML-M3) RAR-alpha gene rearrangements were detected (n = 9). Gene rearrangements in the Ig-JH or the TcR-beta or GM-CSF or IL-3 or MLL gene were detected in 12, 10, 16 and 12% of the cases, respectively, whereas only few cases showed gene rearrangements in the M-bcr (6%) or G-CSF gene (3%). Survival of pAML patients with TcR-beta gene rearrangements was longer and survival of pAML patients with IL-3 or GM-CSF gene rearrangement was shorter than in patients without those rearrangements. No worse survival outcome was seen in patients with rearrangements in the MLL, Ig-JH or M-bcr gene. In remission of AML (CR), clonal gene rearrangements were detected in 23 of 48 cases (48%) if samples were taken once in CR, in 23 of 26 cases (88%) if samples were taken twice in CR and in 23 of 23 cases (100%) if samples were studied three times in CR. All cases with gene rearrangements at diagnosis showed the same kind of rearrangement at relapse of the disease (n = 12). Our data show that (1) populations with clonal gene rearrangements can be regularly detected at diagnosis, in CR and at relapse of AML. (2) Certain gene rearrangements that are detectable at diagnosis have a prognostic significance for the patients' outcome. Our results point out the significance of gene rearrangement analyses at diagnosis of AML in order to identify 'poor risk' patients - independently of the karyotype. Moreover, the persistence of clonal cells in the further course of AML can be studied by gene rearrangement analysis.","['Schmetzer, H M', 'Braun, S', 'Wiesner, D', 'Duell, T', 'Gerhartz, H H', 'Mittermueller, J']","['Schmetzer HM', 'Braun S', 'Wiesner D', 'Duell T', 'Gerhartz HH', 'Mittermueller J']","['Klinikum Grosshadern, Medical Department III, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transcription Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/08/15 00:00,2000/09/23 00:00,['2000/08/15 00:00'],"['2000/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 00:00 [medline]', '2000/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['41035 [pii]', '10.1159/000041035 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;103(3):125-34. doi: 10.1159/000041035.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 S.

This disease is uniquely sensitive to treatment with pharmacological doses of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and the combination of ATRA with chemotherapy has improved the durable disease-free survival in these patients to up to 80%. APL is characterized by chromosomal translocations that lead to the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha) to various partner genes. RARalpha functions as a ligand-inducible transcription factor and the aberrant RARalpha fusion proteins contribute to leukemic transformation by dominant inhibition of the expression of target genes that are important for cellular differentiation. This may at least in part be explained by an abnormally strong interaction with corepressor proteins leading to deacetylation of DNA and silencing of target genes. Most RARalpha fusion proteins can still be induced to transactivate genes, but only at very high doses of ligand, explaining why pharmacological doses of ATRA are necessary to obtain a therapeutic effect in these patients.","['Breems-de Ridder, M C', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Jansen, J H']","['Breems-de Ridder MC', 'Lowenberg B', 'Jansen JH']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, PO Box 1738, 3000 DR, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",48,2000/08/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0303-7207(00)00255-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0303-7207(00)00255-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2000 Jul 25;165(1-2):1-6. doi: 10.1016/s0303-7207(00)00255-0.,,,,,,,,,,,

Its essential physiological role in modifying the topology of DNA involves the generation of transient double-strand breaks. Anti-cancer drugs, such as mitoxantrone, that target this enzyme interrupt its catalytic cycle and give rise to persistent double strand breaks, which may be lethal to a cell. We investigated the role of such lesions in signaling the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) by this drug. Mitoxantrone activated NFkappaB and stimulated IkappaBalpha degradation in the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 but not in the variant cells, HL60/MX2 cells, which lack the beta isoform of topoisomerase II and express a truncated alpha isoform that results in an altered subcellular distribution. Treatment of sensitive HL60 cells with mitoxantrone led to a depletion of both isoforms, suggesting the stabilization of transient DNA-topoisomerase II complexes. This depletion was absent in the variant cells, HL60/MX2. Activation of caspase 3 by mitoxantrone was also impaired in the HL60/MX2 cells. NFkappaB activation in response to tumor necrosis factor and bleomycin, the latter causing topoisomerase II-independent DNA damage, was intact in both cell lines. An inhibitor rather than a poison of topoisomerase II, Imperial Cancer Research Fund 187 (ICRF 187) the mechanism of which does not involve the generation of double strand breaks, did not activate NFkappaB, nor did it induce apoptosis in parental HL60 cells. However, ICRF 187 protected against IkappaB degradation in parental HL60 cells in response to mitoxantrone. This protection was also shown with another topoisomerase II inhibitor, merbarone, which is structurally and functionally distinct from ICRF 187. Their effects were specific, as neither protected against tumor necrosis factor-stimulated IkappaB degradation. The poisoning of topoiso- merase II with resultant DNA damage is therefore a critical signal for NFkappaB activation.","['Boland, M P', 'Fitzgerald, K A', ""O'Neill, L A""]","['Boland MP', 'Fitzgerald KA', ""O'Neill LA""]","['Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology Institute, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Thiobarbiturates)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'YWB9IF596V (merbarone)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Razoxane/pharmacology', 'Thiobarbiturates/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,2000/08/15 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/15 11:00'],"['2000/08/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/15 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)62080-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.275.33.25231 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Aug 18;275(33):25231-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.33.25231.,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 101 cases and 412 controls were investigated. RESULTS: Twenty subjects (9 cases and 11 controls) were considered exposed. A significant fourfold increase in risk for leukemia in exposed subjects and a dose-response relationship were found. The risk was higher than that reported by other studies. Potential biases related to the representativity of controls and validity of exposure assessment do not seem to have influenced the risk estimates.

Benzoquinone ansamycins also bind to and inhibit the activity of Hsp90. We now demonstrate that p210bcr-abl is complexed with Hsp90 and its cochaperone p23 in K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Brief exposure to the benzoquinone ansamycin Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) decreases the association of p210bcr-abl with Hsp90 and p23 and increases its association with the chaperones Hsp70 and p60Hop. GA has a similar effect on chaperone association with v-src, another Hsp90-dependent oncogenic kinase. Loss of Hsp90/p23 association and acquisition of Hsp70/p60Hop association of both p210bcr-abl and v-src precede GA-induced degradation of these kinases. GA-induced degradation is mediated by the proteasome because proteasome inhibitors block the effects of GA, causing both p210bcr-abl and v-src to accumulate in a detergent-insoluble cellular fraction. Both p210bcr-abl and v-src are more susceptible to GA-induced degradation than are their normal cellular counterparts, c-abl and c-src.","['An, W G', 'Schulte, T W', 'Neckers, L M']","['An WG', 'Schulte TW', 'Neckers LM']","['Department of Cell and Cancer Biology, Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Rockville, Maryland 20850, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 5.3.- (Intramolecular Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 5.3.99.3 (PTGES3 protein, human)', 'EC 5.3.99.3 (Prostaglandin-E Synthases)', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones/*metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Prostaglandin-E Synthases', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",,2000/08/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/12 11:00'],"['2000/08/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 2000 Jul;11(7):355-60.,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Unblinded, two-phase, single-center study. SETTING: Adult leukemia and stem cell transplant unit. PATIENTS: High-risk adults with febrile neutropenia. INTERVENTION: Two conditions were analyzed: a multidisciplinary ciprofloxacin stepdown program involving a reduction in parenteral ciprofloxacin dose from 400 to 200 mg (i.v.-i.v.) and conversion to oral ciprofloxacin (i.v.-p.o.) when criteria were met; and no i.v.-i.v. stepdown program. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-six sequential treatment courses were compared with 42 treatment course from 6-month periods in preintervention (P1) and postintervention (P2) phases. Assessed parameters were clinical and microbiologic outcomes, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and direct medical resource use and costs (1998 $Canadian) for the episode of febrile neutropenia. A decision analytic model was used to map probabilities and costs and to conduct sensitivity analyses. To supplement standard statistical testing, 1,000 bootstrap samples were created, and the mean cost difference was calculated between phases for each sample. Patient demographics, percentage i.v.-p.o. stepdown, and duration of therapy were similar between phases. Clinical success (83% P1, 81% P2), microbiologic eradication (15% P1, 24% P2), and possible ADRs (6% P1, 9% P2) did not differ. Intravenous-to-intravenous dose stepdown occurred in 33% of P2 and no P1 treatment courses (p<0.001). Resource use and costs were similar between phases, although a reduction was seen in the drug's mean total cost/day ($58 P1, $52 P2, p=0.04). There was also a trend toward a decrease in mean total treatment costs ($4,843 P1, $3,493 P2, p=0.08). In 1,000 bootstrap samples, 99.8% showed a cost advantage for P2. The model was robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: This intervention influenced administration of ciprofloxacin without apparent compromise of patient outcomes and resulted in a reduction in total costs of treating febrile neutropenia.","['Marra, C A', 'Frighetto, L', 'Quaia, C B', 'de Lemos, M L', 'Warkentin, D I', 'Marra, F', 'Jewesson, P J']","['Marra CA', 'Frighetto L', 'Quaia CB', 'de Lemos ML', 'Warkentin DI', 'Marra F', 'Jewesson PJ']","['CSU Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)']",IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Ciprofloxacin/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Female', 'Fever/complications/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/08/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/12 11:00'],"['2000/08/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1592/phco.20.11.931.35258 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2000 Aug;20(8):931-40. doi: 10.1592/phco.20.11.931.35258.,,,,,,,,,,,

We are investigating the possibilities to use LDL as a drug carrier to increase the selectivity of antineoplastic drugs in cancer chemotherapy. We have developed a method to incorporate lipophilic cytotoxic agents without interfering with the in vitro and in vivo properties of LDL. In this study, we examined the stability of some drug-LDL complexes in blood and plasma as this is an important prerequisite to achieve a selective therapy. The in vitro dialysis of N-trifluoroacetyl-adriamycin-14-valerat-LDL (AD-32-LDL) against plasma revealed a slow dissociation of the complex. The same method showed a fast and total leakage of paclitaxel from paclitaxel-LDL into the plasma chamber. The dissociation of paclitaxel was confirmed by an autoradiographic study of the distribution of paclitaxel-LDL in tumour-bearing mice. In patients with leukemia the rapid plasma dissociation of AD-32 from LDL illustrated a much higher in vivo instability of this complex. With this method, cholesteryl-linoleate only could be incorporated into LDL in a stable manner as shown by dialysis and autoradiography results. The incorporation of cytotoxic drug derivatives, containing lipophilic anchors, is now under study in order to obtain LDL complexes with better plasma stability.","['Masquelier, M', 'Vitols, S', 'Palsson, M', 'Mars, U', 'Larsson, B S', 'Peterson, C O']","['Masquelier M', 'Vitols S', 'Palsson M', 'Mars U', 'Larsson BS', 'Peterson CO']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Institute and Hospital, S-171-76 Stockholm, Sweden. mich@comnet.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Drug Target,Journal of drug targeting,9312476,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '2C6NUM6878 (valrubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/blood/therapeutic use', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/*blood/therapeutic use']",,2000/08/12 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/08/12 11:00'],"['2000/08/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['I383C001003 [pii]', '10.3109/10611860008996861 [doi]']",ppublish,J Drug Target. 2000;8(3):155-64. doi: 10.3109/10611860008996861.,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of SMRT to associate with these transcription factors and thereby to mediate repression is strongly inhibited by activation of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, such as that represented by the epidermal growth factor receptor. We report here that SMRT function is potently inhibited by a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MAPKKK) cascade that operates downstream of this growth factor receptor. Intriguingly, the SMRT protein is a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinases operating at multiple levels in this MAPKKK pathway, including the MAPKs, MAPK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK-1), and MEK-1 kinase (MEKK-1). Phosphorylation of SMRT by MEKK-1 and, to a lesser extent, MEK-1 inhibits the ability of SMRT to physically tether to its transcription factor partners. Notably, activation of MEKK-1 or MEK-1 signaling in transfected cells also leads to a redistribution of the SMRT protein from a nuclear compartment to a more perinuclear or cytoplasmic compartment. We suggest that SMRT-mediated repression is regulated by the MAPKKK cascade and that changes both in the affinity of SMRT for its transcription factors and in the subcellular distribution of SMRT contribute to the loss of SMRT function that is observed in response to kinase signal transduction.","['Hong, S H', 'Privalsky, M L']","['Hong SH', 'Privalsky ML']","['Section of Microbiology, University of California at Davis, Davis, California 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, erbB-1/genetics', 'Haplorhini', 'Immunoblotting', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,2000/08/11 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/11 11:00'],"['2000/08/11 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/11 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.17.6612-6625.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Sep;20(17):6612-25. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.17.6612-6625.2000.,,"['R01 DK053528/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA053394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK-53528/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA-53394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC86146,,,,,

PLZF contains an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain which is required for dimerization, transcriptional repression, formation of high-molecular-weight DNA-protein complexes, nuclear sublocalization, and growth suppression. X-ray crystallographic data show that the PLZF BTB/POZ domain forms an obligate homodimer via an extensive interface. In addition, the dimer possesses several highly conserved features, including a charged pocket, a hydrophobic monomer core, an exposed hydrophobic surface on the floor of the dimer, and two negatively charged surface patches. To determine the role of these structures, mutational analysis of the BTB/POZ domain was performed. We found that point mutations in conserved residues that disrupt the dimer interface or the monomer core result in a misfolded nonfunctional protein. Mutation of key residues from the exposed hydrophobic surface suggests that these are also important for the stability of PLZF complexes. The integrity of the charged-pocket region was crucial for proper folding of the BTB/POZ domain. In addition, the pocket was critical for the ability of the BTB/POZ domain to repress transcription. Alteration of charged-pocket residue arginine 49 to a glutamine (mutant R49Q) yields a domain that can still dimerize but activates rather than represses transcription. In the context of full-length PLZF, a properly folded BTB/POZ domain was required for all PLZF functions. However, PLZF with the single pocket mutation R49Q repressed transcription, while the double mutant D35N/R49Q could not, despite its ability to dimerize. These results indicate that PLZF requires the BTB/POZ domain for dimerization and the charged pocket for transcriptional repression.","['Melnick, A', 'Ahmad, K F', 'Arai, S', 'Polinger, A', 'Ball, H', 'Borden, K L', 'Carlile, G W', 'Prive, G G', 'Licht, J D']","['Melnick A', 'Ahmad KF', 'Arai S', 'Polinger A', 'Ball H', 'Borden KL', 'Carlile GW', 'Prive GG', 'Licht JD']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (ABTB1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arginine/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry', 'Dimerization', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Glutamine/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Repressor Proteins/*chemistry', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Temperature', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Trypsin/pharmacology', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,2000/08/11 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/11 11:00'],"['2000/08/11 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/11 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.17.6550-6567.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Sep;20(17):6550-67. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.17.6550-6567.2000.,,"['R01 CA059936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO8 CA73762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC86130,,,,,

Functional experiments further demonstrated that this interaction has the capacity to render GATA-dependent transcription inducible by retinoic acid, raising the possibility that GATA target genes may be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of APL.","['Tsuzuki, S', 'Towatari, M', 'Saito, H', 'Enver, T']","['Tsuzuki S', 'Towatari M', 'Saito H', 'Enver T']","['Section of Gene Function and Regulation, Institute of Cancer Research, London SW3 6JB, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,2000/08/11 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/11 11:00'],"['2000/08/11 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/11 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.17.6276-6286.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Sep;20(17):6276-86. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.17.6276-6286.2000.,,,,,,PMC86102,,,,,

Grades II to IV acute GVHD occur in 10 to 50% of patients given an allogeneic transplantation of haemopoietic stem cells (HSCT) from a genotypically HLA-identical donor. A significantly higher incidence and severity of the disease is reported in patients receiving transplants from partially matched family donors or unrelated volunteers. Younger individuals or patients receiving HSCT from younger donors develop GVHD less frequently than do older recipients. Severe acute GVHD is characterised by a significant decrease in survival probability, even though the graft-versus-leukaemia activity associated with both acute and chronic GVHD may reduce the risk of leukaemia relapse. Prophylaxis of acute GVHD usually consists of in vivo post-grafting immunosuppression with cyclosporin alone or in combination with methotrexate; methotrexate alone can be considered in leukaemia patients with a high risk of relapse. In recent years, tacrolimus is increasingly being used instead of cyclosporin, alone or in combination with methotrexate. In vitro T cell depletion in paediatric patients is usually reserved for those with transplants from partially matched family donors or unrelated volunteers. The treatment of patients with grades II to IV acute GVHD should be immediate and aggressive, as the quality and duration of the response directly correlates with survival. The overall response rate to treatment is often unsatisfactory, ranging from 40 to 50% of cases. First-line treatment usually consists of corticosteroids. In patients not responding to corticosteroids, antilymphocyte globulin and monoclonal antibodies directed towards lymphocytes and/or cytokines produced during GVHD are employed, but with variable success. Patients experiencing acute GVHD are also prone to develop chronic GVHD. whose classical treatment is based on the use of cyclosporin and corticosteroids. More recently, encouraging results in the treatment of patients with chronic GVHD have been reported with the use of extracorporeal photochemotherapy. Other drugs, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, etretinate and clofazimine, are under evaluation.","['Zecca, M', 'Locatelli, F']","['Zecca M', 'Locatelli F']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Pavia, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Paediatr Drugs,Paediatric drugs,100883685,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use']",208,2000/08/11 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/11 11:00'],"['2000/08/11 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/11 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00148581-200002010-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Paediatr Drugs. 2000 Jan-Feb;2(1):29-55. doi: 10.2165/00148581-200002010-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,

At that time the outlook for such children was certain death. Now patients have an odds-on chance of normal health and life expectancy. Although the greatest gains have been made in recent years, the classes of drug that have achieved this have all been available for over 20 years. It is their better deployment and the greater understanding of their pharmacology that have allowed both more effective protocols to be devised and long term adverse effects to be recognised and avoided. Supportive treatment has also improved in parallel. Three major problems remain: (i) how to recognise children in whom conventional therapy will fail; (ii) how to prevent failure; and (iii) how to treat it if it occurs. Therapy will fail in some children for pharmacological reasons--noncompliance or constitutional (genetic) drug resistance. For such children in vitro drug sensitivity testing and greater pharmacological vigilance may help by identifying those at risk and allowing intervention. In others, treatment will fail because of intrinsically resistant disease that either develops despite therapy or regrows from a minimal residue. Despite wider application of sophisticated immunological and genetic studies both at diagnosis or later, recognising poor-prognosis children prospectively is hampered by the lack of a biological classification system that is sufficiently sensitive and specific to categorise all patients reliably. In those where there is no doubt about high-risk status, treatment failure rates are still unacceptably high whatever therapy is given, and salvage therapy in any child who relapses is a continuing challenge.","['Lilleyman, J']",['Lilleyman J'],"[""St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine, The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, England.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Paediatr Drugs,Paediatric drugs,100883685,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy']",100,2000/08/11 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/11 11:00'],"['2000/08/11 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/11 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00128072-199901030-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Paediatr Drugs. 1999 Jul-Sep;1(3):197-209. doi: 10.2165/00128072-199901030-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of this marker in the evaluation of small round cell tumors has not been evaluated.

Among nonlymphoid small round cell tumors, four of 85 ES/PNET were at least focally reactive. No other lesion in this group was positive. In contrast, the majority of well-differentiated (11 of 17), intermediately differentiated (two of three), and lymphoblastic lymphomas (three of three) were positive. Small cleaved lymphomas (three of 13 follicular, one of 13 diffuse) were less often reactive, whereas small noncleaved lesions were negative. Although reactivity for CD31 in ES/PNET is uncommon, the presence of platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule in a small cell neoplasm should not in isolation be taken as evidence of hematopoietic origin.

Many paraffin-reactive antibodies are now available but have been studied mostly in isolation. Therefore, the utility of a panel of paraffin-reactive antibodies in differentiating small B-cell neoplasms was investigated. Paraffin-embedded sections of small lymphocytic lymphoma/B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/B-CLL; 12), mantle cell (MCL; 15), follicular (FL; 11), and marginal zone B-cell (MZL; eight) lymphomas were stained with CD20/L26, CD3, CD43/DF-T1 or Leu22, CD5/4C7, CD23/BU38, cyclin D1/H295, and CD10/56C6 antibodies. For select antibodies, results were compared to flow cytometric data (FC). Formalin and B5 fixation were also compared. Seven of 11 SLL/B-CLL were CD43+ CD5+ CD23+ cyclin D1- CD10-; seven of 11 MCL were CD43+ CD5+ CD23- cyclin D1+ CD10-; nine of 10 FL were CD43- CD5- CD23- cyclin D1- CD10+; and five of six MZL were CD43+ CD5- CD23- cyclin D1- CD10-. CD5, CD23, and CD10 stains showed sensitivities of 81, 88, and 100%, respectively, compared to FC. With B5 fixation, cyclin D1 was more often negative and CD5 more often equivocal. A panel of paraffin-reactive antibodies aids in classification of small B-cell neoplasms, although a small number of cases have indeterminate phenotypes and MZL have no defining features. CD5 separates most SLL/B-CLL and MCL from FL and MZL. CD23 separates SLL/B-CLL from most MCL, but cyclin D1 is most important for identifying MCL. CD10 positivity distinguishes most FL from other small B-cell lymphoid neoplasms.","['Chen, C C', 'Raikow, R B', 'Sonmez-Alpan, E', 'Swerdlow, S H']","['Chen CC', 'Raikow RB', 'Sonmez-Alpan E', 'Swerdlow SH']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania 15213-2582, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*classification/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/classification/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/classification/metabolism/pathology', 'Paraffin Embedding']",,2000/08/11 11:00,2000/09/09 11:01,['2000/08/11 11:00'],"['2000/08/11 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/09 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/11 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00129039-200003000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2000 Mar;8(1):1-11. doi: 10.1097/00129039-200003000-00001.,,,,,,,,,,,

Three subsets have been described: M6A (myeloblast-rich erythroleukemia); M6B (proerythroblast-rich erythroleukemia); and M6C (myeloblast- and proerythroblast-rich mixed variant). This study was undertaken to define and compare the clinical courses and survival outcomes among M6A, M6B, and M6C variants of erythroleukemia. Sixty-nine cases of M6 leukemia were categorized as consisting of >/=50% erythroid of all nucleated cells and M6A with >/=30% myeloblasts/nonerythroid component; M6B with >/=30% proerythroblasts/erythroid component; and M6C with >/=30% myeloblasts and >/=30% proerythroblasts. The demographics, cell type distribution, and survival (mean +/- sd) of these groups were compared. There were 32 M6A, 26 M6B, and 11 M6C patients. No significant difference was seen among the groups in age, sex, or treatment. Compared to M6A, both the M6B (P< 0.0001) and M6C (P< 0.0001) variants showed a statistically significant increase in the percentage of bone marrow erythroid cells, proerythroblasts, and the proerythroblasts/erythroid ratios. Comparing the groups for survival, M6B (3 +/- 3.6 months) versus M6A (25 +/- 28 months), P< 0. 002, and M6C (10 +/- 13 months) versus M6A, P< 0.01 had a poorer prognosis. Calculating the proerythroblasts as a component of total bone marrow erythroids provides a complimentary method for delineating the pure red cell erythroleukemia (M6B) and mixed variant (M6C), similar to that for the myeloid/erythroid (M6A) leukemia. Now that it is possible to delineate erythroleukemia subtypes, innovative treatments are indicated to target the malignant erythroid population, which is resistant to myeloid-based therapies.","['Kowal-Vern, A', 'Mazzella, F M', 'Cotelingam, J D', 'Shrit, M A', 'Rector, J T', 'Schumacher, H R']","['Kowal-Vern A', 'Mazzella FM', 'Cotelingam JD', 'Shrit MA', 'Rector JT', 'Schumacher HR']","['Department of Pathology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois, USA. avern@enteract.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Erythroblasts/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*classification/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,2000/08/11 11:00,2000/09/09 11:01,['2000/08/11 11:00'],"['2000/08/11 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/09 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/11 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1096-8652(200009)65:1<5::AID-AJH2>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/1096-8652(200009)65:1<5::aid-ajh2>3.0.co;2-u [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2000 Sep;65(1):5-13. doi: 10.1002/1096-8652(200009)65:1<5::aid-ajh2>3.0.co;2-u.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Subsequent analyses revealed differences between the wild type U937 and the R-U937 cells with respect to G1 phase arrest, which seemed to occur in U937 because of low levels of cdk2 kinase activity. This abolished cdk2 kinase activity is mainly due to inhibition of cdk2 phosphorylation, cyclin A down-regulation and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 up-regulation.

Infiltration of tissues by monocytes requires degradation of extracellular matrices, a process that involves matrix metalloproteinases. We studied the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, alpha, and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) ligands on MCP-1-directed migration and matrix metalloproteinase expression of a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). PPARgamma ligands attenuated MCP-1-induced migration, with 50% inhibition (IC(50)) at 2.8 microM for troglitazone and 4.8 microM for rosiglitazone. PPARalpha ligands WY-14643 (IC(50): 0.9 microM) and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetranoic acid (IC(50): 9.9 microM), and the potent RXRalpha ligand AGN 4204 (IC(50): 3.6 nM) also blocked monocyte migration. Troglitazone, rosiglitazone, or AGN 4204 inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. PPARalpha activators WY-14643 and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, however, had no inhibitory effect. AGN 4204 increased PMA-induced tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) expression, whereas all PPAR ligands showed no effect. All PPAR and RXRalpha ligands blocked chemotaxis of THP-1 monocytes in the absence of a matrix barrier. This study demonstrates that activated PPARs and RXRalpha, block MCP-1-directed monocyte migration, mediated, at least in part, through their effects on matrix metalloproteinase-9 or TIMP-1 production, or chemotaxis.","['Kintscher, U', 'Goetze, S', 'Wakino, S', 'Kim, S', 'Nagpal, S', 'Chandraratna, R A', 'Graf, K', 'Fleck, E', 'Hsueh, W A', 'Law, R E']","['Kintscher U', 'Goetze S', 'Wakino S', 'Kim S', 'Nagpal S', 'Chandraratna RA', 'Graf K', 'Fleck E', 'Hsueh WA', 'Law RE']","['Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Hypertension, School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Suite 24-130, Warren Hall, 900 Veteran Avenue, 90095, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '05V02F2KDG (Rosiglitazone)', '1191-85-1 (5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic Acid)', '86C4MRT55A (pirinixic acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'I66ZZ0ZN0E (Troglitazone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,,"['5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL2/*pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*agonists', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*agonists', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Rosiglitazone', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', '*Thiazolidinediones', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*agonists', 'Troglitazone', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/11 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/08/11 11:00'],"['2000/08/11 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/11 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0014299900004611 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(00)00461-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2000 Aug 11;401(3):259-70. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(00)00461-1.,,['HL-58328-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The disease is progressive and always lethal characterized by the slow proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Much of our current understanding of the biology of MM has been obtained by studying MM-derived cell lines. Human myeloma cell lines were shown to be suitable model systems for use in various fields of the biological sciences. However, it has proved very difficult to establish cell lines from plasma cell dyscrasias. Most reported MM cell lines have been derived from patients with advanced disease and from extramedullary sites. Nevertheless, within the last 20 years more than 100 cell lines have been established. A significant portion of this panel is partially or well characterized with regard to their cell culture, clinical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and functional features. Distinct immunoprofiles could be assigned to MM cell lines. All MM cell lines display chromosomal aberrations; in more than 80% of the cell lines analyzed, chromosome 14 band q32 (immunoglobulin heavy chain locus) is affected; the various types of 14q+ chromosomes showed different distributions among the MM cell lines. A large percentage of MM cell lines is constitutively interleukin-6-dependent or responsive to various cytokines. It is important to realize that not every cell line established from a patient with myeloma is a neoplastic cell line. So-called 'myeloma cell lines' have been previously reported and are still widely used which are in reality Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B-lymphoblastoid cell lines.

Expected numbers of CLL cases were based on the age-adjusted incidence rates in non-Hispanic whites and compared to numbers of cases observed in Chinese, Japanese and Filipinos. Possible association of socioeconomic state (SES) was assessed using AAIRs with SES-specific denominators. In the absence of denominators by birthplace, the association of birthplace and CLL-incidence was evaluated using proportional odds ratios (POR). Los Angeles County Asian males and females had significantly lower AAIRs than non-Hispanic whites (males: AAIR=0.7 per 100000 population, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.5-1.0 vs. 4.4, 95% CI, 4.3-4.6; and females: AAIR=0.5, 95% CI, 0.3-0.7 vs. 2.3, 95% CI, 2.2-2.4). Fewer Japanese Chinese and Filipinos were diagnosed with CLL than expected (P<0.01). There was no association of birthplace (POR=0.9, 95% CI, 0. 5-1.9) or SES on CLL-risk.

Monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (DCs) donated by 11 ATL patients were suppressed in the ability to take up fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran and were down-regulated in the expression of CD1a and CD86 antigens (Ags). Monocytes from the patients showed impaired expression of CD14 and HLA-DR Ags. These results suggest intrinsic abnormalities of monocytes and a defect of DC maturation in ATL patients. Therefore, we examined the influence of HTLV-I infection of monocytes on their differentiation to DCs. Monocytes obtained from healthy donors were susceptible to HTLV-I infection in vitro. HTLV-I-infected monocytes were down-regulated in the expression of CD14 Ags, and immature DCs obtained from them expressed CD1a poorly and were impaired in the ability to take up FITC-dextran. Mature DCs differentiated from these cells could not stimulate autologous CD4(+) T cell or CD8(+) T cell proliferation, even after being secondarily pulsed with HTLV-I at an immature DC stage. These results suggest that HTLV-I-infected monocytes cannot properly differentiate to DCs and that this might be one of the important mechanisms producing dysfunctional DCs in ATL patients.","['Makino, M', 'Wakamatsu, S', 'Shimokubo, S', 'Arima, N', 'Baba, M']","['Makino M', 'Wakamatsu S', 'Shimokubo S', 'Arima N', 'Baba M']","['Division of Human Retroviruses, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Kagoshima University, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima 890-8520, Japan. makino-m@cb3.so-net.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,['130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*immunology/virology', 'Phenotype']",,2000/08/11 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/11 11:00'],"['2000/08/11 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/11 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.2000.0445 [doi]', 'S0042682200904458 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2000 Aug 15;274(1):140-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0445.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

IE1 causes a redistribution of both PML and IE1 from the PODs into a nuclear diffuse form, whereas IE2 initially localizes adjacent to PODs but later associates with viral DNA replication compartments. The peripheries of PODs are also believed to be sites for initiation of both viral IE transcription and DNA replication. However, because IE1 is nonessential at high multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) in HF cells, the exact role of these processes in viral infection has been enigmatic. Therefore, we investigated the effects of overexpression of PML in the presence or absence of IE1 on the intranuclear distribution of IE2 and formation of viral DNA replication compartments, as well as on the levels of delayed-early and late viral transcription and protein accumulation. Infection with wild-type HCMV(Towne) and the IE1-deleted derivative HCMV(CR208), which fails to disrupt PODs, was compared in a pair of related astrocytoma/glioblastoma cell lines, the U373-Neo control and a variant U373-PML that constitutively overexpresses PML(560) in much larger than normal PODs. IFA studies on the localization patterns for IE1, IE2, and PML showed that, although the numbers of IE2-positive cells were not significantly reduced in either the wild-type virus-infected U373-PML cell line or in DeltaIE1-infected control cells, POD disruption by IE1 in wild-type virus infection was delayed by up to 6 h in U373-PML cells compared to control cells. Furthermore, there was considerable enhancement of IE2 colocalization with PODs in Delta IE1-infected U373-PML cells. Formation of viral DNA replication compartments in the U373-PML cell line was also greatly delayed, measured at fivefold lower after wild-type virus infection and 12-fold lower after infection with Delta IE1 than in the control cell line at 48 h at an m.o.i. of 1.0. The levels of representative early and late viral proteins detected by Western blotting were suppressed by fivefold and 22-fold at 24 and 72 h, respectively, in the U373-PML cell line, even with high m. o.i. wild-type HCMV infection. Decreased viral protein levels also occurred when control cells were infected with the Delta IE1 virus and these two effects were additive in the U373-PML cell line. Similarly, when U373-PML cells were infected with recombinant HCMV expressing an extragenic luciferase reporter gene under the control of viral early (Pol) or late (pp28) promoters, their transcriptional activation was reduced up to fivefold at both high and low m.o.i. compared to that of the control cells. Overall, these results suggest that POD disruption by IE1 and subsequent redistribution of both PML and IE1 at very early times after infection may play an important role in the efficient utilization of cellular transcription and replication machinery by HCMV and contribute to rapid progression of the HCMV lytic cycle.","['Ahn, J H', 'Hayward, G S']","['Ahn JH', 'Hayward GS']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 725 N.

Record linkage with the Louisiana tumour registry (LTR) provided information on cancer for cases occurring between 1983 and 1994. Standardised incidence ratios (SIR), with the south Louisiana population as a comparison, were computed for all cancers, all LH malignancies and specific LH subtypes. Analyses were conducted for sex and race categories, and by period of first employment, job type, duration of employment, and latency. RESULTS: 672 Cases of cancer were identified, including 59 LH malignancies. Women (n=1169) had an overall cancer SIR below unity and four LH malignancies versus 2.28 expected. Among the 7773 men, those first employed before 1950 had no overall cancer excess, a significant 1.4-fold increase in overall LH malignancies (43 observed versus 30.78 expected), and four CLL cases versus 3.27 expected. Findings for men first employed after 1950 are based on fewer cases, but there was no indication of excesses of overall cancer or LH malignancy. Numbers were too small in the group first employed after 1950 for meaningful analysis of LH malignancy subtypes such as CLL (one case). CONCLUSION: These findings do not suggest a continuing excess of CLL but do suggest a small increase in incidence of overall LH malignancy for workers first employed before 1950. This may reflect associations with earlier workplace conditions, although work related patterns are mixed. Interpretation is limited by the diverse group of diseases within LH malignancies, and the lack of control for non-work factors other than sex, age, race, and period of diagnosis. This study has a major advantage of more complete and reliable cancer ascertainment compared with the mortality investigation, and shows the feasibility and benefits of using cancer registry incidence data in an occupational cohort study.","['Huebner, W W', 'Chen, V W', 'Friedlander, B R', 'Wu, X C', 'Jorgensen, G', 'Bhojani, F A', 'Friedmann, C H', 'Schmidt, B A', 'Sales, E A', 'Joy, J A', 'Correa, C N']","['Huebner WW', 'Chen VW', 'Friedlander BR', 'Wu XC', 'Jorgensen G', 'Bhojani FA', 'Friedmann CH', 'Schmidt BA', 'Sales EA', 'Joy JA', 'Correa CN']","['Epidemiology and Health Surveillance, Exxon Biomedical Sciences, 1545 Route 22, PO Box 971, Annandale, New Jersey 08801-0971, USA. wwhuebn@erenj.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Louisiana/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', '*Petroleum', 'Time Factors']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.57.9.605 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2000 Sep;57(9):605-14. doi: 10.1136/oem.57.9.605.,,,,,,PMC1740012,,,,,

METHODS: Employees from 1964-83 were linked to the Canadian mortality data base to provide 11 years additional follow up. There were 6760 deaths and 750 683 person-years of follow up compared with 3909 and 428 190, respectively, in the earlier study. Analyses used standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare worker cause specific mortality with the Canadian general population. Duration of employment and latency analyses were performed for causes previously found to be increased in this and other petroleum cohorts, as well as any findings of interest. RESULTS: For the period 1964-94, employees experienced significantly low overall mortality (SMR=0.86 men, SMR=0.80 women). Kidney cancer, which has been increased in some studies of petroleum workers, was not increased. Acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia in exposed operating segments was consistent with the expected or only slightly, non-significantly increased. The most notable finding was increased deaths from mesothelioma among refinery and petrochemical workers (SMR 8.68; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 5.51 to 13.03), most of whom were long term employees in jobs with presumed exposure to asbestos (mechanical and pipefitters). Deaths from multiple myeloma among marketing and distribution workers, which were previously increased, remained increased (SMR 2.08; 95% CI 0.95 to 3.95) in the update period 1984-94; however, there was no clear pattern by duration of employment or latency. Aortic aneurysms, which also were previously significantly increased among marketing and distribution workers approached the expected in the update period (SMR 1.18; 95% CI 0. 65-1.98). Analyses by duration of employment showed suggestive trends for aortic aneurysms, but earlier studies of this cohort have not found a relation between aortic aneurysms and exposure to hydrocarbons. CONCLUSION: The additional 2851 deaths and 322 493 person-years of follow up strengthened the assessment of mortality patterns relative to occupational factors. With the exception of mesothelioma, no clear work related increases in disease were identified.","['Lewis, R J', 'Schnatter, A R', 'Katz, A M', 'Thompson, F S', 'Murray, N', 'Jorgensen, G', 'Theriault, G']","['Lewis RJ', 'Schnatter AR', 'Katz AM', 'Thompson FS', 'Murray N', 'Jorgensen G', 'Theriault G']","['ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences, 1545 Route 22, Room LF 264, PO Box 971, Annandale, NJ 08801-0971, USA. rjlewis@fpe.erenj.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,,"['Canada/epidemiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Extraction and Processing Industry/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Occupations', '*Petroleum']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.57.9.595 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2000 Sep;57(9):595-604. doi: 10.1136/oem.57.9.595.,,,,,,PMC1740013,,,,,

However, interactions among these factors that result in successful implantation are not clearly understood. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a pleiotropic cytokine, was shown to be expressed in uterine glands on day 4 morning before implantation and is critical to this process in mice. However, the mechanism by which LIF executes its effects in implantation remains unknown. Moreover, interactions of LIF with other implantation-specific molecules have not yet been defined. Using normal and delayed implantation models, we herein show that LIF is not only expressed in progesterone (P4)-primed uterine glands before implantation in response to nidatory estrogen, it is also induced in stromal cells surrounding the active blastocyst at the time of the attachment reaction. This suggests that LIF has biphasic effects: first in the preparation of the receptive uterus and subsequently in the attachment reaction. The mechanism by which LIF participates in these events was addressed using LIF-deficient mice. We observed that while uterine cell-specific proliferation, steroid hormone responsiveness, and expression patterns of several genes are normal, specific members of the EGF family of growth factors, such as amphiregulin (Ar), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and epiregulin, are not expressed in LIF(-/-) uteri before and during the anticipated time of implantation, although EGF receptor family members (erbBs) are expressed correctly. Furthermore, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an inducible rate-limiting enzyme for PG synthesis and essential for implantation, is aberrantly expressed in the uterus surrounding the blastocyst in LIF(-/-) mice. These results suggest that dysregulation of specific EGF-like growth factors and COX-2 in the uterus contributes, at least partially, to implantation failure in LIF(-/-) mice. Since estrogen is essential for uterine receptivity, LIF induction, and blastocyst activation, it is possible that the nidatory estrogen effects in the P4-primed uterus for implantation are mediated via LIF signaling. However, we observed that LIF can only partially resume implantation in P4-primed, delayed implanting mice in the absence of estrogen, suggesting LIF induction is one of many functions that are executed by estrogen for implantation.","['Song, H', 'Lim, H', 'Das, S K', 'Paria, B C', 'Dey, S K']","['Song H', 'Lim H', 'Das SK', 'Paria BC', 'Dey SK']","['Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, Ralph L.

In the present study, we used confocal laser scanning microscopy and fluo-3, a calcium-sensitive indicator, to investigate the effects of Ms-ACh receptor agonists on the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in single cells from human T-cell (CEM) and B-cell (Daudi) lines, which we used as models of lymphocytes. In both cell lines, stimulation of Ms-ACh receptors with ACh (0.1-100 microM), bethanechol (100 microM), car-bachol (100 microM) or oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M; 0.1-100 microM) induced [Ca2+]i-dependent increases in fluo-3 fluorescence, which in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ were followed by oscillations in [Ca2+]i that persisted for at least 10 min. All effects were completely blocked by atropine (1 microM), an Ms-ACh receptor antagonist. In both cell lines Oxo-M (100 microM) up-regulated expression of c-fos mRNA in an extracellular Ca2+-dependent manner. Again, the effect was blocked by 1 microM atropine. These results provide the first evidence that stimulation of Ms-ACh receptors induces Ca2+ oscillations and up-regulates c-fos gene expression in T- and B-lymphocytes, which is consistent with the notion that ACh released from T-lymphocytes triggers nuclear signaling via Ms-ACh receptors.","['Fujii, T', 'Kawashima, K']","['Fujii T', 'Kawashima K']","['Department of Pharmacology, Kyoritsu College of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Muscarinic Agonists)', '0 (Muscarinic Antagonists)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', '5RY0UWH1JL (Oxotremorine)', '7C0697DR9I (Atropine)', 'N9YNS0M02X (Acetylcholine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Acetylcholine/pharmacology', 'Atropine/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genes, fos/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Muscarinic Agonists/pharmacology', 'Muscarinic Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Oxotremorine/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/*drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002100000251 [doi]'],ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2000 Jul;362(1):14-21. doi: 10.1007/s002100000251.,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparing telomere sizes in Philadelphia-positive versus -negative cells, we found generally shorter telomeres in the Philadelphia-positive cells, but with an expansion of the telomere on the long arm of one chromosome 11 homologue. This expansion was also found in a minority of Philadelphia-negative cells. The telomeres in these cells were of the same overall size as the telomeres in the Philadelphia-negative cells without the 11q expansion. Together, these findings suggest that the order of events was: 11q telomere expansion, Philadelphia translocation, overall telomere shortening. The expanded 11q telomere contained the standard telomeric (AGGGTT)(n) repeat, but also variant repeat sequences. The single telomere expansion suggests a non-telomerase mechanism behind the expansion which may also explain the presence of variant repeats in the expanded telomere. The present case illustrates that telomere changes may occur at only some chromosome ends in a subset of cells. To reveal such changes, telomere morphology should be studied with in situ methodology.","['Krejci, K', 'Stentoft, J', 'Koch, J']","['Krejci K', 'Stentoft J', 'Koch J']","['Department of Medicine and Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Telomere']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.neo.7900065 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 1999 Dec;1(6):492-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.neo.7900065.,,,,,,PMC1508118,,,,,

As described here, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of 35 primary ALL samples with cytogenetic evidence of 12p abnormalities revealed hemizygous deletions of p27KIP1 in 29 cases. Further analysis of 19 of these cases with two additional gene-specific probes from the 12p region (hematopoietic cell phosphatase, HCP and cyclin D2, CCND2) showed that p27KIP1 is located more proximally on the short arm of chromosome 12 and is deleted more frequently than either HCP or CCND2. Of 16 of these cases with hemizygous deletion of p27KIP1, only eight showed loss of HCP or CCND2, whereas loss of either of the latter two loci was uniformly associated with loss of p27KIP1. Missense mutations or mutations leading to premature termination codons were not detected in the coding sequences of the retained p27KIP1 alleles in any of the 16 ALL cases examined, indicating a lack of homozygous inactivation. By Southern blot analysis, one case of primary T-cell ALL had hemizygous loss of a single p27KIP1 allele and a 34.5-kb deletion, including the second coding exon of the other allele. Despite homozygous inactivation of p27KP1 in this case, our data suggest that haploinsufficiency for p27KIP1 is the primary consequence of 12p chromosomal deletions in childhood ALL. The oncogenic role of reduced, but not absent, levels of p27KIP1 is supported by recent studies in murine models and evidence that this protein not only inhibits the activity of complexes containing CDK2 and cyclin E, but also promotes the assembly and catalytic activity of CDK4 or CDK6 in complexes with cyclin D.","['Komuro, H', 'Valentine, M B', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Saito, M', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Carroll, A J', 'Yi, T', 'Sherr, C J', 'Look, A T']","['Komuro H', 'Valentine MB', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Saito M', 'Raimondi SC', 'Carroll AJ', 'Yi T', 'Sherr CJ', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Experimental Oncology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.neo.7900033 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 1999 Aug;1(3):253-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.neo.7900033.,,"['P01 CA071907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 71907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1508076,,,,,

Marek's disease virus is transmitted horizontally only, and international spread in hatching eggs and day-old chicks can be prevented by appropriate hygiene precautions. Transmission of ALV and REV occurs both horizontally and vertically (through the egg), and measures to prevent international spread are more demanding. Marek's disease is controlled by vaccination, whilst avian leukosis is controlled by virus eradication programmes, mainly at the primary breeding level.

STUDY DESIGN: Aspirates of lymphoproliferative disorders from April 1993 to January 1997 were reviewed. The percentage of TLCs was determined on the Papanicolaou smear. The percentage and intensity of p53 and PCNA immunocytochemical staining was evaluated on cell block sections. These results were compared and correlated with the final diagnoses based on available morphology, flow cytometry and clinical history. RESULTS: There were 40 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 12 reactive lymph nodes. Adequate cell blocks were available on 16 large cell lymphomas, 7 grade 1-2 follicular center cell lymphomas, 6 mucosal associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, 2 small lymphocytic lymphomas and 2 mantle cell lymphomas. Average TLC and p53 nuclear staining was highest in large cell lymphomas (57% TLC and 24% p53), followed by grades 1 and 2 follicular lymphomas (14% TLC and 15% p53) and lowest in other indolent lymphomas (< 10% TLC and < 1% p53). Average PCNA staining was highest in large cell lymphomas (46%) and lowest in small lymphocytic lymphomas (7%); however, TLC was the best parameter for differentiating large cell lymphoma from indolent small B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSION: TLC differentiated large cell lymphoma from indolent small B-cell lymphoma better than either p53 or PCNA alone or in combination. Significant overlap between categories limits usefulness of these immunocytochemical stains for differentiating these entities.","['Young, N A', 'Ehya, H', 'Klein-Szanto, A', 'Litwin, S', 'Smith, M R', 'al-Saleem, T']","['Young NA', 'Ehya H', 'Klein-Szanto A', 'Litwin S', 'Smith MR', 'al-Saleem T']","['Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,"['0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/*analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*analysis']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000328534 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2000 Jul-Aug;44(4):592-603. doi: 10.1159/000328534.,,,,,,,,,,,

Its Drosophila homologue female sterile homeotic is a developmental regulator that interacts genetically with trithorax, a human homologue of which is also associated with leukaemia. The RING3 structure contains two mutually related bromodomains that probably assist in the remodelling of chromatin and thereby affect transcription. Consistent with this hypothesis, a RING3-like protein has been identified in the mouse Mediator complex, where it is associated with transcription factors. We show that, whilst RING3 is constitutively localised to the nucleus of exponentially growing HeLa cells, it is delocalised throughout serum-starved fibroblasts. We use immunostaining and confocal microscopy to demonstrate that RING3 translocates to the fibroblast nucleus upon serum stimulation. After translocation, RING3 participates in nuclear protein complexes that include E2F proteins; it transactivates the promoters of several important mammalian cell cycle genes that are dependent on E2F, including dihydrofolate reductase, cyclin D1, cyclin A and cyclin E. We use site-directed mutagenesis of a putative nuclear localisation motif to show that the activation-induced nuclear localisation and consequent transcriptional activity of RING3 depends on a monopartite, classical nuclear localisation sequence. These observations refine and extend the mechanism by which RING3 contributes to E2F-regulated cell cycle progression. Deregulation of this mechanism may be leukaemogenic.","['Guo, N', 'Faller, D V', 'Denis, G V']","['Guo N', 'Faller DV', 'Denis GV']","['Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Room L910, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Brd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2000 Sep;113 ( Pt 17):3085-91.,,"['R29 CA075107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA75107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC3936601,,,,,['NIHMS556178']

New vectors based upon lentiviruses such as HIV-1 exhibit properties that may circumvent these problems. We report that novel third-generation, self-inactivating lentiviral vectors, expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G), can efficiently transduce primitive human repopulating cells derived from human BM and cord blood (CB) tested by the SCID-repopulating cell (SRC) assay. Highly purified CD34+ CD38- CB or BM cells were efficiently transduced (4-69%) and stably expressed in EGFP for 40 days in culture following infection for only 24 h without fibronectin, polybrene, or cytokines. Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient (NOD/SCID) mice transplanted with transduced cells from either CB or BM donors were well engrafted, demonstrating maintenance of SRC during the infection procedure. Serially obtained femoral BM samples indicated that the proportion of EGFP+ cells within both myeloid and lymphoid lineages was maintained or even increased over time, averaging 42.3 +/- 6.6% for BM donors and 23.3 +/- 7.2% for CB at 12 weeks. Thus, the third-generation lentivectors readily transduce human CB and BM stem cells, under minimal conditions of ex vivo culture, where MoMLV-based vectors are ineffective. Since CB is inappropriate for most therapeutic applications, the efficient maintenance and transduction of BM-derived SRC during the short infection procedure are notable advantages of lentivectors.","['Guenechea, G', 'Gan, O I', 'Inamitsu, T', 'Dorrell, C', 'Pereira, D S', 'Kelly, M', 'Naldini, L', 'Dick, J E']","['Guenechea G', 'Gan OI', 'Inamitsu T', 'Dorrell C', 'Pereira DS', 'Kelly M', 'Naldini L', 'Dick JE']","['Hospital for Sick Children and Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (Cd38 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/immunology', 'Gene Expression', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/metabolism', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*immunology/*therapy', '*Transduction, Genetic']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/mthe.2000.0077 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(00)90077-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2000 Jun;1(6):566-73. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2000.0077.,,,,,,,,,,,

The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) uses an abundant membrane phospholipid as a receptor. We hypothesized that transduction of HSC requires relatively high levels of retrovirus receptor molecules. Because mouse HSC can be efficiently transduced by ecotropic virus through the abundant ecotropic receptor, the mouse is an ideal model to compare receptor levels and transduction. We have developed a cotransduction assay where ecotropic retrovirus transduction is a positive internal control for downstream steps in retrovirus transduction. A comparison of mouse HSC transduction with amphotropic, 10A1, and VSV-G envelopes showed that the level of amphotropic and 10A1 receptor mRNA in HSC correlated with the frequency of transduction. Transduction with VSV-G vectors was similar to that with 10A1 vectors.

Blocking the surface expression of this receptor via an intrakine approach has recently been shown to efficiently prevent HIV-1 infection of T cells. The CXC-chemokine gene is fused to an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (KDEL) that retains the newly synthesized chemokine and its receptor within the cell, where both are subsequently degraded. We constructed MoMuLV-based vectors containing the SDF-KDEL construct driven by the ""MND"" long terminal repeat, using eGFP as a marker gene (MND-SDF-KDEL-IRES-eGFP) and a control vector (MND-X-IRES-eGFP). CEM human T lymphoblastic leukemia cells were transduced with the intrakine vector or the control vector. We detected a marked downregulation of CXCR4 expression in the cells transduced with the intrakine vectors as opposed to the cells transduced with the control vector. However, the eGFP-negative fraction of the cells transduced with the intrakine vector displayed the same CXCR4 downregulation as the eGFP-positive fraction, suggesting an effect in trans. The possibility of this being due to eGFP being silenced while SDF-KDEL was still expressed was excluded by Southern and Northern blot analyses. Upon cultivating the control cells with supernatant of the cells transduced with the intrakine vector, we observed a downregulation of CXCR4 expression on the control cells. Experiments using rhSDF-1alpha showed downregulation by the supernatant to be comparable to that achieved by the exogenous addition of 30 ng/ml SDF-1alpha. To assess the bioactivity of the secreted substance in the supernatant, a chemotaxis assay was performed. The transmigration observed was, once again, within the range of that achieved by the addition of 30 ng/ml SDF-1alpha. We conclude that the intrakine SDF-KDEL, apart from acting within the cell, is also in part secreted and causes the downregulation of the receptor by acting like a secreted chemokine.","['Engel, B C', 'Bauer, G', 'Pepper, K A', 'Bockstoce, D C', 'Yu, X J', 'Chen, S Y', 'Kohn, D B']","['Engel BC', 'Bauer G', 'Pepper KA', 'Bockstoce DC', 'Yu XJ', 'Chen SY', 'Kohn DB']","['Division of Research Immunology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, California 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Chemokines, CXC/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/09 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/09 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/mthe.2000.0026 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(00)90026-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2000 Feb;1(2):165-70. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2000.0026.,,"['A138592/PHS HHS/United States', 'A141959-01/PHS HHS/United States', 'AI36606/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

To enhance vector production, the weak FIV long terminal repeat promoter was replaced with the human cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter. To construct a minimal system in which Gag-Pol was the only viral protein present, the cytoplasmic transport element was used in place of the FIV Rev-RRE system to facilitate nuclear export of Gag-Pol and the transfer vector. Unconcentrated vector titers routinely exceeded 1 x 10(6) IU/mL for most constructs tested. Second- and optimized third-generation vectors were capable of efficiently infecting G1/S- and G2/M-arrested cells. FIV-based FELIX vectors transduced human dendritic cells, hepatocytes, and aortic smooth muscle with efficiencies similar to that of a control 3T3 cell line. All three of these primary cell types were transducible by both the second- and third-generation FELIX vectors, demonstrating that FIV Gag-Pol alone contains the determinants necessary for transduction of primary cells. In cross-packaging tests, we observed that HIV Gag-Pol does not substantially package FIV vectors; consequently, use of such vectors in human immunodeficiency virus-infected cells should not lead to efficient mobilization of the inserted gene. Thus, this FIV-based vector system offers high efficiency and stable delivery of genes to numerous nondividing and primary cell types, opening new avenues for biological inquiry into normal human cells.","['Curran, M A', 'Kaiser, S M', 'Achacoso, P L', 'Nolan, G P']","['Curran MA', 'Kaiser SM', 'Achacoso PL', 'Nolan GP']","['Program in Immunology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305-5332, USA. curran@leland.stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transduction, Genetic']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/mthe.1999.0007 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(99)90007-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2000 Jan;1(1):31-8. doi: 10.1006/mthe.1999.0007.,,"['AI35304/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AR44565/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-AI39646/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

We have determined the structure of the free PBX homeodomain using NMR spectroscopy. Both the PBX homeodomain and the extended PBX homeodomain make identical contacts with a 5'-TGAT-3' DNA site and a YPWM peptide. A fourth alpha-helix, which forms upon binding to DNA, stabilizes the extended PBX structure.

The tumor cells are typically derived from immature T cells. During preleukemic times, a marked decrease in thymic size is apparent in M-MuLV-inoculated mice. We previously demonstrated that this thymic regression is correlated with enhanced levels of thymocyte apoptosis (C. Bonzon and H. Fan, J. Virol. 73:2434-2441, 1999). In this study, we investigated the apoptotic state of M-MuLV-induced tumors. M-MuLV-induced tumors were screened for expression of the apoptotic proteins Fas and Bcl-2 by three-color flow cytometric analysis. Single-positive (SP; CD4(+) CD8(-) and CD4(-) CD8(+)) tumor cells generally displayed lower cell surface expression of Fas than SP thymocytes from uninoculated control mice. Double-positive (DP; CD4(+) CD8(+)) M-MuLV-induced tumor cells fell into two categories: those with normal high levels of Fas and those with low levels of Fas. Additionally, the vast majority of DP tumors showed elevated Bcl-2 levels. The DP tumor cells retaining normal/high Fas expression were capable of transducing an apoptotic signal upon anti-Fas engagement. In addition, DP and CD4(+) SP tumor populations displayed higher levels of Fas ligand than normal thymocytes with the same phenotypes. In contrast, CD8(+) SP and CD4(-) CD8(-) tumors did not show elevated Fas ligand expression. There was no significant correlation between Fas and Fas ligand expression in the DP tumors, suggesting that Fas Ligand expression was not the driving force behind Fas down-regulation. These results suggest that both the Fas death receptor and mitochondrial pathways of apoptotic death are active in M-MuLV-induced tumors and that they must be modulated to permit cell survival and tumor outgrowth.","['Bonzon, C', 'Fan, H']","['Bonzon C', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD8 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.17.8151-8158.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Sep;74(17):8151-8. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.17.8151-8158.2000.,,"['R01 CA032455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA09054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC112349,,,,,

In this report we describe our results which demonstrate that MCF13 MLV infection of thymuses reduced the number of T lymphocytes in this organ. Histological examination showed diffuse lymphocyte depletion, which was most striking in the CD4(+) CD8(+) lymphocyte-enriched cortical zone. Consistent with this, flow cytometric analysis showed that the lymphocytes which were depleted were predominantly the immature CD3(-) CD4(+) CD8(+) and CD3(+) CD4(+) CD8(+) cells. A comparison of the percentages of live, apoptotic, and dead cells of the gp70(+) and gp70(-) thymic lymphocytes suggested that this effect on thymus cellularity is a result of virus infection. Studies of the survival of thymic T lymphocytes in culture showed that cells from MCF13 MLV-inoculated mice underwent greater apoptosis and death than cells from control animals. Assays for apoptosis included 7-amino-actinomycin D staining, DNA fragmentation, and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase proenzymes. Our results suggest that apoptosis of thymic lymphocytes by virus infection is an important step in the early stages of MCF13 MLV tumorigenesis.","['Yoshimura, F K', 'Wang, T', 'Yu, F', 'Kim, H R', 'Turner, J R']","['Yoshimura FK', 'Wang T', 'Yu F', 'Kim HR', 'Turner JR']","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology and the Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA. fyoshi@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology/virology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*immunology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/*virology', 'Thymus Gland/pathology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*pathology/virology']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.17.8119-8126.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Sep;74(17):8119-26. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.17.8119-8126.2000.,,"['R29 CA064139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK02503/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA064139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC112345,,,,,

We have observed median times to engraftment of 26 days or less, shortest times ranging 8 to 13 days, late engraftment or graft failures tending to be associated with age >15 years and infusions of <3.7 x 10(7)/Pf-NCC/kg. These data may be appropriate references to evaluate engraftment of CBT performed with previously ex vivo expanded cells. CBT performed with units of which one aliquot has been previously culture-expanded have resulted in times to engraftment similar to the ones observed in the above-mentioned analysis. In these trials it is not possible to trace the actual origin of the early engrafting cells because the pre-cultured cells lack differentiating markers. To better evaluate the engraftment dynamics of culture-expanded CB cells in humans, we have used a model of simultaneously transplanting cells from two different donors to the same patient. Preliminary results of patients that have simultaneously received one uncultured CB unit and culture-expanded purified CB CD34+ cells obtained from a second one show no significant contribution of cultured cells to early engraftment, and no prohibitive unfavorable immunological problems have been observed.","['Fernandez, M N', 'Granena, A', 'Millan, I', 'Regidor, C', 'Cabrera, R', 'Querol, S', 'Garcia, J']","['Fernandez MN', 'Granena A', 'Millan I', 'Regidor C', 'Cabrera R', 'Querol S', 'Garcia J']","['Clinica Puerta de Hierro, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Donors', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702357 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 May;25 Suppl 2:S61-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702357.,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, donor availability limits its applicability with only approximately one-third of patients having HLA-matched family members. For the remaining two-thirds of patients who need an allogeneic procedure, an alternative donor is required. Matched unrelated donor (MUD) bone marrow transplants have proven useful for many of these patients, however, matched donors may be unavailable or too time-consuming to find. In addition, MUD transplants are associated with high morbidity and mortality secondary to severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), organ toxicity, and infections. For those patients without a matched related or unrelated volunteer donor, unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is a feasible alternative. UCBT has been associated with a lower incidence and severity of GVHD than MUD BMT, allowing successful transplantation in the HLA-mismatched setting, thus increasing the donor pool. This manuscript reviews the available literature regarding these two procedures, assesses their risk/benefit ratio, and arrives at several conclusions regarding their relative indications.","['Mogul, M J']",['Mogul MJ'],"['Clinical Faculty, Pediatric Hematology-Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA Antigens', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",20,2000/08/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702372 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 May;25 Suppl 2:S58-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702372.,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as such tumor- and leukemia-associated self-proteins are also expressed at low levels in some types of normal tissues, such as thymus, spleen and lymphohemopoietic cells, these self-MHC-self-peptide complexes may also represent thymic and/or peripheral tolerogens, thereby preventing immune responses. This is particularly true for class I MHC-peptide complexes expressed by bone marrow-derived cells in the thymus, as such expression would cause negative selection of immature thymic T cells with high avidity for self-MHC-self-peptide complexes. This intrathymic deletion of potentially self-reactive T cells could result in a peripheral T cell repertoire purged of CTL precursors with sufficient avidity to recognize natural tumor associated self-epitopes presented by class I MHC molecules on tumor cells.

Moreover, they may exert potent anti-tumor effects (graft-versus-leukemia, GVL), which are used for adoptive immunotherapy. On the other hand, infusion of allogeneic T cells is frequently associated with the manifestation of immune reactions against healthy tissue, which may lead to life-threatening graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). To overcome this problem, we developed a new strategy for the exclusive depletion of alloreactive cells from donor leukocytes. We activated donor T cells by co-cultivation with a stroma layer of recipient cells and analyzed activation kinetics of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Based on these data, activated cells were then depleted based on expression of activation-induced antigens using magnetic cell sorting (MACS). Alloreactivity of donor T cells was remarkably decreased after depletion of cells expressing either CD25 or CD69, as was shown in suitable in vitro assays. The lowest level of alloreactivity was found when both CD25- and CD69-positive cells were depleted. Importantly, depleted cell fractions preserved reactivity against third-party cells. In summary, we found that MACS-based ex vivo depletion of alloreactive cells may be a suitable way to prevent GVHD and therefore improve allogeneic BMT and adoptive immunotherapy.","['Fehse, B', 'Goldmann, M', 'Frerk, O', 'Bulduk, M', 'Zander, A R']","['Fehse B', 'Goldmann M', 'Frerk O', 'Bulduk M', 'Zander AR']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation/*methods', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702352 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 May;25 Suppl 2:S39-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702352.,,,,,,,,,,,

The rest were either refractory to induction chemotherapy (four patients) or in a more advanced stage of their disease (14 patients). In addition, nine patients with MDS (1M/8F) were treated. Their median age was 41 years (range 21-64). Engraftment to > or =500 neutrophils/microl was reached at 14 days (range 10-29 days) post BMT, and the median time of neutropenia was only 11 days (range 4-28 days). The most common regimen-related toxicity was grade 2-3 nausea. In the post-BMT period (including BMT day +30), two patients died, one each from pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to CMV pneumonia and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), for an early treatment-related mortality (TRM) of 5.7%. Three patients developed VOD and two of them died. There was no direct regimen-related pulmonary or neurologic toxicity. Overall, the clinical side-effect spectrum was analogous to what would be expected from a high-dose oral Bu-based regimen; there was no unique toxicity experienced with the used solvent system. The disease-free survival in the high-risk subgroup (all patients not in CR1) at 1 and 2 years post transplant was 44% and 31%, respectively.

The addition of donor T cells to the TCD allograft will decrease the risk of graft rejection but will increase the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Relapse of leukemia or lymphoma following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can be successfully treated with post-transplant infusions of donor lymphocytes. A relatively small number of donor T cells can have a profound anti-tumor effect and facilitate engraftment, but has an unpredictable potential for severe GVHD. An alternative to using viable immunocompetent donor immune cells to facilitate engraftment and to treat relapsed patients are donor lymphocytes that have been treated to limit their ability to proliferate and cause GVHD. T cells treated with irradiation retain cytotoxic activity against tumor cells and host immune cells. We have tested the hypothesis that allogeneic donor T cells treated with low-dose irradiation will facilitate engraftment and mediate an anti-leukemia effect in a mouse model of bone marrow transplantation. Multiple infusions of irradiated allogeneic donor lymphocytes in the peri-transplant period had graft-enhancing activity without resulting in GVHD. Murine recipients of irradiated allogeneic splenocytes and allogeneic bone marrow had stable donor-derived hematopoiesis without a significant contribution of irradiated donor cells to the T cell compartment. Removing T cells from the allogeneic splenocytes prior to irradiation largely eliminated their graft facilitating activity. Based upon the promising results of the pre-clinical murine studies, we initiated a phase I clinical trial of multiple infusions of irradiated allogeneic lymphocytes in patients who had relapsed after allogeneic BMT. Of 12 patients treated to date on this study, three have shown objective responses of their leukemia or lymphoma to multiple infusions of irradiated donor lymphocytes.

Using standard-dose CsA the risk for acute GVHD seems to be minimized. Add-back of 2 x 10(6)/kg CD3+ cells on day +60 with CsA protection is feasible.

In our report, the immune status of minor antigen mismatched BM chimeras given DLI was studied. Particularly the role of donor ASGM1 positive or T cells in the graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL) was investigated. METHODS: AKR mice (H2k, Mls1a, Thy1.1) received TBI (9,5 Gy) and T cell-depleted (TCD) C3H (H2k, Mls2a, Thy1.2) BM alone (BM chimeras), or TCD BM together with immunocompetent C3H spleen cells at the time of BM transplantation (BM+SP chimeras), or TCD BM and 3 weeks later C3H spleen cells (DLI chimeras). Chimerism and T lymphocyte subsets were scored using FACS and anti-Thy, anti-Vbeta6, anti-IL2-beta receptor, anti-CD4, anti-CD3, and anti-CD8 mAbs. Leukemia challenge consisted of 5 x 10(6) AKR T cell lymphoma (BW4157) cells injected i.v. ASGM1 positive (ASGM1+) cells and T cells were depleted using anti-ASGM1 or anti-Thy1.2 antibodies, respectively. Immune tolerance was studied using MLR and CML tests. RESULTS: BM + SP chimeras developed acute and lethal GVHD, whereas DLI chimeras were totally free from GVHD. In DLI chimeras, host-reactive cytotoxic T cells (CTL) could not be induced and host-reactive CD8Vbeta6 cells were deleted whereas CD4Vbeta6 cells and MLR reactivity persisted temporarily. In contrast, in BM+SP chimeras, anti-host CTL were easily generated and an expansion of both host-reactive CD8Vbeta6 and CD4Vbeta6 T cells was found as well as high anti-host MLR reactivity. Depletion of either ASGM1 + cells or T cells from the DLI inoculum resulted in an abrogation of GVL reactivity, suggesting that both cell populations were involved in the protection against BW4157 leukemia. Three weeks after DLI, the GVL effect waned which correlated with the disappearance of host-reactive CD4 cells and MLR reactivity. CONCLUSION: In minor antigen mismatched BM chimeras, anti-host reactivity after DLI is characterized by (1) an absence of clinical GVHD, (2) clonal deletion of host-reactive CD8 cells, (3) an absence of anti-host CTL induction, and ( 4) a temporary persistence of host-reactive CD4 T cells and of MLR reactivity. In addition, either donor ASGM1+ cells or an interaction between these cells and T cells contribute to the GVL effect.","['Sefrioui, H', 'Billiau, A D', 'Waer, M']","['Sefrioui H', 'Billiau AD', 'Waer M']","['Laboratory of Experimental Transplantation, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antigens)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '71012-19-6 (asialo GM1 ganglioside)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Chimera/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/analysis', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/physiology', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Time Factors']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-200007270-00020 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2000 Jul 27;70(2):348-53. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200007270-00020.,,,,,,,,,,,

The p16INK4a tumor suppressor gene has been shown to be frequently deleted in human T-ALL cases. Deletion of p16INK4a may be associated with poor prognosis and relapse of the disease. Radiation-induced murine T-ALL in C57B1/6 mice shares pathogenetic and molecular characteristics with the human disease. We used the murine disease as a model to study the status of the INK4/ARF gene locus and to examine the effect of p16INK4a-re-expression in T-ALL cells on their leukemic potential in vivo. In 9 of 17 radiation-induced murine T-ALL cell lines, the p16INK4a protein was not expressed as determined by immunoblotting. Southern blot analysis revealed homozygous deletions of the p16INK4a gene locus in three of the nine lines, along with the genes encoding p15INK4b and p19ARF. Transduction of p16INK4a-negative T-ALL lines with retrovirus encoding p16INK4a significantly inhibited their in vitro proliferation by inducing G1-arrest. Importantly, re-expression of p16INK4a in p16INK4a-negative T-ALL cells obliterated the induction of lethal disseminated leukemia in syngeneic mice.

Recombination between two copackaged retroviral genomes may occur at rates as high as 40% per replication cycle. This enables genetic information to be shuffled rapidly, leading to recombinants with new patterns of mutations and phenotypes. The in vitro process of DNA shuffling (molecular breeding) mimics this mechanism on a vastly parallel and accelerated scale. Multiple homologous parental sequences are recombined in parallel, leading to a diverse library of complex recombinants from which desired improvements can be selected. Different proteins and enzymes have been improved using DNA shuffling. We report here the first application of molecular breeding to viruses. A single round of shuffling envelope sequences from six murine leukaemia viruses (MLV) followed by selection yielded a chimaeric clone with a completely new tropism for Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHOK1) cells. The composition and properties of the selected clone indicated that this particular permutation of parental sequences cannot be readily attained by natural retroviral recombination. This example demonstrates that molecular breeding can enhance the inherently high evolutionary potential of retroviruses to obtain desired phenotypes. It can be an effective tool, when information is limited, to optimize viruses for gene therapy and vaccine applications when multiple complex functions must be simultaneously balanced.","['Soong, N W', 'Nomura, L', 'Pekrun, K', 'Reed, M', 'Sheppard, L', 'Dawes, G', 'Stemmer, W P']","['Soong NW', 'Nomura L', 'Pekrun K', 'Reed M', 'Sheppard L', 'Dawes G', 'Stemmer WP']","['Maxygen Inc., Redwood City, California, USA. naywei_soong@maxygen.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Gene Products, env)']",IM,['Nat Genet. 2000 Aug;25(4):366-7.

Diseases such as vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency, or cytotoxic therapy leading to a marrow dysplasia should be ruled out. Five subtypes are described in the FAB classification : refractory anaemia or refractory cytopenia, refractory sideroblastic anaemia, refractory anaemia with excess of blasts, refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in transformation, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. This FAB classification is based on a small number of parameters: percentage of blood and marrow blasts, percentage of ringed sideroblasts and blood monocytes. The anaemia is typically normo- or macrocytic, non regenerative, and in half cases is associated with neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia. During blood film examination, cell abnormalities have to be notified, i.e. anisocytosis, poikilocytosis of red cells, morphological abnormalities of neutrophils including hypogranulation, hypolobulation, abnormal large platelets. The prognostic and the treatment of MDS depend on the subtype of the FAB classification, the patient's age, the percentage of marrow blasts, the importance of cytopenia, the presence or not of cytogenetic abnormalities and the existence or not of HLA-identical donor.","['Garandeau, C', 'Pautas, E', 'Andreux, M', 'Andreux, J', 'Gaussem, P', 'Siguret, V']","['Garandeau C', 'Pautas E', 'Andreux M', 'Andreux J', 'Gaussem P', 'Siguret V']","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Groupe hospitalier Charles-Foix-Jean Rostand, 7, avenue de la Republique, 94205 Ivry-sur-Seine Cedex.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),Annales de biologie clinique,2984690R,,IM,,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/diagnosis/*physiopathology']",37,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Biol Clin (Paris). 2000 Jul-Aug;58(4):405-16.,,,Les syndromes myelodysplasiques.,,,,,,,,

In Moloney murine leukemia virus, three stem-loops are important in this process. One is a self-complementary tetraloop (H1), but the other two stem-loops (H2, H3) contain highly conserved GACG tetraloops that are not self-complementary sequences. Using two-dimensional NMR, we determined the structure of the H3 stem-loop. Surprisingly, it forms a stable, homodimeric kissing complex through only two intermolecular G small middle dotC base pairs. Cross-strand interactions of the adenines adjacent to the intermolecular G small middle dotC base pairs, plus unusual strong electrostatic interactions around the base pairs, contribute to the unexpected stability. This structure shows how even stem-loops without self-complementary sequences can facilitate the intermolecular recognition between two identical RNAs, and thus initiate dimerization and encapsidation of retroviral RNAs.","['Kim, C H', 'Tinoco, I Jr']","['Kim CH', 'Tinoco I Jr']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, and Physical Biosciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley 94720-1460, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,,"['Adenine/metabolism', 'Base Pairing/*genetics/radiation effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytosine/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Guanine/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation/radiation effects', 'RNA Stability/radiation effects', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Static Electricity', 'Temperature', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.170283697 [doi]', '170283697 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Aug 15;97(17):9396-401. doi: 10.1073/pnas.170283697.,['PDB/1F5U'],"['R01 GM010840/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM010840/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 10840/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC16875,,,,,

The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) activates a genetic program of gene expression in these cells leading to their differentiation into megakaryoblasts, a platelet precursor. Thus, K562 cells offer a means to examine early changes in gene expression necessary for megakaryoblastic commitment and differentiation. An essential requirement for differentiation of many hematopoietic cell types is the down-regulation of c-myc expression, because its constitutive expression blocks differentiation. TPA-induced differentiation of K562 cells causes rapid down-regulation of c-myc expression, due in part to an mRNA decay rate that is 4-fold faster compared with dividing cells. A cell-free mRNA decay system reconstitutes TPA-induced destabilization of c-myc mRNA, but it requires at least two components for reconstitution. One component fractionates to the post-ribosomal supernatant from either untreated or treated cells. This component is sensitive to cycloheximide and micrococcal nuclease. The other component is polysome-associated and is induced or activated by TPA. Although in dividing cells c-myc mRNA decays via a sequential pathway involving removal of the poly(A) tract followed by degradation of the mRNA body, TPA activates a deadenylation-independent pathway. The cell-free mRNA decay system reconstitutes this alternate decay pathway as well.","['Brewer, G']",['Brewer G'],"['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA. brewerga@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M006145200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)89017-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Oct 27;275(43):33336-45. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M006145200.,,['CA52243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Tax is known to suppress cellular nucleotide excision repair (NER), and this activity has been proposed to play an important role in Tax transformation. In this study we have investigated the mechanism by which Tax suppresses NER with specific focus on the previously characterized ability of Tax to inhibit p53 function. Suppression of NER by Tax was rescued by overexpression of wild-type p53; however, a p53 transactivation-incompetent mutant did not restore NER activity. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a major transcriptional target of p53, plays an important role in regulating DNA replication and repair. Overexpression of p21 reversed Tax-induced suppression of NER; however, a p21 C-terminal mutant that lacks the proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding domain did not restore NER activity. Thus, p53 and its downstream effector p21 can inhibit Tax-mediated suppression of DNA repair. These results imply that the inactivation of p53 function by Tax contributes to Tax suppression of DNA repair.","['Kao, S Y', 'Lemoine, F J', 'Marriott, S J']","['Kao SY', 'Lemoine FJ', 'Marriott SJ']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology and Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M004397200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)88692-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Nov 17;275(46):35926-31. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M004397200.,,"['CA-09197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-77371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

According to our simple model, the probability of such an occurrence, due to chance alone, is less than 1 per cent. However, if we divide the child population of the U.S.A. into 200 regions (each region having 200 000 children) then the probability that at least one region will see, in a given year, 12 or more cases is higher than 80 per cent. So in this sense the Columbus cluster could be attributed to chance alone. However, the probability that any of the 200 regions see 18 cases or more in a given year is almost 0. Thus, a cluster of 18 or more cases in a region of 200 000 children should be regarded as highly suspicious and should be investigated.","['Schinazi, R B']",['Schinazi RB'],"['Department of Mathematics, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO 80933-7150, USA. schinazi@math.uccs.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Binomial Distribution', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Ohio/epidemiology', 'Poisson Distribution', '*Probability', 'Time Factors']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0258(20000830)19:16<2195::AID-SIM522>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0258(20000830)19:16<2195::aid-sim522>3.0.co;2-z [doi]']",ppublish,Stat Med. 2000 Aug 30;19(16):2195-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0258(20000830)19:16<2195::aid-sim522>3.0.co;2-z.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,

Their clinical features are distinct from patients with BCR/ABL positive CML, although to the authors' knowledge the pathogenesis to date has been unknown. METHODS: A 50-year-old female patient with BCR/ABL negative CML and multiple complications of Graves disease, Sweet syndrome, and a fatal pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is described in the current study. To show a clonal origin of her myeloid cells, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) assay was applied. Because the patient developed a progressive and fatal neutrophilia, a screening of cell functions in neutrophilic lineage, including in vitro colony assay of her bone marrow cells and production of superoxide and interleukin-8 (IL-8) by blood neutrophils was performed. RESULTS: Southern blot analysis based on the polymorphism of the HPRT gene was compatible with monoclonality of her neutrophils. The patient had an increased amount of bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells, which formed colonies in response to a very low dose (0.1 ng/mL) of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. In vitro production of superoxide and IL-8, which is an inducer of positive chemotaxis of neutrophils, by her peripheral neutrophils was markedly augmented. Her bronchoalveolar lavage fluid also contained a significant amount of IL-8 as well as an unusual infiltration of neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: In the patient in the current study, hyperfunction of the neutrophils might have contributed to the onset of PAP as well as Sweet syndrome and to the pathogenesis of BCR/ABL negative CML.","['Watari, K', 'Tojo, A', 'Nagamura-Inoue, T', 'Matsuoka, M', 'Irie, S', 'Tani, K', 'Yamada, Y', 'Asano, S']","['Watari K', 'Tojo A', 'Nagamura-Inoue T', 'Matsuoka M', 'Irie S', 'Tani K', 'Yamada Y', 'Asano S']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Interleukin-8)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Graves Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/genetics/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis/complications', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Sweet Syndrome/complications']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(20000801)89:3<551::AID-CNCR10>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Aug 1;89(3):551-60.,,,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,

A wide variety of pro-inflammatory insults to the brain, including viral infection, result in upregulation of these molecules on brain endothelial cells, astrocytes, and microglia. This study investigated the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in chronic encephalitis induced by infection with a temperature sensitive (ts-1) strain of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MoMuLV), an ecotropic murine retrovirus. During the late stages of disease, viral antigen was present in both endothelial cells and microglia, but not astrocytes, in regions of spongiform change and gliosis. In these areas, ICAM-1 staining was detected on activated microglia, but not on endothelial cells or astrocytes. In contrast, no cells showed increased VCAM-1 expression in the CNS. These findings demonstrate that there is cell-specific, differential expression of these adhesion molecules in ts-1 retroviral encephalitis. The lack of endothelial cell expression correlates with the characteristic lack of lymphocytic infiltrate in this chronic retroviral encephalitis and suggests that increased microglial ICAM-1 expression may play a role in the pathogenesis of MoMuLV (ts-1)-mediated neurodegeneration.","['Dallasta, L M', 'Wang, G', 'Bodnar, R J', 'Draviam, R', 'Wiley, C A', 'Achim, C L', 'Hamilton, R L']","['Dallasta LM', 'Wang G', 'Bodnar RJ', 'Draviam R', 'Wiley CA', 'Achim CL', 'Hamilton RL']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Neuropathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,7609829,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (monocyte-macrophage differentiation antigen)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'X8ZC7V0OX3 (Tyramine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Brain Stem/metabolism/virology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Encephalitis, Viral/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/biosynthesis', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Tyramine/analogs & derivatives', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*biosynthesis']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['nan249 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2990.2000.00249.x [doi]']",ppublish,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol. 2000 Aug;26(4):332-41. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2990.2000.00249.x.,,"['NS 33429/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 35419/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

There were 11 male and 10 female patients with a median age of 47.4 years (range 1.0-62.9). Patients were conditioned either with total body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy, with or without antithymocyte globulin (n = 19), or with chemotherapy alone (n = 2). The marrow donor was an HLA-identical sibling in 12 patients, an HLA-non-identical related donor in three patients and an unrelated volunteer donor in six patients. All evaluable patients achieved sustained engraftment. Fifteen patients developed grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Nine patients (43.0%) are surviving disease free at 0.7-8.1 years (median 6.9) after transplantation. Five patients relapsed 75-660 d after transplant and all died. Five patients died with organ failure and two died with GVHD and associated infections. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of disease-free survival and relapse at 3 years were 39% and 25% respectively. The probability of survival was improved in patients with shorter disease duration compared with those with a long interval from diagnosis to BMT. Thus, as with other myeloproliferative diseases or myelodysplastic syndromes, BMT offers curative therapy for a proportion of patients with CMML. We suggest that patients with CMML who have a suitable donor should be considered for transplantation, probably early in their disease course. However, it will be important to develop new regimens with enhanced antileukaemic efficacy without further increasing regimen-related toxicity and mortality.","['Zang, D Y', 'Deeg, H J', 'Gooley, T', 'Anderson, J E', 'Anasetti, C', 'Sanders, J', 'Myerson, D', 'Storb, R', 'Appelbaum, F']","['Zang DY', 'Deeg HJ', 'Gooley T', 'Anderson JE', 'Anasetti C', 'Sanders J', 'Myerson D', 'Storb R', 'Appelbaum F']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington School of Medicine, Departments of Medicine, Paediatrics and Pathology, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2133 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02133.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Jul;110(1):217-22. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02133.x.,,"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have examined the cytotoxic effects of the purine analogue 2'-deoxycoformycin (dCF) on cultured mononuclear cells and purified gammadelta+ tumour cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood of four patients with hepatosplenic gammadelta+ T-cell lymphoma. At a concentration of 10 microM, dCF, in the presence of 2'-deoxyadenosine (dAdo), displayed an early and selective cytotoxic effect on gammadelta+ tumour T cells. After 48 h of in vitro exposure to dCF, the absolute number of viable CD3+/gammadelta+ tumour T cells was reduced by more than 90% in all samples with respect to control cultures, with absolute counts of viable CD3+/alphabeta+ lymphocytes being reduced only by 6-40% of the initial cell input. Analysis of cultures after 5 d of exposure to dCF plus dAdo revealed the persistence of normal CD3+/alphabeta+ T cells, which accounted, however, for only 20-25% of the initial cell input. Accordingly, the combination of dCF (10-100 microM) plus dAdo was able to induce a dose-dependent inhibition of clonogenic growth and [3H]-thymidine incorporation in purified CD3+/CD4-/CD8- gammadelta+ tumour cells. We also report that one patient with hepatosplenic gammadelta+ T-cell lymphoma in terminal leukaemic phase showed a striking haematological response to single-agent dCF given as fourth-line treatment. In particular, the selective clearance of gammadelta+ tumour T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow was observed starting after the second course of treatment.

The study revealed p53 deletion and accumulation of p53 protein in the absence of mutation in the exons that included the hot-spots and differs from that described in B-prolymphocytic leukaemia. Seven T-PLL and five Sezary syndrome patients had p53 overexpression, and five T-PLL and nine Sezary syndrome patients showed p53 deletion. Although the majority of cases with p53 accumulation had p53 deletion, the proportion of cells with the deletion did not correlate with the proportion of cells positive for p53 expression. Two cases of T-PLL showed strong p53 expression in the absence of p53 deletion, and one case of Sezary syndrome with p53 deletion in 97% of cells did not express p53. These findings suggest that a non-mutational mechanism exists for the accumulation of p53 protein in these T-cell disorders. The oncogenic effect of the accumulating wild-type protein has been reported in other malignancies. Whether haploidy resulting from p53 deletion contributes to this mechanism has yet to be determined. Alternatively, the frequent loss of the p53 gene could be associated with the deletion of an adjacent gene, which could be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases.","['Brito-Babapulle, V', 'Hamoudi, R', 'Matutes, E', 'Watson, S', 'Kaczmarek, P', 'Maljaie, H', 'Catovsky, D']","['Brito-Babapulle V', 'Hamoudi R', 'Matutes E', 'Watson S', 'Kaczmarek P', 'Maljaie H', 'Catovsky D']","['Department of Academic Haematology/Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Trust and Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. vasantha@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Sezary Syndrome/*genetics/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/metabolism']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2174 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02174.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Jul;110(1):180-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02174.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of key enzymes of AraC metabolism-deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), cytidine deaminase (DCD) and polymerase alpha (PolyA) were determined in blast cells from 33 patients. In addition, formation and retention of intracellular levels of AraC triphosphate (AraCTP) and DNA incorporation of AraC were measured, as was the proliferative activity of leukaemic blasts by [3H]-TdR incorporation before and after stimulation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) for 48 h. AraC incorporation into the DNA (median 0.60 pmol/105 cells) was significantly related to the proliferative activity of AML blasts (r = 0.74, P < 0.001). Similarly, priming with GM-CSF or G-CSF increased both the proliferative activity of AML blasts by a median of 1.84- and 1.64-fold, respectively, and the incorporation of AraC into the DNA (1.29- and 1.40-fold respectively). In contrast, no relationship was found between the endogenous proliferative activity (EPA) and enzyme activities regulating AraC activation (DCK; median 4.70 pmol/min/mg protein), inactivation (DCD; median 2.92 pmol/min/mg protein) or inhibitory effects (PolyA; median 1.50 pmol/min/mg protein), nor the formation or retention of AraCTP (median 306.1 ng/107 cell and 1.6 h respectively). When samples were grouped according to EPA (more than or less than the median), slowly proliferating specimens had a higher response to cytokine priming for proliferative activity and incorporation of AraC into DNA.

The enzyme activity was not correlated with the CTP synthetase mRNA expression. The activity of CTP synthetase in ALL cells compared with non-malignant CD34+ bone marrow controls (5.6 +/- 2.4 nmol CTP/mg/h) was not statistically different. In vitro treatment of ALL cells with CPEC induced a dose-dependent decrease of the CTP concentration. The lowest concentration of CPEC (0.63 microM) induced a depletion of CTP of 41 +/- 20% and a depletion of dCTP of 27 +/- 21%. The degree of CTP depletion of ALL cells after treatment with CPEC was positively correlated with the activity of CTP synthetase. The inhibition of CTP synthetase in situ was confirmed by flux studies using radiolabelled uridine. From these results, it can be expected that CPEC has a cytostatic effect on lymphoblasts of children with ALL.","['Verschuur, A C', 'Van Gennip, A H', 'Leen, R', 'Meinsma, R', 'Voute, P A', 'van Kuilenburg, A B']","['Verschuur AC', 'Van Gennip AH', 'Leen R', 'Meinsma R', 'Voute PA', 'van Kuilenburg AB']","['Laboratory of Genetic Metabolic Diseases, Divisions of Clinical Chemistry and Paediatrics, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. a.c.verschuur@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '69MO0NDN8K (cyclopentenyl cytosine)', 'EC 6.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.4.2 (CTP synthetase)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Ribonucleotides/analysis', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2136 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02136.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Jul;110(1):161-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02136.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the clinical significance of apoptosis-regulating factors in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), we investigated cell samples of children with ALL who had been included in the German ALL Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) study using flow cytometry for constitutive expression levels of CD95 (n = 110) and Bcl-2 (n = 110). Furthermore, we determined the extent of spontaneous apoptosis in vitro (n = 102) and susceptibility to anti-CD95-induced apoptosis (CD95-sensitivity) (n = 97). We correlated these findings with the functional activity of the multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as detected by the rhodamine123 efflux test, immunophenotype, cytogenetics and clinical data of the patients examined. Good responders to initial prednisone therapy ('prednisone response') revealed significantly higher Bcl-2 expression levels [5.4 +/- 3.4 relative fluorescence intensity (RFI), n = 68] than poor responders (3.7 +/- 2.6 RFI, n = 42; P = 0.002). There was no significant correlation between the other investigated parameters and prednisone response. Moreover, neither the CD95 and Bcl-2 expression levels nor the extent of spontaneous apoptosis in vitro, CD95 sensitivity or P-gp function were correlated with the response to induction chemotherapy or relapse rate, either for B-cell precursor ALL or T-cell ALL. No consistent pattern of change in CD95 (n = 10) and Bcl-2 expression (n = 9) was noted in cases studied at both initial diagnosis and relapse. In conclusion, our findings underline the different cell biological features of primary AML and ALL cells.","['Wuchter, C', 'Karawajew, L', 'Ruppert, V', 'Schrappe, M', 'Harbott, J', 'Ratei, R', 'Dorken, B', 'Ludwig, W D']","['Wuchter C', 'Karawajew L', 'Ruppert V', 'Schrappe M', 'Harbott J', 'Ratei R', 'Dorken B', 'Ludwig WD']","['Department of Haematology, Oncology and Tumour Immunology, Robert-Rossle-Clinic, Charite, Humboldt-University of Berlin, Germany. wuchter@rrk-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology', 'Child', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'fas Receptor/*analysis']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2147 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02147.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Jul;110(1):154-60. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02147.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

The study cohort included all cases of cytogenetically abnormal childhood ALL diagnosed between 1986 and 1997 in the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). The probability of event-free survival (pEFS) for the total cohort was 0. 72 +/- 0.02. When comparing the two treatment periods of July 1986 to December 1991 and January 1992 to December 1997, a better survival was seen for the latter time period (pEFS of 0.69 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.76 +/- 0.02, P = 0.05). Hypodiploidy with less than 45 chromosomes, t(9;22)(q34;q11) and 11q23 translocations were associated with a dismal outcome during the whole study period (pEFS of 0.57 +/- 0.12, 0.41 +/- 0.14 and 0.37 +/- 0.10 respectively). The poor prognostic influence of 11q23 rearrangements seemed to be restricted to infants and older children (> 10 years), who differed significantly from children aged 1-10 years in this regard (P < 0. 01). Patients with t(9;22)-positive ALL seemed to benefit from allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in first remission (P = 0.05). The pEFS for children with t(1;19)(q23;p13)-positive ALL was intermediate (0.63 +/- 0.17), with a tendency to a better outcome for patients with the unbalanced variant der(19)t(1;19). Hyperdiploid ALL patients, subdivided into moderate hyperdiploidy (47-51 chromosomes), massive hyperdiploidy (52-60 chromosomes) and cases in the tri-/tetraploid range (> 60 chromosomes) had the best outcome in the last treatment period (pEFS of 0.81 +/- 0.06, 0.80 +/- 0.04 and 0.88 +/- 0.07 respectively), unless t(1;19), t(8;14), t(9;22) or 11q23 translocations were present.

Additionally, 60 BM follow-up samples from six patients were subjected to clonality assessment via heteroduplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of immunoglobulin VH-JH gene rearrangements. We observed substantial expansions of normal precursor B cells in regenerating BM not only after maintenance therapy but also during treatment. At the end of the 2-week intervals after consolidation and reinduction treatment, B-cell-lineage regeneration was observed in BM with a large fraction of immature CD34+/TdT+ B cells. In contrast, in regenerating BM after cessation of maintenance treatment, the more mature CD19+/CD10+ B cells were significantly increased, but the fraction of immature CD34+/TdT+ B cells was essentially smaller. Blood samples showed a profound B-cell lymphopenia during treatment followed by a rapid normalization of blood B cells after treatment, with a substantial CD10+ fraction (10-30%). Heteroduplex PCR analysis confirmed the polyclonal origin of the expanded precursor B cells in regenerating BM.

In this study, the effects of CHS 828 and a series of analogues on extracellular acidification and cytotoxicity were compared with those of m-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in human tumor cells. The extracellular acidification rate was measured using the Cytosensor microphysiometer, and determination of cytotoxicity and proliferation was [(14)C] performed by the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) and measurement of [(14)C]thymidine and leucine uptake. CHS 828 significantly increased the acidification rate during the first 15-24 hr in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was abolished by removal of glucose from the medium, substituted with 10 mM of pyruvate, indicating stimulated glycolysis as the source of the increased acidification rate. However, CHS 828 induced cytotoxicity at concentrations well below those that affected the rate of acidification; when a series of closely related pyridylguanidine analogues were tested and compared, no apparent relationship between cytotoxicity and acidification could be discerned. Furthermore, comparable increases in the acidification rate were evident in one subline with high-grade resistance to the cytotoxic actions of CHS 828. The results indicate that CHS 828 may share the inhibitory actions of MIBG on mitochondrial respiration with a subsequent increase in glycolysis and acidification rate. However, this mechanism of action appears neither necessary nor sufficient to fully explain the cytotoxic actions of CHS 828 in human tumor cells, actions which remain to be mechanistically clarified.","['Ekelund, S', 'Liminga, G', 'Bjorkling, F', 'Ottosen, E', 'Schou, C', 'Binderup, L', 'Larsson, R']","['Ekelund S', 'Liminga G', 'Bjorkling F', 'Ottosen E', 'Schou C', 'Binderup L', 'Larsson R']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Akademiska Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.

We have investigated the effects of the proteasome inhibitors carbobenzoxyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-leucinal (MG132) and N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal (LLnL) on apoptosis and NF-kappaB activation induced by etoposide, using a human leukemia cell line (U937) and leukemia blasts freshly isolated from patients with acute leukemia. Pretreatment of U937 cells with MG132 or LLnL inhibited etoposide-induced morphological apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, MG132 or LLnL prevented NF-kappaB activation and IkappaBalpha degradation, but not IkappaBalpha phosphorylation at Ser32. Other inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation, including pyrrrolidine dithiocarbamate (an antioxidant) and the peptide SN50 (an inhibitor of translocation of activated NF-kappaB into the nucleus), also attenuated etoposide-induced apoptosis. In leukemia blasts, although proteasome inhibitors suppressed NF-kappaB activation induced by etoposide, they were unable to prevent morphological apoptosis. Moreover, proteasome inhibitors by themselves caused apoptosis in leukemia blasts at the concentrations employed in this study. These results suggest that the role that NF-kappaB plays in apoptosis induced by etoposide in a human leukemia cell line may be different from the role it plays in freshly isolated leukemia blasts.","['Watanabe, K', 'Kubota, M', 'Hamahata, K', 'Lin, Y', 'Usami, I']","['Watanabe K', 'Kubota M', 'Hamahata K', 'Lin Y', 'Usami I']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '110044-82-1 (acetylleucyl-leucyl-norleucinal)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Leupeptins/*pharmacology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295200003877 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00387-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Sep 15;60(6):823-30. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00387-7.,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine whether DACA or TAS-103 stabilise topo I, topo IIalpha, and topo IIbeta cleavable complexes in human leukaemia CCRF-CEM cells, the TARDIS assay (trapped in agarose DNA immunostaining) was used. This assay can reveal drug-stabilised topo-DNA complexes formed in situ in individual cells. The results showed that both DACA and TAS-103 can stabilise topo IIalpha cleavable complexes in these cells. Topo IIbeta cleavable complexes were also formed, but only at high concentrations of DACA and TAS-103. The effect on topo I was less clear, with TAS-103 showing only low levels of cleavable complex formation and DACA having no detectable effect under these assay conditions. This is in contrast to the purified enzyme cleavable complex assay, where both DACA and TAS-103 poisoned topo I. Although both DACA and TAS-103 show a preference for topo IIalpha in whole cells using the TARDIS assay, the formation of low levels of topo I or topo IIbeta cleavable complexes may still play a role in cell death.","['Padget, K', 'Stewart, A', 'Charlton, P', 'Tilby, M J', 'Austin, C A']","['Padget K', 'Stewart A', 'Charlton P', 'Tilby MJ', 'Austin CA']","['School of Biochemistry and Genetics, The Medical School, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DACA, acridine)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Indenes)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'YVC96489QV', '(6-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)amino)-3-hydroxy-7H-indeno(2,1-c)quinolin-7-one)']",IM,,"['Acridines/*pharmacology', 'Aminoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Indenes/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(00)00402-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00402-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Sep 15;60(6):817-21. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00402-0.,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous studies have demonstrated that arsenic induces apoptosis in various cell types. In the present study, we showed that approximately 35% of arsenite-treated HeLa S3 cells arrested in mitosis. After release from arsenite treatment, more than 80% of arsenite-arrested mitotic cells subsequently underwent apoptosis, as indicated by anachronistic nuclear envelope reformation, DNA ladder occurrence, chromatin condensation, and activation of caspases 3 and 9. In exploring how these cells entered apoptosis mechanistically, we found an inverse correlation between mitotic indexes and apoptotic frequencies. As shown by using Percoll density gradient fractionation and flow cytometric analysis, the mitosis-mediated apoptosis induced by arsenite was accompanied by delayed cyclin B degradation and altered mitotic exit. Furthermore, treatment of arsenite-arrested mitotic cells with staurosporine or 2-aminopurine resulted in a rapid degradation of cyclin B, moved these cells forward to interphase without cell division, and abrogated apoptosis. These results suggest that apoptosis occurs in arsenite-arrested mitotic cells that exit mitosis abnormally.","['Huang, S', 'Huang, C F', 'Lee, T']","['Huang S', 'Huang CF', 'Lee T']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Sodium Compounds/*pharmacology']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['S000629520000397X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00397-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Sep 15;60(6):771-80. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00397-x.,,,,,,,,,,,

Such properties may be due to their association with membrane microdomains composed of glycosphingolipids, cholesterol and some signaling proteins. In this study, we hypothesize that GPI proteins may be required for crosslinking-mediated endocytosis of extracellular bioconjugates. To test this hypothesis, we first biotinylated the surface membranes of native K562 erythroleukemia cells versus K562 cells incapable of surface GPI protein expression. We then compared the entry of fluorescently labeled avidin or DNA condensed on polyethylenimine-avidin bioconjugates into the two biotinylated cell populations. Using fluorescence microscopy, nearly 100% efficiency of fluorescent avidin endocytosis was demonstrated in both cell types over a 24 h period. Surprisingly, plasmid DNA transfer was slightly more efficient among the biotinylated GPI-negative cells as measured by the expression of green fluorescence protein. Our findings that GPI proteins are not required for the endocytosis of avidin bioconjugates into biotinylated cells suggest that endocytosis associated with general membrane crosslinking may be due to overall reorganization of the membrane domains rather than GPI protein-specific interactions.","['Wojda, U', 'Miller, J L']","['Wojda U', 'Miller JL']","['Laboratory of Chemical Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '1405-69-2 (Avidin)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,,"['Avidin/chemistry/genetics', 'Biotin/chemistry', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Endocytosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/biosynthesis/*chemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Polyethyleneimine/chemistry', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0005-2736(00)00213-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0005-2736(00)00213-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000 Jul 31;1467(1):144-52. doi: 10.1016/s0005-2736(00)00213-3.,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantification by ELISA revealed a constitutive production in the cell lines HL-60, ML-2, MONO-MAC-6 and MUTZ-3 ranging between 1500 and ca. 5000 pg/ml IL-8 per million cells. No measurable IL-8 was detected in the culture medium of MONO-MAC-1 and THP-1. Stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) significantly increased the IL-8 level secreted by all cell lines; the best producers were TPA-treated MONO-MAC-6 and MUTZ-3 cultures, generating more than 50 000 pg/ml IL-8. Also the calcium ionophore A-23187, IL-13, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) strongly enhanced the IL-8 production in MONO-MAC-6 cells. The glucocorticoid dexamethasone and the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine distinctively inhibited the IL-8 production of MONO-MAC-6 cells. Thus, our results demonstrate a strong constitutive IL-8 secretion in human myelomonocytic leukaemia cell lines; the variety of different modulators affecting IL-8 production leads to the suggestion of a multiple regulation of IL-8 expression and secretion.","['Steube, K G', 'Meyer, C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Steube KG', 'Meyer C', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. kst@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/cyto.2000.0702 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(00)90702-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2000 Aug;12(8):1236-9. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2000.0702.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

RESULTS: We found that phosphorothioate oligonucleotides have a high affinity for iron as well as several other clinically relevant toxic metals. Analysis of patient urine following administration of OL(1)p53 reveals a 7.5-fold increase in iron excretion at low doses (0.05 mg/kg/h). CONCLUSIONS: Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may have therapeutic potential as heavy metal chelators. Low doses of phosphorothioate oligonucleotide facilitated the excretion of iron.

Red blood cells (RBC) from the same patient samples were also analyzed. METHODS: Blasts were isolated by standard density centrifugation. RBC were prepared from the pellet of the same centrifugation. MTX-Glu(n) were analyzed by means of HPLC and radiochemical quantification. RESULTS: In lymphoblasts isolated from blood, the distribution patterns of MTX-Glu(n) were the same as in bone marrow lymphoblasts, but the total amount of MTX-Glu(n) accumulated in blood lymphoblasts was reduced by 41% 51% when compared to the same number of bone marrow lymphoblasts of the same patient. RBC accumulated MTX but no formation of MTX-Glu(n) occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The determination of MTX and MTX-Glu(n) in lymphoblasts isolated from blood samples of patients with common ALL provides qualitative information on the capacity of the blasts to form MTX-Glu(n) since distribution patterns of MTX and MTX-Glu(n) parallel that of bone marrow lymphoblasts. The amounts of MTX-Glu(n) accumulated, however, were much lower in blood lymphoblasts. Blood lymphoblasts are therefore not useful for a quantitative analysis of MTX-Glu(n). The contribution of RBC to MTX and MTX-Glu(n) in vitro is only marginal and residual RBC in lymphoblast preparations from bone marrow can therefore be ignored.","['Weigand, M', 'Frei, E', 'Graf, N', 'Wiessler, M']","['Weigand M', 'Frei E', 'Graf N', 'Wiessler M']","['German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. m.weigand@dkfz-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2000/08/10 11:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['2000/08/10 11:00'],"['2000/08/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/08/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/pl00008489 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2000 Jul;126(7):407-11. doi: 10.1007/pl00008489.,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear whether these enzymes are required for the induction of such killing, or whether they simply determine the mode of cell death. To address this question, we examined the effect of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk on six different manifestations of nucleoside cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that while caspase activity is required for nucleoside-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and DNA fragmentation, other manifestations of cell death (mitochondrial depolarization, exposure of phosphatidyl serine, cell membrane disruption and cell shrinkage) are caspase independent. By showing that caspases influence the mode, but not the extent, of nucleoside cytotoxicity, our results exclude defects in these enzymes as a mechanism of nucleoside resistance in CLL.","['Pettitt, A R', 'Cawley, J C']","['Pettitt AR', 'Cawley JC']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/pathology', 'Cell Size', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2000/08/06 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/06 11:00'],"['2000/08/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2068 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02068.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Jun;109(4):800-4. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02068.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

TCR usage skewed at an early period (6-7 weeks) after BMT. The change was more apparent in allogeneic recipients than in autologous recipients. In particular, a predominant increase was detected in the frequency of VA1-4 (26%, 11 of 41 recipients), VA3-1 (32%) and VB24-1 (28%). Interestingly, acidic amino acid residues frequently followed the arginine residue in complementarity-determining region 3 of BV24S1. We further examined the extent of skew using samples obtained at serial time points after transplantation. The normalization of skewed repertoires occurred over a long period of time (> 8 years). There was a significant difference in the rate of normalization of skewed TCR repertoires between adult and child recipients (P < 0.05). The results suggest that these T cells may have expanded in response to allogeneic antigens, such as miHA (minor histocompatibility antigen), and that altered repertoires are eventually normalized by T-cell regeneration via a thymic-dependent pathway in children.","['Matsutani, T', 'Yoshioka, T', 'Tsuruta, Y', 'Iwagami, S', 'Toyosaki-Maeda, T', 'Horiuchi, T', 'Miura, A B', 'Watanabe, A', 'Takada, G', 'Suzuki, R', 'Hirokawa, M']","['Matsutani T', 'Yoshioka T', 'Tsuruta Y', 'Iwagami S', 'Toyosaki-Maeda T', 'Horiuchi T', 'Miura AB', 'Watanabe A', 'Takada G', 'Suzuki R', 'Hirokawa M']","['Department of Immunology, Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Shionogi & Company Ltd, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/surgery', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/immunology/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/surgery', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/08/06 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/06 11:00'],"['2000/08/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2080 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02080.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Jun;109(4):759-69. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02080.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

IN CONCLUSION: (i) patients up to the age of 60 years can be allografted with reduced intensity conditioning; (ii) the procedure was associated with a low transplant-related mortality, particularly for bone marrow grafts, because of a lower risk of chronic GVHD; and (iii) DLI were required after transplant in half the patients for persisting disease or relapse.","['Raiola, A M', 'Van Lint, M T', 'Lamparelli, T', 'Gualandi, F', 'Mordini, N', 'Berisso, G', 'Bregante, S', 'Frassoni, F', 'Sessarego, M', 'Fugazza, G', 'Di Stefano, F', 'Pitto, A', 'Bacigalupo, A']","['Raiola AM', 'Van Lint MT', 'Lamparelli T', 'Gualandi F', 'Mordini N', 'Berisso G', 'Bregante S', 'Frassoni F', 'Sessarego M', 'Fugazza G', 'Di Stefano F', 'Pitto A', 'Bacigalupo A']","[""Dipartimento di Ematologia (DEMA), Ospedale San Martino, Dipartimento Medicina Interna (DIMI) and Cattedra Medicina Legale, Univesita', Genova, Italy. emato2@smartino.ge.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/surgery', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*surgery', 'Survival Rate', 'Thiotepa/*administration & dosage', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/08/06 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/06 11:00'],"['2000/08/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2123 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02123.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Jun;109(4):716-21. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02123.x.,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF withdrawal results in progressive ES cell differentiation. Here we show that during this differentiation process, part of the cells undergo apoptosis concomitant with an activation of the p38 MAP kinase. To gain insight into events mediated by LIF in ES cells, the expression of potential candidate genes was analyzed in the absence or presence of this cytokine by using a semiquantitative RT-PCR assay. We focused on early response genes and on a new type of cytokine repressors (the Socs proteins), some of which exhibit anti-apoptotic properties. We found that expression of c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB was induced upon LIF treatment whereas that of JunD, the tyrosine phosphatase ESP, and the components of the LIF receptor remained unaffected. Expression of Socs-3, but not Socs-1 or Socs-2, was stimulated in the presence of LIF. Finally, uncontrolled overexpression of Socs-1 and Socs-3 led to repression of LIF-dependent transcription and severely reduced cell viability, suggesting that the disturbance of a well balanced Socs protein content has adverse effects on cell survival.","['Duval, D', 'Reinhardt, B', 'Kedinger, C', 'Boeuf, H']","['Duval D', 'Reinhardt B', 'Kedinger C', 'Boeuf H']","['Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (CNRS/INSERM/ULP), BP 163, F-67404 ILLKIRCH Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Socs2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genes, fos/genetics', 'Genes, jun/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', '*Trans-Activators', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection']",,2000/08/06 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/06 11:00'],"['2000/08/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fj.14.11.1577 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2000 Aug;14(11):1577-84. doi: 10.1096/fj.14.11.1577.,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior work has identified the adapter protein CRKL as a major substrate of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. CRKL can also bind via its first SH3 domain [SH3(1)] to specific sequences in Bcr-Abl. Cell-penetrating peptides were developed that bind with high affinity and selectivity to the SH3(1) domain of CRKL. They disrupt Bcr-Abl-CRKL complexes and strongly reduce the proliferation of primary CML blast cells and cell lines established from Bcr-Abl-positive patients. Activation-specific antibodies against phosphorylated MAP kinase (MAPK) showed that MAPK activity is down-regulated in blast cells treated with the CRKLSH3(1) blocker peptides. We conclude that the Bcr-Abl-CRKL complexes are largely dependent on the CRKLSH3(1) domain, that the central mitogenic cascade is down-regulated as a consequence of the disruption of CRKLSH3(1) interactions, and that CRKL therefore contributes to the proliferation of CML blast cells.","['Kardinal, C', 'Konkol, B', 'Schulz, A', 'Posern, G', 'Lin, H', 'Adermann, K', 'Eulitz, M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Talpaz, M', 'Arlinghaus, R B', 'Feller, S M']","['Kardinal C', 'Konkol B', 'Schulz A', 'Posern G', 'Lin H', 'Adermann K', 'Eulitz M', 'Estrov Z', 'Talpaz M', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Feller SM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, MSZ, Universitat Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Calreticulin', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', '*Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*src Homology Domains']",,2000/08/06 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/06 11:00'],"['2000/08/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fj.14.11.1529 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2000 Aug;14(11):1529-38. doi: 10.1096/fj.14.11.1529.,,,,,,,,,,,

MIP-2alpha and a truncated form lacking 5 lysine residues in the COOH-terminal region (mut-MIP-2alpha) were expressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. Purified MIP-2alpha but not mut-MIP-2alpha bound specifically to plasminogen, with K(A) of 3.7 X 10(5) M(-1) for the interaction of plasminogen with surface-bound MIP-2alpha. Binding and competition experiments indicated that the interaction involves the region comprising the first 3 kringles of plasminogen and the COOH-terminal lysine-rich domain of MIP-2alpha. Activation of plasminogen bound to surface-associated MIP-2alpha by two-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (tcu-PA) was about 2.5-fold more efficient than in solution (catalytic efficiency k(cat)K(M) of 0.1 microM(-1)s(-1), as compared to 0.04 microM(-1)s(-1). In contrast, binding of plasminogen to MIP-2alpha in solution was very weak, as evidenced by the absence of competition of MIP-2alpha with lysine-Sepharose or with human THP-1 cells for binding of plasminogen. In agreement with this finding, addition of excess MIP-2alpha did not affect the main functional properties of plasmin(ogen) in solution, as indicated by unaltered activation rates of plasminogen by tcu-PA or tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), t-PA-mediated fibrinolysis, and inhibition rate of plasmin by alpha2-antiplasmin. Thus, association of MIP-2alpha with surfaces exposes its COOH-terminal plasminogen-binding site, and may result in enhanced local plasmin generation.","['Arza, B', 'Felez, J', 'Fabregas, P', 'Laroche, Y', 'Collen, D', 'Lijnen, H R']","['Arza B', 'Felez J', 'Fabregas P', 'Laroche Y', 'Collen D', 'Lijnen HR']","['Institut de Recerca Oncologica, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (CXCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Monokines)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9001-91-6 (Plasminogen)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Chemokine CXCL2', 'Chemokines, CXC', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fibrinolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Kringles', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Monokines/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Plasminogen/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/pharmacology']",,2000/08/06 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/08/06 11:00'],"['2000/08/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['00070071 [pii]'],ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2000 Jul;84(1):71-7.,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, recent advances in the knowledge of psychoneuroimmunology have demonstrated that anticancer immunity is under neuroendocrine control and that the pineal hormone melatonin (MLT) may stimulate the IL-2-dependent anticancer reaction. Finally, preliminary clinical studies have already shown that the concommitant administration of MLT may amplify the efficacy of IL-2 in the treatment of advanced solid neoplasms, whereas there are no data about MLT influence on IL-2 activity in hematologic malignancies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a neuroimmunotherapeutic combination of low-dose IL-2 plus MLT in advanced hematologic malignancies which did not respond to previous standard therapies. The study included 12 evaluable patients. Tumor histotypes were as follows: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) 6; Hodgkin's disease (HD), 2; multiple myeloma, 2; acute myelogenous leukemia (ALM), 1 and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 1. IL-2 was injected subcutaneously at a dose of 3 million IU/day for 6 days per week for 4 weeks, corresponding to one cycle. MLT was given orally at 20 mg/day in the evening, without interruption. In non-progressing patients, a second IL-2 cycle was planned after a 3 week-rest period. A partial response was achieved in one patient with multiple myeloma. Stable disease occurred in 7 other patients (NHL, 3; HD, 1; AML, 1; CLLM, 1; multiple myeloma, 1), whereas the other 4 patients progressed. Therefore, lack of progression was obtained in 8 out of 12 (67%) patients, with a median duration of 21+ months (14-30+ months). The treatment was well tolerated in all patients. These preliminary results would suggest that the concomitant administration of low-dose IL-2 plus the pineal hormone MLT may prolong the survival time in untreatable advanced hematologic malignancies, with results comparable to those previously reported using a more toxic immunotherapy, consisting of high-dose IL-2 alone.","['Lissoni, P', 'Bolis, S', 'Brivio, F', 'Fumagalli, L']","['Lissoni P', 'Bolis S', 'Brivio F', 'Fumagalli L']","['Division of Radiation Oncology, S.

The novel intestinal bacterial metabolites of ginseng protopanaxadiol saponins have recently been found and isolated after the oral administration of ginseng extract in human and rats. 20-O-(beta-D-Glucopyranosyl)-20(S)-protopanaxadiol (IH-901) formed from ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, and Rc is of particular interest in cancer chemoprevention and treatment. We investigated the effects of IH-901 on the human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 in terms of inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. IH-901 showed a significant cytotoxic activity in HL-60 cells (IC(50) = 24. 3 microM) following a 96-hr incubation. Treatment of HL-60 cells with IH-901 resulted in the formation of internucleosomal DNA fragments. The dose- and time-dependent induction of apoptosis by IH-901 was demonstrated in sandwich enzyme immunoassay and the results were confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. Morphological examination of IH-901-treated samples showed cells with chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage, and nuclear fragmentation, all typical characteristics of apoptotic cells. The treatment of HL-60 cells with IH-901 caused activation of caspase-3 protease and subsequent proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. IH-901 did not affect the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 but did cause a release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytosol. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that IH-901 dramatically suppresses HL-60 cell growth by inducing programed cell death through activation of caspase-3 protease, which occurs via mitochondrial cytochrome c release independently of Bcl-2 modulation. These results may provide a pivotal mechanism for the use of IH-901 in the prevention and treatment of leukemia.","['Lee, S J', 'Ko, W G', 'Kim, J H', 'Sung, J H', 'Moon, C K', 'Lee, B H']","['Lee SJ', 'Ko WG', 'Kim JH', 'Sung JH', 'Moon CK', 'Lee BH']","['College of Pharmacy and Medicinal Resources Research Center, Wonkwang University, Iksan, 570-749, Chonbuk, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'A9RLM212CY (ginsenoside M1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', '*Ginsenosides', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology', 'Panax/chemistry', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Saponins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology']",,2000/08/06 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/06 11:00'],"['2000/08/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(00)00362-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00362-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Sep 1;60(5):677-85. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00362-2.,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe a novel signaling pathway activated by the IL-5 receptor in eosinophils involving the CrkL adapter protein. We determined whether IL-5 induces activation of CrkL and STAT5 in eosinophils using both the human eosinophil-differentiated AML14.3D10 cell line and purified peripheral blood eosinophils from normal donors. Stimulation of AML14.3D10 cells or blood eosinophils with IL-5 induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the CrkL adapter and STAT5 and the association of CrkL and STAT5 in vivo as evidenced by the detection of STAT5 in anti-CrkL immunoprecipitates. The resulting CrkL.STAT5 complexes translocated to the nucleus and bound STAT5 consensus DNA-binding sites present in the promoters of IL-5-regulated genes, as shown in gel mobility and antibody supershift assays. IL-5 also induced marked activity of an 8X-GAS (interferon gamma-activated site)-luciferase reporter construct in transient transfections of AML14.3D10 eosinophils, demonstrating that these complexes play a functional role in IL-5 signaling. CrkL was also found to interact, via its N-terminal SH3 domain, with C3G, a guanine exchange factor for the small G-protein Rap1, which was also rapidly activated in an IL-5-dependent manner in these cells, establishing that CrkL mediates downstream activation of at least two signaling cascades in IL-5-stimulated eosinophils. Thus, the CrkL adapter plays an important role in IL-5 signaling in the eosinophil, acting as a nuclear adapter for STAT5 and as an upstream regulator of the C3G-Rap1 signaling pathway.","['Du, J', 'Alsayed, Y M', 'Xin, F', 'Ackerman, S J', 'Platanias, L C']","['Du J', 'Alsayed YM', 'Xin F', 'Ackerman SJ', 'Platanias LC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-5)']",IM,,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-5/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-5', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/06 11:00'],"['2000/08/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M003655200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)89213-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Oct 20;275(42):33167-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M003655200.,,"['AI25230/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI33043/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77816/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Although most cases can be diagnosed by these methods, there is only modest correlation between morphologic categories and treatment responsiveness and prognosis. The expansion of therapeutic options and improvement in remission induction and disease-free survival for both AML and ALL have stimulated emphasis on defining good and poor treatment response groups. This is most effectively accomplished by a multifaceted approach to diagnosis and classification using immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular analysis in addition to the traditional methods. Immunophenotyping is important in characterizing morphologically poorly differentiated acute leukemias and in defining prognostic categories of ALL. Cytogenetic and molecular studies provide important prognostic information and are becoming vitally important in determining the appropriate treatment protocol. With optimal application of these techniques in the diagnosis of acute leukemias, treatment strategies can be more specifically directed and new therapeutic approaches can be evaluated more effectively.","['McKenna, R W']",['McKenna RW'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd., Dallas, TX 75390-9072, USA. rmcken@mednet.swmed.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'World Health Organization']",42,2000/08/06 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/06 11:00'],"['2000/08/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Chem. 2000 Aug;46(8 Pt 2):1252-9.,,,,,,,,,,,

After expression in two cell systems, immunopurified HDAC8 is shown to possess trichostatin A- and sodium butyrate-inhibitable HDAC activity on histone H4 peptide substrates as well as on core histones. Expression profiling reveals the expression of HDAC8 to various degrees in every tissue tested and also in several tumour lines. Mutation of two adjacent histidine residues within the predicted active site severely decreases activity, confirming these residues as important for HDAC8 enzyme activity. Finally, linkage analysis after radiation hybrid mapping has localized HDAC8 to chromosomal position Xq21.2-Xq21.3.

Cytarabine, pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine and gemcitabine are all prodrugs whose plasma pharmacokinetics do not fully reflect their therapeutic activity; after cellular uptake, these compounds undergo phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase before their incorporation into DNA results in cell death. Cytarabine is principally active in the S phase of the cell cycle and is most toxic to replicating cells, whereas pentostatin, fludarabine and cladribine are incorporated into DNA during the process in which strand breaks are repaired and are therefore cytotoxic to slowly replicating cells (although the action of pentostatin results from its inhibition of adenosine deaminase). Gemcitabine is unusual in being highly metabolised in solid tumour cells. The cytotoxic activity of pentostatin, fludarabine and cladribine against the clonal cells of lymphoproliferative disorders is accompanied by damage to normal lymphoid cells, which results in significant and long-lasting immunosuppression. Useful interactions between nucleoside analogues have been defined. Cells that are primed by exposure to fludarabine or cladribine exhibit enhanced accumulation of cytarabine triphosphate (the cytotoxic nucleotide of cytarabine) and an improved therapeutic effect against acute myeloid leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia can be achieved by clinical schedules that exploit this effect. Combinations of alkylating agents and fludarabine or cladribine are also synergistic in producing significantly enhanced activity against refractory lymphoid malignancies, but at the cost of increased haematological toxicity. Developments in the clinical administration of gemcitabine are concentrating on efforts to extend the duration of exposure to the drug as a means of counteracting its rapid catabolism in the circulation. Future developments with this group of agents will further explore the use of fludarabine-based combination therapies to produce a transient period of myelosuppression and immunosuppression that is sufficient to permit the engraftment of allogeneic haemopoietic stem cells and also exploit the immunological benefits of graft-versus-tumour reactions. In addition, the clinical spectrum of activity of gemcitabine is also being extended by combining the drug with other active chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, and by early studies of its role as a radiosensitiser.","['Johnson, S A']",['Johnson SA'],"['Department of Haematology, Taunton Hospital, England. steve.johnson@tauntonsom-tr.swest.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleosides)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nucleosides/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",212,2000/08/05 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003088-200039010-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2000 Jul;39(1):5-26. doi: 10.2165/00003088-200039010-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,

RNase L is a latent endoribonuclease that is activated on its binding by 2-5A and inhibited by the ribonuclease L inhibitor (RLI). We have shown previously by coimmunoprecipitation that RNase L may be associated with a 90-kDa RNA binding protein (RNABP), identified with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) raised against an RNase L complex purified under native conditions on 2-5A-sepharose. Here we confirm, by gel-filtration and pull-down analysis, the association of RNase L and RNABP, and we demonstrate that this association is significantly increased in the presence of 2-5A. Moreover, we found that RNABP protein levels decrease during terminal differentiation in various cell lines but do not vary during vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection or following IFN-alpha/beta treatment. In this latter case, although total cellular RNABP levels do not vary, the amount of RNABP found in the cytoplasm increases in comparison to that found in the nucleus, indicating a cytoplasmic localization of RNABP after IFN-alpha/beta treatment. Finally, we demonstrate the interaction between RNase L and RNABP in intact cells. Microinjection of an mAb against RNABP into HeLa cells inhibits RNase L antiviral activity and partially inhibits the IFN-alpha/beta-induced antiviral activity.","['Le Roy, F', 'Laskowska, A', 'Silhol, M', 'Salehzada, T', 'Bisbal, C']","['Le Roy F', 'Laskowska A', 'Silhol M', 'Salehzada T', 'Bisbal C']","['EP 2030 and UMR CNRS 5535, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', ""61172-40-5 (2',5'-oligoadenylate)"", 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,,"['Adenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Encephalomyocarditis virus/physiology', 'Endoribonucleases/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oligoribonucleotides/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/physiology']",,2000/08/05 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/107999000414817 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000 Jul;20(7):635-44. doi: 10.1089/107999000414817.,,,,,,,,,,,

We report that immunological tolerance to a tumor-associated viral superantigen (SAg) is overcome in a mouse lymphoma model by transfer of allogeneic T cells expressing SAg-reactive Vbeta6 T-cell receptor chains. Surprisingly, upon contact with SAg-expressing lymphoma cells, Vbeta6 T cells became activated rather than tolerized (as reported previously). They also developed SAg-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity and secreted IL-2 and IFN-gamma. The grafted T cells infiltrated liver metastases, formed close contact with SAg-expressing tumor cells, and caused significant graft-vs. -leukemia (GvL) effects. Selection for tumor resistance among the progeny from a cross between SAg-negative donor and SAg- positive recipient strains revealed a strict correlation between loss of the endogenous SAg tolerogen, rescue of Vbeta6 T cells from SAg-mediated deletion, and leukemia resistance. These findings suggest that immune responses to SAg can be exploited to break tolerance and augment immune responses to tumors.","['Schirrmacher, V', 'Muerkoster, S', 'Bucur, M', 'Umansky, V', 'Rocha, M']","['Schirrmacher V', 'Muerkoster S', 'Bucur M', 'Umansky V', 'Rocha M']","['German Cancer Research Center, Division of Cellular Immunology, Tumor Immunology Program, Heidelberg, Germany.

These receptors can also regulate T cells by modulating TCR-induced effector functions such as cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and proliferation. Here we have assessed the capacity of mouse T cells expressing the inhibitory MHC class I receptor Ly49A to respond to a well-defined tumor Ag in vivo using Ly49A transgenic mice. We find that the presence of Ly49A on the vast majority of lymphocytes prevents the development of a significant Ag-specific CD8+ T cell response and, consequently, the rejection of the tumor. Despite minor alterations in the TCR repertoire of CD8+ T cells in the transgenic lines, precursors of functional tumor-specific CD8+ T cells exist but could not be activated most likely due to a lack of appropriate CD4+ T cell help. Surprisingly, all of these effects are observed in the absence of a known ligand for the Ly49A receptor as defined by its ability to regulate NK cell function. Indeed, we found that the above effects on T cells may be based on a weak interaction of Ly49A with Kb or Db class I molecules. Thus, our data demonstrate that enforced expression of a Ly49A receptor on conventional T cells prevents a specific immune response in vivo and suggest that the functions of T and NK cells are differentially sensitive to the presence of inhibitory MHC class I receptors.","['Brawand, P', 'Lemonnier, F A', 'MacDonald, H R', 'Cerottini, J C', 'Held, W']","['Brawand P', 'Lemonnier FA', 'MacDonald HR', 'Cerottini JC', 'Held W']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Lausanne Branch, University of Lausanne, Epalinges, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Klra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily A)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, NK Cell Lectin-Like)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Ly', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Graft Rejection/genetics/immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/immunology', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/prevention & control/virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Lymphopenia/genetics/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily A', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Receptors, NK Cell Lectin-Like', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transgenes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/transplantation']",,2000/08/05 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']","['ji_v165n4p1871 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.165.4.1871 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Aug 15;165(4):1871-6. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.4.1871.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Personal files of patients treated for secondary intracranial meningioma during a 31-year period were reviewed. In cases which met the criteria for radiation-induced tumors, steroid hormone receptor and Ki-67 status were analyzed. For the literature review, computerized database systems and reference lists from respective publications were used. RESULTS: Five patients (2 females, 3 males), 3-11 years old at the time of cranial irradiation, developed secondary meningioma after a latency period of 9.5-31.5 years. Three patients had multiple tumors and 2 developed recurrent disease. Of 9 histologically examined tumors, 5 were graded as benign and 4 as atypical meningiomas, with Ki-67 proliferative index 3.2 +/- 3.6 and 10 +/- 6, respectively. The ratio between positive and negative meningiomas regarding immunostaining for progesterone and estrogen receptors was eight-to-one and six-to-three, respectively. Cumulative actuarial risk of secondary meningioma in a cohort of 445 children 16 years or younger treated with high-dose cranial irradiation between 1968 and 1990 in Slovenia at 10, 20, and 25 years was 0.53%, 1.2%, and 8.18%, respectively. Out of 126 cases of radiation-induced meningiomas reported, 57% were females and 43% were males, with mean age at presentation 33 +/- 17.3 years. The majority (68%) of patients was irradiated during childhood. The latency period was significantly shorter in those who aged 5 years or less at the time of cranial irradiation (p = 0.04), and in those with atypical/anaplastic tumor (p = 0.01). Correlation between radiation dose and latency period could not be found. CONCLUSION: Secondary meningiomas following high-dose cranial irradiation are characterized by younger age at presentation, by higher male-to-female ratio and by biologically more aggressive variants compared to primary spontaneous meningiomas.

ATL cells originate from the CD4 subset of peripheral T cells. The main route of mother-to-child transmission is postnatal breast-feeding. Refraining from breast-feeding or limiting the duration of breast-feeding can reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Other than postnatal breast-feeding, there seem to be two routes of HTLV-I transmission from mother to child. One is intrauterine transmission, and the other is via saliva. Intrauterine transmission is rare, although proviral DNA is detected in cord blood samples. HTLV-I proviruses in the cord blood may be defective. HTLV-I proviral DNA and antibodies against HTLV-I are also detected in saliva. However, no report has been published so far which showed direct evidence of HTLV-I transmission via saliva. The placenta can be infected by HTLV-I, but infection does not reach the fetus, possibly apoptosis of placental villous cells because it is induced by HTLV-I infection.","['Fujino, T', 'Nagata, Y']","['Fujino T', 'Nagata Y']","['School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan. toshinet@health.nop.kagoshima-u-ac-jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,J Reprod Immunol,Journal of reproductive immunology,8001906,,IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Breast Feeding/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/virology', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Milk, Human/virology', 'Placenta Diseases/pathology/virology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/epidemiology/*virology', 'Saliva/virology', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",60,2000/08/05 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-0378(00)00054-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-0378(00)00054-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Reprod Immunol. 2000 Jul;47(2):197-206. doi: 10.1016/s0165-0378(00)00054-1.,,,,,,,,,,,

By using a mast cell model rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells we explored the mechanism of the inhibition. EGCG inhibited histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells in response to antigen or the calcium-ionophore A23187, while (-)-epicatechin (EC) had little effect. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including approximately 120 kDa proteins occurred in parallel with the secretion induced by either stimulation. EGCG also inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of the approximately 120-kDa proteins induced by either stimulation, whereas EC did not. The tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor piceatannol inhibited the secretion and tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins induced by either stimulation also. Further analysis showed that the focal adhesion kinase pp125(FAK) was one of the approximately 120-kDa proteins. These findings suggest that EGCG prevents histamine release from mast cells mainly by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins including pp125(FAK).","['Yamashita, K', 'Suzuki, Y', 'Matsui, T', 'Yoshimaru, T', 'Yamaki, M', 'Suzuki-Karasaki, M', 'Hayakawa, S', 'Shimizu, K']","['Yamashita K', 'Suzuki Y', 'Matsui T', 'Yoshimaru T', 'Yamaki M', 'Suzuki-Karasaki M', 'Hayakawa S', 'Shimizu K']","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, 173-8610, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine']",,2000/08/05 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2000.3200 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(00)93200-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 Aug 11;274(3):603-8. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.3200.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,['Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2000 Sep 16;276(1):391'],,,

Preintegration complexes (PICs) stripped of BAF lose their normal integration activity, which can be restored by incubation with purified BAF. BAF bridges double-stranded DNA both intra- and intermolecularly in a non-sequence-specific manner, leading to the formation of a nucleoprotein network. BAF also binds to the nuclear protein lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2), and is localized with chromatin during interphase and mitosis. The crystal structure of homodimeric human BAF has been determined to 1.9 A resolution. The fold of the BAF monomer resembles that of the second domain of RuvA. This comparison revealed the presence of the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) nonspecific DNA binding motif within BAF. A novel feature of BAF's HhH motif is the occupation of the metal binding site by the epsilon-amino group of Lys 6, providing an alternative means of sequestering positive charge. Mutational analysis corroborates the HhH motif's prominent role in DNA binding and argues against a previously proposed helix-turn-helix (HTH) binding site located in another region of the monomer. A model of BAF bridging DNA via the HhH motif is proposed.","['Umland, T C', 'Wei, S Q', 'Craigie, R', 'Davies, D R']","['Umland TC', 'Wei SQ', 'Craigie R', 'Davies DR']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (BANF1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '964MRK2PEL (Selenomethionine)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs/genetics', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein Folding', 'Selenomethionine/chemistry', 'Solutions', '*Virus Integration']",,2000/08/05 11:00,2000/09/09 11:01,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/09 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']","['bi000572w [pii]', '10.1021/bi000572w [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2000 Aug 8;39(31):9130-8. doi: 10.1021/bi000572w.,"['PDB/1CI4', 'PDB/R1CI4SF']",,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the expression of several Bcl-2 homologs upon stimulation of CD34(+) human hematopoietic progenitor cells. CD34(+) cells were induced to differentiate into predominantly erythroid cells in the presence of erythropoietin (Epo) and stem cell factor (SCF), while the addition of G-CSF and SCF led to differentiation predominantly into granulocytic cells, as demonstrated by immunophenotyping and morphological examination of cultured cells. In Epo- and SCF-stimulated cells, we found a marked increase in the level of Bcl-x(L) protein expression and downregulation of Bax expression, apparent from day 4 and more pronounced on days 8 and 21. In contrast, Bcl-x(L) protein expression was downregulated in G-CSF- and SCF-stimulated cells compared with cells cultured in medium alone, whereas there was no sign of change in the level of Bax. Mcl-1 expression showed a biphasic expression pattern in both early erythropoiesis and early granulopoiesis, but with an inverse regulation. Thus, Mcl-1 levels initially decreased in granulocytic progenitor cells and increased in erythroid progenitor cells. Finally, Bcl-2 expression was significantly downregulated in both Epo and SCF and G-CSF- and SCF-stimulated cells. The role of the distinct upregulation of Bcl-x(L) in early erythroid differentiation was further examined by use of specific ribozymes against Bcl-x(L). Addition of Bcl-x(L) ribozymes promoted a clear increase in cell death of Epo- and SCF-stimulated cells, while erythroid differentiation was not affected. In conclusion, we found a distinct regulation of several Bcl-2 family members in CD34(+) cells dependent on the cytokine stimulation given. The use of Bcl-x(L)-specific ribozymes suggested that Bcl-x(L) is important for survival but not for differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells.","['Josefsen, D', 'Myklebust, J H', 'Lomo, J', 'Sioud, M', 'Blomhoff, H K', 'Smeland, E B']","['Josefsen D', 'Myklebust JH', 'Lomo J', 'Sioud M', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Smeland EB']","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway. dag.josefsen@labmed.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Adult', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Catalytic', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2000/08/03 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/03 11:00'],"['2000/08/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/03 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/stemcells.18-4-261 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2000;18(4):261-72. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.18-4-261.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The medical records of patients with musculoskeletal symptoms and a final diagnosis of cancer were reviewed. In each case age, gender, presenting symptoms, laboratory data, diagnostic procedures, provisional and final diagnoses, and time between clinical onset and correct diagnosis were reviewed. RESULTS: An underlying neoplasia was found in 10 of 1,254 patients (<1%) complaining of musculoskeletal symptoms. The types of malignancies found included acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (6 cases), lymphoma (2 cases), neuroblastoma (1 case), and Ewing's sarcoma (1 case). The mean time between disease onset and final diagnosis was 3.2 months. The most common presenting feature was monoarthritis, involving the larger joints such as the elbows, knees or ankles. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was the most frequent provisional diagnosis. In the preliminary hematologic evaluation, eight patients had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) value. White blood cell (WBC) count was normal in almost all children, with a normal differential count. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) was raised in all children. Bone marrow aspirates and lymph node or bone biopsies were necessary to reach the final diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: A malignancy should always be excluded in children with musculoskeletal symptoms, especially when the clinical pattern is not characteristic of a specific rheumatic disease. Routine laboratory tests may be misleading. The simultaneous presence of high LDH or alpha-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase (alpha-HBDH) levels and raised ESR or CRP, even with normal blood cell counts, should lead to additional investigations. RELEVANCE: All patients presenting with arthritis or other musculoskeletal symptoms should have a thorough clinical examination. Disproportionate pain levels and an atypical pattern of ""arthritis,"" especially in the presence of systemic manifestations, suggest a possible underlying malignancy.","['Trapani, S', 'Grisolia, F', 'Simonini, G', 'Calabri, G B', 'Falcini, F']","['Trapani S', 'Grisolia F', 'Simonini G', 'Calabri GB', 'Falcini F']","['Department of Pediatrics, A.

RESULTS: When the 0-4Gy dose range is used, the low-dose extrapolation factor for all solid tumours, assessing the degree to which low-dose cancer risks are overestimated by fitting a model linear in dose, is 1.06 (95% CI 0.78, 1.62) and so is not significantly different from 1; the associated ratio of the quadratic to the linear coefficients is 0.06 Sv(-1) (95% CI -0.22, 0.67). The best estimate of the low-dose extrapolation factor for leukaemia is 2.47 (95% CI 1.24, > 1,000). The ratio of the quadratic to the linear coefficients is 1.81 Sv(-1) (95% CI 0.21, > 1,000). When various types and groupings of solid tumours are considered there is not generally any strong evidence for upward curvature; for only two out of the six solid tumour groupings are there indications of appreciable upward curvature in the dose response, and in no instance is this statistically significant. Consideration of a lower dose range (0-2Gy rather than 0-4 Gy) results in the low-dose extrapolation factor for solid tumours increasing to 1.21 (95% CI 0.81, 2.45), with corresponding increases for solid tumour subtypes; the corresponding quantity for leukaemia decreases to 1.73 (95% CI 0.79, 147.67). Three out of the six solid tumour subtypes now show appreciable upward curvature. If there is additional adjustment of the Hiroshima neutron dose estimates over the 0-2 Gy dose range, the low-dose extrapolation factor for all solid tumours increases still further, to 1.43 (95% CI 0.97, 2.72), whereas for leukaemia this quantity is further reduced, to 1.58 (95% CI 0.90, 10.58). CONCLUSIONS: There is marked upward curvature in the dose response for leukaemia. For solid tumours there is little indication of upward curvature in the dose response over the 0-4 Gy dose range, although over the 0-2 Gy dose range and after adjustment of Hiroshima DS86 neutron dose estimates the upward curvature is more pronounced. Uncertainties in the likely adjustments to the Hiroshima DS86 neutron dose estimates imply that these findings should be treated with caution.","['Little, M P', 'Muirhead, C R']","['Little MP', 'Muirhead CR']","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK. mark.little@nrpb.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', '*Nuclear Warfare']",,2000/08/03 11:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['2000/08/03 11:00'],"['2000/08/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '2000/08/03 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553000050050954 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2000 Jul;76(7):939-53. doi: 10.1080/09553000050050954.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 11 B-CLL patients were studied with regard to exposure of leukemic lymphocytes with (n = 8) or without (n = 3) P2z receptors to ATP, benzoylbenzoic-ATP (BzATP), 2-methylthio-ATP (2MeSATP), adenosine-5'-[gamma-thio] triphosphate (ATP-gamma S), and other nucleosides for 8 h in vitro. Apoptosis was detected by electron microscopy (EM), agarose gel electrophoresis, and quantitative assay-TdT assay. RESULTS: Apoptosis was detected only in leukemic lymphocytes with P2z receptors. Using a quantitative assay, we found that ATP-induced DNA strand breaks occur specifically with BzATP, ATP and 2MeSATP, but not for analogue ATP-gamma S nor other nucleosides. Meanwhile, ATP-induced DNA fragmentation was fully blocked by pretreatment with oxidized ATP (OxATP), a compound recently shown to block P2z receptors. Also, the Ca2+/calmodulin complex played a role in the regulation of the apoptosis induced by ATP on CLL cells, because an antagonist of this complex, 1-[N,O-bis (5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine (KN-62) was found to inhibit the ATP-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that P2z receptors on lymphocytes play an important role in apoptosis induced by ATP in vitro.","['Peng, L', 'Bradley, C J', 'Wiley, J S']","['Peng L', 'Bradley CJ', 'Wiley JS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, West China University of Medical Sciences, Chengdu.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/03 11:00,2000/10/07 11:01,['2000/08/03 11:00'],"['2000/08/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/07 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/03 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 1998 Jul;78(7):508-11.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cell culture techniques, direct immunogold silver staining(D-IGSS), reverse transcriptase (RT)assay, XC syncytium assay, and electron microscopy were employed to evaluate retrovirus associated antigens (RVAAgs), RT activities, CPE, and virus particles of both leukemic cells and normal hematopoietic cells. RESULTS: RVAAgs were detected by D-IGSS in 50.0% of fresh AML cell samples and 87.5% of cultured AML samples. RT assay showed that RVAAg-positive samples from 14 cases simultaneously expressed RT activities, and XC syncytium assay also revealed positive results. Electron microscopy demonstrated typical type C retrovirus particles at various maturation in 75% of cultured leukemic cell samples. In contrast, neither RVAAgs and RT activity nor syncytium and virus particles were detected in normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: AML cells harbor the entire genome(s) of retrovirus(es), which could release into extracellular spaces in intact particles via budding from the target cells stimulated in vitro by appropriate RV inducing agents.

With the use of antisense oligonucleotides, we have previously demonstrated that Mcl-1 is necessary for this effect. We wanted to further characterize the expression of Mcl-1 and examine signaling pathways required for the delay in apoptosis that is mediated by hypoxia. METHODS: For kinase signaling inhibition, PMNs were incubated for 12 hours with the following inhibitors: PD98059 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase (MEK), SB202190 (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK]), and LY294002 (phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase [PI3K]). PMNs that were treated with inhibitors were assessed for apoptosis by morphologic features or were lysed for Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Western blot analyses, immunofluorescent staining, and quantification showed an upregulation of Mcl-1 expression after 12 hours of incubation in response to hypoxia. When inhibitors of either MEK or p38 MAPK were incubated with PMNs during hypoxia, apoptosis increased to similar levels as normoxia. We further wanted to determine whether signaling through p38 MAPK or MEK led to increased Mcl-1 expression. Western blot analysis confirmed that the inhibition of p38 MAPK led to a significant decrease in Mcl-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: We have documented a novel mechanism by which hypoxia can modify PMN apoptosis in the wound site by the activation of p38 MAPK signaling, thereby inducing the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1.","['Leuenroth, S J', 'Grutkoski, P S', 'Ayala, A', 'Simms, H H']","['Leuenroth SJ', 'Grutkoski PS', 'Ayala A', 'Simms HH']","['Brown University School of Medicine and Rhode Island Hospital, Providence 02903, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Surgery,Surgery,0417347,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Hypoxia/*physiology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/blood', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood/genetics', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,2000/08/03 11:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/08/03 11:00'],"['2000/08/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/03 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0039-6060(00)36546-1 [pii]', '10.1067/msy.2000.107609 [doi]']",ppublish,Surgery. 2000 Aug;128(2):171-7. doi: 10.1067/msy.2000.107609.,,['R01GM53114-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

This paper tests whether the people who survived, in spite of bomb-related injuries, are homogeneous in respect of variation of cancer risk with age with survivors without such injuries. METHODS: Appropriate statistical models are derived and fitted to survivor data by maximum likelihood and the resultant statistics used to test the homogeneity assumption. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between those with no injuries and those with multiple injuries and shown to be largely due to exposures before 10 or after 55 years of age having exceptionally high risks of late effects of radiation for survivors showing early effects, i.e. bomb-related injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Certain accepted dogmas about the biology of radiation risks in humans, such as 'cancer is the only late effect of radiation' and 'leukaemia is uniquely radiogenic amongst cancers', may be significantly in error. These are discussed.","['Stewart, A M', 'Kneale, G W']","['Stewart AM', 'Kneale GW']","['Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, The University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.

Here we report that Bright interacts with the ubiquitous autoantigen Sp100, a component of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs), and with LYSp100B/Sp140, the lymphoid-restricted homolog of Sp100. Both in intact cells and in nuclear matrix preparations, the majority of Bright and Sp100 colocalize within PML NBs. In contrast, Bright colocalizes with only a small fraction of LYSp100B while inducing a redistribution of the majority of LYSp100B from its associated nuclear domains (LANDs) into nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Sp100 represses the MAR-binding and transactivation activity of Bright. LYSp100B interacts more weakly with Bright but requires significantly higher levels than Sp100 to inhibit MAR binding. However, it strongly stimulates Bright transactivation through E mu. We suggest that Sp100 and LYSp100B interactions with Bright have different consequences for IgH transcription, potentially through differential association of E mu MARs with nuclear matrix- associated PML NBs and LANDs.","['Zong, R T', 'Das, C', 'Tucker, P W']","['Zong RT', 'Das C', 'Tucker PW']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and The Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (ARID3A protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)']",IM,,"['*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Matrix', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein Binding', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,2000/08/02 11:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/08/02 11:00'],"['2000/08/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/02 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/19.15.4123 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2000 Aug 1;19(15):4123-33. doi: 10.1093/emboj/19.15.4123.,['GENBANK/U60335'],,,,,PMC306587,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: University hospital intensive care unit. PATIENTS: A total of 82 critically ill adult patients in four clinically defined groups, namely septic shock (n = 29), sepsis without shock (n = 17), shock without sepsis (n = 22), and nonseptic, nonshock controls (n = 14). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: During day 1 of septic shock, peak plasma levels of G-CSF, interleukin (IL)-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), but not GM-CSF, were greater than in sepsis or shock alone (p < .001), and were correlated among themselves (rs = 0.44-0.77; p < .02) and with the APACHE II score (rs = 0.25-0.40; p = .03 to .18). G-CSF, IL-6, and UF, and sepsis, shock, septic shock, and APACHE II scores were strongly associated with organ dysfunction or 5-day mortality by univariate analysis. However, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that only septic shock remained significantly associated with organ dysfunction and only APACHE II scores and shock with 5-day mortality. Similarly, peak G-CSF, IL-6, and LIF were poorly predictive of 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of G-CSF, IL-6, and LIF are greatly elevated in critical illness, including septic shock, and are correlated with one another and with the severity of illness. However, they are not independently predictive of mortality, or the development of multiple organ dysfunction. GM-CSF was rarely elevated, suggesting different roles for G-CSF and GM-CSF in human septic shock.","['Presneill, J J', 'Waring, P M', 'Layton, J E', 'Maher, D W', 'Cebon, J', 'Harley, N S', 'Wilson, J W', 'Cade, J F']","['Presneill JJ', 'Waring PM', 'Layton JE', 'Maher DW', 'Cebon J', 'Harley NS', 'Wilson JW', 'Cade JF']","['Intensive Care Unit, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['APACHE', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood', 'Growth Inhibitors/blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphokines/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure/etiology/mortality', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sepsis/*blood/classification/complications/mortality', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Shock, Septic/*blood/classification/complications/mortality']",,2000/08/02 11:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['2000/08/02 11:00'],"['2000/08/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/08/02 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00003246-200007000-00028 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2000 Jul;28(7):2344-54. doi: 10.1097/00003246-200007000-00028.,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective, comparative, single-center study. SETTING: Specialized ward for treating patients with acute leukemia and associated intensive care unit at a university hospital. SUBJECTS: Twenty-six consecutive patients who developed either severe sepsis (n = 13) or septic shock (n = 13) during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (leukocytes <1,000/microL). INTERVENTION: None, other than standard care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline blood samples were obtained from 97 adult patients treated with intensive cytostatic chemotherapy. Serial blood sampling was performed in 62 of 97 patients who developed fever (>38.3 degrees C). Thirteen patients progressed to severe sepsis and 13 patients to septic shock. Protein C, endogenous activated protein C, and D-dimer were measured in these 26 patients. At fever onset, protein C concentrations decreased from normal baseline concentrations and were significantly lower in the group of patients who progressed to septic shock compared with those who developed severe sepsis (medians for protein C activity: 23.1% vs. 69.5%; p = .0003). The median elapsed time between detection of fever and the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock was 16 hrs and 12 hrs, respectively. All septic shock patients died, whereas patients who progressed only to severe sepsis survived. CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock in neutropenic patients is associated with increased protein C consumption. The data demonstrate that the coagulation cascade is activated and produces a hypercoagulable state before the onset of clinical symptoms of severe sepsis and septic shock. Low protein C concentrations at the onset of fever and before the onset of clinical symptoms of severe sepsis or septic shock may have prognostic value in predicting an unfavorable outcome. Protein C measurements may help identify patients at risk in an early phase of neutropenic sepsis. It is also attractive to speculate that because low protein C concentrations were seen in these patients, protein C replacement may be beneficial in sepsis.","['Mesters, R M', 'Helterbrand, J', 'Utterback, B G', 'Yan, B', 'Chao, Y B', 'Fernandez, J A', 'Griffin, J H', 'Hartman, D L']","['Mesters RM', 'Helterbrand J', 'Utterback BG', 'Yan B', 'Chao YB', 'Fernandez JA', 'Griffin JH', 'Hartman DL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein C)', '0 (Pyrimidine Dimers)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*blood/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein C/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidine Dimers/blood', 'Sepsis/*etiology', 'Shock, Septic/*etiology/mortality']",,2000/08/02 11:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['2000/08/02 11:00'],"['2000/08/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/08/02 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00003246-200007000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2000 Jul;28(7):2209-16. doi: 10.1097/00003246-200007000-00005.,,['R37HL52246/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The expression level of MRP were expressed as ratio of MRP/beta 2M(beta 2-microglobulin) and the ratio of MRP/beta 2M > or = 0.3 was defined as MRP positive. RESULTS: The level of MRP mRNA and the positive percentage of MRP in relapsed-refractory group were significantly higher than that in normal control group. In newly diagnosed group, the first complete remission rate of MRP negative patients(84%) was significantly higher than that of MRP positive(25%) patients. MRP expression level was different in leukemia sub-type. MRP and mdr-1 genes were examined simultaneously in 65 AL patients, the mean expression level and positive percentage of MRP and mdr-1 in clinical resistance group were significantly higher than those in non-resistance group.

METHODS: Serum and bone marrow mononuclear cell (MNC) culture supernatant IL-6, sgp 130, IL-8 concentrations of 18 cases APL patients were measured (ELISA). Bone marrow MNC IL-8RA was measured by flow cytometry after cultured with ATRA (10(-6) mmol/L). RESULTS: Serum IL-6, sgp130, IL-8 levels were higher than normal (P < 0.05), IL-6, sgp130 levels correlated with white blood cell (WBC) counts (P < 0.05) while IL-8 level correlated with body temperature (P < 0.05) at initial diagnosis after 72-hour incubation with ATRA, concentration of IL-6 of bone marrow MNC culture supenatant did not change, that of sgp130 mildly decreased, and IL-8 significantly decreased while the positive rate of IL-8RA on bone marrow MNC increased.

METHODS: Observed survival rate (OS) was computed by the Kaplan-Meier method using EGRET statistical software package. Relative survival (RS) which is the ratio of the OS to the expected rate was calculated by using Qidong life table with respect to sex, age and calendar period of observation. RESULTS: The five-year OS for the 5 leading sites of cancers, liver, stomach, lung, oesophagus, and rectum were 1.8%, 11.6%, 3.0%, 3.3%, and 19.9%, respectively. The five-year RS for the 5 sites were 1.9%, 14.0%, 3.6%, 4.2%, and 23.7%, respectively, in which, 1.7%, 14.8%, 3.4%, 4.2%, and 26.0% for males, and 2.7%, 12.7%, 4.1%, 4.0%, and 22.0% for females, respectively. Female patients with breast cancer and cervix cancer had 5-year RS of 54.6% and 33.0%. CONCLUSION: Cancer survival rates for all sites are poor, in which that of the liver is the lowest, while that of the breast, the highest. The survivals of cancers for all sites, especially for breast, cervix, and leukaemia are seen to be lower than those of European countries except for oesophagus, pancreas and lung cancer which do not achieve improved survival both in developing and developed countries.

However, the mechanisms of the different responses to apoptosis in these cell lines remain unclear. We report here that an increase of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) expression was required for antitumor drug-induced apoptosis in WI-38 and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, but not in HL-60 cells. Then, we used BHK cells transfected with the bcl-2 gene to investigate the involvement of complex formation of Bcl-2 and calcineurin. Calcineurin was imported to the nucleus in response to the drug treatment. Overexpression of Bcl-2 and cyclosporin A treatment inhibited the nuclear import and FasL expression, and as a result, both inhibited apoptosis. Although a caspase inhibitor, z-Asp-CH2-DCB, suppressed the drug-induced apoptosis, it failed to inhibit the drug-induced expression of Fas and FasL. These findings suggest that initially the Fas / FasL system is activated by calcineurin-dependent transcription followed by activation of the downstream caspase cascade resulting in antitumor drug-induced apoptosis in BHK cells, but not in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, Bcl-2 inhibits the nuclear import of calcineurin and suppresses calcineurin-mediated FasL expression during antitumor drug-induced apoptosis.","['Simizu, S', 'Shibasaki, F', 'Osada, H']","['Simizu S', 'Shibasaki F', 'Osada H']","['Antibiotics Laboratory, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '151519-02-7 (pironetin)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Aspartic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Calcineurin/metabolism', '*Calcineurin Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Lung/cytology/drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'Pyrones/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/physiology', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",,2000/08/02 11:00,2000/09/19 11:01,['2000/08/02 11:00'],"['2000/08/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/19 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/02 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2000.tb01003.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2000 Jul;91(7):706-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2000.tb01003.x.,,,,,,PMC5926418,,,,,

However, cytogenetic analysis does not always find the translocations and the many partner genes of MLL make molecular detection difficult. We developed cDNA panhandle PCR to identify der(11) transcripts regardless of the partner gene. By reverse transcribing first-strand cDNAs with oligonucleotides containing coding sequence from the 5' MLL breakpoint cluster region at the 5' ends and random hexamers at the 3' ends, known MLL sequence was attached to the unknown partner sequence. This enabled the formation of stem-loop templates with the fusion point of the chimeric transcript in the loop and the use of MLL primers in two-sided PCR. The assay was validated by detection of the known fusion transcript and the transcript from the normal MLL allele in the cell line MV4-11. cDNA panhandle PCR then was used to identify the fusion transcripts in two cases of treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia where the karyotypes were normal and the partner genes unknown. cDNA panhandle PCR revealed a fusion of MLL with AF-10 in one case and a fusion of MLL with ELL in the other. Alternatively spliced transcripts and exon scrambling were detectable by the method. Leukemias with normal karyotypes may contain cryptic translocations of MLL with a variety of partner genes. cDNA panhandle PCR is useful for identifying MLL translocations and determining unknown partner sequences in the fusion transcripts.","['Megonigal, M D', 'Rappaport, E F', 'Wilson, R B', 'Jones, D H', 'Whitlock, J A', 'Ortega, J A', 'Slater, D J', 'Nowell, P C', 'Felix, C A']","['Megonigal MD', 'Rappaport EF', 'Wilson RB', 'Jones DH', 'Whitlock JA', 'Ortega JA', 'Slater DJ', 'Nowell PC', 'Felix CA']","[""Division of Oncology, Joseph Stokes, Jr., Research Institute, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing/genetics', 'Child', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis/chemistry/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Peptide Elongation Factors', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar/genetics', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/genetics', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/02 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/02 11:00'],"['2000/08/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/02 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.150241797 [doi]', '150241797 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Aug 15;97(17):9597-602. doi: 10.1073/pnas.150241797.,"['GENBANK/AF272370', 'GENBANK/AF272371', 'GENBANK/AF272372', 'GENBANK/AF272373', 'GENBANK/AF272374', 'GENBANK/AF272375', 'GENBANK/AF272376', 'GENBANK/AF272377', 'GENBANK/AF272378', 'GENBANK/AF272379', 'GENBANK/AF272380', 'GENBANK/AF272381', 'GENBANK/AF272382', 'GENBANK/AF272383', 'GENBANK/AF272384', 'GENBANK/AF272385']","['CA77683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA080175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC16910,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a population-based study in a cohort of 3,093 women younger than 85 years who resided in the French administrative area of the Cote d'Or, who were given a first diagnosis of primary breast cancer between 1982 and 1996, and who received a curative treatment. Information about therapy and follow-up events was obtained from records of cancer registries that covered this area. RESULTS: Until December 1998, 10 cases of acute leukemia, including nonlymphoid acute leukemia and refractory anemia with excess of blasts, occurred in patients before any local or distant recurrence. All cases developed in the first 4 years of follow-up. Compared with the general female population, the incidence rate of leukemia was significantly increased in women who received radiotherapy and chemotherapy (standardized incidence ratio, 28.5; P <.0001). A dose-dependent increase in the risk of leukemia was observed in women treated with mitoxantrone. Cox regression analysis showed that the risk of leukemia was significantly lower in patients treated with anthracyclines than in those treated with mitoxantrone at cumulative doses >/= 13 mg/m(2). CONCLUSION: The combination of adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy with mitoxantrone induces a high risk of acute leukemia in patients with breast cancer. A leukemogenic effect of chemotherapy with anthracyclines cannot be ruled out with certainty. However, there are some suggestions that these topoisomerase II inhibitors might be less leukemogenic than mitoxantrone and could be preferred in an adjuvant setting.","['Chaplain, G', 'Milan, C', 'Sgro, C', 'Carli, P M', 'Bonithon-Kopp, C']","['Chaplain G', 'Milan C', 'Sgro C', 'Carli PM', 'Bonithon-Kopp C']","[""Registre des Cancers Gynecologiques de Cote d'Or, Faculte de Medecine, Dijon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,['J Clin Oncol. 2001 Feb 15;19(4):1231-3.

Of seven T-cell lines four exhibited capacity to infiltrate Matrigel. Analysis of infiltration was performed at the single-cell level throughout the Matrigel using a depth meter. Further, we examined differences in migration capacity and metalloproteinase production between infiltrating and non-infiltrating T-cell lines. The capacity to infiltrate was not directly correlated to the capacity to adhere to the Matrigel or to migrate on/to extracellular matrix components. It is concluded that infiltration capacity does not simply reflect capacity to migrate but represents a distinct functional property. The production of metalloproteinases and their inhibitors by the separate T-cell lines was analyzed using rt PCR, biosynthetic labelling, zymography, immunoprecipitation and ELISA. All T-cell lines with capacity to infiltrate produced matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) while non-infiltrating cell lines did not express MMP-9. Expression of MMP-1, 2, 3, 10, 14 and 17 showed no correlation to capacity to infiltrate. Analysis of infiltration in the presence of a metalloprotease inhibitor showed an increased number of cells within the gel. This enhancement of infiltration suggests that the function of MMPs and/or their inhibitors in lymphocyte infiltration is more complex than previously thought.","['Ivanoff, A', 'Ivanoff, J', 'Hultenby, K', 'Sundqvist, K G']","['Ivanoff A', 'Ivanoff J', 'Hultenby K', 'Sundqvist KG']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Clin Exp Metastasis,Clinical & experimental metastasis,8409970,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ro 31-9790)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9000-70-8 (Gelatin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (pro-matrix metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,,"['Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Collagenases/metabolism', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gelatin/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Hydroxamic Acids', 'Laminin', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteoglycans', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/enzymology/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/05 11:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1006749304315 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Metastasis. 1999;17(8):695-711. doi: 10.1023/a:1006749304315.,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL expression confers cross-resistance to multiple genotoxic anticancer drugs by inhibition of the apoptotic response to DNA damage in association with cell cycle arrest at the G2-M restriction point. Previous reports indicated that BCR-ABL exerts its antiapoptotic effect against various apoptotic stimuli upstream to the cleavage and activity of caspase-3. Here we show that the adenovirus E1A protein induces substantial apoptosis in BCR-ABL expressing K562 and LAMA-84 leukemia cells. This apoptotic activity of E1A is accompanied by processing of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and can be significantly blocked by z-VAD-fmk Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OCH3)-CH2F and the caspase-3-specific inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK Z-Asp(OCH3)-Glu-Val-Asp(OCH3)-CH2F. Moreover, E1A renders K562 cells, which are particularly resistant to cell death irrespective of the inducing agent, susceptible to induction of apoptosis by the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and daunorubicin. Counteracting the DNA damage-induced inactivation of cdc2 kinase, E1A reverses the drug-induced G2-M arrest These results indicate that solitary delivery of E1A significantly antagonizes BCR-ABL-induced antiapoptotic functions and circumvents the inherent resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis, supporting the use of E1A in combination with chemotherapeutic agents as a promising therapeutic strategy for successful treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia in vivo.","['Stiewe, T', 'Parssanedjad, K', 'Esche, H', 'Opalka, B', 'Putzer, B M']","['Stiewe T', 'Parssanedjad K', 'Esche H', 'Opalka B', 'Putzer BM']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Essen Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Peptides)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Adenovirus E1A Proteins/*metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Plasmids', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/05 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Jul 15;60(14):3957-64.,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present work was to characterize the antigene and antiproliferative activity of a triple helix-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) targeted to a homopurine-homopyrimidine sequence in the P2 promoter of the c-myc gene. The TFO was synthesized with phosphorothioate (PS) internucleotide linkages to confer resistance to intra- and extracellular nucleases. This property is required of oligonucleotides designed for in vivo testing and therapeutic applications. The PS-TFO was found to form triplex DNA with affinity and specificity comparable with that of the corresponding phosphodiester TFO, as shown by gel mobility shift and footprinting assays. Fluorescence microscopy and polyacrylamide gel analysis showed that the fluorescein-labeled PS-TFO accumulated in nuclei of CEM leukemia cells and remained intact for at least 72 h. Incubation of CEM cells with PS-TFO reduced c-myc RNA and protein levels. A single exposure of leukemia cells to the PS-TFO was sufficient to induce dose-dependent growth inhibitory effects. Growth inhibition correlated with accumulation of cells in S phase and with induction of cell death by apoptosis. The PS-TFO was also effective in other leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. Control oligonucleotides had minimal effects in all assays. These data indicate that the c-myc-targeted PS-TFO is an effective antigene and antiproliferative agent, with potential for testing in vivo as a novel approach to cancer therapy.","['McGuffie, E M', 'Pacheco, D', 'Carbone, G M', 'Catapano, C V']","['McGuffie EM', 'Pacheco D', 'Carbone GM', 'Catapano CV']","['Department of Experimental Oncology and Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Contrast Media)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Solvents)', '0 (triplex DNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'TPY09G7XIR (Fluorescein)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Antigens/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Contrast Media/pharmacology', '*DNA', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Exons', 'Fluorescein/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/*immunology', 'RNA/metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Solvents/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/08/05 11:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Jul 15;60(14):3790-9.,,['CA-70735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The risk is due to the failure of the screening tests to detect all the infected blood donations and in particular those which are recently infected in the pre-seroconversion window phase of infection, and the asymptomatic immunosilent chronic carriers who never develop antibodies. Another source of risk relates to variant strains of known viruses that are not detected by the current assays. The last potential risk involves the failure to detect infected blood samples because of inaccurate performances of the test process. In order to reduce this residual risk, the French health authorities requested the progressive introduction of nucleic acid technology (NAT) in blood screening so as to be generalised to all blood centres in the course of year 2000. Multicentric studies are underway to identify the most suitable techniques for the French network.","['Coste, J']",['Coste J'],"['Laboratoire de biologie moleculaire appliquee a la transfusion, EFS Pyrenees-Mediterranee, Montpellier, France.']",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Transfus Clin Biol,Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine,9423846,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis/blood', 'Biological Products/*standards', 'Blood Banks/legislation & jurisprudence/standards', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Transfusion/legislation & jurisprudence/*standards', 'DNA, Viral/*blood', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Feasibility Studies', 'France', '*Genome, Viral', 'HIV/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Hepacivirus/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Mass Screening/legislation & jurisprudence/*methods/standards', 'Pan troglodytes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/*blood', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'Viremia/*diagnosis/prevention & control/transmission/virology', 'Virus Cultivation']",8,2000/08/05 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']","['S1246-7820(00)80010-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s1246-7820(00)80010-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Clin Biol. 2000 Jun;7 Suppl 1:11s-17s. doi: 10.1016/s1246-7820(00)80010-5.,,,Le depistage de genomes viraux en transfusion sanguine.,,,,,,,,

Major viruses transmissible by blood transfusion are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C viruses (respectively HBV, HCV). The prevalence of virological markers in French blood donors has been continuously decreasing since the implementation of serological screening methods as soon as they were available. In 1998, the prevalences (per 10,000 donations) were 0.17 for antibody to HIV, 0.08 for antibody to human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), 2.23 for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) and 2.52 for antibody to HCV. The values are, of course, higher in new donors when compared to regular donors: approximately five-fold for HIV, 50-fold for HCV and 300-fold for HBs Ag. The remaining major questions concern the residual risk due to infectious donations which could escape the preventive measures. It seems evident that the major risk is imputable mainly to donations collected during the window period. During the 1996-1998 period, the residual risk for HIV was 1 out of 1,350,000 donations, 0 for HTLV, 1 out of 375,000 for HCV, and 1 out of 220,000 for HBV. A few cases of ""immunosilent"" patients have been reported. They remain exceptional. The first data collected after the implementation of nucleic acid technology (NAT) confirm the very low residual risk. The recent introduction of leukodepletion probably brought an important contribution to diminishing the risk of transmission of leucotropic viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesviruses-6, -7 and -8, and HTLV. If the purification process of plasma-derived medicinal products including inactivation procedures makes it possible to be confident with the elimination of infectivity due to enveloped viruses, the detection of nucleic acid sequences derived from naked viruses in plasma pools such as parvovirus B19 or hepatitis A virus (HAV), and/or the introduction of a nanofiltration step during the purification process, when possible, may greatly contribute to their safety. The emergence of a new form of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) introduces a new series of questions about the safety of blood products that, although the risks appear limited, are not yet resolved.","['Barin, F']",['Barin F'],"['Unite de virologie transfusionnelle, Institut national de la transfusion sanguine, Paris, France.']",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Transfus Clin Biol,Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine,9423846,['0 (Biological Products)'],IM,,"['Biological Products/*adverse effects', 'Blood Donors', 'France/epidemiology', 'HIV Infections/prevention & control/transmission', 'Hepatitis, Viral, Human/prevention & control/transmission', 'Herpesviridae Infections/prevention & control/transmission', 'Humans', 'Mass Screening', 'Prion Diseases/epidemiology/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Risk Assessment', '*Transfusion Reaction', 'Viremia/diagnosis/prevention & control/transmission', 'Virus Diseases/epidemiology/prevention & control/*transmission']",17,2000/08/05 11:00,2000/09/23 11:01,['2000/08/05 11:00'],"['2000/08/05 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/23 11:01 [medline]', '2000/08/05 11:00 [entrez]']","['S1246-7820(00)80009-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s1246-7820(00)80009-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Clin Biol. 2000 Jun;7 Suppl 1:5s-10s. doi: 10.1016/s1246-7820(00)80009-9.,,,Virus et ATNC: le point sur la transmission par le sang.,,,,,,,,

We observed that CD154 gene transfer induced a marked inhibition of leukemogenicity, and also that CD154 and combination of GM-CSF and CD80 gene transfer protected mice against subsequent challenge with leukemic cells and had a therapeutic effect for a pre-established leukemia disease. We also found minimal residual leukemic disease by RT-PCR for 6 to 12 months in 0 to 25% of animals injected with transduced leukemic cells and surviving the challenge without evidence of disease, except in the control empty plasmid group where very few mice survived the challenge but all of those were positive by RT-PCR.

We investigated whether the subtraction of NF-kappa B/Rel activity influenced the response of 11 AML (M1, M2 and M4) patients' cells to AraC. To this end we used a phosphorothioate double-stranded decoy oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) carrying the NF-kappa B/Rel- consensus sequence. Cell incubation with this ODN, but not its mutated (scrambled) form used as a control, resulted in abating the NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear levels in these cells, as verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) of cells' nuclear extracts. We incubated the leukemic cells with AraC (32 or 1 microM), in either the absence or presence of the decoy or the scrambled ODN, and analyzed cell apoptosis. The spontaneous cell apoptosis detectable in the absence of AraC (<25%) was not modulated by the oligonucleotide presence in cell cultures. On the other hand, in 10 of the 11 samples tested, the decoy kappa B, but not the scrambled ODN significantly (P < 0.01 in a Student's t test) enhanced cell apoptotic response to AraC. Such an effect was particularly remarkable at low AraC doses (1 microM).

The typical MDR phenotype is due to the overexpression of membrane proteins among which the main representative is P-glycoprotein (Pgp) encoded by the MDR1 gene. Many attempts to modulate MDR by chemosensitizers have been unsuccessful in human therapy due to their intrinsic toxic effects. In an effort to modulate the MDR phenotype efficiently we designed an antisense and a transcriptional decoy strategy targeting the TATA-less human MDR1 gene promoter. The choice of the start point of transcription in a multiple start site window is related to an upstream MED-1 cis-element, the sequence and configuration of which are specific to human MDR1 gene expressed in Pgp-overproducing cancer cells. A 12mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) and a 12mer double-stranded ODN, both containing the MED-1 sequence, were designed and efficiently vectorized into the nucleus with the chimerical MPG peptide. A synthetic cellular model (NIH-EGFP) and highly resistant human CEM/VLB0.45 leukemia cells, significantly responded to transfection with the ODN/MPG complex. The level of EGFP fluorescence in NIH-EGFP cells decreased, and thus its production, and viability of CEM/VLB0.45 cells decreased by 63% in the presence of vinblastine, revealing that their resistance to the anticancer drug was reversed. These results open new insights into transcriptional decoy and anti-gene therapies of MDR cancers that overproduce Pgp.

CLL B cells were found to express high levels of herpes virus entry mediator (Hve) A, but not HveC, the other known receptor for HSV-1. An HveA cDNA from CLL cells was found to encode Arg-->Lys and Val-->Iso substitutions at amino acids 17 and 241, respectively. Nevertheless, this cDNA encoded a functional receptor for HSV-1 when transfected into Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells. Antibodies to HveA could block rdHSV-1 infection of CLL cells and HveA-transfected CHO cells with similar efficiencies in vitro. In contrast to B cells of normal donors, CLL B cells were resistant to the cytopathic effects of infection by rdHSV-1 and maintained high-level expression of the transgene for several days in vitro. We propose that this is due to the expression by CLL cells of the anti-apoptotic protein, bcl-2. Consistent with this, we found that transduction of HeLa cells with a retrovirus expression vector encoding bcl-2 rendered HeLa cells resistant to the cytopathic effects of rdHSV-1.

The first viral vector approved for human clinical trials was murine leukemia virus (MLV), which remains the most commonly used vector in clinical trials to date. However, the application of MLV vectors is limited since MLV requires cells to be actively dividing in order for transduction and therefore gene delivery to occur. This limitation precludes the use of MLV for delivering genes to the adult CNS, where very little cell division is occurring. However, we speculated that this inherent limitation of ML V may be overcome by utilizing the known mitogenic effect of growth factors on cells of the CNS. Specifically, an in vivo application of growth factor to the adult brain, if able to induce cell division, could enhance MLV-based gene transfer to the adult brain. We now show that an exogenous application of basic fibroblast growth factor induces cell division in vivo.

One hundred and forty-eight patients were examined, 96 undergoing allogeneic grafting and 52 autologous. Fifty patients had CML, 48 AML, 21 ALL, 18 multiple myeloma and 11 breast cancer. The second RVG examination was performed 22 to 227 days (median 60 days) after HSCT. The mean LVEF value in the whole patient group was 60.2% (range 39-81%) before and 61.1% (35-86%) after transplantation. Patients with CML had significantly higher LVEF before transplantation than patients with acute leukemia (P = 0.007) and multiple myeloma (P = 0.005). No significant changes in mean LVEF between the pre- and post-transplant measurements were seen in any of the diagnostic subgroups or in allogeneic or autologous recipients. None of the 148 patients in the study has shown any signs of clinical heart failure at 2, 5 to 10 years follow-up. Patients who had received anthracyclines in the previous treatment had significantly lower LVEF before transplantation but showed no increased risk of decline in cardiac function.

Seven patients (50%) relapsed in the bone marrow only; three (21%) relapsed in extramedullary sites only; and four (29%) relapsed in both extramedullary sites and bone marrow. Times to relapses in bone marrow only (median 6.3 months) were significantly shorter when compared to times to extramedullary relapses with or without bone marrow involvement (median 12.3 months, P = 0.048). Sites of extramedullary relapses varied widely among the patients. In conclusion, we observed a high frequency of extramedullary relapses of acute leukemia after allogeneic BMT (50%).
