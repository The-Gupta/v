Blood samples from 255 cats with symptoms compatible with FIV or FeLV infection, collected between 2009 and 2013 were analyzed by serology (immunochromatography, IA) and by hemi-nested PCR (n-PCR). The IA and n-PCR assays showed similar percentages of positivity for FIV while the n-PCR test was more sensitive for FeLV. Differences between the diagnostic tests and their choice according to the age of the animal are discussed. The clinical histories of ninety of the 255 cats showed blood profiles similar to others previously reported and revealed a higher risk of infection in male adult cats with outdoor access.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Asociacion Argentina de Microbiologia.

Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells encapsulated in alginate/graphene oxide hydrogel were immobilized on a gold electrode, while mast cells as recognition elements were cultured in a 3D cell culture system. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to record the cell impedance signal as-influenced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing molecule, N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL). The results indicated that cellular activities such as cell viability, apoptosis, intracellular calcium, and degranulation were markedly influenced by the AHLs. Importantly, the exposure of 3OC12-HSL to mast cells induced a marked decrease in the electrochemical impedance signal in a dose-dependent manner. The detection limit for 3OC12-HSL was 0.034muM with a linear range of 0.1-1muM. These results were confirmed via conventional cell assay and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis. Altogether, the proposed method appears to be an innovative and effective approach to the quantitative measurement of Gram-negative bacterial quorum signaling molecules; to this effect, it also may serve as a primary evaluation of the cytotoxicity of food-borne pathogens.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Compared to the general population AYAs have a 5 to 15-fold increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity. Thus, improving modifiable lifestyle risk factors is of particular importance. METHODS: The INAYA trial included AYAs between 18 and 39 years receiving an intensified individual nutrition counseling at four time points in a 3-month period based on a 3-day dietary record. At week 0 and 12 AYAs got a face-to-face counseling, at week 2 and 6 by telephone. Primary endpoint was change in nutritional behavior measured by Healthy Eating Index - European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (HEI-EPIC). RESULTS: Twenty-three AYAs (11 female, 12 male, median age 20 years (range 19-23 years), median BMI: 21.4 kg/m(2) (range: 19.7-23.9 kg/m(2)) after completion of cancer treatment for sarcoma (n = 2), carcinoma (n = 2), blastoma (n = 1), hodgkin lymphoma (n = 12), or leukemia (n = 6) were included (median time between diagnosis and study inclusion was 44 month). The primary endpoint was met, with an improvement of 20 points in HEI-EPIC score in 52.2 % (n = 12) of AYAs. At baseline, median HEI-EPIC score was 47.0 points (range from 40.0 to 55.0 points) and a good, moderate and bad nutritional intake was seen in 4.3, 73.9 and 21.7 % of AYAs. At week 12, median HEI-EPIC improved significantly to 65.0 points (range from 55.0 to 76.0 points) (p </= 0.001) and a good, moderate and bad nutritional intake was seen in 47.8, 52.2 and 0 % of AYAs. No change was seen in quality of life, waist-hip ratio and blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Intensified nutrition counseling is feasible and seem to improve nutritional behavior of AYAs. Further studies will be required to demonstrate long-term sustainability and confirm the results in a randomized design in larger cohorts.

Aberrant expression of miR-451 has been reported to participate in anticancer drug resistance. However, the role of miR-451 in imatinib resistance has not been investigated. The present study was undertaken to determine the expression of miR-451 in order to find a possible association between the expression of this miRNA and imatinib resistance in Tunisian CML patients. METHODS: First, real-time RT-PCR was performed to identify the expression of miR-451 in peripheral leukocytes of 59 CML patients treated with imatinib. Then, bioinformatics analysis was carried out to understand the regulatory roles of miR-451 in imatinib-resistant process. RESULTS: Downregulated miR-451 was observed in imatinib-resistant CML cases. In silico analysis identified MYC as a potential target of miR-451. We further revealed the existence of an MYC-binding site in MiR-451 promoter region. On the other hand, increased level of MYC was detected in imatinib-resistant CML cases which may explain the causative role of MYC in CML cases and the downregulation of miR-451. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-451 and MYC form together a regulatory loop which may act as a potential therapeutic target, and disruption of suggested regulatory loop could help to improve CML therapy.",,"['Soltani, Ismael', 'Douzi, Kais', 'Gharbi, Hanen', 'Benhassine, Islem', 'Teber, Mouheb', 'Amouri, Hassiba', 'Ben Hadj Othman, Hind', 'Farrah, Ahlem', 'Ben Lakhel, Raihane', 'Abbes, Salem', 'Menif, Samia']","['Soltani I', 'Douzi K', 'Gharbi H', 'Benhassine I', 'Teber M', 'Amouri H', 'Ben Hadj Othman H', 'Farrah A', 'Ben Lakhel R', 'Abbes S', 'Menif S']","['a Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory , Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory , Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory , Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory , Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory , Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory , Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory , Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory , Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'b Aziza Othmana Hospital , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory , Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.', 'a Molecular and Cellular Hematology Laboratory , Institut Pasteur de Tunis, Universite Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161109,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN451 microRNA, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Computational Biology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tunisia']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'MYC', 'imatinib mesylate', 'miR-451', 'resistance']",2016/11/09 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2016/11/10 06:00'],"['2016/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2016.1252020 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2017 May;22(4):201-207. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2016.1252020.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) can act as a modulator for glial gene expression. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a critical regulator of reactive astrogliosis. The present study tested whether endogenous LIF acted on ICH-induced reactive astrogliosis via the STAT3 signaling pathway. Rats were divided into three experimental groups: 1) Rats received either an ICH or a needle insertion (sham), 2) Rats received 100 ng LIF or an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by direct infusion into the lateral ventricle (LV) after ICH, and 3) AG490 (0.25 mg/kg) was injected into the LV to block STAT3 signaling. Brains were perfused to identify proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)(+)/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)(+)nuclei. The expression of GFAP, LIF, LIF receptor (LIFR), glycoprotein 130 (gp130), and phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot, respectively. After ICH, the number of the PCNA(+)/GFAP(+) nuclei and the expression of GFAP, LIF, LIFR, gp130, and p-STAT3 were increased. Moreover, LIF increased the number of PCNA(+)/GFAP(+) nuclei and the expression of GFAP, LIFR, gp130, and p-STAT3. The number of PCNA(+)/ GFAP(+) nuclei and GFAP protein levels were attenuated markedly after inhibition of p-STAT3.

Triplebody SPM-1 was designed for lysis of CD19-bearing malignant B-lymphoid cells through the engagement of CD16-expressing cytolytic effectors, including NK and gammadelta T cells.SPM-1 is an optimized version of triplebody ds(19-16-19) and includes humanization, disulfide stabilization and the removal of potentially immunogenic sequences. A three-step chromatographic procedure yielded 1.7 - 5.5 mg of purified, monomeric protein per liter of culture medium. In cytolysis assays with NK cell effectors, SPM-1 mediated potent lysis of cancer-derived B cell lines and primary cells from patients with various B-lymphoid malignancies, which surpassed the ADCC activity of the therapeutic antibody Rituximab. EC50-values ranged from 3 to 86 pM. Finally, in an impedance-based assay, SPM-1 mediated a particularly rapid lysis of CD19-bearing target cells by engaging and activating both primary and expanded human gammadelta T cells from healthy donors as effectors.These data establish SPM-1 as a useful tool for a kinetic analysis of the cytolytic reactions mediated by gammadelta T and NK cells and as an agent deserving further development towards clinical use for the treatment of B-lymphoid malignancies.",,"['Schiller, Christian B', 'Braciak, Todd A', 'Fenn, Nadja C', 'Seidel, Ursula J E', 'Roskopf, Claudia C', 'Wildenhain, Sarah', 'Honegger, Annemarie', 'Schubert, Ingo A', 'Schele, Alexandra', 'Lammermann, Kerstin', 'Fey, Georg H', 'Jacob, Uwe', 'Lang, Peter', 'Hopfner, Karl-Peter', 'Oduncu, Fuat S']","['Schiller CB', 'Braciak TA', 'Fenn NC', 'Seidel UJ', 'Roskopf CC', 'Wildenhain S', 'Honegger A', 'Schubert IA', 'Schele A', 'Lammermann K', 'Fey GH', 'Jacob U', 'Lang P', 'Hopfner KP', 'Oduncu FS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Gene Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Gene Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', ""Department of General Paediatrics, Oncology/Haematology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Gene Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Gene Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Westend-Innovation, Munich, Germany.', 'Westend-Innovation, Munich, Germany.', ""Department of General Paediatrics, Oncology/Haematology, University Children's Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Gene Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Intraepithelial Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Rituximab/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity', 'gamma delta T cell', 'immunotherapy', 'leukemia', 'single chain triplebody']",2016/11/09 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2016/11/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['13110 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.13110 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Dec 13;7(50):83392-83408. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.13110.,,,PMC5347777,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sphingolipid dysregulation through decreased ceramide levels and elevated sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) promotes cancer cell growth and survival. Acid ceramidase (AC) catalyzes ceramide breakdown to sphingosine, the precursor for S1P. We report for the first time that AC is required for AML blast survival. Transcriptome analysis and enzymatic assay show that primary AML cells have high levels of AC expression and activity. Treatment of patient samples and cell lines with AC inhibitor LCL204 reduced viability and induced apoptosis. AC overexpression increased the expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, significantly increased S1P and decreased ceramide. Conversely, LCL204 induced ceramide accumulation and decreased Mcl-1 through post-translational mechanisms. LCL204 treatment significantly increased overall survival of C57BL/6 mice engrafted with leukemic C1498 cells and significantly decreased leukemic burden in NSG mice engrafted with primary human AML cells. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that AC plays a critical role in AML survival through regulation of both sphingolipid levels and Mcl-1.

The prognostic impact of the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) and for chromosomal translocations was assessed in 751 patients from the Korea MDS Registry. IPSS-R effectively discriminated patients according to leukaemia evolution risk and OS. We identified 40 patients (5.3%) carrying translocations, 30 (75%) of whom also fulfilled complex karyotype criteria. Translocation presence was associated with a shorter OS (median, 12.0 versus 79.7 months, P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that translocations (hazard ratio [HR] 1.64 [1.06-2.63]; P = 0.03) as well as age, sex, IPSS-R, and CK were independent predictors of OS. In the IPSS-R high and very high risk subgroup (n = 260), translocations remained independently associated with OS (HR 1.68 [1.06-2.69], P = 0.03) whereas HMA treatment was not associated with improved survival (median OS, 20.9 versus 21.2 months, P = 0.43). However, translocation carriers exhibited enhanced survival following HMA treatment (median 2.1 versus 12.4 months, P = 0.03).

Smoking as an important source of toxic chemicals may contribute to the developmental origin of diseases. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to pursue the possible association between maternal smoking and cancer in early life. Specifically, we wanted to identify the associated early life cancer types, and to quantify the associations. METHODS: In a systematic literature search 825 articles were identified in PubMed and Web of Science, and 55 more through the reference lists. Of these 62 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in meta-analyses. Using Mantel-Haenszel or DerSimonian and Laird method, depending on heterogeneity of the studies, pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals for eight cancer types were calculated. RESULTS: Smoking during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for for brain and central nervous system tumors (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02-1.17). Although the risk for lymphoma was also associated (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.05-1.34), it did not hold up in subgroup analyses. Leukemia was not found to be associated with maternal smoking. Five other cancer types (bone, soft tissue, renal, hepatic, and germ cell cancer) were also examined, but the number of studies was too limited to exclude the possibility of maternal smoking as a risk factor for cancer in offspring. CONCLUSIONS: According to our meta-analyses, maternal smoking is associated with nervous system cancers, but not with leukemia in early life. Confirming or rejecting associations of maternal smoking with lymphoma and the five other cancer types requires further studies.",,"['Rumrich, Isabell Katharina', 'Viluksela, Matti', 'Vahakangas, Kirsi', 'Gissler, Mika', 'Surcel, Helja-Marja', 'Hanninen, Otto']","['Rumrich IK', 'Viluksela M', 'Vahakangas K', 'Gissler M', 'Surcel HM', 'Hanninen O']","['Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Health Protection, National Institute of Health and Welfare, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Environmental and Biological Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Health Protection, National Institute of Health and Welfare, Kuopio, Finland.', 'School of Pharmacy/Toxicology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio Finland.', 'Department of Information Services, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland and Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Division of Family Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Health Protection, National Institute of Health and Welfare, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Health Protection, National Institute of Health and Welfare, Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20161108,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Life', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects']",,,2016/11/09 06:00,2017/06/28 06:00,['2016/11/09 06:00'],"['2016/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0165040 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-13568 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Nov 8;11(11):e0165040. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0165040. eCollection 2016.,,,PMC5100920,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we investigated the molecular mechanism, including the potential regulator and signaling pathways, of MYOCD, which is the gene that in humans encodes the protein myocardin. MATERIAL AND METHODS We searched the online miRNA database (www.mirdb.org) with the ""seed sequence"" located within the 3'-UTR of the target gene, and then validated MYOCD to be the direct gene via luciferase reporter assay system, and further confirmed it in cultured cells by using Western blot analysis and realtime PCR. RESULTS We established the negative regulatory relationship between miR-9 and MYOCD via studying the relative luciferase activity. We also conducted realtime PCR and Western blot analysis to study the mRNA and protein expression level of MYOCD between different groups (intracranial aneurysm vs. normal control) or cells treated with scramble control, miR-9 mimics, MYOCD siRNA, and miR-9 inhibitors, indicating the negative regulatory relationship between miR-9 and MYOCD. We also investigated the relative viability of smooth muscle cells when transfected with scramble control, miR-9 mimics, MYOCD siRNA, and miR-9 inhibitors to validate that miR-9 t negatively interferes with the viability of smooth muscle cells. We then investigated the relative contractility of smooth muscle cells when transfected with scramble control, miR-9 mimics, MYOCD siRNA, and miR-9 inhibitors, and the results showed that miR-9 weakened contractility.

Case details A 57-year-old male was admitted for the management of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and ongoing pulmonary aspergillosis. While continuing on posaconazole tablet 300 mg daily, he received a course of salvage chemotherapy. The initial steady state posaconazole trough level was therapeutic at 0.84 mg/L (target >0.70 mg/L). However, after five days, the level had dropped to 0.40 mg/L, coinciding with hyperbilirubinemia and hypoalbuminemia. Bilirubin level peaked at 36 microm/L (normal high <20 microm/L), albumin levels were consistently low, averaging at 25 g/L (range 33-46 g/L). The patient had been compliant and there were no underlying gastrointestinal conditions identified which might have potentially affected posaconazole absorption. Outcome An increase in posaconazole dose failed to achieve target levels and treatment was changed to voriconazole. However, levels were surprisingly supra-therapeutic, resulting in side effects and substantial dose reduction was required. Conclusion Failure to achieve target posaconazole levels despite increased dosing may be attributed to factors other than impaired oral absorption. Enhanced metabolism and clearance could be associated with hypoalbuminemia and hyperbilirubinemia.

Chromosomal aberrations were identified by array-comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) and multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (mFISH). Fifteen ATP-binding cassette transporters and numerous new genes were overexpressed in CEM/ADR5000 cells. The basic karyotype in CCRF-CEM cells consisted of 47, XX, der(5)t(5;14) (q35.33;q32.3), del(9) (p14.1), +20. CEM/ADR5000 cells acquired additional aberrations, including X-chromosome loss, 4q and 14q deletion, chromosome 7 inversion, balanced and unbalanced two and three way translocations: t(3;10), der(3)t(3;13), der(5)t(18;5;14), t(10;16), der(18)t(7;18), der(18)t(21;18;5), der(21;21;18;5) and der(22)t(9;22). CCRF-CEM consisted of two and CEM/ADR5000 of five major sub-clones, indicating genetic tumor heterogeneity. Loss of 3q27.1 in CEM/ADR5000 caused down-regulation of ABCC5 and ABCF3 expression, Xq28 loss down-regulated ABCD1 expression. ABCB1, the most well-known MDR gene, was 448-fold up-regulated due to 7q21.12 amplification. In addition to well-known drug resistance genes, numerous novel genes and genomic aberrations were identified.

Alternative therapeutic strategies to override imatinib-resistant CML are urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the effect of AKI603, a novel small molecule inhibitor of Aurora kinase A (AurA) to overcome resistance mediated by BCR-ABL-T315I mutation. Our results showed that AKI603 exhibited strong anti-proliferative activity in leukemic cells. AKI603 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation capacities in imatinib-resistant CML cells by inducing cell cycle arrest with polyploidy accumulation. Surprisingly, inhibition of AurA by AKI603 induced leukemia cell senescence in both BCR-ABL wild type and T315I mutation cells. Furthermore, the induction of senescence was associated with enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Moreover, the anti-tumor effect of AKI603 was proved in the BALB/c nude mice KBM5-T315I xenograft model.

However, bacterial enzymes are susceptible to induce immune responses, leading to a high incidence of adverse effects compromising the effectiveness of the treatment. Therefore, alternative sources of L-ASNase may be useful to reduce toxicity and enhance efficacy. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has the ASP1 gene responsible for encoding L-asparaginase 1 (ScASNase1), an enzyme predicted as type II, like bacterial therapeutic isoforms, but it has been poorly studied.

It is true that the clonal B-cell/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements have been identified in rare cases of histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms, such as those with or following lymphoma/leukemia or in some sporadic histiocytic/dendritic cell sarcomas, but the clonal features of such group of tumor are still not clear. Here we investigated the clonal status of 33 samples including Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), Langerhans cell sarcoma (LCS), follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS), interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma (IDCS) and histiocytic sarcoma (HS). Among them, twenty-eight cases were sporadic without current or past lymphoma/leukemia. Three cases were found with a past history of T-cell lymphoma, one case was followed by extraosseous plasmacytoma, and one case was found with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Our results showed that there was a high frequency of clonal IG and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in these cases. Notably, 4 cases of LCH and 2 cases of FDCS showed both B and T cell receptor gene rearrangements concurrently. One case of FDCS synchronous with DLBCL showed identical clonal IGH in both tumor populations and clonal TCRbeta in FDCS alone. No matter if the presence of clonal receptor gene rearrangements was associated with the tumor origin or tumorigenesis, it might serve as a novel tumor marker for developing target therapy.",,"['Huang, Wenting', 'Qiu, Tian', 'Zeng, Linshu', 'Zheng, Bo', 'Ying, Jianming', 'Feng, Xiaoli']","['Huang W', 'Qiu T', 'Zeng L', 'Zheng B', 'Ying J', 'Feng X']","['Department of Pathology, National Cancer Center, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pathology, National Cancer Center, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pathology, National Cancer Center, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pathology, National Cancer Center, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pathology, National Cancer Center, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pathology, National Cancer Center, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Dendritic Cell Sarcoma, Follicular/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Dendritic Cell Sarcoma, Interdigitating/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Histiocytic Disorders, Malignant/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Langerhans Cell Sarcoma/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Langerhans cell histiocytosis', 'Langerhans cell sarcoma', 'Pathology Section', 'follicular dendritic cell sarcoma', 'histiocytic sarcoma', 'interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma']",2016/11/09 06:00,2018/02/21 06:00,['2016/11/09 06:00'],"['2016/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['13058 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.13058 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 29;7(48):78355-78362. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.13058.,,,PMC5346644,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there is evidence that daily doses of CS can have neuropsychological effects, few studies have investigated the role of cumulative doses of CS in short- and long-term neuropsychological effects in cALL. The aims of this review were to identify the measures used for documenting adverse neuropsychological effects (ANEs) of CS treatment and to study the association between cumulative doses of CS and the presence of ANEs. Twenty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. A variety of measures were used to evaluate outcomes in the domains of emotion, behaviour, neurocognition, and fatigue/sleep. The results suggest that we cannot conclude in favour of an association between the cumulative dosage of CS and ANEs. Yet, several factors including the heterogeneity of measures used to evaluate outcomes and reporting biases may limit the scope of the results. We offer several recommendations that could help improve the future published evidence on ANEs in relation to CS treatment in cALL.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Nowadays the morphological analysis of blood cells is operated manually by skilled operators, which results in some drawbacks such as slowness of the analysis, a non-standard accuracy, and the dependence on the operator's skills. Although there have been many papers studying the detection of WBCs or classification of WBCs independently, few papers consider them together. This paper proposes an automatic detection and classification system for WBCs from peripheral blood images. It firstly proposes an algorithm to detect WBCs from the microscope images based on the simple relation of colors R, B and morphological operation. Then a granularity feature (pairwise rotation invariant co-occurrence local binary pattern, PRICoLBP feature) and SVM are applied to classify eosinophil and basophil from other WBCs firstly. Lastly, convolution neural networks are used to extract features in high level from WBCs automatically, and a random forest is applied to these features to recognize the other three kinds of WBCs: neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte. Some detection experiments on Cellavison database and ALL-IDB database show that our proposed detection method has better effect almost than iterative threshold method with less cost time, and some classification experiments show that our proposed classification method has better accuracy almost than some other methods.",,"['Zhao, Jianwei', 'Zhang, Minshu', 'Zhou, Zhenghua', 'Chu, Jianjun', 'Cao, Feilong']","['Zhao J', 'Zhang M', 'Zhou Z', 'Chu J', 'Cao F']","[""Department of Applied Mathematics, College of Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Applied Mathematics, College of Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Applied Mathematics, College of Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Jiashan Jasdaq Medical Device Co., Ltd., Jiashan, 314100, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Applied Mathematics, College of Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. feilongcao@gmail.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161107,United States,Med Biol Eng Comput,Medical & biological engineering & computing,7704869,,IM,,"['Algorithms', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Leukocytes/*pathology', 'Machine Learning', 'Microscopy/*methods', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",['NOTNLM'],"['Classification', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Detection', 'Random forest', 'White blood cell']",2016/11/09 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2016/11/09 06:00'],"['2016/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11517-016-1590-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11517-016-1590-x [pii]']",ppublish,Med Biol Eng Comput. 2017 Aug;55(8):1287-1301. doi: 10.1007/s11517-016-1590-x.

Initial proof of the existence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) was accomplished by functional studies in xenograft models making use of the key features shared with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) such as the capacity of self-renewal and the ability to initiate and sustain growth of progenitors in vivo. Significant progress has also been made in identifying the phenotype and signaling pathways specific for LSCs. Therapeutically, a multitude of drugs targeting LSCs are in different phases of preclinical and clinical development. This review focuses on recent discoveries which have advanced our understanding of LSC biology and provided rational targets for development of novel therapeutic agents. One of the major challenges is how to target the self-renewal pathways of LSCs without affecting normal HSCs significantly therefore providing an acceptable therapeutic window.

RESULTS: The task of discriminating true chRNAs from the false ones poses an interesting Machine Learning (ML) challenge. First of all, the sequencing data may contain false reads due to technical artifacts and during the analysis process, bioinformatics tools may generate false positives due to methodological biases. Moreover, if we succeed to have a proper set of observations (enough sequencing data) about true chRNAs, chances are that the devised model can not be able to generalize beyond it. Like any other machine learning problem, the first big issue is finding the good data to build models. As far as we were concerned, there is no common benchmark data available for chRNAs detection. The definition of a classification baseline is lacking in the related literature too. In this work we are moving towards benchmark data and an evaluation of the fidelity of supervised classifiers in the prediction of chRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a modelization strategy that can be used to increase the tools performances in context of chRNA classification based on a simulated data generator, that permit to continuously integrate new complex chimeric events. The pipeline incorporated a genome mutation process and simulated RNA-seq data. The reads within distinct depth were aligned and analysed by CRAC that integrates genomic location and local coverage, allowing biological predictions at the read scale. Additionally, these reads were functionally annotated and aggregated to form chRNAs events, making it possible to evaluate ML methods (classifiers) performance in both levels of reads and events. Ensemble learning strategies demonstrated to be more robust to this classification problem, providing an average AUC performance of 95 % (ACC=94 %, Kappa=0.87 %). The resulting classification models were also tested on real RNA-seq data from a set of twenty-seven patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).",,"['Beaumeunier, Sacha', 'Audoux, Jerome', 'Boureux, Anthony', 'Ruffle, Florence', 'Commes, Therese', 'Philippe, Nicolas', 'Alves, Ronnie']","['Beaumeunier S', 'Audoux J', 'Boureux A', 'Ruffle F', 'Commes T', 'Philippe N', 'Alves R']","['Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France ; Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France ; Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France ; Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France ; Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France ; Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France ; Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', ""Institut de Medecine Regeneratrice et de Biotherapie, INSERM U1183, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France ; Institut de Biologie Computationnelle, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France ; Laboratoire d'Informatique, de Robotique et de Microelectronique de Montpellier, Universite Montpellier, UMR 5506 CNRS, Montpellier, France ; PPGCC, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem, Brazil ; Instituto Tecnologico Vale, Belem, Brazil.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161102,England,BioData Min,BioData mining,101319161,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chimeric RNAs', 'Classification', 'Data simulation', 'Ensemble learning', 'Transcriptomics']",2016/11/09 06:00,2016/11/09 06:01,['2016/11/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13040-016-0112-6 [doi]', '112 [pii]']",epublish,BioData Min. 2016 Nov 2;9:34. doi: 10.1186/s13040-016-0112-6. eCollection 2016.,,,PMC5090896,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is one of hemocyanins and has many years of experience for vaccine developments and immunological studies in mammals including human. However, the association between KLH and the immune systems, especially the innate immune systems, remains poorly understood. The aim of this study is to clarify the direct effects of KLH on the innate immune systems. KLH activated an inflammation-related transcription factor NF-kappaB as much as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a human monocytic leukemia THP-1 reporter cell line. We have found that the KLH-induced NF-kappaB activation is partially involved in a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) pathway. We have also successfully revealed that an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), a member of mitogen-activated protein kinases, is located in an upstream of NF-kappaB activation induced by KLH. Furthermore, a Syk phosphorylation inhibitor partially suppressed the Erk activation in KLH-stimulated THP-1. These results suggest that both Syk and Erk associate with the KLH-induced NF-kappaB activation in the human monocyte.",,"['Yasuda, Kyoko', 'Ushio, Hideki']","['Yasuda K', 'Ushio H']","['Laboratory of Marine Biochemistry, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo.', 'Laboratory of Marine Biochemistry, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160803,Germany,EXCLI J,EXCLI journal,101299402,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Erk', 'NF-kappaB', 'Syk', 'innate immunity', 'keyhole limpet hemocyanin']",2016/11/09 06:00,2016/11/09 06:01,['2016/11/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.17179/excli2016-488 [doi]', '2016-488 [pii]', 'Doc474 [pii]']",epublish,EXCLI J. 2016 Aug 3;15:474-481. doi: 10.17179/excli2016-488. eCollection 2016.,,,PMC5083961,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since these pre-processed and reduced features are still high dimensional, the proposed MOBPSO algorithm is used for finding further feature subsets. The objective functions are suitably modeled by optimizing two conflicting objectives i.e., cardinality of feature subsets and distinctive capability of those selected subsets. As these two objective functions are conflicting in nature, they are more suitable for multi-objective modeling. The experiments are carried out on benchmark gene expression datasets, i.e., Colon, Lymphoma and Leukaemia available in literature.

The primary aim of the registry is to assure quality of diagnosis and care of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in Denmark. Secondarily, to evaluate adherence to national guidelines and to provide source data for research purposes. STUDY POPULATION: All patients diagnosed with CLL in Denmark from 2008 onward are included in the registry. Patients are followed in one of nine hematology centers. All centers participate in the registry and are all obliged to collect data. MAIN VARIABLES: Predefined data are collected at the time of diagnosis, and follow-up at the time of significant events: treatment, progression, transplantation, and death. Parameters included in the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia criteria for diagnosis, and for decision on treatment initiation as well as characteristics included in the CLL International Prognostic Index are collected. DESCRIPTIVE DATA: To ensure full coverage of Danish CLL patients in the registry, both continuous queries in case of missing data, and cross-referencing with the Danish National Patient Registry are performed. Data from the registry are published in an annual report summarizing the collected data, the overall survival for yearly cohorts, and the degree of data coverage. Per year approximately 450 new patients with CLL are registered in the registry, cumulative as of July 1, 2015, 3,082 patients have been registered. CONCLUSION: The Danish National CLL Registry is based within the Danish National Hematology Database. The registry covers a cohort of all patients diagnosed with CLL in Denmark since 2008.

It includes adult AML patients diagnosed in Denmark since 2000, ALL patients diagnosed since 2005, and MDS patients diagnosed since 2010. The coverage of leukemia patients exceeds 99%, and the coverage of MDS patients is currently 90%. MAIN VARIABLES AND DESCRIPTIVE DATA: Approximately, 250 AML patients, 25 ALL patients, and 230 MDS patients are registered in the DNLR every year. In January 2015, the registry included detailed patient characteristics, disease characteristics, treatment characteristics, and outcome data on more than 3,500 AML, 300 ALL, and 1,100 MDS patients. Many of the included prognostic variables have been found to be of high quality including positive predictive values and completeness exceeding 90%. These variables have been used in prognostic observational studies in the last few years. To ensure this high coverage, completeness, and quality of data, linkage to the Danish Civil Registration System and the Danish National Registry of Patients, and several programmed data entry checks are used.

Chromosome 8 abnormalities, namely losses of 8p (8p-) and gains of 8q (8q+) have been suggested to aggravate the outcome of patients with TP53abs. However, the reported series were small, thus hindering definitive conclusions. To gain insight into this issue, we assessed a series of 101 CLL patients harboring TP53 disruption. The frequency of 8p- and 8q+ was 14.7% and 17.8% respectively. Both were associated with a significantly (P < 0.05) higher incidence of a complex karyotype (CK, >/=3 abnormalities) detected by chromosome banding analysis (CBA) compared to cases with normal 8p (N-8p) and 8q (N-8q), respectively. In univariate analysis for 10-year overall survival (OS), 8p- (P = 0.002), 8q+ (P = 0.012) and CK (P = 0.009) were associated with shorter OS. However, in multivariate analysis only CK (HR = 2.47, P = 0.027) maintained independent significance, being associated with a dismal outcome regardless of chromosome 8 abnormalities.

Irrespective of age, the ABL1 fusion genes are markers of poor prognosis and amplification of the NUP214-ABL1 oncogene can be detected mainly in patients with T-ALL. T cell malignancies harboring the ABL1 fusion genes are sensitive to many cytotoxic agents, but up to date complete remissions have not been achieved. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is often activated in leukemias and plays a crucial role in leukemogenesis.We analyzed the effects of three BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), alone and in combination with a panel of selective PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, on three NUP214-ABL1 positive T-ALL cell lines that also displayed PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation. Cells were sensitive to anti BCR-ABL1 TKIs Imatinib, Nilotinib and GZD824, that specifically targeted the ABL1 fusion protein, but not the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis. Four drugs against the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade, GSK690693, NVP-BGT226, ZSTK474 and Torin-2, showed marked cytotoxic effects on T-leukemic cells, without affecting the NUP214-ABL1 kinase and related pathway. Dephosphorylation of pAkt and pS6 showed the cytotoxicity of these compounds.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor TS levels were prospectively evaluated in two adjuvant therapy trials for patients with resected stage II or III colon cancer. TS expression was determined by standard immunohistochemistry and by automated quantitative analysis. Tumor mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-D) and BRAF c.1799T > A (p.V600E) mutation status were also examined. Relationships between tumor TS, MMR-D, and BRAF mutation status, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were investigated in the subset of stage III patients. RESULTS: Patients whose tumors demonstrated high TS expression experienced better treatment outcomes, with DFS hazard ratio (HR) = 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53, 0.84; and OS HR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.53, 0.88, for high versus low TS expression, respectively. No significant interaction between TS expression and stage was observed (DFS: interaction HR = 0.94; OS: interaction HR = 0.94). Tumors with high TS expression were more likely to demonstrate MMR-D (22.2% vs. 12.8%; p = .0003). Patients whose tumors demonstrated both high TS and MMR-D had a 7-year DFS of 77%, compared with 58% for those whose tumors had low TS and were non-MMR-D (log-rank p = .0006). Tumor TS expression did not predict benefit of a particular therapeutic regimen. CONCLUSION: This large prospective analysis showed that high tumor TS levels were associated with improved DFS and OS following adjuvant therapy for colon cancer, although tumor TS expression did not predict benefit of 5-FU-based chemotherapy. The Oncologist 2017;22:107-114Implications for Practice: This study finds that measurement of tumor levels of thymidylate synthase is not helpful in assigning specific adjuvant treatment for colorectal cancer.

Little is known about their long-term adverse health risks, particularly of cardiac disease that is increased in other cancer populations where cardiotoxic treatments have been used. METHODS: The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study cohort comprises 200 945 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed at 15 to 39 years of age in England and Wales from 1971 to 2006, and followed to 2014. Standardized mortality ratios, absolute excess risks, and cumulative risks were calculated. RESULTS: Two thousand sixteen survivors died of cardiac disease. For all cancers combined, the standardized mortality ratios for all cardiac diseases combined was greatest for individuals diagnosed at 15 to 19 years of age (4.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.4-5.2) decreasing to 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3) for individuals aged 35 to 39 years (2P for trend <0.0001). Similar patterns were observed for both standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess risks for ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy. Survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia, genitourinary cancers other than bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, leukaemia other than acute myeloid, central nervous system tumour, cervical cancer, and breast cancer experienced 3.8, 2.7, 2.0, 1.7, 1.7, 1.6, 1.4, 1.3 and 1.2 times the number of cardiac deaths expected from the general population, respectively. Among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma aged over 60 years, almost 30% of the total excess number of deaths observed were due to heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study of over 200 000 cancer survivors shows that age at cancer diagnosis was critical in determining subsequent cardiac mortality risk. For the first time, risk estimates of cardiac death after each cancer diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 39 years have been derived from a large population-based cohort with prolonged follow-up.

However, the mechanisms underlying long-term persistence of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells are not well-defined. Here we identify a subset of memory CD4(+) T cells capable of effluxing cellular toxins, including rhodamine (Rho), through the multidrug efflux protein MDR1 (also known as P-glycoprotein and ABCB1). Drug-effluxing CD4(+) T cells were characterized as CD161(+)CD95(+)CD45RA(-)CD127(hi)CD28(+)CD25(int) cells with a distinct chemokine profile and a Th1-polarized pro-inflammatory phenotype. CD4(+)CD161(+)Rho-effluxing T cells proliferated vigorously in response to stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads and gave rise to CD161(-) progeny in vitro. These cells were also capable of self-renewal and maintained their phenotypic and functional characteristics when cultured with homeostatic cytokines. Multidrug-effluxing CD4(+)CD161(+) T cells were enriched within the viral-specific Th1 repertoire of healthy donors and patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and survived exposure to daunorubicin chemotherapy in vitro. Multidrug-effluxing CD4(+)CD161(+) T cells also resisted chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in vivo and underwent significant expansion in AML patients rendered lymphopenic after chemotherapy, contributing to the repopulation of anti-CMV immunity. Finally, after influenza vaccination, the proportion of influenza-specific CD4(+) T cells coexpressing CD161 was significantly higher after 2 years compared with 4 weeks after immunization, suggesting CD161 is a marker for long-lived antigen-specific memory T cells. These findings suggest that CD4(+)CD161(+) T cells with rapid efflux capacity contribute to the maintenance of viral-specific memory T cells.

Here we report that depletion of MCL-1 but not its isoform MCL-1S increases genomic instability and cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced death. MCL-1 association with genomic DNA increased postirradiation, and the protein colocalized with 53BP1 foci. Postirradiation, MCL-1-depleted cells exhibited decreased gamma-H2AX foci, decreased phosphorylation of ATR, and higher levels of residual 53BP1 and RIF1 foci, suggesting that DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) was compromised. Consistent with this model, MCL-1-depleted cells had a reduced frequency of IR-induced BRCA1, RPA, and Rad51 focus formation, decreased DNA end resection, and decreased HR repair in the DR-GFP DSB repair model. Similarly, after HU induction of stalled replication forks in MCL-1-depleted cells, there was a decreased ability to subsequently restart DNA synthesis, which is normally dependent upon HR-mediated resolution of collapsed forks. Therefore, the present data support a model whereby MCL-1 depletion increases 53BP1 and RIF1 colocalization at DSBs, which inhibits BRCA1 recruitment, and sensitizes cells to DSBs from IR or stalled replication forks that require HR for repair.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Mattoo, Abid R', 'Pandita, Raj K', 'Chakraborty, Sharmistha', 'Charaka, Vijaya', 'Mujoo, Kalpana', 'Hunt, Clayton R', 'Pandita, Tej K']","['Mattoo AR', 'Pandita RK', 'Chakraborty S', 'Charaka V', 'Mujoo K', 'Hunt CR', 'Pandita TK']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA armattoo@houstonmethodist.org tpandita@houstonmethodist.org.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA armattoo@houstonmethodist.org tpandita@houstonmethodist.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170119,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1)']",IM,,"['Cell Nucleus/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/radiation effects', '*DNA Replication/radiation effects', 'Genomic Instability/radiation effects', 'Homologous Recombination/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Stress, Physiological/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*53BP1', '*BCL-2', '*DSB repair', '*HR', '*ICL', '*MCL-1', '*apoptosis']",2016/11/09 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/11/09 06:00'],"['2016/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00535-16 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00535-16 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2017 Jan 19;37(3). pii: MCB.00535-16. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00535-16.

In this study, a dramatic decrease of the solute carrier family 47 member 2 (SLC47A2) mRNA in RCC comparing with the paired adjacent nontumor tissues from patients at low Tumor Node Metastasis stage was observed. Thus, patients with SLC47A2 transcriptional repression are susceptible to RCC. Little is known about the regulation mechanism of SLC47A2 We found that it was a bivalent gene that was enriched with both histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Loss of mixed lineage leukemia 1 binding at the gene promoter caused decreased H3K4me3 enrichment and H3K4me3/H3K27me3 ratio, and subsequently repressed the expression of SLC47A2 These two epigenetic markers modulated the expression of SLC47A2 simultaneously, suggesting the regulation pattern for bivalent genes. Histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation also contributed to the expression of SLC47A2 An E2F1-histone deacetylase 10 complex catalyzed deacetylation of H3K27, then prevented the enrichment of H3K4me3, and finally reduced SLC47A2 expression. Consequently, the combined effect of all these factors determined SLC47A2 transcriptional repression in RCC tissues.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Yu, Qinqin', 'Liu, Yanqing', 'Zheng, Xiaoli', 'Zhu, Qianying', 'Shen, Zhuowei', 'Wang, Hua', 'He, Huadong', 'Lin, Nengming', 'Jiang, Huidi', 'Yu, Lushan', 'Zeng, Su']","['Yu Q', 'Liu Y', 'Zheng X', 'Zhu Q', 'Shen Z', 'Wang H', 'He H', 'Lin N', 'Jiang H', 'Yu L', 'Zeng S']","[""Institute of Drug Metabolism and Pharmaceutical Analysis, Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China (Q.Y., Y.L., X.Z., Q.Z., Z.S., H.J., L.Y., S.Z.);

Furthermore, there is still no consensus regarding what stage filtering of variants is performed in the bioinformatics pipeline to produce consistent result sets, the extent of filtering and how this is most optimal performed. We hypothesized that combination of coding transcriptome and exomes enables precise identification of both somatic single nucleotide and indel variants early in the bioinformatics process, superseding the need for extensive annotation and validation from external databases. Exome and RNA-sequencing were performed on diagnosis-remission paired bone marrow samples from 5 cytogenetically normal AML, i.e. sequencing of 20 samples in total. Intersection of rare exome and RNA variants, exclusively found in the diagnostic samples, yielded a median of 6 somatic point mutations and small indels, ranging from 3 to 21. Close correlation between routine diagnostic biomarkers was observed in 29/30 laboratory tests, with the exception of a large FLT3 internal tandem repeat, whereas WT1 with nonsense mutation lacked RNA transcripts. Additionally, the assay revealed mutations in DNMT3A, IDH2, TET2 and IL32 frame shift, not encompassed by routine panel. We thus describe a procedure to effectively reduce observations to a focused subset of high specificity. The approach is applicable to precise screening of both putative driver mutations and, often heterogeneous, discrete patient specific somatic combinations.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Most deaths after MAC occur within the first 2 years after SCT, while patients surviving leukemia-free for 2 years can expect a favorable long-term outcome. However, there is paucity of data on the long-term outcome (beyond 10 years) and the pattern of late events following RIC due to the relative recent introduction of this approach. METHODS: We analyzed long-term outcomes in a cohort of 1423 AML patients, age >/=50 years, after SCT from HLA-matched siblings, during the years 1997-2005, median follow-up 8.3 years (0.1-17). RESULTS: The 10-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 31 % (95CI, 27-35) and 32 % (28-35) after MAC and RIC, respectively (P = 0.57). The 10-year GVHD/ relapse-free survival (GRFS), a surrogate for quality of life was 22 % (18-25) and 21 % (18-24), respectively (P = 0.79). The 10-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was higher and relapse rate was lower after MAC, throughout the early and late post-transplant course. The 10-year LFS among 584 patients surviving leukemia-free 2 years after SCT was 71 % (65-76) and 73 % (67-78) after MAC and RIC, respectively (P = 0.76). Advanced leukemia at SCT was the major predictor of LFS subsequent to the 2-year landmark. Relapse was the major cause of late death after both regimens; however, NRM and in particular chronic graft-versus-host disease and second cancers were more common causes of late death after MAC.

Biological therapies targeting widely-shared antigens of blast cells have entered the clinic in B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL. Area covered: Results of phase II/III trials of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and phase I/II trials of adoptive cell therapy by chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T cells (CAR-T cells) are presented. Rituximab, a naked anti-CD20 MoAb, improves the results of chemotherapy in Philadelphia chromosome-negative BCP-ALL. Inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22 immunotoxin, yields complete remission (CR) rates of 80% in R/R patients and in elderly newly diagnosed patients. Blinatumomab, a bispecific anti-CD19 and anti-CD3 agent redirects effector T cells towards B leukemic cells, is approved in R/R patients (40% CR, duration 6 months) and under investigation in MRD+ CR patients (80% negativation). Autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T cells undergo proliferation and persistence in the recipient. In limited series, they salvage more than 80% of advanced patients. Cytokine-release syndrome, encephalopathy and B-cell aplasia are shared, to varying extents, by blinatumomab and CAR-T cells.

Objective: To compare proportions of self-reported adverse health status outcomes among childhood cancer survivors across 3 decades. Design: Cross-sectional. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01120353). Setting: 27 North American institutions. Participants: 14 566 adults, who survived for 5 or more years after initial diagnosis (median age, 27 years; range, 18 to 48 years), treated from 1970 to 1999. Measurements: Patient report of poor general or mental health, functional impairment, activity limitation, or cancer-related anxiety or pain was evaluated as a function of treatment decade, cancer treatment exposure, chronic health conditions, demographic characteristics, and health habits. Results: Despite reductions in late mortality and the proportions of survivors with severe, disabling, or life-threatening chronic health conditions (33.4% among those treated from 1970 to 1979 and 21.0% among those treated from 1990 to 1999), those reporting adverse health status did not decrease by treatment decade. Compared with survivors diagnosed in 1970 to 1979, those diagnosed in 1990 to 1999 were more likely to report poor general health (11.2% vs. 13.7%; P < 0.001) and cancer-related anxiety (13.3% vs. 15.0%; P < 0.001). From 1970 to 1979 and 1990 to 1999, the proportions of survivors reporting adverse outcomes were higher (P < 0.001) among those with leukemia (poor general health, 9.5% and 13.9%) and osteosarcoma (pain, 23.9% and 36.6%). Temporal changes in treatment exposures were not associated with changes in the proportions of survivors reporting adverse health status. Smoking, not meeting physical activity guidelines, and being either underweight or obese were associated with poor health status. Limitation: Considerable improvement in survival among children diagnosed with cancer in the 1990s compared with those diagnosed in the 1970s makes it difficult to definitively determine the effect of risk factors on later self-reported health status without considering their effect on mortality. Conclusion: Because survival rates after a diagnosis of childhood cancer have improved substantially over the past 30 years, the population of survivors now includes those who would have died in earlier decades. Self-reported health status among survivors has not improved despite evolution of treatment designed to reduce toxicities.

Since these initial findings, numerous additional studies have confirmed the role of Gfi1 in myeloid differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors to bipotential lymphoid/myeloid precursors and myeloid effector cells. This review will summarize the existing knowledge concerning the mechanisms through which Gfi1 exerts these actions and will highlight recent insights into its additional implication in myeloid malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: Gfi1 has more recently been implicated in myeloid malignancies, in particular in myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative neoplasms and in acute myeloid leukemia, a fatal disease, which is essentially treated today the same way as 30 years ago. SUMMARY: Recent findings on the role of Gfi1 in myeloid malignancies together with the knowledge base built over many years on this molecule may help us to find new ways to predict the progression of acute myeloid leukemia and to design more efficient epigenetic drugs to treat this disease.",,"['Fraszczak, Jennifer', 'Moroy, Tarik']","['Fraszczak J', 'Moroy T']","['aInstitut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM) bDepartement de microbiologie, infectiologie et immunologie, Universite de Montreal cDivision of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2016/11/08 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2016/11/08 06:00'],"['2016/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000295 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Jan;24(1):32-37. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000295.,,['CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Five databases for published literature were searched for the period 1990 to 2009. Additionally, the reference lists of all retrieved articles were further searched for additional references. Assessment for methodological quality was undertaken using a critical appraisal tool from JBI-SUMARI. Following the critical appraisal, data extraction was carried out using the data extraction tool from JBI-MAStaRI. Specific details about the study, design, data collection methods, participants, stage of therapy, type of adverse drug reaction, location of evidence and findings were then described and compiled into a table. Data synthesis was presented in a narrative format as the methodologically heterogeneous nature of the quantitative studies made it not appropriate to perform meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven included studies, mostly descriptive, formed the basis of this systematic review. The ADRs induced by oral dexamethasone that have a poorer outlook in adolescents with ALL than in children with ALL are: transient hyperglycemia, infectious complications, thrombosis, thromboembolism and avascular necrosis. Adolescents were observed to have higher incidence and risk to these ADRs. In some included studies, adolescence age was found to be a predictor of the ADRs. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that adolescents experience more severe ADRs induced by oral dexamethasone during ALL treatment than children. This phenomenon may be explained by the age-related variability in pharmacokinetics characteristics of dexamethasone between the adolescents and younger children as well as the impact of pubertal changes that occur in adolescents. The outcome of the ADRs however, may be inevitably affected by the presence of confounders such as co-administered drugs as well. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: The findings call for more attention to be given to ALL patients who are diagnosed at an adolescent age, especially when dexamethasone is administered. This will alert the healthcare professionals to watch for the ADRs when administering the treatment. Healthcare professionals should also inform caregivers and patients so that they can be more aware of the ADRs. IMPLICATION FOR RESEARCH: Prospective studies involving a larger number of subjects should be carried out, with a focus on revising protocol's efficiency in monitoring dexamethasone-induced ADRs in ALL patients. Patient subgroups who are more vulnerable to such ADRs and often ignored in non-specific protocols should be identified and prophylactic interventions, such as early screening, proposed.",,"['Hu, Loh', 'Kim Emily, Ang Neo', 'Juh Allen, Yeoh Eng']","['Hu L', 'Kim Emily AN', 'Juh Allen YE']","['1.

With the increase in cancer survival rate, how to control children's cancer-related fatigue during treatments or the coexisting period with the disease to further increase their quality of life has become the focus of medical teams who provide care to children with cancer. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to synthesise the best available evidence concerning the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions on fatigue in children and adolescents with cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy aimed to find studies published between 1960 and 2010, in either the English or Chinese languages. Reference lists of studies that met the inclusion criteria were also searched for additional studies. TYPES OF STUDIES: This review included randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies that examined the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for fatigue in children and adolescents with cancer. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Children and adolescents aged between one to 18 years old, with cancer either during or after the chemotherapy. The types of cancer included were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, lymphoma and solid tumours. TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS: Non-pharmacological interventions for fatigue in children and adolescents with cancer including: activity enhancement (exercise, physical activity), psychosocial interventions, cognitive behavioural therapy, stress management, relaxation, nutrition consultation, massage and educational interventions. The intervention descriptions included the length, frequency, setting and intervention providers. TYPES OF OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures considered fatigue scores assessment. TYPES OF SETTING: The review considered studies conducted either in a hospital or a community setting. DATA COLLECTION AND SYNTHESIS: The data were extracted and synthesised using the standardised data extraction tool and synthesis function offered by the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument. RESULTS: The review included six studies - five English-language papers and one Chinese-language paper. Meta-analysis did not show a statistically significant impact on the effectiveness of exercise interventions in reducing overall fatigue in children and adolescents with cancer. Exercise interventions did lead to a statistically significant improvement (p = 0.01) in general fatigue (i.e. tiredness, physical weakness) (effect size = -0.76; 95% Confidence Interval -1.35 to -0.17). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review show that exercise interventions can effectively reduce the level of general fatigue of children aged six to 18 years. No strong conclusions can be made for the use of massage therapy or health education measures, as there was only one article for each of these interventions. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The review provides an evidenced-based guide to future priorities for clinical practice. Exercise intervention could reduce the level of general fatigue of children aged six to 18 years. In particular, exercise interventions for fatigue are feasible and safe. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: There is still a lack of rigorous research on this specific topic. Further research requires more rigorous study design and reporting of methodological issues, such as randomised controlled trials using concealment of allocation. Other non-pharmacological interventions for this problem should also be examined, including cognitive behavioural therapy, stress management, relaxation, support groups and massage therapy.",,"['Chang, Chi-Wen', 'Mu, Pei-Fan', 'Jou, Shiann-Tarng', 'Wong, Tai-Ting', 'Chen, Yu-Chih']","['Chang CW', 'Mu PF', 'Jou ST', 'Wong TT', 'Chen YC']","['a Professor and Deputy Academic Dean b Assistant professor c Professor and Chief of NS Pediatrics d Director 1.

The immune system components most affected, the degree to which immune suppression occurs, and the duration of immunodeficiency are incompletely characterized. This study measures immunologic parameters following completion of therapy. METHODS: This is a prospective, single institution cohort study. Eligible children with acute myelogenous or acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed between 1 and 21 years of age were enrolled at therapy completion. Immune parameters were assessed at the end of therapy and 6 months later: complete blood counts, immunoglobulin levels, quantitative lymphocyte subsets, mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, natural killer cell function, and vaccine titers. RESULTS: Twenty patients were evaluated; 13 (65%) were female, 15 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (75%). Mean age at diagnosis was 7.9 years. At end of therapy, all patients had some degree of immune dysfunction. At 6 months posttherapy, persistent abnormalities included: leukopenia (25%), neutropenia (15%), lymphopenia (5%), hypogammaglobulinemia (25%), one or more subtherapeutic vaccine titers (100%), abnormal lymphocyte subset levels (20%), decreased (15%), or absent (10%) natural killer cell function and abnormal lymphocyte proliferative responses (25%). CONCLUSIONS: All patients had multiple abnormalities at end of therapy, and all patients had some degree of persistent immune dysfunction at 6 months after completion of therapy. Clinical implications of these laboratory abnormalities are currently unknown; longer term evaluations are ongoing.

Although pharmaceutical manufacturers recommend second and subsequent infusions to run over 2-3 hours, many cancer centres have changed their clinical practice based on their own research and the results from other primary studies. Such research studies claim that it is safe to administer Rituximab rapidly among cancer patients especially in Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). In addition, the studies suggest that the rapid infusion of Rituximab also results in benefits of cost saving and better resource utilisation. However, these studies have not been critically appraised for their validity and application to the global population. No previous systematic reviews on this topic have been identified.Objective The objective of this review was to critically appraise, synthesise and present the best available evidence related to the safety of rapid Rituximab infusion among adult patients with NHL and CLL. INCLUSION CRITERIA: The participants of interest were adults aged 18 years old and above who had a diagnosis of NHL or CLL at any stage, have had prior exposure to Rituximab and received Rituximab with or without combination of any chemotherapy.The intervention of interest was rapid Rituximab infusion to be completed in 120 minutes or less.The studies of interest were both experimental and non-experimental studies.The primary outcomes of interest were the presence of acute adverse reactions and their severity. The secondary outcomes of interest were the management of the acute adverse reactions and patient mortality rate resulting from adverse reactions.Search strategy The search sought to identify published and unpublished studies from 1997 till 2010. A three-step search strategy was used for electronic databases, grey literature and reference lists.Methodological quality Two independent reviewers used the standard critical appraisal tool from JBI-MAStARI to assess the methodological qualities of the studies that matched with inclusion criteria.Data collection A standard data form from JBI-MAStARI was used to extract the data across all included studies.Data synthesis Proportional Meta-analysis based on DerSimonian-Laird weights for the random effects model was used for statistical pooling through Stats Direct. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran Q. When statistical pooling is not possible, the findings are presented in narrative summary. RESULTS: A total of 753 patients were included in this review. All except one patient completed a total of 2298 cycles of rapid Rituximab infusions. Seventeen and one acute adverse reactions were reported among NHL and CLL patients respectively. There were five reactions which were not clearly stated if they were occurring in NHL or CLL patients. All were mild to moderate reactions except one patient developed severe reaction and withdrew from the study. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid Rituximab infusion is safe for NHL patients especially in a 90-minute regimen. However, rapid rituximab infusion is not recommended for CLL patients due to lack of evidence. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: 90-minute rapid Rituximab infusion with or without steroid premedication is recommended for NHL patient at second and subsequently infusions. No recommendations can be made in relation to stage of disease or the presence of bulky disease or leucocytosis. It is not recommended, based on the current evidence, to use rapid Rituximab for CLL patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Further research is needed on the role of monoclonal antibodies development in rapid infusion, especially in the second and subsequent cycles. Currently, this review broadly establishes that rapid Rituximab infusion over 90 minutes is safe for NHL patients. However, more research and detailed analysis is needed to develop more specific guidelines.",,"['Lang, Dora', 'George, Cobie']","['Lang D', 'George C']","['1.

We recently showed that the combined loss of Runx1/Cbfb inhibited the development of MLL-AF9-induced AML. However, c-Kit(+)/Gr-1(-) cells remained viable in Runx1/Cbfb-deleted cells, indicating that suppressing RUNX activity may not eradicate the most immature LSCs. In this study, we found upregulation of several hemostasis-related genes, including the thrombin-activatable receptor PAR-1 (protease-activated receptor-1), in Runx1/Cbfb-deleted MLL-AF9 cells. Similar to the effect of Runx1/Cbfb deletion, PAR-1 overexpression induced CDKN1A/p21 expression and attenuated proliferation in MLL-AF9 cells. To our surprise, PAR-1 deficiency also prevented leukemia development induced by a small number of MLL-AF9 leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in vivo. PAR-1 deficiency also reduced leukemogenicity of AML1-ETO-induced leukemia. Re-expression of PAR-1 in PAR-1-deficient cells combined with a limiting-dilution transplantation assay demonstrated the cell-dose-dependent role of PAR-1 in MLL-AF9 leukemia: PAR-1 inhibited rapid leukemic proliferation when there were a large number of LSCs, while a small number of LSCs required PAR-1 for their efficient growth. Mechanistically, PAR-1 increased the adherence properties of MLL-AF9 cells and promoted their engraftment to bone marrow. Taken together, these data revealed a multifaceted role for PAR-1 in leukemogenesis, and highlight this receptor as a potential target to eradicate primitive LSCs in AML.",,"['Goyama, S', 'Shrestha, M', 'Schibler, J', 'Rosenfeldt, L', 'Miller, W', ""O'Brien, E"", 'Mizukawa, B', 'Kitamura, T', 'Palumbo, J S', 'Mulloy, J C']","['Goyama S', 'Shrestha M', 'Schibler J', 'Rosenfeldt L', 'Miller W', ""O'Brien E"", 'Mizukawa B', 'Kitamura T', 'Palumbo JS', 'Mulloy JC']","[""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161107,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, PAR-1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Receptor, PAR-1/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,,2016/11/08 06:00,2017/09/08 06:00,['2016/11/08 06:00'],"['2016/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016416 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.416 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 May 4;36(18):2589-2598. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.416.

However, it is assumed that genetic predispositions to HM are currently underestimated due to great variations in disease phenotype, variable latency and incomplete penetrance. Most of patients do not display any biological or clinical signs besides the overt hematological disease and many of them have a lack of personal or family history of malignancies. Areas covered: Collaborative studies and important advances in molecular testing have led to the discovery of several genes recurrently deregulated in familial HM including RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, ANKRD26, SRP72, PAX5, DDX41, ETV6, ATG2B/GSKIP and TERT/TERC. This review summarizes biological and clinical findings encountered within these disorders. Expert commentary: Identify and manage individuals with genetic predisposition is a current challenge for hematologists. Their identification has immediate implications for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation including donor selection and conditioning regimen. Importantly, several features, including familial and personal history as well as molecular and cytogenetic findings, may help clinicians to suspect an underlying genetic predisposition.",,"['Duployez, Nicolas', 'Lejeune, Sophie', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Preudhomme, Claude']","['Duployez N', 'Lejeune S', 'Renneville A', 'Preudhomme C']","['a Laboratory of Hematology , CHU Lille , Lille , France.', 'b INSERM, UMR-S 1172 , Lille , France.', 'c Department of Clinical Genetics , CHU Lille , Lille , France.', 'a Laboratory of Hematology , CHU Lille , Lille , France.', 'b INSERM, UMR-S 1172 , Lille , France.', 'a Laboratory of Hematology , CHU Lille , Lille , France.', 'b INSERM, UMR-S 1172 , Lille , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161121,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['Platelet Disorder, Familial, with Associated Myeloid Malignancy']",IM,,"['Blood Coagulation Disorders, Inherited/complications/genetics', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/complications/genetics', 'Comorbidity', 'Family', 'Genes, Dominant', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*etiology/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ANKRD26', '*ATG2B/GSKIP', '*CEBPA', '*DDX41', '*ETV6', '*GATA2', '*GSKIP', '*PAX5', '*RUNX1', '*SRP72', '*TERC', '*TERT', '*acute leukemia', '*bone marrow failure', '*genetic predisposition', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']",2016/11/08 06:00,2017/05/19 06:00,['2016/11/08 06:00'],"['2016/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2016.1257936 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2016 Dec;9(12):1189-1202. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2016.1257936.

However, its regulation is not well studied. Here, we show that TRAF6 E3 ligase is a crucial factor to restrict mitochondrial translocation of p53 and spontaneous apoptosis by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of p53 at K24 in cytosol, and such ubiquitination limits the interaction between p53 and MCL-1/BAK. Genotoxic stress reduces this ubiquitination in cytosol by S13/T330 phosphorylation-dependent translocation of TRAF6 from cytosol to nucleus, where TRAF6 also facilitates the K63-linked ubiquitination of nuclear p53 and its transactivation by recruiting p300 for p53 acetylation. Functionally, K63-linked ubiquitination of p53 compromised p53-mediated apoptosis and tumor suppression. Colorectal cancer samples with WT p53 reveal that TRAF6 overexpression negatively correlates with apoptosis and predicts poor response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Together, our study identifies TRAF6 as a critical gatekeeper to restrict p53 mitochondrial translocation, and such mechanism may contribute to tumor development and drug resistance.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We undertook a transcriptomic characterization of primary human CLL cells to identify transcripts and pathways affected by SF3B1 mutation. Splicing alterations, identified in the analysis of bulk cells, were confirmed in single SF3B1-mutated CLL cells and also found in cell lines ectopically expressing mutant SF3B1. SF3B1 mutation was found to dysregulate multiple cellular functions including DNA damage response, telomere maintenance, and Notch signaling (mediated through KLF8 upregulation, increased TERC and TERT expression, or altered splicing of DVL2 transcript, respectively).

Twenty-fold potency enhancement compared to BVdU was achieved against L1210 cells. Interestingly, a number of ProTides showed low micromolar activity against CEM and HeLa cells compared to the inactive parent BVdU.

Recent studies, however, have provided a battery of findings that cannot be explained by this ""classical"" hierarchical model for the architecture of hematopoiesis. It is emerging that heterogeneous hematopoietic stem cell populations in the bone marrow coexist, each with distinct, preprogrammed differentiation and proliferation behaviors. Three subsets can be distinguished among them: myeloid-biased (alpha), balanced (beta), and lymphoid-biased (gamma/delta) hematopoietic stem cells. The ratio of these hematopoietic stem cell subsets is developmentally regulated in the foetal liver and hematopoietic stem cells adult bone marrow, and coordinately gives rise to hematopoiesis. Beta- and gamma/delta-hematopoietic stem cells are found predominantly early in the life of an organism, whereas alpha-hematopoietic stem cells accumulate in aged mice and humans. In addition, new sophisticated genetic experiments in mice have identified a major role of long-lived, committed progenitor cells downstream from hematopoietic stem cells as drivers of normal adult hematopoiesis, and revealed that post-transplantation hematopoiesis differs qualitatively and quantitatively from normal steady-state hematopoiesis. These findings have important implications for understanding in situ the regulation of haematopoiesis in health and disease. Orv.

Braun)) grains, caused cytotoxicity, enhancement of apoptotic sub-G1 rate, Bak activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi), activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and FITC-Annexin V-stainable phosphatidylserine exposure on the external surface of the cytoplasmic membrane without accompanying necrosis. These apoptotic responses were abrogated in Jurkat T cell clone (J/Bcl-xL) overexpressing Bcl-xL. Under the same conditions, cellular autophagic responses, including suppression of the Akt-mTOR pathway and p62/SQSTM1 down-regulation, were commonly detected in J/Neo and J/Bcl-xL cells; however, formation of acridine orange-stainable acidic vascular organelles, LC3-I/II conversion, and Beclin-1 phosphorylation (Ser-15) were detected only in J/Neo cells. Correspondingly, concomitant treatment with the autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine or LY294002) appeared to enhance acacetin-induced apoptotic responses, such as Bak activation, Deltapsi loss, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and apoptotic sub-G1 accumulation. This indicated that acacetin could induce apoptosis and cytoprotective autophagy in Jurkat T cells simultaneously. Together, these results demonstrate that acacetin induces not only apoptotic cell death via activation of Bak, loss of Deltapsi, and activation of the mitochondrial caspase cascade, but also cytoprotective autophagy resulting from suppression of the Akt-mTOR pathway. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of the autophagy pathway augments the activation of Bak and resultant mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat T cells.",,"['Lee, Ji Young', 'Jun, Do Youn', 'Kim, Ki Yun', 'Ha, Eun Ji', 'Woo, Mi Hee', 'Ko, Jee Youn', 'Yun, Young Ho', 'Oh, In-Seok', 'Kim, Young Ho']","['Lee JY', 'Jun DY', 'Kim KY', 'Ha EJ', 'Woo MH', 'Ko JY', 'Yun YH', 'Oh IS', 'Kim YH']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Catholic University of Daegu, Gyeongsan 38430, Republic of Korea.', 'Upland Crop Breeding Research Division, Department of Southern Area Crop Science, RDA, Miryang 50424, Republic of Korea.', 'Upland Crop Breeding Research Division, Department of Southern Area Crop Science, RDA, Miryang 50424, Republic of Korea.', 'Upland Crop Breeding Research Division, Department of Southern Area Crop Science, RDA, Miryang 50424, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),J Microbiol Biotechnol,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,9431852,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acacetin', 'Bak activation', 'Echinochloa esculenta (A.

Transformation from chronic to blastic phase is the lethal step in CML. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are the basic reason for blastic transformation. It has been shown that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling contributes to the self-renewal capacity and proliferation of LSCs in CML. However, the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in blastic transformation of CML is still obscure. Here, we explored the relationship between BCR-ABL and beta-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo. We found that BCR-ABL stimulated beta-catenin via activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in blastic phase CML cells. Inhibition of the kinase activity of BCR-ABL, PI3K, or AKT decreased the level of beta-catenin in both K562 cells and a CML mouse model and suppressed the transcription of downstream target genes (c-myc and cyclin D1). In addition, inhibition of the BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT pathway delayed the disease progression in the CML mouse model. To further explore the role of beta-catenin in the self-renewal and survival of CML LSCs, we established a secondary transplantation CML mouse model. Our data revealed that inhibition of the BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT pathway reduced the tumor-initiating ability of K562 cells, decreased leukemia cell infiltration into peripheral blood and bone marrow, and prolonged the survival of mice. In conclusion, our data indicate a close relationship between beta-catenin and BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT in blastic phase CML. beta-Catenin inhibition may be of therapeutic value by targeting LSCs in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which may delay blastic transformation of CML.",,"['Hu, Jing', 'Feng, Min', 'Liu, Zhang-Ling', 'Liu, Yi', 'Huang, Zheng-Lan', 'Li, Hui', 'Feng, Wen-Li']","['Hu J', 'Feng M', 'Liu ZL', 'Liu Y', 'Huang ZL', 'Li H', 'Feng WL']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. fengwlcqmu@sina.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161105,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Blastic transformation', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'PI3K/AKT', 'beta-Catenin']",2016/11/07 06:00,2016/11/07 06:00,['2016/11/07 06:00'],"['2016/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-016-5413-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-016-5413-3 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Tumour Biol. 2016 Nov 5. pii: 10.1007/s13277-016-5413-3. doi: 10.1007/s13277-016-5413-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, in vitro activation of NK cells by cytokines leads to generation of NK cells with memory-like properties characterized by increased interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) production. However, it remains to be defined whether these memory-like NK cells exist in vivo after cytokine activation. Furthermore, it is also unclear whether such memory-like NK cells induced in vivo by cytokines could have effective anti-leukemia response. To address these issues, we used an in vivo pre-activation and re-stimulation system that was able to produce NK cells with increased IFNgamma secretion. It was found that after in vivo pre-activation and re-stimulation with interleukins (ILs), NK cells retained a state to produce increased amount of IFNgamma. Of note, whereas this intrinsic capacity of enhanced IFNgamma production after in vivo IL pre-activation and re-stimulation could be transferred to the next generation of NK cells and was associated with prolonged survival of the mice with acute lymphoid leukemia. Moreover, the anti-leukemia activity of these memory-like NK cells was associated with IFNgamma production and up-regulation of NK cells activation receptor-NK Group 2 member D (NKG2D). Together, these findings argue strongly that in vivo IL pre-activation and re-stimulation is capable to induce memory-like NK cells as observed previously in vitro, which are effective against acute lymphoblastic leukemia, likely via NKG2D-dependent IFNgamma production, in intact animals.",,"['Jin, Fengyan', 'Lin, Hai', 'Gao, Sujun', 'Hu, Zheng', 'Zuo, Song', 'Sun, Liguang', 'Jin, Chunhui', 'Li, Wei', 'Yang, Yanping']","['Jin F', 'Lin H', 'Gao S', 'Hu Z', 'Zuo S', 'Sun L', 'Jin C', 'Li W', 'Yang Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (IFNG protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Klrk1 protein, mouse)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukins/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*transplantation', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['NKG2D', 'interferon-gamma', 'interleukin', 'leukemia', 'natural killer cells']",2016/11/07 06:00,2018/02/13 06:00,['2016/11/07 06:00'],"['2015/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['13007 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.13007 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 29;7(48):79187-79202. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.13007.,,,PMC5346707,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY ANSWER: There was a clear association between the intensity of treatment received and requirement for medical puberty induction but no association with the diagnosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Although it cannot be predicted which girls will become infertile or develop premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) following intensive chemotherapy or irradiation, patients who are at high risk of POI should be offered ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC). This includes girls who are planned to receive either high doses of alkylating agents, conditioning regimen before stem cell transplantation (SCT), total body irradiation (TBI) or high radiation doses to the craniospinal, abdominal or pelvic area. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a retrospective cohort study. In total, 176 Danish girls under 18 years of age have had OTC performed over a period of 15 years. An overview of the girls' diagnoses and mean age at OTC as well as the number of deceased is presented. Of the 176 girls, 38 had died and 46 girls were still younger than 12 years so their pubertal development cannot be evaluated yet. For the 60 girls who had OTC performed after 12 years of age, the incidence of POI was evaluated and in the group of 32 girls who were younger than 12 years at OTC, the association between the diagnosis and received treatment and the requirement for medical puberty induction was examined. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The need for medical puberty induction was assessed in 32 girls who were prepubertal at the time of OTC. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Indications for OTC were allogeneic SCT for leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or benign haematological disorders, autologous SCT for lymphoma or sarcoma, and irradiation to the pelvis or to the spinal axis. The mean age at OTC of the 176 girls were 11.3 years. The two most prevalent diagnoses of the 176 girls were malignant tumours and malignant haematological diseases. Among the 32 prepubertal girls, 12 received high dose chemotherapy and either TBI prior to SCT or irradiation to the pelvis, abdomen or the spinal axis, 13 received high dose alkylating agents but no irradiation prior to SCT, six received alkylating agents as part of conventional chemotherapy and one patient had a genetic metabolic disorder and did not receive gonadotoxic treatment. Among these 32 girls, 23 did not undergo puberty spontaneously and thus received medical puberty induction. Among the nine girls, who went through spontaneous puberty, four had received high dose alkylating agents and five had received conventional chemotherapy. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: All information was retrieved retrospectively from patient records, and thus some information was not available. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: OTC should be recommended to all young girls, who present a high risk of developing ovarian insufficiency and/or infertility following high dose chemotherapy and/or irradiation. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The Childhood Cancer Foundation (2012-2016) and the EU interregional project ReproHigh are thanked for having funded this study. They had no role in the study design, collection and analysis of the data or writing of the report. The authors have no conflict of interest to disclose.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Bilirubin peaks were 18, 7 and 8 folds more than upper normal limit (UNL) respectively. However, albumin was reduced to approximately half of the lower Normal limit (LNL). Although Blincyto(R) administration was immediately withdrawn, he expired in the day 10 due to a fatal cardiac failure. Based on evidence, FDA concluded that CRS was the main cause of death in this patient. Evoking evidence now propose that aberrant pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion, the hallmark of CRS, and subsequent elevation in nitric oxide (NO) can result in both inotropic and chronotropic alterations in myocardial excitation-contraction coupling, myocardial contractility suppression, desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors stimulation, development of acute cardiac failure and death. The probably neglecting point here is that TLS itself can also develop life threatening conditions including sudden cardiac failure through induction of hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia and hyperuricemia, making CRS monitoring and proper required supportive interventions more complex. Here, first we enumerate probable mechanisms through which CRS results in development of fatal cardiac failure and then explain the possible neglected role of TLS in development of the fatal cardiac failure.",['Copyright A(c) 2016.

A total of 107 patients, median age 38 years (range, 19 to 64 years) received a matched sibling donor (n = 52) or matched unrelated donor (n = 55) transplant for ALL in first complete remission (n = 62), second complete remission (n = 28), or more advanced disease (n = 17). Nearly one-half of the patients had a high-risk cytogenetic profile as defined by the presence of t(9;22) (n = 34), t(4;11) (n = 4), or complex cytogenetics (n = 7). Clo 40 mg/m(2) was given once daily, with each dose followed by pharmacokinetically dosed Bu infused over 3 hours daily for 4 days, followed by hematopoietic cell infusion after 2 days of rest. The Bu dose was based on the drug clearance as determined by a test Bu dose of 32 mg/m(2). The target daily area under the curve was 5500 micromol/min for patients aged <60 years and 4000 micromol/min for patients aged >59 years. With a median follow-up of 3.3 years among surviving patients (range, 1 to 5.8 years), the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) for patients undergoing HSCT in first complete remission (CR1), second complete remission (CR2), or more advanced disease was 62%, 34%, and 35%, respectively. The regimen was well tolerated, with nonrelapse mortality (NRM) of 10% at 100 days and 31% at 2 years post-HSCT. The incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 35% and 10%, respectively; 18% patients developed extensive chronic GVHD. The 2-year overall survival (OS) for patients undergoing HSCT in CR1, CR2, or more advanced disease was 70%, 57%, and 35%, respectively. Among 11 patients aged >59 years treated with reduced-dose Bu in CR1 (n = 7) or CR2 (n = 4), 4 remain alive and disease-free, with a median follow-up of 2.6 years (range, 2 to 4.7 years). Only the presence of minimal residual disease at the time of transplantation was associated with significantly worse PFS and OS in multivariate analysis. Our data indicate that the Clo-Bu combination provides effective disease control while maintaining a favorable safety profile. OS and NRM rates compare favorably with those for traditional myeloablative total body irradiation-based conditioning regimens.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

To improve their outcome, we evaluated the outcome of a sequential intermediate-intensity conditioning regimen combining fludarabine, cytosine arabinoside, amsacrine, cyclophosphamide, and either total body irradiation or busulfan (FLAMSA) in patients with intermediate or high-risk AML in first or second complete remission (CR). A total of 265 patients (median age, 55 years; range, 19 to 76) with AML who underwent allo-HSCT using a FLAMSA regimen were included. At the time of transplant, 216 (81.5%) were in CR1 and 49 (18.5%) in CR2. Cytogenetic was intermediate in 114 (43%) and poor in 42 (15.8%) patients, whereas 109 patients (41.1%) had a secondary AML. With a median follow-up of 46 months (range, 1 to 145), the Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall and leukemia-free survival at 2 years were 56.1% (95% CI, 49.7% to 62.6%) and 52.8% (95% CI, 46.4% to 59.2%), respectively. At 2 years, the cumulative incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality were 22.8% (95% CI, 17.6% to 28.4%) and 24.0% (95% CI, 18.8% to 29.5%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, patient age and cytogenetics were the only parameters with a significant impact on overall survival. These data suggest that the FLAMSA sequential intermediate conditioning regimen provides an efficient disease control in intermediate- and high-risk AML patients, including those in CR2 and with secondary AML.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Hematopoiesis is the biological process of birth, replication and differentiation of blood cells. Despite of being essentially a stochastic phenomenon followed by a huge number of discrete entities, blood formation has naturally an associated continuous dynamics, because the cellular populations can - on average - easily be described by (e.g.) differential equations. This deterministic dynamics by no means contemplates some important stochastic aspects related to abnormal hematopoiesis, that are especially significant for studying certain blood cancer deceases. For instance, by mere stochastic competition against the normal cells, leukemic cells sometimes do not reach the population thereshold needed to kill the organism. Of course, a pure discrete model able to follow the stochastic paths of billons of cells is computationally impossible. In order to avoid this difficulty, we seek a trade-off between the computationally feasible and the biologically realistic, deriving an equation able to size conveniently both the discrete and continuous parts of a model for hematopoiesis in terrestrial mammals, in the context of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. Assuming the cancer is originated from a single stem cell inside of the bone marrow, we also deduce a theoretical formula for the probability of non-diagnosis as a function of the mammal average adult mass. In addition, this work cellular dynamics analysis may shed light on understanding Peto's paradox, which is shown here as an emergent property of the discrete-continuous nature of the system.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, to evaluate MMTV-MuERVs' responses to stress (e.g., injury, infection)-elicited systemic glucocorticoid (GC) levels, we examined the GC-stress response of 64 MMTV-MuERV promoters isolated from the genomes of 23 mouse strains. All 64 promoters responded to treatment with a synthetic GC, dexamethasone (DEX), at a wide range from a 0.6- to 85.7-fold increase in reporter activity compared to no treatment. An analysis of the 10 lowest and 10 highest DEX responders revealed specific promoter elements exclusively present in either the three lowest or the two highest responders. Each promoter had a unique profile of transcription regulatory elements and the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) was identified in all promoters with the number of GREs ranging from 2 to 7. The three lowest DEX responders were the only promoters with two GREs. The findings from this study suggest that certain MMTV-MuERVs are more responsive to stress-elicited systemic GC elevation compared to the others. The mouse strain-specific genomic MMTV-MuERV profiles and individual MMTV-MuERVs' differential responses to GC-stress might explain, at least in part, the variable inflammatory responses to injury and/or infection, often observed among different mouse strains.

BCL6 loss of function can kill DLBCL cells, demonstrating that BCL6 is necessary for the survival of DLBCL cells and could be a therapeutic target. In this study, we found that BCL6 protein levels were consistently upregulated in DLBCL tissues, whereas its mRNA levels varied randomly in tissues, suggesting that a post-transcriptional mechanism was involved in BCL6 regulation. We used bioinformatics analysis to search for miRNAs, which potentially target BCL6, and identified specific targeting sites for miR-10a in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of BCL6. We further identified an inverse correlation between miR-10a levels and BCL6 protein levels, but not mRNA levels, in DLBCL tumor tissue samples. By overexpressing or knocking down miR-10a in DLBCL cells, we experimentally validated that miR-10a directly recognizes the 3'-UTR of the BCL6 transcript and regulated BCL6 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that negatively regulating BCL6 by miR-10a suppressed the proliferation and promoted apoptosis of DLBCL cells.",,"['Fan, Qian', 'Meng, Xiangrui', 'Liang, Hongwei', 'Zhang, Huilai', 'Liu, Xianming', 'Li, Lanfang', 'Li, Wei', 'Sun, Wu', 'Zhang, Haiyang', 'Zen, Ke', 'Zhang, Chen-Yu', 'Zhou, Zhen', 'Chen, Xi', 'Ba, Yi']","['Fan Q', 'Meng X', 'Liang H', 'Zhang H', 'Liu X', 'Li L', 'Li W', 'Sun W', 'Zhang H', 'Zen K', 'Zhang CY', 'Zhou Z', 'Chen X', 'Ba Y']","['Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, 300060, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, 300060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, NJU Advanced Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, 300060, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, 300060, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, 300060, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, 300060, China.', 'Department of Digestion, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, 300060, China.', 'Department of Digestion, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, 300060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, NJU Advanced Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, NJU Advanced Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, NJU Advanced Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China. zhenzhou@nju.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, NJU Advanced Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China. xichen@nju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Digestion, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, 300060, China. bayi@tjmuch.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161104,Germany,Protein Cell,Protein & cell,101532368,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN10 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)']",IM,,"[""*3' Untranslated Regions"", '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*metabolism/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6/*biosynthesis/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCL6', '*DLBCL', '*apoptosis', '*miR-10a', '*microRNA', '*proliferation']",2016/11/07 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2016/11/06 06:00'],"['2016/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13238-016-0316-z [doi]', '10.1007/s13238-016-0316-z [pii]']",ppublish,Protein Cell. 2016 Dec;7(12):899-912. doi: 10.1007/s13238-016-0316-z.

Although many studies have indicated that IKZF1 alterations might be associated with poor outcomes in adults with ALL, the results remain controversial. A previous meta-analysis demonstrated the negative prognostic significance of IKZF1 deletion in ALL. However, most of the included studies (14 out of 15) were conducted in pediatric patients with ALL, and age was identified as a significant source of heterogeneity. Thus, performing the present meta-analysis provides valuable information to further elucidate the prognostic value of IKZF1 deletion in adults with ALL. Eight studies were identified that had been published prior to August 1, 2016. The studies included a total of 1008 patients. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)/relapse-free survival (RFS)/progression-free survival (PFS)/event-free survival (EFS) were pooled to estimate the prognostic power of IKZF1 deletion. Pooled HRs suggested that IKZF1 deletion had a negative impact on both OS (HR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73) and DFS/RFS/PFS/EFS (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.17) in the overall population. Subgroup analyses indicated that IKZF1 deletion could independently predict unfavorable OS (HR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.25-2.06) and DFS/RFS/PFS/EFS (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.17) in BCR-ABL1-negative but not in BCR-ABL1-positive B cell ALL patients. Our meta-analysis suggests that IKZF1 deletion is a poor prognostic factor for adults with B cell ALL and may be more valuable in BCR-ABL1-negative B cell ALL patients.",,"['Zhang, Wanhua', 'Kuang, Pu', 'Li, He', 'Wang, Fengjuan', 'Wang, Yu']","['Zhang W', 'Kuang P', 'Li H', 'Wang F', 'Wang Y']","[""Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Guoxuexiang 37, Chengdu, 610041, People's Republic of China. wanhua.zhang@foxmail.com."", ""Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Guoxuexiang 37, Chengdu, 610041, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Guoxuexiang 37, Chengdu, 610041, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Guoxuexiang 37, Chengdu, 610041, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Guoxuexiang 37, Chengdu, 610041, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20161104,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,,"['*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'IKZF1', 'Meta-analysis', 'Prognosis']",2016/11/07 06:00,2017/02/02 06:00,['2016/11/06 06:00'],"['2016/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2869-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2869-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Feb;96(2):215-225. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2869-6.

Most patients had Rai stage III/IV disease and were heavily pretreated (median 4 prior therapies), and 61% had del(17p)/del(11q). Eleven of 19 evaluable patients (58%) responded, with a median response duration of 12 months (1-29+); time to progression was short in non-responders. Lenalidomide had a narrow therapeutic dose range, 2.5 mg/day was not efficient, and maximum tolerated dose was 5 mg/day. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 84 and 55%, 30% had febrile neutropenia, and CMV-reactivation requiring valganciclovir occurred in 30% of patients. The frequency of proliferating (Ki67(+)) CD8(+) T cells was increased at week 4, with further increase in both the CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets (p < 0.01 and <0.05), which was accompanied by significant upregulation of HLA-DR after addition of alemtuzumab. Antigen-experienced cells increased at week 4 as the frequency of effector memory cells increased in the CD8(+) subset (p < 0.003), while effector cells decreased in both the CD8(+) and CD4(+) subsets (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01). The Th1/Th2 balance was unchanged at week 4 but shifted toward a Th2 profile after combination therapy. At end of treatment, the frequency of Th17 and regulatory T cells was reduced (p < 0.01), naive T cells decreased, and effector memory T cells increased (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). Granzyme B(+) T cells increased at 30-week follow-up (p < 0.05). PD-1 expression was unaffected.

METHODS: The red bone marrow (RBM) dose from low-linear energy transfer (LET) (mainly external gamma-radiation) and high-LET (mainly radon gas) radiation was estimated based on a job-exposure matrix and biokinetic/dosimetric models. Linear excess relative risks (ERR) and 95% CIs were estimated via Poisson regression for chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) and non-CLL. RESULTS: The mean cumulative low-LET and high-LET RBM doses among the 86% radiation-exposed workers were 48 and 9 mGy, respectively. There was a positive non-significant dose-response for mortality from non-CLL (n=120) in relation to low-LET (ERR/Gy=2.18; 95% CI -0.41 to 6.37) and high-LET radiation (ERR/Gy=16.65; 95% -1.13 to 46.75). A statistically significant excess was found for the subgroup chronic myeloid leukaemia (n=31) in relation to low-LET radiation (ERR/Gy=7.20; 95% CI 0.48 to 24.54) and the subgroup myeloid leukaemia (n=99) (ERR/Gy=26.02; 95% CI 2.55 to 68.99) for high-LET radiation. The ERR/Gy tended to be about five to ten times higher for high-LET versus low-LET radiation; however, the CIs largely overlapped. Results indicate no association of death from CLL (n=70) with either type of radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate an increased risk of death for specific subtypes from non-CLL in relation to chronic low-LET and high-LET radiation, but no such relation for CLL.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

ROR1 is a receptor for Wnt5a that may complex with TCL1, a coactivator of AKT that is able to promote development of CLL. We found the CLL cells of a few patients expressed negligible ROR1 (ROR1(Neg)), but expressed TCL1A at levels comparable to those of samples that expressed ROR1 (ROR1(Pos)). Transcriptome analyses revealed that ROR1(Neg) cases generally could be distinguished from those that were ROR1(Pos) in unsupervised gene-expression clustering analysis. Gene-set enrichment analyses demonstrated that ROR1(Neg) CLL had lower expression and activation of AKT signaling pathways relative to ROR1(Pos) CLL, similar to what was noted for leukemia that respectively developed in TCL1 vs ROR1xTCL1 transgenic mice. In contrast to its effect on ROR1(Pos) CLL, Wnt5a did not enhance the proliferation, chemotaxis, or survival of ROR1(Neg) CLL. We examined the CLL cells from 1568 patients, which we randomly assigned to a training or validation set of 797 or 771 cases, respectively. Using recursive partitioning, we defined a threshold for ROR1 surface expression that could segregate samples of the training set into ROR1-Hi vs ROR1-Lo subgroups that differed significantly in their median treatment-free survival (TFS). Using this threshold, we found that ROR1-Hi cases had a significantly shorter median TFS and overall survival than ROR1-Lo cases in the validation set. These data demonstrate that expression of ROR1 may promote leukemia-cell activation and survival and enhance disease progression in patients with CLL.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Cui, Bing', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Chen, Liguang', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'DeBoever, Christopher', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Yu, Jian', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Wierda, William G', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Gribben, John G', 'Frazer, Kelly A', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Cui B', 'Ghia EM', 'Chen L', 'Rassenti LZ', 'DeBoever C', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Yu J', 'Neuberg DS', 'Wierda WG', 'Rai KR', 'Kay NE', 'Brown JR', 'Jones JA', 'Gribben JG', 'Frazer KA', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.', 'Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard University, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Medicine, Hofstra North Shore-Long Island Jewish School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard University, Boston, MA.', 'Division of Hematology and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK; and.', ""Moores Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics and Rady Children's Hospital, Institute for Genomic Medicine, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA."", 'Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161104,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)']",IM,,"['Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2016/11/07 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/11/06 06:00'],"['2016/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33876-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-04-712562 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Dec 22;128(25):2931-2940. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-04-712562.

Here, we report that concurrent RAS pathway and TP53 mutations are identified in a subset of AML patients and confer an inferior overall survival. To further investigate the genetic interaction between p53 loss and endogenous Nras(G12D/+) in AML, we generated conditional Nras(G12D/+)p53(-/-) mice. Consistent with the clinical data, recipient mice transplanted with Nras(G12D/+)p53(-/-) bone marrow cells rapidly develop a highly penetrant AML. We find that p53(-/-) cooperates with Nras(G12D/+) to promote increased quiescence in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs). Nras(G12D/+)p53(-/-) MEPs are transformed to self-renewing AML-initiating cells and are capable of inducing AML in serially transplanted recipients. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that transformed MEPs gain a partial hematopoietic stem cell signature and largely retain an MEP signature. Their distinct transcriptomes suggests a potential regulation by p53 loss. In addition, we show that during AML development, transformed MEPs acquire overexpression of oncogenic Nras, leading to hyperactivation of ERK1/2 signaling. Our results demonstrate that p53(-/-) synergizes with enhanced oncogenic Nras signaling to transform MEPs and drive AML development. This model may serve as a platform to test candidate therapeutics in this aggressive subset of AML.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Zhang, Jingfang', 'Kong, Guangyao', 'Rajagopalan, Adhithi', 'Lu, Li', 'Song, Jingming', 'Hussaini, Mohamed', 'Zhang, Xinmin', 'Ranheim, Erik A', 'Liu, Yangang', 'Wang, Jinyong', 'Gao, Xin', 'Chang, Yuan-I', 'Johnson, Kirby D', 'Zhou, Yun', 'Yang, David', 'Bhatnagar, Bhavana', 'Lucas, David M', 'Bresnick, Emery H', 'Zhong, Xuehua', 'Padron, Eric', 'Zhang, Jing']","['Zhang J', 'Kong G', 'Rajagopalan A', 'Lu L', 'Song J', 'Hussaini M', 'Zhang X', 'Ranheim EA', 'Liu Y', 'Wang J', 'Gao X', 'Chang YI', 'Johnson KD', 'Zhou Y', 'Yang D', 'Bhatnagar B', 'Lucas DM', 'Bresnick EH', 'Zhong X', 'Padron E', 'Zhang J']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research.', 'Cellular and Molecular Biology Program, and.', 'Wisconsin Institute for Discovery and Laboratory of Genetics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.', 'Hematopathology and Laboratory Medicine, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'Hematopathology and Laboratory Medicine, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'BioInfoRx, Inc., Madison, WI.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research.', 'Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research.', 'Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'Wisconsin Institute for Discovery and Laboratory of Genetics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.', 'Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161104,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Megakaryocyte-Erythroid Progenitor Cells/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/*genetics']",,,2016/11/07 06:00,2017/08/24 06:00,['2016/11/06 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33778-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-06-719237 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jan 19;129(3):358-370. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-06-719237.

The monitoring of serum galactomannan (GM) antigen is considered useful in the diagnosis of IA . The aim of this study was to determine the utility of serum GM monitoring in the early diagnosis of IA and the role of positive antigenemia in the management of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: The cases of 141 children who were being treated for ALL in the Division of Pediatric Hematology of the Medical School of Ege University between January 2006 and February 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. Cases of proven and probable IA were defined according to the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria. RESULTS: The incidence of proven and probable IA was 3.5% (5/141). The incidence of positive GM antigenemia among 3264 serum samples was 5.5% (n=179). Of the cases detected, 21.7% were true-positive, 52.1% were false-positive, and the remaining 26.1% were classified as 'undetermined.' An increase in the incidence of true-positive tests and induction of antifungal therapy was determined through multiple consecutive positive tests. CONCLUSIONS: GM may be detected in the serum before the clinical signs of IA appear, but its sensitivity and specificity are variable. False-positivity is a significant disadvantage, and consecutive positive GM must be taken into account in the case of clinical and imaging findings that are relevant to IA.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

Adults with ALL tend to have higher risk factors at diagnosis, more comorbidities, and increasing age that often requires dose reductions. Major advancements have been made in redefining the pathologic classification of ALL, identifying new cytogenetic-molecular abnormalities, and developing novel targeted agents in order to improve survival. The addition of new monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors to conventional chemotherapy in the frontline setting has resulted in increased rates of complete remission and overall survival.

Herein, three edible mushrooms, Auricularia auricula-judae (AA), Pleurotus abalonus (PA) and Pleurotus sajor-caju (PS) extracted using Soxhlet ethanol extraction were evaluated for their antioxidative, anti-proliferative effects on leukemia cells. Using the Folin-Ciocalteau method and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay, phenolics and antioxidant activity were found in all sample mushrooms. Additionally, anti-proliferative activity of mushroom extracts against U937 leukemia cells was determined using a viability assay based on mitochondrial activity. PA (0.5 mg/mL) and AA (0.25-0.5 mg/mL) significantly reduced cell viability. Interestingly, PS caused a hormetic-like biphasic dose-response. Low doses (0-0.25 mg/L) of PS promoted cell proliferation up to 140% relative to control, whereas higher doses (0.50 mg/mL) inhibited cell proliferation. Against U937 cells, AA IC50 was 0.28 +/- 0.04 mg/mL, which was lower than PS or PA IC50 (0.45 +/- 0.01 and 0.49 +/- 0.001 mg/mL, respectively). Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage conferred cytotoxicity. PS and PA were not toxic to U937 cells at any tested concentration; AA (0.50 mg/mL) showed high LDH levels and caused 50% cytotoxicity. Additionally, UPLC-HRMS data indicated several phytochemicals known to support functional activities as either antioxidant or anti-proliferative. Glutamic acid was uniquely found in ethanolic extracts of AA, and was considered an anti-cancer amino acid with potent anti-proliferative effects on U937 cells. Collectively, all mushroom extracts exhibited antioxidant effects, but their anti-proliferative effects were dose-dependent. Nevertheless, the AA extract, with highest potency, is a promising candidate for future applications.",,"['Panthong, S', 'Boonsathorn, N', 'Chuchawankul, S']","['Panthong S', 'Boonsathorn N', 'Chuchawankul S']","['Graduate Program in Molecular Science of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Medical Biotechnology Center, Medical Life Science Institute, Department of Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand.', 'Medical Biotechnology Center, Medical Life Science Institute, Department of Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand siriporn.ch@chula.ac.th.', 'Innovation Center for Research and Development of Medical Diagnostic Technology Project, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand siriporn.ch@chula.ac.th.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161017,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,,"['Agaricales/*chemistry', 'Amino Acids/*analysis', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Ethanol/*chemistry', 'Flavonoids/analysis', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Metabolomics', 'Phenols/analysis', 'U937 Cells']",,,2016/11/05 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/11/05 06:00'],"['2016/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr-15-gmr15048886 [pii]', '10.4238/gmr15048886 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2016 Oct 17;15(4). pii: gmr-15-gmr15048886. doi: 10.4238/gmr15048886.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of evidence that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL6), and the survival-enhancing oncoprotein, B cell leukemia 2 (BCL2), have critical roles in the natural history of WM, we hypothesized that the enforced expression of IL6 and BCL2 in mice unable to perform immunoglobulin class switch recombination may result in a lymphoproliferative disease that mimics WM. To evaluate this possibility, we generated compound transgenic BALB/c mice that harbored the human BCL2 and IL6 transgenes, EmuSV-BCL2-22 and H2-L(d)-hIL6, on the genetic background of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) deficiency. We designated these mice BCL2(+)IL6(+)AID(-) and found that they developed-with full genetic penetrance (100% incidence) and suitably short latency (93 days median survival)-a severe IgM(+) lymphoproliferative disorder that recapitulated important features of human WM. However, the BCL2(+)IL6(+)AID(-) model also exhibited shortcomings, such as low serum IgM levels and histopathological changes not seen in patients with WM, collectively indicating that further refinements of the model are required to achieve better correlations with disease characteristics of WM.",,"['Tompkins, V S', 'Sompallae, R', 'Rosean, T R', 'Walsh, S', 'Acevedo, M', 'Kovalchuk, A L', 'Han, S-S', 'Jing, X', 'Holman, C', 'Rehg, J E', 'Herms, S', 'Sunderland, J S', 'Morse, H C', 'Janz, S']","['Tompkins VS', 'Sompallae R', 'Rosean TR', 'Walsh S', 'Acevedo M', 'Kovalchuk AL', 'Han SS', 'Jing X', 'Holman C', 'Rehg JE', 'Herms S', 'Sunderland JS', 'Morse HC', 'Janz S']","['Department of Pathology, Iowa Institute of Human Genetics, University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A.

In mammals, there are two converging apoptosis pathways: the 'extrinsic' pathway, which is triggered by engagement of cell surface 'death receptors' such as Fas/APO-1; and the 'intrinsic' pathway, which is triggered by diverse cellular stresses, and is regulated by pro-survival and pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Pro-survival Mcl-1, which can block activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, appears critical for the survival and maintenance of multiple haemopoietic cell types. To investigate the impact on haemopoiesis of simultaneously inhibiting both apoptosis pathways, we introduced the vavP-Mcl-1 transgene, which causes overexpression of Mcl-1 protein in all haemopoietic lineages, into Fas(lpr/lpr) mice, which lack functional Fas and are prone to autoimmunity. The combined mutations had a modest impact on myelopoiesis, primarily an increase in the macrophage/monocyte population in Mcl-1tg/lpr mice compared with lpr or Mcl-1tg mice. The impact on lymphopoiesis was striking, with a marked elevation in all major lymphoid subsets, including the non-conventional double-negative (DN) T cells (TCRbeta(+)CD4(-)CD8(-)B220(+)) characteristic of Fas(lpr/lpr) mice. Of note, the onset of autoimmunity was markedly accelerated in Mcl-1tg/lpr mice compared with lpr mice, and this was preceded by an increase in immunoglobulin (Ig)-producing cells and circulating autoantibodies. This degree of impact was surprising, given the relatively mild phenotype conferred by the vavP-Mcl-1 transgene by itself: a two- to threefold elevation of peripheral B and T cells, no significant increase in the non-conventional DN T-cell population and no autoimmune disease. Comparison of the phenotype with that of other susceptible mice suggests that the development of autoimmune disease in Mcl-1tg/lpr mice may be influenced not only by Ig-producing cells but also other haemopoietic cell types.",,"['Anstee, Natasha S', 'Vandenberg, Cassandra J', 'Campbell, Kirsteen J', 'Hughes, Peter D', ""O'Reilly, Lorraine A"", 'Cory, Suzanne']","['Anstee NS', 'Vandenberg CJ', 'Campbell KJ', 'Hughes PD', ""O'Reilly LA"", 'Cory S']","['Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Nephrology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161104,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Autoimmune Diseases/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Kidney Diseases/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred MRL lpr', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/11/05 06:00,2018/01/20 06:00,['2016/11/05 06:00'],"['2016/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['cdd2016125 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2016.125 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2017 Mar;24(3):397-408. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2016.125.

The success of these treatments is because normal cells remain unaltered since they are less demanding and/or can synthesize these compounds in sufficient amounts for their needs by other mechanisms. Areas covered: This review is focused on amino acid depriving enzymes and their formulations that have been successfully used in the treatment of several types of cancer and viral infections. Particular attention will be given to the enzymes L-asparaginase, L-arginase, L-arginine deiminase, and L-methionine-gamma-lyase. Expert opinion: The immunogenicity and other toxic effects are perhaps the major limitations of these therapies, but they have been successfully decreased either through the expression of these enzymes from other organisms, recombination processes, pegylation of the selected enzymes or by specific mutations in the proteins. In 2006, FDA has already approved the use of L-asparaginase in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Estrogen receptor (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, (HER2) and progesterone receptor (PR) are three classified makers of breast cancer, which are defined as ER+, HER2+, and the most serious ER-PR-HER2- (triple-negative). It is well known that ErbB2 (V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) plays an important part in breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ErbB2 action needs to be well studied. In this report, we discovered that the decreased expression levels of miR-34a were inversely correlated with the increased ErbB2 levels in breast cancer. A luciferase reporter assay was done to understand the potential correlation between ErbB2 and miR-34a. Over-expression of miR-34a reduces ErbB2 expression and suppresses breast cancer cell invasion and growth in vitro. What's more, reduced expression of ErbB2 inhibits breast Cancer cell proliferation and re-expression of ErbB2 reversed miR-34a-dependent tumor suppression. Meanwhile, miR-34a levels were correlated inversely with breast cancer malignancy. Our study demonstrates that miR-34a, like ErbB2, might be a diagnostic target in breast cancer.",['(c) 2016 International Federation for Cell Biology.'],"['Wang, Yilin', 'Zhang, Xiaolong', 'Chao, Zou', 'Kung, Hsiang-Fu', 'Lin, Marie C', 'Dress, Andreas', 'Wardle, Fiona', 'Jiang, Bing-Hua', 'Lai, Lihui']","['Wang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Chao Z', 'Kung HF', 'Lin MC', 'Dress A', 'Wardle F', 'Jiang BH', 'Lai L']","['Institute of Molecular and Chemical Biology, East China Normal University, North Zhongshan Road, Shanghai, 200062, China.', 'Institute of Molecular and Chemical Biology, East China Normal University, North Zhongshan Road, Shanghai, 200062, China.', 'Institute of Molecular and Chemical Biology, East China Normal University, North Zhongshan Road, Shanghai, 200062, China.', 'Institute of Molecular and Chemical Biology, East China Normal University, North Zhongshan Road, Shanghai, 200062, China.', 'Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Tai Po Rd, Hong Kong.', 'Institute of Molecular and Chemical Biology, East China Normal University, North Zhongshan Road, Shanghai, 200062, China.', 'Brain Tumor Center, Neurosurgery Division, Faculty of Medicine, PWH, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Tai Po Rd, Hong Kong.', 'Institute of Molecular and Chemical Biology, East China Normal University, North Zhongshan Road, Shanghai, 200062, China.', 'CAS-MPG Partner Institute and Key Lab for Computational Biology, SIBS, CAS, Yue Yang Road, Shanghai, 200062, China.', 'Institute of Molecular and Chemical Biology, East China Normal University, North Zhongshan Road, Shanghai, 200062, China.', ""Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, New Hunt's House, King's College London, Guy's Campus, WC2R 2LS, London, UK."", 'State Key lab of Reproductive Medicine, and Department of Pathology, Cancer Center, Nanjing Medical University, Hanzhong Rd, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Thomas Jefferson University, Walnut St, Philadelphia, 19107, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular and Chemical Biology, East China Normal University, North Zhongshan Road, Shanghai, 200062, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161201,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['ErbB2', 'MiR-34a', 'breast cancer']",2016/11/05 06:00,2017/01/24 06:00,['2016/11/05 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbin.10700 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2017 Jan;41(1):93-101. doi: 10.1002/cbin.10700.

Topoisomerase II (TopoII) inhibition and subsequent DNA damage induction by Que was implicated in the mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) rearrangements that can induce infant and adult leukemias. This notion raised concerns regarding possible genotoxicities of Que in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, molecular targets mediating Que effects on DNA repair relevant to MLL translocations have not been defined. In this study we describe novel and potentially genotoxic Que activities in suppressing non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination pathways downstream of MLL cleavage. Using pharmacological dissection of DNA-PK, ATM and PI3K signalling we defined PI3K inhibition by Que with a concomitant decrease in the abundance of key DNA repair genes to be responsible for DNA repair inhibition. Evidence for the downstream TopoII-independent mutagenic potential of Que was obtained by documenting further increased frequencies of MLL rearrangements in human HSPCs concomitantly treated with Etoposide and Que versus single treatments. Importantly, by engaging a tissue engineered placental barrier, we have established the extent of Que transplacental transfer and hence provided the evidence for Que reaching fetal HSPCs. Thus, Que exhibits genotoxic effects in human HSPCs via different mechanisms when applied continuously and at high concentrations. In light of the demonstrated Que transfer to the fetal compartment our findings are key to understanding the mechanisms underlying infant leukemia and provide molecular markers for the development of safety values.",['(c) 2016 UICC.'],"['Biechonski, Shahar', 'Gourevich, Dana', 'Rall, Melanie', 'Aqaqe, Nasma', 'Yassin, Muhammad', 'Zipin-Roitman, Adi', 'Trakhtenbrot, Luba', 'Olender, Leonid', 'Raz, Yael', 'Jaffa, Ariel J', 'Grisaru, Dan', 'Wiesmuller, Lisa', 'Elad, David', 'Milyavsky, Michael']","['Biechonski S', 'Gourevich D', 'Rall M', 'Aqaqe N', 'Yassin M', 'Zipin-Roitman A', 'Trakhtenbrot L', 'Olender L', 'Raz Y', 'Jaffa AJ', 'Grisaru D', 'Wiesmuller L', 'Elad D', 'Milyavsky M']","['Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Gynecological Oncology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Cancer Research Centre, Sheba Medical Centre, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Gynecologic Oncology Division, Lis Maternity Hospital, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Ultrasound Unit in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lis Maternity Hospital, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Gynecologic Oncology Division, Lis Maternity Hospital, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Gynecological Oncology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161122,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Histones/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pregnancy', 'Quercetin/*toxicity', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*toxicity']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA repair', '*MLLbcr', '*PI3K/Akt inhibitor', '*etoposide', '*hematopoietic stem cells', '*leukemia', '*quercetin', '*transplacental transfer']",2016/11/05 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/11/05 06:00'],"['2016/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.30497 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2017 Feb 15;140(4):864-876. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30497.

With an arbitrary cut-off value of 1.5-fold change in gene expression, we identified the down-regulation of 212 genes (M value </=-0.585) and the up-regulation of 158 genes (M value of >/=0.585) at 1% false discovery rate in BLV-positive animals in comparison to the BLV-negative group. The gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed (DE) genes could be classified to diverse biological processes, including immune response of host blood cells. Interestingly, our data indicated the potential involvement of the innate immunity, including complement system activation, NK-cell cytotoxicity and TREM-1 signaling, during the BLV-induced pathogenesis.

This study is aimed to investigate the prevalence of CEBPA mutations and its clinical and prognostic impact in Egyptian patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). This was done using fragment analysis to assess this method as a cheaper and less laborious screening method compared to sequencing. Fluorescent PCR was done to amplify CEBPA gene in DNA extracted from 40 CN-AML patients. This was followed by fragment analysis of post-PCR products using GeneMapper software for detection of CEBPA mutations. CEBPA gene mutations were found in 7/40 CN-AML patients (17.5 %) and it was significantly associated with lower LDH levels (p = 0.039). All patients with CEBPA mutations achieved clinical remission and none of them showed refractoriness, relapsed, or died by the end of the 2 years study period. Furthermore, those patients demonstrate significantly longer overall and disease free survival than those with wild type CEBPA gene (p = 0.001 and 0.004 respectively).

This makes bcr/abl1 a perfect target for developing CML vaccines that elicit specific immune responses against minimal residual disease while sparing normal tissue. The aim of this study was to use different methods to induce dendritic cells (DCs) derived from patients with CML (CML-DCs) and analyze them for CML-specific tumor cytotoxicity for immune therapy. Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells from ten CML patients were studied to induce CML-DC differentiation in the presence of recombinant human interleukin-4, rh-granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha with either a total RNA-lipofectamine complex, total RNA or CML tumor lysate (freeze-thawed). CML-DC maturation, confirmed by expression of CD1alpha, CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86 and by real-time polymerase chain reaction, validated the CML-origin of these DC cells. CML-DCs stimulated cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) apoptosis, high levels of IL-12 secretion, and had significant inhibitory effect on K562 tumorigenicity in nude mice. CML-DCs pulsed with total RNA by lipofectamine transfection produced the strongest effect in tumor-specific CTL functions. These results indicate that CML-DCs transfected with total RNA by lipofectamine induce the strongest CTL cytotoxicity and have the greatest potential for CML immune therapy.

Although it shows most of the canonical features of other SET domains, both the lack of key residues and the presence in the SET-I subdomain of an unusually large loop preclude the interaction of MLL5 SET with its cofactor and substrate.

Anti-mitotics-induced apoptosis is known to involve degradation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins during mitotic arrest; however, it remains unclear how this mechanism accounts for significant heterogeneity observed in the cell death responses both within and between cancer cell types. To unravel quantitative determinants underlying variability in anti-mitotic drug response, we constructed a single-cell dynamical Bcl-2 network model describing cell death control during mitotic arrest, and constrained the model using experimental data from four representative cancer cell lines. The modeling analysis revealed that, given a variable, slowly accumulating pro-apoptotic signal arising from anti-apoptotic protein degradation, generation of a switch-like apoptotic response requires formation of pro-apoptotic Bak complexes with hundreds of subunits, suggesting a crucial role for high-order cooperativity. Moreover, we found that cell-type variation in susceptibility to drug-induced mitotic death arises primarily from differential expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 relative to Bak. The dependence of anti-mitotic drug response on Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 that we derived from the modeling analysis provides a quantitative measure to predict sensitivity of distinct cancer cells to anti-mitotic drug treatment.",,"['Kueh, Hao Yuan', 'Zhu, Yanting', 'Shi, Jue']","['Kueh HY', 'Zhu Y', 'Shi J']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA.', 'Center for Quantitative Systems Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.', 'Center for Quantitative Systems Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Physics and Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.', 'Center for Quantitative Systems Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Physics and Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161104,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antimitotic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,,"['A549 Cells', 'Antimitotic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,,2016/11/05 06:00,2018/05/09 06:00,['2016/11/05 06:00'],"['2016/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['srep36585 [pii]', '10.1038/srep36585 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Nov 4;6:36585. doi: 10.1038/srep36585.,,,PMC5095668,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis of this heritable disorder is poor and bone marrow transplantation is the only effective treatment. Here, by using the TALEN (transcription activator-like effector nuclease) technology, we created a zebrafish mpl mutant to model human CAMT. Disruption of zebrafish mpl lead to a severe reduction in thrombocytes and a high bleeding tendency, as well as deficiencies in adult hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. We further demonstrated that thrombocytopenia in mpl mutant zebrafish was caused by impaired Tpo/Mpl/Jak2 signaling, resulting in reduced proliferation of thrombocyte precursors. These results indicate that mpl mutant zebrafish develop thrombocytopenia resembling the human CAMT. To utilize fully zebrafish to study thrombocyte biology and thrombocytopenia disorders, we generated a transgenic reporter line Tg(mpl:eGFP)smu4, in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was driven by the mpl promoter. Detailed characterization of Tg(mpl:eGFP)smu4 fish confirmed that the thrombocyte lineage was specifically marked by GFP expression.

Stereotyped subsets display a strikingly similar biology of the leukemic clones, referring to many different levels, from the immunogenetic and genetic and extending to the epigenetic and functional levels. Even more importantly, the homogeneity of stereotyped subsets has clinical consequences as patients assigned to the same stereotyped subset generally exhibit an overall similar disease course and outcome. In other words, stereotypy-based patient classification of CLL has already provided a more compartmentalized view of this otherwise heterogeneous disease and can assist in refining prognostication models.

MxA expression was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stained with an antihuman MxA antibody. All data were obtained through the MDS Committee of the Japanese Society of Pediatric Hematology. RESULTS: Twelve patients (67%) had elevated levels of the MxA protein, with rotavirus, RS virus, or CMV infection documented in three of these patients. Although none of the patients had primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, reactivation of the virus was strongly suspected in four children, including two with monosomy 7, each having increased levels of MxA. Southern blot analysis revealed monoclonal integration of the EBV genome into bone marrow mononuclear cells from one of these patients. There was no discernible correlation between increases in the marker protein and the presenting features or course of the disease.

Proportional incidence ratios (PIRs) for 1988 to 1995 were used to compare Southeast Asian children to non-Hispanic white children. RESULTS: Of the Asian children, 4.2% (30/722) were misclassified by subgroup, predominantly Hmong listed as Laotian. The Asian cancer rate was 134.2 versus 159.2 for non-Hispanic whites.

Southeast Asian children had increased PIRs for Burkitt lymphoma (PIR = 2.6) and leukemias not classified as acute lymphocytic leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (PIR = 3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Accurate race/ethnicity classification of Southeast Asian children is a concern. Marked differences were found in the incidence and PIRs of specific cancers among Southeast Asian children, other Asian children, and other children in California.",,"['Ducore, Jonathan M', 'Parikh-Patel, Arti', 'Gold, Ellen B']","['Ducore JM', 'Parikh-Patel A', 'Gold EB']","['From the *Department of Pediatrics, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California; and daggerDepartment of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California.

Pretransplant DNA samples from 696 CBUs with malignant diseases were genotyped for NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, TIRAP/Mal, IL10, REL, TNFRSF1B, and CTLA4. HLA compatibility was 6 of 6 in 10%, 5 of 6 in 39%, and >/=4 of 6 in 51% of transplants. Myeloablative conditioning was used in 80%, and in vivo T-cell depletion in 81%, of cases. The median number of total nucleated cells infused was 3.4 x 10(7)/kg. In multivariable analysis, patients receiving CBUs with GG-CTLA4 genotype had poorer neutrophil recovery (hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; P = .02), increased nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (HR, 1.50; P < .01), and inferior disease-free survival (HR, 1.41; P = .02). We performed the same analysis in a more homogeneous subset of cohort 1 (cohort 2, n = 305) of patients who received transplants for acute leukemia, all given a myeloablative conditioning regimen, and with available allele HLA typing (HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1). In this more homogeneous but smaller cohort, we were able to demonstrate that GG-CTLA4-CBU was associated with increased NRM (HR, 1.85; P = .01). Use of GG-CTLA4-CBU was associated with higher mortality after CBT, which may be a useful criterion for CBU selection, when multiple CBUs are available.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Cunha, Renato', 'Zago, Marco A', 'Querol, Sergio', 'Volt, Fernanda', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Pouthier, Fabienne', 'Kogler, Gesine', 'Vicario, Jose L', 'Bergamaschi, Paola', 'Saccardi, Riccardo', 'Lamas, Carmen H', 'Diaz-de-Heredia, Cristina', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Bittencourt, Henrique', 'Tavella, Marli', 'Panepucci, Rodrigo A', 'Fernandes, Francisco', 'Pavan, Julia', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Cunha R', 'Zago MA', 'Querol S', 'Volt F', 'Ruggeri A', 'Sanz G', 'Pouthier F', 'Kogler G', 'Vicario JL', 'Bergamaschi P', 'Saccardi R', 'Lamas CH', 'Diaz-de-Heredia C', 'Michel G', 'Bittencourt H', 'Tavella M', 'Panepucci RA', 'Fernandes F', 'Pavan J', 'Gluckman E', 'Rocha V']","['Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'University Paris-Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Monaco.', 'Clinical Hospital, Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, Sao Paulo University, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Clinical Hospital, Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, Sao Paulo University, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Barcelona Cord Blood Bank, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'University Paris-Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Monaco.', 'Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'University Paris-Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Monaco.', ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, AP-HP, Paris, France."", 'La Fe University Hospital, Valencia, Spain.', 'Besancon Cord Blood Bank, Besancon, France.', 'Jose Carreras Cord Blood Bank, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Madrid Cord Blood Bank, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pavia Cord Blood Bank, Pavia, Italy.', 'Service of Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine, Policlinico San Matteo, Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Firenze Cord Blood Bank, Firenze, Italy.', 'Malaga Cord Blood Bank, Malaga, Spain.', ""Vall d'Hebron Hospital, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Timone Children Hospital, Marseille, France.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Clinical Hospital, Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, Sao Paulo University, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Clinical Hospital, Ribeirao Preto School of Medicine, Sao Paulo University, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Mathematics Institute, Sao Paulo University, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Mathematics Institute, Sao Paulo University, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'University Paris-Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Monaco.', 'Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'University Paris-Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Monaco.', 'Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom; and.', 'Servico de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia Celular, Sao Paulo University, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161103,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '0 (NLR Proteins)', '0 (NLRP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/immunology/transplantation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'NLR Proteins', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Unrelated Donors']",,,2016/11/05 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/11/05 06:00'],"['2016/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33761-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-06-722249 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jan 26;129(4):525-532. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-06-722249.

Here, we characterize zebrafish with mutations in recombination activating gene 2 (rag2), DNA-dependent protein kinase (prkdc), and janus kinase 3 (jak3). Histology, RNA sequencing, and single-cell transcriptional profiling of blood showed that rag2 hypomorphic mutant zebrafish lack T cells, whereas prkdc deficiency results in loss of mature T and B cells and jak3 in T and putative Natural Killer cells. Although all mutant lines engraft fluorescently labeled normal and malignant cells, only the prkdc mutant fish reproduced as homozygotes and also survived injury after cell transplantation. Engraftment into optically clear casper, prkdc-mutant zebrafish facilitated dynamic live cell imaging of muscle regeneration, repopulation of muscle stem cells within their endogenous niche, and muscle fiber fusion at single-cell resolution. Serial imaging approaches also uncovered stochasticity in fluorescently labeled leukemia regrowth after competitive cell transplantation into prkdc mutant fish, providing refined models to assess clonal dominance and progression in the zebrafish.

Since the discovery of chemotherapeutic agents, ALL has become a model for improvement of survival. In parallel to this, serious side effects were observed and new natural therapeutic options has been discussed. One of these substances is called propolis which is a resinous substance gathered by honeybees. In the molecular era, miRNAs have been shown to play crucial roles in the development of many clinical conditions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Aydin propolis on 81 human miRNA activity in CCRF-SB leukemia cell line. Apoptotic effects of propolis on cell lines were also evaluated and apoptosis were found to be induced 1.5 fold in B-cell leukemia cells. The expression of 63 miRNAs (46 miRNAs were downregulated, 19 miRNAs were upregulated) in propolis treated leukemia cells have changed significantly (p<0.05). In conclusion propolis has changed expression of miRNAs which have epigenetic effects on leukemic cells.

The prognostic significance of such additional chromosomal abnormalities has been controversial. Translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) CCND1-IGH is typically associated with mantle cell lymphoma or a subset of plasma cell myeloma and is exceedingly rare in myeloid neoplasm. Here we report a unique case describing a patient found at diagnosis of chronic phase CML to have both the Philadelphia chromosome as well as t(11;14)-a rare cytogenetic combination. The patient was treated with imatinib with appropriate hematologic response but persistent disease by FISH and RT-PCR. She was switched to dasatinib and eventually achieved cytogenetic remission in both translocations, but still with persistent RT-PCR evidence of BCR-ABL1 fusion. As cyclin D1 is a regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 and is required for the cells to progress through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, overexpression of cyclin D1 will likely promote cells into cell cycle. This may further augment proliferation in addition to upregulated ABL1 kinase activity in the index case. It may also contribute to the resistance to imatinib, as imatinib only targets on BCR-ABL fusion. Therefore, the addition of t(11;14)(q13;q32) may have significant implication in patient management.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although originally developed for supervised analyses, i.e., to test the association between gene sets and an outcome variable, gene set testing also has important unsupervised applications, e.g., p-value weighting. For unsupervised testing, however, few effective gene set testing methods are available with support especially poor for several biologically relevant use cases. RESULTS: In this paper, we describe two new unsupervised gene set testing methods based on random matrix theory, the Marcenko-Pastur Distribution Test (MPDT) and the Tracy-Widom Test (TWT), that support both self-contained and competitive null hypotheses. For the self-contained case, we contrast our proposed tests with the classic multivariate test based on a modified likelihood ratio criterion. For the competitive case, we compare the new tests against a competitive version of the classic test and our recently developed Spectral Gene Set Enrichment (SGSE) method. Evaluation of the TWT and MPDT methods is based on both simulation studies and a weighted p-value analysis of two real gene expression data sets using gene sets drawn from MSigDB collections. CONCLUSIONS: The MPDT and TWT methods are novel and effective tools for unsupervised gene set analysis with superior statistical performance relative to existing techniques and the ability to generate biologically important results on real genomic data sets.",,"['Frost, H Robert', 'Amos, Christopher I']","['Frost HR', 'Amos CI']","['Department of Biomedical Data Science, Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College, Hanover, 03755, NH, USA. rob.frost@dartmouth.edu.', 'Department of Biomedical Data Science, Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College, Hanover, 03755, NH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161104,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,,"['*Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Models, Theoretical']",['NOTNLM'],"['Gene set testing', 'Marcenko-Pastur', 'Pathway analysis', 'Random matrix theory', 'Tracy-Widom']",2016/11/05 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2016/11/05 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/s12859-016-1299-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-016-1299-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2016 Nov 4;17(1):442. doi: 10.1186/s12859-016-1299-8.,,"['U19 CA148127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103534/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 LM012426/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA196386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5096314,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to measure patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in children during the initial 6 months of therapy to characterize function and explore factors associated with function including type of cancer, intensity of therapy, age, and gender. PROCEDURE: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children aged 5-21 newly diagnosed with cancer. PROs were obtained twice monthly over the first 6 months of treatment. The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) was used to measure patient mobility, fatigue, pain interference, peer relationships, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. A generalized linear mixed model was used to analyze changes by domain over time. RESULTS: Forty patients completed the study with a mean age of 11.7 years (standard deviation [SD] 4.7), 60% had leukemia/lymphoma. All patients report improved pain over time (P = 0.008). Patients with central nervous system (CNS)/solid tumor report better mobility (P < 0.001), less fatigue (P < 0.001), less pain (P < 0.001), less anxiety (P < 0.001), fewer depressive symptoms (P < 0.001), and better peer relationships (P = 0.0036). Younger patients report worse mobility (P = 0.017), more fatigue (P = 0.032), more pain (P < 0.001), more anxiety (P = 0.017), and more depressive symptoms (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Pain improved for all patients over the first 6 months of cancer treatment. Age and tumor type also affected patient-reported function for all domains. Understanding the burden of cancer treatment is critical to refine supportive care interventions to minimize the burden of pediatric cancer treatment.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Dobrozsi, Sarah', 'Yan, Ke', 'Hoffmann, Raymond', 'Panepinto, Julie']","['Dobrozsi S', 'Yan K', 'Hoffmann R', 'Panepinto J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, The Medical College of Wisconsin, Wisconsin.', ""Quantitative Health Sciences, Children's Research Institute of the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin."", ""Quantitative Health Sciences, Children's Research Institute of the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, The Medical College of Wisconsin, Wisconsin.', ""Quantitative Health Sciences, Children's Research Institute of the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161103,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', '*Quality of Life', '*Self Report', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*patient-reported outcome measure', '*pediatric cancer']",2016/11/04 06:00,2017/07/21 06:00,['2016/11/04 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26295 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Apr;64(4). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26295.

To identify genes capable of independently imposing Ara-C resistance, we applied a genome-wide CRISPR library to human U937 cells and exposed to them to Ara-C. Interestingly, all drug resistant clones contained guide RNAs for DCK. To avoid DCK gene modification, gRNA resistant DCK cDNA was created by the introduction of silent mutations. The CRISPR screening was repeated using the gRNA resistant DCK, and loss of SLC29A was identified as also being capable of conveying Ara-C drug resistance. To determine if loss of Dck results in increased sensitivity to other drugs, we conducted a screen of 446 FDA approved drugs using two Dck-defective BXH-2 derived murine AML cell lines and their Ara-C sensitive parental lines. Both cell lines showed an increase in sensitivity to prednisolone. Guide RNA resistant cDNA rescue was a legitimate strategy and multiple DCK or SLC29A deficient human cell clones were established with one clone becoming prednisolone sensitive.

Pre-treatment of cells with periodate resulted in significantly higher STD NMR signal intensities for 9-BPC-4-mNPC-Neu5Acalpha2Me as the cells were more susceptible to ligand binding because cis-binding on the cell surface was removed. Quantification of STD NMR effects led to a cell-derived binding epitope of 9-BPC-4-mNPC-Neu5Acalpha2Me that facilitated the design and synthesis of C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-9 tetra-substituted Siglec-2 ligands showing an 88-fold higher affinity compared to 9-BPC-Neu5Acalpha2Me.

However, a common approach in statistical analysis of a suspected cluster is a necessary tool for public health operators who have to face population worries and requests. We propose an approach for the analysis of clusters and discuss the main limitations and strengths of the used methods. To this aim, we present, as a case study, the spatial clustering analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cases among children in Rome between 2000 and 2011. Cases were selected through a record linkage of three different health and administrative current databases. Cases were geocoded at 3 spatial resolutions: 20 districts (D), 155 neighbourhoods (NB), and 5,812 census areas (CA). Indirect standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were computed for the NBs with Rome average incidence rate (IR) of ALL as reference and then smoothed by Besag-York-Mollie (BYM) model. General clustering was tested by Tango statistics, whereas localized clustering was detected through two different statistics: Besag and Newell's, and Kulldorf and Nagarwalla's. Both general and local clustering were tested at city level, using NBs as area units, and at district level, using CAs as area units. We identified 194 ALL cases in the 0-14 age group (IR: 43.7x1,000,000). SIRs ranged between 0.00 and 18.1 among NBs. After smoothing, a significant excess of cases was identified only in 3 Ds. At city level, no general clustering was highlighted (Tango's test p-value: 0.08), while both tests for local clustering were significant in one of the 3 Ds with the highest SIRs. Finally, at district level, although no general cluster was founded, a total of 7 clusters were identified in the 3 Ds with the highest SIRs, each cluster being composed by a number of cases ranging between 2 and 6. Results indicate the presence of clusters in some areas of Rome, which are evident only when the finest spatial resolution is used.

This paper summarizes the studies about clusters of childhood leukaemia in the international context and in Italy, and discusses the aetiological hypotheses particularly in reference to exposures in the area of residence. Thirty-three cluster studies have been identified through a literature search performed using the PubMed bibliographic database, websites of main national and international health authorities, and relevant reviews published on this topic. Most of leukaemia cluster studies were conducted following an alarm in the nearby areas of a point source of toxic substances as nuclear power plants, chemical-industrial sites, military bases, broadcasting antennas. As alternative explanation, in several clusters an infectious aetiology was hypothesized (population mixing or delayed infection hypothesis).

At the beginning, these protocols were used in few well-trained centres, later in almost all Italian haemato-oncological centres. The need of a careful monitoring of his own activity induced AIEOP to achieve, in 1989, an Italian hospital- based registry (database Mod.1.01) of malignant tumours diagnosed and treated in the participating centres, with the aim to quantify the number of cases diagnosed and treated in the different centres, the agreement (or not) to official diagnostic- therapeutic protocols, and the extraregional migration. The database Mod.1.01, which is available via web to the current 55 AIEOP centres since 2000, recruits annually about 1,400 children (0-14 years) and 200 adolescents (15-19 years). While the first accounts for over 90% of expected subjects, the latter are only 25%. Leukaemias (30% of cases) are the most frequent childhood cancers, followed by central nervous system (CNS) tumours and lymphomas, 18% of cases both. In children, leukaemias (34%) are prevalent, mostly acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (26%), followed by CNS tumours (18%); in adolescents, lymphomas (30%) are prevalent, mostly Hodgkin lymphomas (22%), followed by bone sarcomas (16%). The recruitment of registered cases in AIEOP protocols is overall good both for children (70%) and for adolescents (60%), achieving outstanding results in leukaemia protocols. Extraregional migration of patients for diagnosis and therapy is decreasing over time, being currently about 20%, higher in adolescents, in solid tumours, and in residents in South Italy and in the islands. On the contrary, an increase of subjects born and resident abroad who are hospitalised in AIEOP centres for diagnosis and treatment, accounting at present for 5% of all cases, was observed.

Two issues have been underlined in most definitions of cancer clusters reported in the literature over the last 30 years. The first is the need for an unbiased methodological approach for the detection and the interpretation of clustering and of individual clusters. The other is the responsibility for scientists and public health workers to unravel suspicious events and to interact with the population in circumstances which may turn out to be false alarms. The relative weight given to epidemiological methods and to risk perception has varied between definitions of clusters given in different periods. In the field of childhood cancer clusters, epidemiological research has produced very little fresh knowledge. However, it is recognized that this is not a sufficient reason for refusing to pay attention to reports of perceived clusters. Models of spatio-temporal interactions according to Birch et al. (2000) are taken in consideration: the literature offers a very limited number of circumstances fitting such models. In Italy, over the years, only two childhood cancer clusters have been reported in the indexed literature, both of them regarded cases of acute lymphatic leukaemia and occurred in Sardinia in the Eighties and in the area of Roma in the Nineties. A possible reason for the paucity of reports (compared, for instance, to the UK scenario) is the limited availability of health statistics.",,"['Maule, Milena', 'Terracini, Benedetto']","['Maule M', 'Terracini B']","['Unita di epidemiologia dei tumori, Dipartimento di scienze mediche, Universita di Torino e Centro per la prevenzione oncologica della Regione Piemonte, Torino. milena.maule@unito.it.', 'Unita di epidemiologia dei tumori, Dipartimento di scienze mediche, Universita di Torino e Centro per la prevenzione oncologica della Regione Piemonte, Torino. benedetto.terracini@fastwebnet.it.']",['ita'],"['Journal Article', 'English Abstract']",,Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,,,,,,,2016/11/04 06:00,2016/11/04 06:01,['2016/11/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/04 06:01 [medline]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['3501 [pii]'],ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 2016 Sep-Oct;40(5Suppl2):5-8.,Epidemiologia dei tumori infantili ed evidenze della tendenza all'aggregazione dei casi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an example, structure modeling methods were used to investigate the relation between mutation-caused misfolding of protein and human diseases including epilepsy and leukemia. Protein structure prediction and modeling were also applied in nucleotide-gated channels and their interaction interfaces to investigate their roles in brain and heart cells. In molecular mechanism studies of plants, rice salinity tolerance mechanism was studied via structure modeling on crucial proteins identified by systems biology analysis; trait-associated protein-protein interactions were modeled, which sheds some light on the roles of mutations in soybean oil/protein content.

This process renders APL cells resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapies. Epigenetic regulators of the histone deacetylases (HDACs) family, which comprise four classes (I-IV), critically control the development and progression of APL. We set out to clarify the parameters that determine the interaction between ATRA and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). Our assays included drugs against class I HDACs (MS-275, VPA, and FK228), pan-HDACi (LBH589, SAHA), and the novel HDAC6-selective compound Marbostat-100. We demonstrate that ATRA protects APL cells from cytotoxic effects of SAHA, MS-275, and Marbostat-100. However, LBH589 and FK228, which have a superior substrate-inhibitor dissociation constant (Ki) for the class I deacetylases HDAC1, 2, 3, are resistant against ATRA-dependent cytoprotective effects. We further show that HDACi evoke DNA damage, measured as induction of phosphorylated histone H2AX and by the comet assay. The ability of ATRA to protect APL cells from the induction of p-H2AX by HDACi is a readout for the cytoprotective effects of ATRA. Moreover, ATRA increases the fraction of cells in the G1 phase, together with an accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and a reduced expression of thymidylate synthase (TdS). In contrast, the ATRA-dependent activation of the transcription factors STAT1, NF-kappaB, and C/EBP hardly influences the responses of APL cells to HDACi. We conclude that the affinity of HDACi for class I HDACs determines whether such drugs can kill naive and maturated APL cells.",,"['Noack, Katrin', 'Mahendrarajah, Nisintha', 'Hennig, Dorle', 'Schmidt, Luisa', 'Grebien, Florian', 'Hildebrand, Dagmar', 'Christmann, Markus', 'Kaina, Bernd', 'Sellmer, Andreas', 'Mahboobi, Siavosh', 'Kubatzky, Katharina', 'Heinzel, Thorsten', 'Kramer, Oliver H']","['Noack K', 'Mahendrarajah N', 'Hennig D', 'Schmidt L', 'Grebien F', 'Hildebrand D', 'Christmann M', 'Kaina B', 'Sellmer A', 'Mahboobi S', 'Kubatzky K', 'Heinzel T', 'Kramer OH']","['Integrated Research and Treatment Center, Center for Sepsis Control and Care (CSCC), Jena University Hospital, Erlanger Allee 101, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Biomedicine (CMB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Hans-Knoll-Strasse 2, 07745, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Toxicology, University Medical Center, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 67, 55131, Mainz, Germany.', 'Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, J.B.

We demonstrate that CALR mutations activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in 293T cells in the presence of thrombopoietin receptor (MPL). Human megakaryocytic CMK11-5 cells and erythroleukemic F-36P-MPL cells with knocked-in CALR mutations showed increased growth and acquisition of cytokine-independent growth, respectively, accompanied by STAT5 phosphorylation. Transgenic mice expressing a human CALR mutation with a 52 bp deletion (CALRdel52-transgenic mice (TG)) developed ET, with an increase in platelet count, but not hemoglobin level or white blood cell count, in association with an increase in bone marrow (BM) mature megakaryocytes. CALRdel52 BM cells did not drive away wild-type (WT) BM cells in in vivo competitive serial transplantation assays, suggesting that the self-renewal capacity of CALRdel52 hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) was comparable to that of WT HSCs. Therapy with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor ruxolitinib ameliorated the thrombocytosis in TG mice and attenuated the increase in number of BM megakaryocytes and HSCs. Taken together, our study provides a model showing that the C-terminal of mutant CALR activated JAK-STAT signaling specifically downstream of MPL and may have a central role in CALR-induced myeloproliferative neoplasms.",,"['Shide, K', 'Kameda, T', 'Yamaji, T', 'Sekine, M', 'Inada, N', 'Kamiunten, A', 'Akizuki, K', 'Nakamura, K', 'Hidaka, T', 'Kubuki, Y', 'Shimoda, H', 'Kitanaka, A', 'Honda, A', 'Sawaguchi, A', 'Abe, H', 'Miike, T', 'Iwakiri, H', 'Tahara, Y', 'Sueta, M', 'Hasuike, S', 'Yamamoto, S', 'Nagata, K', 'Shimoda, K']","['Shide K', 'Kameda T', 'Yamaji T', 'Sekine M', 'Inada N', 'Kamiunten A', 'Akizuki K', 'Nakamura K', 'Hidaka T', 'Kubuki Y', 'Shimoda H', 'Kitanaka A', 'Honda A', 'Sawaguchi A', 'Abe H', 'Miike T', 'Iwakiri H', 'Tahara Y', 'Sueta M', 'Hasuike S', 'Yamamoto S', 'Nagata K', 'Shimoda K']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Organization for Promotion of Tenure Track, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Ultrastructural Cell Biology, Department of Anatomy, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161103,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/chemically induced/etiology', 'Nitriles', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/drug therapy/genetics']",,,2016/11/04 06:00,2017/09/13 06:00,['2016/11/04 06:00'],"['2016/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016308 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.308 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 May;31(5):1136-1144. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.308.

Several studies reveal that malignancies in children can originate in utero. However, a diagnostic approach to distinguish between cancers initiated pre- or postnatally is absent. Here we identified a transcriptional factor FEV (fifth Ewing variant) that was expressed in fetal hematopoietic cells and became silent after birth. We characterized that FEV was essential for the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We next found that FEV was expressed in most infant leukemia samples, but seldom in adult samples, in accord with the known prenatal origins of the former. We further determined the majority of pediatric acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were FEV positive.

Cutaneous neoplasms of dendritic cell origin are uncommon and mostly represented by histiocytic lesions derived primarily from Langerhans cells. The myeloid DC (mDC) while recognized in the immunology literature does not have a well-defined neoplastic cutaneous counterpart. Eleven patients with a diagnosis of cutaneous mDC dyscrasia were evaluated. Routine hematoxylin and eosin stain were performed followed by selective phenotypic studies. The patients were older without a gender predilection and exhibited an asymptomatic papular skin rash with a waxing and waning course. The biopsies demonstrated a dermal based monomorphic small mononuclear cell infiltrate. The cells expressed CD14, CD11c, HLA-DR, as well as granzyme and lysozyme that defines terminally differentiated monocyte/dendritic cells. Expression of BDCA-3 (CD141) by the tumor cells indicated that they were myeloid dendritic cells (mDC2). Each patient had a prior or subsequent diagnosis of an abnormal bone marrow biopsy that included myelodysplastic syndrome, myelofibrosis, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myelogenous leukemia. We propose the term cutaneous mDC cell dyscrasia for distinctive infiltrates of differentiated mDCs reflective of underlying myeloproliferative disease.

In contrast, detailed clinicopathologic analyses of bone marrow (BM) PCs have not been previously reported. METHODS: The PCs in 88 CLL/SLL BMs from 45 patients (pts) were graded (0-4) and were correlated with other morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and laboratory features. RESULTS: Proliferation centers were present in 69 BMs (78%) from 32 pts (71%) and were distinct/prominent (grades 2-4) in 21 pts (47%), with the latter more commonly found in follow-up BMs (1/7 diagnostic BMs vs 49/81 follow-up BMs; P=.04). When present, PCs were most commonly graded as distinct nodules easily visible on x10. No relationships were identified between PCs and any complete blood count parameter, serum lactate dehydrogenase or IgG levels, degree or pattern of BM involvement, blood morphology, CD38 and FMC7 expression by flow cytometry, or fluorescence in situ hybridization results, when the first encountered BM was considered for each patient. CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first detailed analysis of PCs in CLL/SLL BMs. In our tertiary center, PCs were seen frequently, in approximately three-fourths of cases.

Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the strength of the association between cigarette smoking and risk of CML in this study. Quality assessments were performed on the studies with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. I2 index was used to evaluate heterogeneity. Finally, publication bias was assessed through funnel plots and Begger's test. RESULTS: No significant association was observed between ever-smokers and CML when compared among non-smokers (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.99-1.29) or between subgroups stratified by smoking history, gender, geographical region, study design and source of patients. Our results demonstrate that this association was stronger in individuals who smoked <20 cigarettes/day (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.06-2.79) vs. individuals who smoked >20 cigarettes/day (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.55-2.81). Moreover, cumulative smoking of <15, 15-30 and >30 pack-years was associated with ORs of 1.22, 1.32 and 1.39, respectively (P < 0.001, for trend). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that smoking may significantly increase the risk of CML in a dose-dependent manner. However, additional well-designed, prospective cohort studies are required to verify these findings and identify other risk factors associated with CML.",,"['Qin, Ling', 'Deng, Hui-Yang', 'Chen, Sheng-Jiang', 'Wei, Wei']","['Qin L', 'Deng HY', 'Chen SJ', 'Wei W']","['a Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine , Henan University of Science and Technology , Luoyang , Henan , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine , Henan University of Science and Technology , Luoyang , Henan , China.', 'b Department of Ultrasound, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine , Henan University of Science and Technology , Luoyang , Henan , China.', 'a Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine , Henan University of Science and Technology , Luoyang , Henan , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20161102,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects/*epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukaemia', '*case-control/cohort study', '*cigarette smoking', '*epidemiology', '*meta-analysis', '*risk factors']",2016/11/04 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2016/11/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2016.1232011 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2017 May;22(4):193-200. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2016.1232011.

However, the challenges of targeting a protein-protein interaction delayed the discovery of fit-for-purpose molecules until the mid-2000s. Since then, a series of high affinity small organic molecules that inhibits the interaction of BCL2 with the apoptotic machinery, the so-called BH3-mimetics, have been developed. Venetoclax (formerly ABT-199) is the first to achieve US Food and Drug Administration approval, with an indication for treatment of patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) bearing deletion of the long arm of chromosome 17. Here, we review key aspects of the science underpinning the clinical application of BCL2 inhibitors and explore both our current knowledge and unresolved questions about its clinical utility, both in CLL and in other B-cell malignancies that highly express BCL2.","['(c) 2016 The Authors Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics published by Wiley', 'Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and', 'Therapeutics.']","['Roberts, A W', 'Huang, Dcs']","['Roberts AW', 'Huang D']","['Integrated Department of Clinical Hematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Parkville, Australia.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry, and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Parkville, Australia.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry, and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161126,United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,,2016/11/03 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/11/03 06:00'],"['2016/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cpt.553 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2017 Jan;101(1):89-98. doi: 10.1002/cpt.553.

In this study, we examined the role of the glutamine (Gln) utilization pathway in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary AML samples. Our results indicate that a subset of AML cell lines is sensitive to Gln deprivation. Glutaminase (GLS) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of Gln to glutamate. One of the two GLS isoenzymes, GLS1 is highly expressed in cancer and encodes two different isoforms: kidney (KGA) and glutaminase C (GAC). We analyzed mRNA expression of GLS1 splicing variants, GAC and KGA, in several large AML datasets and identified increased levels of expression in AML patients with complex cytogenetics and within specific molecular subsets. Inhibition of glutaminase by allosteric GLS inhibitor bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1, 2, 4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulfide or by novel, potent, orally bioavailable GLS inhibitor CB-839 reduced intracellular glutamate levels and inhibited growth of AML cells. In cell lines and patient samples harboring IDH1/IDH2 (Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2) mutations, CB-839 reduced production of oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, inducing differentiation.

Different cytokines play important roles in breast cancer initiation and progression. Here, we show that of the 39 interleukin (IL) genes, IL-20 is the only gene over-expressed in MCF-7 cells treated with estradiol (E2) and that induction of IL-20 expression by estrogen was epigenetically regulated. Methylation of histone H3K4 in the IL-20 promoter was shown to occur via the specific recruitment of KMT2B by estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), but not by other members of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) family of histone methyltransferases. Depletion of KMT2B, or IL-20, disrupts estrogen signaling, attenuates cell proliferation, reduces colony formation, and results in cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we demonstrated that KMT2B-mediated epigenetic modification also affected the expression of several ERalpha target genes. IL-20 and KMT2B expression were also associated with ERalpha-positive breast cancer tissues. We have revealed an important role for KMT2B in the epigenetic transcriptional regulation of cytokine IL-20, and other ERalpha-responsive genes, in breast cancer cells.

This study investigated the crosstalk between EGFR and VEGFR2 signaling in two hematological in vitro models: THP1, a human monocytic leukemia, and Raji, a Burkitt's lymphoma, cell lines. Results showed that both cell lines express EGFR and VEGFR2 and responded to EGF stimulation by activating EGFR, triggering VEGF production and phosphorylating ERK, AKT, and p38 very early, with a peak of expression at 10-20min. Blocking EGFR using Tyrphostin resulted in inhibiting EGFR induced activation of ERK, AKT, and p38. In addition, EGF stimulation caused a significant and immediate increase, within 1min, in pVEGFR2 in both cell lines, which peaked at ~5-10 min after treatment. Selective inhibition of VEGFR2 by DMH4, anti-VEGFR2 antibody or siRNA diminished EGF-induced pAKT and pERK, indicating a positive feedback exerted by EGFR-induced VEGF. Similarly, the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002, suppressed AKT and ERK phosphorylation showing that VEGF feedback is PI3K-dependent. On the other hand, phosphorylation of p38, initiated by EGFR and independent of VEGF feedback, was diminished using PLC inhibitor U73122. Moreover, measurement of intracellular [Ca2+] and ROS following VEGFR2 inhibition and EGF treatment proved that VEGFR2 is not implicated in EGF-induced Ca2+ release whereas it boosts EGF-induced ROS production. Furthermore, a significant decrease in pAKT, pERK and p-p38 was shown following the addition of the ROS inhibitor NAC.

Despite their low relative recurrence risk, this group accounts for the overall largest relapse proportion. PROCEDURE: To evaluate potential risk factors in our population-based cohort of patients with HD ALL enrolled in four Austrian ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster) studies from 1986 to 2010 (n = 210), we reviewed the clinical, laboratory, and cytogenetic data of the respective cases in relation to their outcome. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of the entire group was 83.1 +/- 2.7% and 92.0 +/- 1.9%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that trisomy 17 was significantly associated with a better EFS and OS, whereas trisomy 10 and a modal chromosome number (MCN) > 53 chromosomes were significantly associated with a better OS. Except for the latter, findings remained valid in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous studies, our retrospective analysis shows that MCN and specific trisomies are relevant prognostic indicators in an ALL-BFM cohort of patients with HD ALL. However, considering the current dominant role of minimal residual disease monitoring for prognostic stratification in ALL, including this particular subgroup, it is unlikely that this information is compelling enough to be utilized for refined risk classification in future ALL-BFM treatment protocols.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Reismuller, Bettina', 'Steiner, Manuel', 'Pichler, Herbert', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Urban, Christian', 'Meister, Bernhard', 'Schmitt, Klaus', 'Potschger, Ulrike', 'Konig, Margit', 'Mann, Georg', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe']","['Reismuller B', 'Steiner M', 'Pichler H', 'Dworzak M', 'Urban C', 'Meister B', 'Schmitt K', 'Potschger U', 'Konig M', 'Mann G', 'Haas OA', 'Attarbaschi A']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Kepler University Hospital, Linz, Austria.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20161102,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol', 'Chromosome 17 trisomy']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mosaicism', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', '*Trisomy', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cytogenetics', '*high hyperdiploid karyotype', '*outcome', '*trisomies']",2016/11/03 06:00,2017/09/01 06:00,['2016/11/03 06:00'],"['2016/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26327 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Jun;64(6). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26327.

We then developed a biochemical purification procedure that allowed us to purify the factor(s) with stimulatory activity and analyzed them by nanoliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS). Using nanoLC-MS/MS we have identified several proteins which were further processed using various bioinformatics tools. This resulted in eight protein candidates which might be responsible for the growth activity on non-growing LD ALL3 cells and their involvement in the stimulatory activity are discussed.","['(c) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

METHODS: A total of 462 patients diagnosed with thoracic ESCC underwent radical esophagectomy between March 2001 and May 2010 at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center. Clinical characteristics, CD44 expression, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) levels were evaluated in 198 patients who underwent R0 dissection with long-term follow-up. Partial Cox regression analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to validate the selected risk factors. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 54 months, the 5-year local failure-free survival (LFFS) rate of 198 patients was 62.5%. Multivariate analysis revealed that T stage (p = 0.043), pathological positive tumor above the carina (p = 0.000), CD44 expression level (p = 0.045) and TIL level (p = 0.007) were prognostic factors for LFFS, while the Cox model with risk scores had an area under the curve value of 83.6% for the prediction of 5-year LFFS. The best cut-off value (sum score = 11.19) was used to determine the high- and low-risk groups, with patients at high risk having a significantly shorter 5-year LFFS than patients at low risk (p = 0.000). The LRR pattern revealed significantly high incidences of recurrent disease at the supraclavicular and cervical sites, mediastinum (above the carina), and anastomosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our predictive model was able to distinguish between patients at high risk for LRR and patients at low risk for LRR. LRR primarily involved the upper thorax and this area must be considered in future study designs for radical trimodality treatment.",,"['Liu, ShiLiang', 'Anfossi, Simone', 'Qiu, Bo', 'Zheng, YuZhen',

METHODS: HCECs were cultured in vitro. They were randomly divided into 4 groups, including control group, Aspergillus fumigatus group, GW5074 (an inhibitor of Raf-1) group and Laminarin [an inhibitor of Dendriti-cell-associated C-type lectin 1 (Dectin-1)] group. The protein expression level of total Raf-1 and p-Raf-1was measured by Western blot. The expression of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA in each group was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In Aspergillus fumigatus group, total Raf-1 protein levels in HCECs remained unchanged at 5, 15, 30 and 45min after infection, while p-Raf-1 expression was significantly enhanced at 30min after infection compared with control group. However, the expression of p-Raf-1 was apparently declined after treated with GW5074 or Laminarin compared with Aspergillus fumigatus group. The expression levels of IL-6, IL-8 mRNA were significantly increased after stimulation with fumigatus compared with control group. Pre-treated with GW5074 significantly inhibited Aspergillus fumigatus-induced upregulation of IL-8 and IL-6.

The patient had recurrent fever while neutropenic, without experiencing abdominal pain or tenderness on physical examination. His diagnosis was delayed by the fact that he had no localizing symptoms. DISCUSSION: Neutropenic enterocolitis is a common complication, generally occurring in patients who are severely neutropenic; the condition presents with fever and abdominal pain. No cases of painless neutropenic enterocolitis have yet been reported. Review of the literature shows that patients can develop this condition in the absence of fever and, sometimes, neutropenia. Furthermore, few comprehensive studies or reviews have investigated the utility of computed tomography imaging in identifying a source for abdominal pain in neutropenic patients with fever.

The role of adjuvant chemotherapy and surgical staging is debated. Patients and methods: Data from 144 patients with stage I MOGTs were collected among MITO centers (Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian Cancer) and analyzed. Results: Fifty-five (38.2%) patients were affected by dysgerminomas, 49 (34%) by immature teratomas, 26 (18.1%) by yolk sac tumors and 14 (9.7%) by mixed tumors. Seventy-three (50.7%) patients receive surgery plus chemotherapy, while 71 (49.3%) patients underwent surgery alone. The latter group included 32 dysgerminomas (14 IA-13 Ix, 3 IB, and 2 IC), 34 immature teratomas (20 1A-13 IA grade 1, 6 Ix, 1 IB, and 7 IC), 4 mixed tumors and 1 yolk sac tumor. Forty-four patients did not received chemotherapy, even if it would have been indicated by recommended approach. 94 (65.3%) patients received peritoneal surgical staging. Twenty-three (15.9%) developed a recurrence. Incomplete surgical staging was associated with recurrence (P < 0.05; OR 2.37) at Cox regression analysis. Seven patients died. Four patients were affected by yolk sac tumors, two by mixed tumors and one by immature teratoma. Five patients died for disease, one for acute leukemia and one for suicide. Prognostic parameter analyses showed that yolk sac component is a predictor for survival (P < 0.05). Five-years OS rates were 96.8% and 88.7% in the surgically staged and the incomplete staged group, respectively, while 93.8% and 94.1% in the standard treatment and in the surveillance group, respectively. Conclusions: This study shows that surveillance seems not to affect survival; chemotherapy should be reserved for relapse resulting in high cure rate. Incomplete peritoneal surgical staging is associated with recurrence. Yolk sac histology worsens the prognosis.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Elderly patients with CLL are heterogeneous with regard both to the biology of their disease and aging. Following the diagnosis of CLL in an elderly individual, careful risk assessment is essential when treatment options are evaluated. This includes not only clinical staging and evaluation of disease-specific prognostic biomarkers such as 17p deletion and TP53 mutation, but also of comorbidities, physical capacity, nutritional status, cognitive capacity, ability to perform activities of daily living and social support. Comorbidity scoring and geriatric assessment tools are helpful in achieving such multidimensional evaluation in a systematic manner. The introduction of new drugs including novel monoclonal antibodies and kinase inhibitors offers enhanced opportunities for the treatment of elderly patients with CLL. This position paper of a Task Force of the International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) reviews currently available evidence relevant to such patients. All types of elderly patient (i.e. chronological age > 65-70 years) are considered, from robust (fit) to vulnerable (unfit) to the terminally ill. Among the topics covered are the following: (i) the relationship between chronological age, prognosis and survival, (ii) assessment of biological aging, (iii) biological age as a determinant of treatment feasibility and tolerance and (iv) tailoring of both first and further-line treatment to the circumstances of the individual patient.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Here, we present 27 patients with relapsed CLL following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) who subsequently received ibrutinib salvage therapy. Sixteen of these patients were part of multi-institutional clinical trials and achieved an overall response rate of 87.5%. An additional 11 patients were treated at Stanford University following US Food and Drug Administration approval of ibrutinib; 7 (64%) achieved a complete response, and 3 (27%) achieved a partial response. Of the 9 patients treated at Stanford who had mixed chimerism-associated CLL relapse, 4 (44%) converted to full donor chimerism following ibrutinib initiation, in association with disease response. Four of 11 (36%) patients evaluated by ClonoSeq achieved minimal residual disease negativity with CLL <1/10 000 white blood cells, which persisted even after ibrutinib was discontinued, in 1 case even after 26 months. None of the 27 patients developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) following ibrutinib initiation. We postulate that ibrutinib augments the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) benefit through a T-cell-mediated effect, most likely due to ITK inhibition. To investigate the immune modulatory effects of ibrutinib, we completed comprehensive immune phenotype characterization of peripheral B and T cells from treated patients. Our results show that ibrutinib selectively targets pre-germinal B cells and depletes Th2 helper cells. Furthermore, these effects persisted after drug discontinuation.

Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that the capacity of immunogenic cell death to (re-)activate an anticancer immune response is key to the success of various chemo- and radiotherapeutic regimens. Malignant blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exposed multiple DAMPs, including calreticulin (CRT), heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), and HSP90 on their plasma membrane irrespective of treatment. In these patients, high levels of surface-exposed CRT correlated with an increased proportion of natural killer cells and effector memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the periphery. Moreover, CRT exposure on the plasma membrane of malignant blasts positively correlated with the frequency of circulating T cells specific for leukemia-associated antigens, indicating that ecto-CRT favors the initiation of anticancer immunity in patients with AML. Finally, although the levels of ecto-HSP70, ecto-HSP90, and ecto-CRT were all associated with improved relapse-free survival, only CRT exposure significantly correlated with superior overall survival. Thus, CRT exposure represents a novel powerful prognostic biomarker for patients with AML, reflecting the activation of a clinically relevant AML-specific immune response.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Fucikova, Jitka', 'Truxova, Iva', 'Hensler, Michal', 'Becht, Etienne', 'Kasikova, Lenka', 'Moserova, Irena', 'Vosahlikova, Sarka', 'Klouckova, Jana', 'Church, Sarah E', 'Cremer, Isabelle', 'Kepp, Oliver', 'Kroemer, Guido', 'Galluzzi, Lorenzo', 'Salek, Cyril', 'Spisek, Radek']","['Fucikova J', 'Truxova I', 'Hensler M', 'Becht E', 'Kasikova L', 'Moserova I', 'Vosahlikova S', 'Klouckova J', 'Church SE', 'Cremer I', 'Kepp O', 'Kroemer G', 'Galluzzi L', 'Salek C', 'Spisek R']","['Department of Immunology, Charles University, 2nd Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Sotio, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, Charles University, 2nd Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Sotio, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Sotio, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'INSERM, U1138, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie/Paris VI, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes/Paris 5, Paris, France.', 'Department of Immunology, Charles University, 2nd Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Sotio, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, Charles University, 2nd Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Sotio, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Sotio, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, 1st Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'INSERM, U1138, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie/Paris VI, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes/Paris 5, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1138, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie/Paris VI, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes/Paris 5, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1138, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie/Paris VI, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes/Paris 5, Paris, France.', 'Equipe 11 labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Metabolomics and Cell Biology Platforms, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM, U1138, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie/Paris VI, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes/Paris 5, Paris, France.', 'Equipe 11 labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Metabolomics and Cell Biology Platforms, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, France.', 'Pole de Biologie, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, Paris, France.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'INSERM, U1138, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie/Paris VI, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes/Paris 5, Paris, France.', 'Equipe 11 labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic;

Cancer chemotherapy requires continuous monitoring of the plasma concentration levels of active forms of cytotoxic drugs and subsequent dose adjustment. In order to attain optimum therapeutic efficacy, correlation to pharmacogenetics data is crucial. In this study, a specific, accurate and sensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been developed for determination of methotrexate (MTX), 6-mercaptopurine (MP) and its metabolite 6-thioguanine nucleotide (TG) in human plasma. Based on the basic character of the studied compounds, solid phase extraction using a strong cation exchanger was found the optimum approach to achieve good extraction recovery. Chromatographic separation was carried out using RP-HPLC and isocratic elution by acetonitrile: 0.1% aqueous formic acid (85:15v/v) with a flow rate of 0.8mL/min at 40 degrees C. The detection was performed by tandem mass spectrometry in MRM mode via electrospray ionization source in positive ionization mode. Analysis was carried out within 1.0min over a concentration range of 6.25-200.00ng/mL for the studied analytes. Validation was carried out according to FDA guidelines for bioanalytical method validation and satisfactory results were obtained. The applicability of the assay for the monitoring of the MTX, MP and TG and subsequent application to personalized therapy was demonstrated in a clinical study on children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Results confirmed the need for implementation of reliable analysis tools for therapeutic dose adjustment.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Since than much progress has been made and nowadays Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is considered the most effective treatment of numerous severe haematological diseases. Gynaecological complications in HSCT women represent a serious concern for these patients, but often underestimated by clinicians in the view of Overall Survival. The main gynaecological complications of HSCT are represented by: premature ovarian failure (POF), thrombocytopenia-associated menorrhagia, genital symptoms or sexual problems in course of chronic GVHD (cGVHD), osteoporosis, secondary solid tumours due to immunosuppressive drugs to treat cGVHD and severity of cGVHD, and fertility and pregnancy issues. In particular fertility-related issues are always more relevant for patients, whose life expectation is constantly growing up after HSCT.Thus, taking care of a patient undergoing HSCT should primarily include gynaecological evaluation, even before conditioning regimen or chemotherapy for the underlying malignancy, as, in our opinion, it is of great importance to ensure a complete diagnostic work-up and intervention options to guarantee maximum reproductive health and a better quality of life in HSCT women.The present review aims at describing principal features of the aforementioned gynaecological complications of HSCT, and to define, on the basis of current international literature, a specific protocol for the prevention, diagnosis, management and follow-up of gynaecological complications of both autologous and heterologous transplantation, before and after the procedure.",,"['Guida, Maurizio', 'Castaldi, Maria Antonietta', 'Rosamilio, Rosa', 'Giudice, Valentina', 'Orio, Francesco', 'Selleri, Carmine']","['Guida M', 'Castaldi MA', 'Rosamilio R', 'Giudice V', 'Orio F', 'Selleri C']","['Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy.', 'Ph.

Support and palliation are the only current therapies. Objective: To evaluate the safety and wound outcomes following genetically corrected autologous epidermal grafts in patients with RDEB. Design, Setting, and Participants: Single-center phase 1 clinical trial conducted in the United States of 4 patients with severe RDEB with a measured area of wounds suitable for grafting of at least 100 cm2. Patients with undetectable type VII collagen keratinocyte expression were excluded. Interventions: Autologous keratinocytes isolated from biopsy samples collected from 4 patients with RDEB were transduced with good manufacturing practice-grade retrovirus carrying full-length human COL7A1 and assembled into epidermal sheet grafts. Type VII collagen gene-corrected grafts (approximately 35 cm2) were transplanted onto 6 wounds in each of the patients (n = 24 grafts). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary safety outcomes were recombination competent retrovirus, cancer, and autoimmune reaction. Molecular correction was assessed as type VII collagen expression measured by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Wound healing was assessed using serial photographs taken at 3, 6, and 12 months after grafting. Results: The 4 patients (mean age, 23 years [range, 18-32 years]) were all male with an estimated body surface area affected with RDEB of 4% to 30%. All 24 grafts were well tolerated without serious adverse events. Type VII collagen expression at the dermal-epidermal junction was demonstrated on the graft sites by immunofluorescence microscopy in 9 of 10 biopsy samples (90%) at 3 months, in 8 of 12 samples (66%) at 6 months, and in 5 of 12 samples (42%) at 12 months, including correct type VII collagen localization to anchoring fibrils. Wounds with recombinant type VII collagen graft sites displayed 75% or greater healing at 3 months (21 intact graft sites of 24 wound sites; 87%), 6 months (16/24; 67%), and 12 months (12/24; 50%) compared with baseline wound sites. Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary study of 4 patients with RDEB, there was wound healing in some type VII collagen gene-corrected grafts, but the response was variable among patients and among grafted sites and generally declined over 1 year. Long-term follow-up is necessary for these patients, and controlled trials are needed with a broader range of patients to better understand the potential long-term efficacy of genetically corrected autologous epidermal grafts.

These rearrangements are commonly detected by conventional and molecular cytogenetic techniques. OBJECTIVE: Using an alternative method, we sought to highlight the presence of chromosomal rearrangements. METHODS: We applied molecular combing to detect and directly visualize gene fusions associated with balanced translocations found in acute leukemia. RESULTS: In patients harboring t(12;21)(p13;q22), we demonstrated the presence of the fusion using specific probes covering the ETV6 and RUNX1 genes, with a positive result occurring due to the hybridization of the two probes to the same DNA fiber. Thanks to molecular combing, we also showed the presence of different breakpoints using these same probes.

We previously showed that sustained mild activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in CML cells supports their survival and resistance to chemotherapy. We now demonstrate, using dominant negative non-phosphorylable mutant of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha subunit (eIF2alpha), that phosphorylation of eIF2alpha (eIF2alpha-P), which is a hallmark of ER stress in CML cells, substantially enhances their invasive potential and modifies their ability to secrete extracellular components, including the matrix-modifying enzymes cathepsins and matrix metalloproteinases. These changes are dependent on the induction of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and facilitate extracellular matrix degradation by CML cells. Conditioned media from CML cells with constitutive activation of the eIF2alpha-P/ATF4 pathway induces invasiveness of bone marrow stromal fibroblasts, suggesting that eIF2alpha-P may be important for extracellular matrix remodeling and thus leukemia cells-stroma interactions.

A disturbance of the intestinal microflora, especially of endogenous lactic acid bacteria, might be a contributing factor for IgE-mediated allergic diseases. Additional knowledge regarding the interaction of human intestinal Lactobacilli with mast cells is still necessary. Twenty-three strains of Lactobacilli, including commercial and reference strains and strains from the human intestine, were tested for their ability to regulate degranulation of cells from rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells (RBL-2H3) in vitro based on a beta-hexosaminidase release assay. Each of the tested Lactobacilli characteristically suppressed IgE-mediated degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells, and Lactobacillus GG showed the strongest inhibitory effect on the cells. Furthermore, the bacteria isolated from the human intestine significantly suppressed degranulation of RBL-2H3 cellsin comparison with the reference strains. These results suggest that Lactobacilli, particularly those from the human intestine, can affect the activation of mast cells in a strain-dependent manner.

In allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), alloreactive NK cells derived by the graft are discussed to mediate the elimination of leukemic cells and dendritic cells in the patient and thereby to reduce the risk for leukemic relapses and graft-versus-host reactions. The alloreactivity of NK cells is determined by various receptors including the activating CD94/NKG2C and the inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptors, which both recognize the non-classical human leukocyte antigen E (HLA-E). Here we analyze the contribution of these receptors to NK cell alloreactivity in 26 patients over the course of the first year after alloSCT due to acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and T cell Non-Hodgkin-Lymphoma. Our results show that NK cells expressing the activating CD94/NKG2C receptor are significantly reduced in patients after alloSCT with severe acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Moreover, the ratio of CD94/NKG2C to CD94/NKG2A was reduced in patients with severe acute and chronic GvHD after receiving an HLA-mismatched graft.

OBJECTIVES: The study aims were to (a) validate one vendor's commercially available EIAs for detecting IL-6 and TNF-alpha in saliva as an alternative matrix to blood and (b) test the long-term stability of EIA detection of IL-6 and TNF-alpha after 12-month storage of saliva and plasma. METHODS: Spike and recovery and linearity experiments were performed. Concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in saliva and plasma from 20 healthy adult volunteers (6 men and 14 women) were correlated; the assays were repeated 12 months later. RESULTS: Spike and recovery and linearity performance was adequate for salivary IL-6: intra-assay percentage coefficient of variation, less than or equal to 8.4%; sensitivity, 0.11 pg/ml; mean recoveries, 81% in spiked saliva and 110% in spiked controls; and linearity, r = .995. The association between IL-6 in saliva and plasma was moderate and significant (p = .04). Spike and recovery and linearity performance was inadequate for TNF-alpha: intra-assay coefficient of variation, 10.8%; sensitivity, 2.3 pg/ml; mean recoveries, 44% in spiked saliva and 92% in spiked controls; and linearity, r = .950. The association between TNF-alpha in saliva and plasma was low and insignificant. Plasma and saliva IL-6 levels were significantly higher (p < .0001), and plasma and saliva TNF-alpha levels were significantly lower (p < .0001) after 12-month storage of specimens. DISCUSSION: We concluded that (a) saliva can be used to assess IL-6, but not TNF-alpha, with an EIA validated for use with blood and (b) 12-month storage of plasma and saliva significantly changes the assay results. Validation of other EIAs would expand assay options for investigators.",,"['Hanneman, Sandra K', 'McCue, David', 'Blog, Gabriel L']","['Hanneman SK', 'McCue D', 'Blog GL']","['Sandra K.

We identified that miR-99a was significantly upregulated in the LSCs obtained at relapse compared to the LSCs collected at the time of initial diagnosis. We also found that miR-99a was upregulated in LSCs compared to non-LSCs in a larger cohort of AML patients, and higher expression levels of miR-99a were significantly correlated with worse overall survival and event-free survival in these AML patients. Ectopic expression of miR-99a led to increased colony forming ability and expansion in myeloid leukemia cells after exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and in vivo, partially due to overcoming of chemotherapeutic agent-mediated cell cycle arrest. Gene profiling and bioinformatic analyses indicated that ectopic expression of miR-99a significantly upregulated genes that are critical for LSC maintenance, cell cycle, and downstream targets of E2F and MYC.

The cell line Ba/F3 lentivirally transduced with mutant BCR-ABL1 constructs is widely used for in vitro sensitivity testing and response prediction to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The transposon-based Sleeping Beauty system presented offers several advantages over lentiviral transduction including the absence of biosafety issues, faster generation of transgenic cell lines, and greater efficacy in introducing large gene constructs. Nevertheless, both methods can mediate multiple insertions in the genome. Here we show that multiple BCR-ABL1 insertions result in elevated IC50 levels for individual TKIs, thus overestimating the actual resistance of mutant subclones. We have therefore established flow-sorting-based fractionation of BCR-ABL1-transformed Ba/F3 cells facilitating efficient enrichment of cells carrying single-site insertions, as demonstrated by FISH-analysis. Fractions of unselected Ba/F3 cells not only showed a greater number of BCR-ABL1 hybridization signals, but also revealed higher IC50 values for the TKIs tested. The data presented highlight the need to carefully select transfected cells by flow-sorting, and to control the insertion numbers by FISH and real-time PCR to permit unbiased in vitro testing of drug resistance.",,"['Byrgazov, Konstantin', 'Lucini, Chantal Blanche', 'Berkowitsch, Bettina', 'Koenig, Margit', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Valent, Peter', 'Lion, Thomas']","['Byrgazov K', 'Lucini CB', 'Berkowitsch B', 'Koenig M', 'Haas OA', 'Hoermann G', 'Valent P', 'Lion T']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'Ba/F3', 'transposon-based gene transfer', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2016/11/02 06:00,2018/03/21 06:00,['2016/11/02 06:00'],"['2016/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['12943 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12943 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 22;7(47):78083-78094. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12943.,,,PMC5363645,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, therapeutic options are limited and a critical need exists for understanding a more thorough characterization of the molecular pathology underlying this disease. The Men1 knockout mouse model recapitulates the early stage of human PanNET development and can serve as a foundation for the development of advanced mouse models that are necessary for preclinical testing. Menin, the product of the MEN1 gene, has been shown to physically interact with the KMT2A and KMT2B histone methyltransferases. Both the KMT2A and MEN1 genes are located on chromosome 11q, which frequently undergoes loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in PanNETs. We report herein that inactivation of Kmt2a in Men1-deficient mice accelerated pancreatic islet tumorigenesis and shortened the average life span. Increases in cell proliferation were observed in mouse pancreatic islet tumors upon inactivation of both Kmt2a and Men1.

This translocation causes the expression of a deregulated BCR/ABL fusion oncogene and, interestingly, is detectable in healthy individuals. Based on this information we assumed that the sole presence of the BCR/ABL transcript represents a necessary but not sufficient event for the clonal expansion of CML precursors. We developed a mathematical model introducing a probability that any normal cell undergoes a first aberration, and a probability that a cell that experienced a first mutation undergoes a second mutation as well. Two variants are proposed and analyzed: in the first the probability of the first mutation is supposed to be age independent and in the second, it depends on the hemopoietic cell turnover and mass. The model parameters have been estimated by regression from the observed CML incidence curves. Our models offer a significantly improved version of existing one-step and two-steps models, as they integrate key clinical and biological data reported in the literature and accurately fit the observed incidence. Our models also estimate the increased radiation-associated mutation rate at a younger age in atomic bomb survivors.

AIM: In the current analysis, we evaluated all-cause mortality and incidence, timing and response to medical therapy of anthracycline cardiotoxicity. METHODS: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was serially assessed using gated heart pool scan/echocardiography in patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy from January 2009 to December 2014. RESULTS: A total of 1204 patients was administered anthracyclines during the study period. During a median follow up of 32 (interquartile range: 15-58) months, all-cause mortality was 38% (n = 463), with the incidence of cardiotoxicity 10.2% (n = 123). Only 15.4% (n = 19) patients required heart failure hospitalisation, with 48% (n = 59) of patients commenced on beta blockade therapy and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The majority of patients (73.2%, n = 90) experienced cardiotoxicity within 1 year of anthracycline initiation. The proportion of patients with complete, partial and no LVEF recovery were 16.3% (n = 20), 29.3% (n = 36) and 54.4% (n = 67) respectively. Mortality was higher in the cardiotoxicity group (49% vs 37%, P < 0.01). History of coronary artery disease, leukaemia, idarubicin use and high cumulative anthracycline dose were predictors of cardiotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiotoxicity after anthracycline use predictably occurs within the first year of therapy and is dose-related, with variable degrees of recovery. While the need for hospitalisation for heart failure was uncommon, medical therapy appears underutilised, suggesting there may be a role for improved surveillance and early initiation of treatment.",['(c) 2016 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],"['Khan, Arshad A', 'Ashraf, Asma', 'Singh, Rajinder', 'Rahim, Aadil', 'Rostom, Walid', 'Hussain, Mumtaz', 'Renner, Ian', 'Collins, Nicholas J']","['Khan AA', 'Ashraf A', 'Singh R', 'Rahim A', 'Rostom W', 'Hussain M', 'Renner I', 'Collins NJ']","['Cardiovascular Department, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Cardiovascular Department, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Cardiovascular Department, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Cardiovascular Department, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Australia', 'Cardiotoxicity/etiology/*mortality', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Stroke Volume', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",['NOTNLM'],"['anthracycline', 'cardiotoxicity', 'ejection fraction']",2016/11/02 06:00,2017/08/25 06:00,['2016/11/02 06:00'],"['2016/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/imj.13305 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2017 Jan;47(1):104-109. doi: 10.1111/imj.13305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The detergent Triton X-100 has been used for many years and is part of the production process of several commercial therapeutic proteins. However, recent ecological studies have suggested that Triton X-100 and its break-down products can potentially behave as endocrine disrupters in aquatic organisms, raising concerns from an environmental impact perspective. As such, discharge of Triton X-100 into the waste water treatment plants is regulated in some jurisdictions, and alternative detergents for viral inactivation are required. In this work, we report on the identification and evaluation of more eco-friendly detergents as viable replacements for Triton X-100. Five detergent candidates with low to moderate environmental impact were initially identified and evaluated with respect to protein stability, followed by proof-of-concept virus inactivation studies using a model enveloped virus. From the set of candidates lauryldimethylamine N-oxide (LDAO) was identified as the most promising detergent due to its low ecotoxicity, robust anti-viral activity (LRV >4 at validation set-point conditions with X-MuLX), and absence of any negative impact on protein function. This detergent exhibited effective and robust virus inactivation in a broad range of protein concentrations, solution conductivities, pHs, and in several different cell culture fluid matrices. The only process parameter which correlated with reduced virus inactivation potency was LDAO concentration, and then only when the concentration was reduced to below the detergent's critical micelle concentration (CMC). Additionally, this work also demonstrated that LDAO was cleared to below detectable levels after Protein A affinity chromatography, making it suitable for use in a platform process that utilizes this chromatographic mode for protein capture. All these findings suggest that LDAO may be a practical alternative to Triton X-100 for use in protein therapeutic production processes for inactivating enveloped viruses. Biotechnol.

Weekly methotrexate with daily 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) constitutes the backbone of maintenance therapy. Reduction in the maintenance therapy could overweight problems related with poverty of children with ALL living in limited-income countries (LIC). OBJECTIVE: To compare, prospectively, the EFS rates of children with ALL treated according to two maintenance regimens: 18 vs. 24 months duration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October 1993 to September 1999, 867 consecutive untreated ALL patients <18 years of age were treated according to the Brazilian Cooperative Group for Childhood ALL Treatment (GBTLI) ALL-93 protocol. Risk classification was based exclusively on patient's age and leukocyte count (NCI risk group) and clinical extra medullary involvement of the disease. Data were analyzed by the intention-to-treat approach. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (1.6%) were excluded: wrong diagnosis (n = 7) and previous corticosteroid (n = 7). Of the 853 eligible patients, 421 were randomly allocated, at study enrollment, to receive 18-month (group 1) and 432 to receive 24-month (group 2) maintenance therapy. Complete remission rate was achieved in 96% of the patients (817/853). Twenty-eight patients (3.4%) died during the induction phase. Thirty-four patients (4.0%) were lost to follow-up. The overall EFS was 66.1 +/- 1.7% at 15 years. No difference was seen according to maintenance: EFS15y was 65.8 +/- 2.3% (group 1) and 66.3 +/- 2.3% (group 2; p = 0.79). No difference between regimens was detected after stratifying the analyses according to factors associated with adverse prognosis in this study (age group <1 year or >10 years and high WBC at diagnosis). Overall death in remission rate was 6.85% (56 patients). Deaths during maintenance were 13 in group 1 and 12 in group 2, all due to infection. Over 15 years of follow-up, two patients both from group 2 presented a second malignancy (Hodgkin's disease and thyroid carcinoma) after 8.3 and 11 years off therapy, respectively. CONCLUSION: Six-month reduction of maintenance therapy in ALL children treated according to the GBTLI ALL-93 protocol provided the same overall outcome as 2-year duration regimen.",,"['Brandalise, Silvia R', 'Viana, Marcos B', 'Pinheiro, Vitoria R P', 'Mendonca, Nubia', 'Lopes, Luiz F', 'Pereira, Waldir V', 'Lee, Maria L M', 'Pontes, Elitania M', 'Zouain-Figueiredo, Glaucia P', 'Azevedo, Alita C A C', 'Pimentel, Nilma', 'Fernandes, Maria Z', 'Oliveira, Hilda M', 'Vianna, Sonia R', 'Scrideli, Carlos A', 'Werneck, Fernando A', 'Alvares, Maria N', 'Boldrini, Erica', 'Loggetto, Sandra R', 'Bruniera, Paula', 'Mastellaro, Maria J', 'Souza, Eni M', 'Araujo, Rogerio A', 'Bandeira, Flavia', 'Tan, Doralice M', 'Carvalho, Nelson A', 'Salgado, Maria A S']","['Brandalise SR', 'Viana MB', 'Pinheiro VR', 'Mendonca N', 'Lopes LF', 'Pereira WV', 'Lee ML', 'Pontes EM', 'Zouain-Figueiredo GP', 'Azevedo AC', 'Pimentel N', 'Fernandes MZ', 'Oliveira HM', 'Vianna SR', 'Scrideli CA', 'Werneck FA', 'Alvares MN', 'Boldrini E', 'Loggetto SR', 'Bruniera P', 'Mastellaro MJ', 'Souza EM', 'Araujo RA', 'Bandeira F', 'Tan DM', 'Carvalho NA', 'Salgado MA']","[""Boldrini Children's Center , Campinas , Brazil."", 'Federal University of Minas Gerais , Belo Horizonte , Brazil.', ""Boldrini Children's Center , Campinas , Brazil."", 'Onco Bahia Hospital , Salvador , Brazil.', 'A.

Since data on complement functionality in oncology patients are limited, we aimed to investigate the innate complement function in relation to the type of malignancy and therapy in a longitudinal cohort of patients. METHODS: A large single-center, prospective non-intervention study was conducted, in which blood samples were taken from patients before, during, and after treatment with chemotherapy and/or subsequent admittance for (febrile) neutropenia. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Analysis of 48 patients showed a high percentage of defects in complement activity of the alternative pathway (19.1%), the classical pathway (4.3%), or both (42.6%). Post hoc analysis of six different treatment protocols with more than three patients each showed distinct effects of specific therapies. Whereas patients treated according to the Ewing, EpSSG-rhabdomyosarcoma, or SIOP CNS germ cell tumor protocol showed no defects, patients treated according to the ALL-11 (leukemia), the EURAMOS I (osteosarcoma), or the ACNS (medulloblastoma) protocols showed an almost universal reduction in complement function. Although we could not explain the reduced complement functionality under all conditions, a strong effect was observed following high-dose methotrexate or ifosfamide. CONCLUSION: Acquired complement defects were commonly observed in more than 50% of oncology patients, some of which associated with certain chemotherapeutic drugs. Additional studies are needed to determine the clinical and therapeutic context of complement defects and their possible effect on treatment outcome or the increased risk of infection.",,"['Keizer, Mischa P', 'Kamp, Angela M', 'Aarts, Cathelijn', 'Geisler, Judy', 'Caron, Huib N', 'van de Wetering, Marianne D', 'Wouters, Diana', 'Kuijpers, Taco W']","['Keizer MP', 'Kamp AM', 'Aarts C', 'Geisler J', 'Caron HN', 'van de Wetering MD', 'Wouters D', 'Kuijpers TW']","[""Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory AMC, Department of Immunopathology, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Academic Medical Center (AMC), Emma Children's Hospital, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands."", 'Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory AMC, Department of Immunopathology, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , Netherlands.', 'Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory AMC, Department of Immunopathology, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , Netherlands.', 'Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory AMC, Department of Blood Cell Research, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , Netherlands.', ""Academic Medical Center (AMC), Emma Children's Hospital, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , Netherlands."", ""Academic Medical Center (AMC), Emma Children's Hospital, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , Netherlands."", 'Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory AMC, Department of Immunopathology, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , Netherlands.', ""Academic Medical Center (AMC), Emma Children's Hospital, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory AMC, Department of Blood Cell Research, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161017,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['complement system', 'methotrexate', 'oncology', 'therapeutic effect', 'transient defects']",2016/11/02 06:00,2016/11/02 06:01,['2016/11/02 06:00'],"['2016/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/02 06:01 [medline]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2016.00420 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2016 Oct 17;7:420. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2016.00420. eCollection 2016.,,,PMC5066094,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), JAK signaling is a feature of the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype and is triggered by autocrine production of IL-6 and IL-10. Whether this signaling involves STAT activation, epigenetic modification of chromatin, or both mechanisms is unknown. Here we use genetic and pharmacological inhibition to show that JAK1 signaling sustains the survival of ABC DLBCL cells. Whereas STAT3 contributed to the survival of ABC DLBCL cell lines, forced STAT3 activity could not protect these cells from death following JAK1 inhibition, suggesting epigenetic JAK1 action. JAK1 regulated the expression of nearly 3,000 genes in ABC DLBCL cells, and the chromatin surrounding many of these genes was modified by H3Y41-P marks that were diminished by JAK1 inhibition. These JAK1 epigenetic target genes encode important regulators of ABC DLBCL proliferation and survival, including IRF4, MYD88, and MYC.

How HIV infection promotes the development of lymphoma is unclear, but it may involve chronic B-cell activation, inflammation, and/or impaired immunity, possibly leading to a loss of control of oncogenic viruses and reduced tumor immunosurveillance. We hypothesized that HIV structural proteins may contribute to lymphomagenesis directly, because they can persist long term in lymph nodes in the absence of viral replication. The HIV-1 transgenic mouse Tg26 carries a noninfectious HIV-1 provirus lacking part of the gag-pol region, thus constituting a model for studying the effects of viral products in pathogenesis. Approximately 15% of Tg26 mice spontaneously develop leukemia/lymphoma. We investigated which viral proteins are associated with the development of leukemia/lymphoma in the Tg26 mouse model, and performed microarray analysis on RNA from spleen and lymph nodes to identify potential mechanisms of lymphomagenesis. Of the viral proteins examined, only expression of HIV-1 matrix protein p17 was associated with leukemia/lymphoma development and was highly expressed in bone marrow before disease. The tumor cells resembled pro-B cells, and were CD19(+)IgM(-)IgD(-)CD93(+)CD43(+)CD21(-)CD23(-)VpreB(+)CXCR4(+) Consistent with the pro-B-cell stage of B-cell development, microarray analysis revealed enrichment of transcripts, including Rag1, Rag2, CD93, Vpreb1, Vpreb3, and Igll1 We confirmed RAG1 expression in Tg26 tumors, and hypothesized that HIV-1 matrix protein p17 may directly induce RAG1 in B cells.

We hypothesized that transfusion of leukocytes loaded ex vivo with the lipophilic antifungal posaconazole could improve delivery of antifungals to the sites of established infection and improve outcome in experimental IPA. Methods: The HL-60 leukemia cell line was differentiated to a neutrophil-like phenotype (differentiated HL-60 [dHL-60] cells) and then exposed to a range of posaconazole concentrations. The functional capacity and antifungal activity of these cells were assessed in vitro and in a mouse model of IPA. Results: Posaconazole levels in dHL-60 cells were 265-fold greater than the exposure concentration. Posaconazole-loaded cells were viable and maintained their capacity to undergo active chemotaxis. Contact-dependent transfer of posaconazole from dHL-60 cells to hyphae was observed in vitro, resulting in decreased fungal viability. In a neutropenic mouse model of IPA, treatment with posaconazole-loaded dHL-60 cells resulted in significantly reduced fungal burden in comparison to treatment with dHL-60 cells alone. Conclusions: Posaconazole accumulates at high concentrations in dHL-60 cells and increases their antifungal activity in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that posaconazole-loading of leukocytes may hold promise for the therapy of IPA.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Cryoglobulins differ in their composition, which has an impact on the clinical presentation and the underlying disease that triggers cryoglobulin formation. Cryoglobulinemia is categorized into two main subgroups: type I, which is seen exclusively in clonal hematologic diseases, and type II/III, which is called mixed cryoglobulinemia and is seen in hepatitis C virus infection and systemic diseases such as B-cell lineage hematologic malignancies and connective tissue disorders. Clinical presentation is broad and varies between types but includes arthralgia, purpura, skin ulcers, glomerulonephritis, and peripheral neuropathy. Life-threatening manifestations can develop in a small proportion of patients.

With the aim of evaluating the potential role of pre-transplant MRD, we studied the impact of pre-transplant MRD level on the outcome of alloHSCT in patients with AML in complete remission (CR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2/2005 to 9/2014, 60 patients with a median age of 54 years (range=30-66 years) with normal karyotype-AML harboring nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation [53% Fms-related tyrosine kinase receptor 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD)-positive] in first (n=45) or second (n=15) CR underwent myeloablative (n=16) or reduced-intensity (n=44) alloHSCT (27% related, 73% unrelated). The MRD level was determined from bone marrow samples using real-time polymerase chain reaction for detection of NPM1 mutations before starting the conditioning regimen. RESULTS: The estimated probabilities of 3-year relapse, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for the whole cohort were 28%, 54%, and 59%, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that only age over 63 years and high MRD level affected alloHSCT outcome. Pre-transplant MRD level of 10 mutant copies of NPM1 per 10,000 Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL) copies had the strongest statistical significance, and detection of higher MRD level (>10 NPM1-mutant copies) before alloHSCT was associated with increased overall mortality (hazard ratio=3.71; 95% confidence interval=1.55-9.06; p=0.004). The estimated probabilities of 3-year relapse, EFS, and OS were 6%, 72%, and 75% for patients with a low level of MRD and 48%, 35%, and 40% for patients with a higher level. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that the pre-transplant level of MRD in patients with normal karyotype AML harboring NPM1 mutation in CR provides important prognostic information, which as an independent prognostic factor predicts transplant results.","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Karas, Michal', 'Steinerova, Katerina', 'Lysak, Daniel', 'Hrabetova, Marcela', 'Jungova, Alexandra', 'Sramek, Jiri', 'Jindra, Pavel', 'Polivka, Jiri', 'Holubec, Lubos']","['Karas M', 'Steinerova K', 'Lysak D', 'Hrabetova M', 'Jungova A', 'Sramek J', 'Jindra P', 'Polivka J', 'Holubec L']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Faculty Hospital Plzen, Plzen, Czech Republic karas@fnplzen.cz.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Faculty Hospital Plzen, Plzen, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Faculty Hospital Plzen, Plzen, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Faculty Hospital Plzen, Plzen, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Faculty Hospital Plzen, Plzen, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Faculty Hospital Plzen, Plzen, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Faculty Hospital Plzen, Plzen, Czech Republic.', 'Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine in Plzen, Charles University Prague, Plzen, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine in Plzen, Charles University Prague, Plzen, Czech Republic.', 'Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine in Plzen, Charles University Prague, Plzen, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Preoperative Period', '*Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'minimal residual disease', 'nucleophosmin 1 mutation']",2016/11/01 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/11/01 06:00'],"['2016/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['36/10/5487 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11130 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Oct;36(10):5487-5498. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11130.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the contribution of MMP1 genotype to leukemia has never been investigated to our knowledge. Therefore, in this study we aimed to evaluate the contribution of the genotypic variants in the promoter region of MMP1 to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, 266 patients with childhood ALL and 266 non-cancer controls were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology. RESULTS: The distribution of 2G/2G, 1G/2G and 1G/1G for MMP1 promoter rs1799750 genotype was 49.2%, 39.5% and 11.3% in the childhood ALL group and 36.8%, 43.6% and 19.5% in the non-cancer control group, respectively (p for trend=0.0046), significantly differentially distributed between childhood ALL and control groups. The carrier comparisons in dominant and recessive models also support the findings that 1G appears to be the protective allele in childhood ALL. In genotype and gender interaction analysis, it was found that boys carrying the MMP1 rs1799750 1G/2G or 1G/1G genotypes had lower odds ratios(ORs) of 0.68 and 0.43 [95% confidence intervals (CI)=0.47-0.98 and 0.26-0.73, p=0.0395 and 0.0013, respectively] for childhood ALL than those carrying the 2G/2G genotype. Analysis of genotype inaction with age of onset age showed those aged less than 3.5 years at onset carrying the 1G/2G or 1G/1G genotypes had lower ORs (0.0183 and 0.0004, respectively) for childhood ALL, but there was no such difference for those having an age at onset of 3.5 years or more. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the MMP1 rs1799750 1G allele is a protective biomarker for childhood ALL.","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Pei, Jen-Sheng', 'Hsu, Pei-Chen', 'Chou, An-Kuo', 'Tsai, Chia-Wen', 'Chang, Wen-Shin', 'Hsiao, Chieh-Lun', 'Hsu, Yuan-Nian', 'Cheng, Shun-Ping', 'Bau, DA-Tian']","['Pei JS', 'Hsu PC', 'Chou AK', 'Tsai CW', 'Chang WS', 'Hsiao CL', 'Hsu YN', 'Cheng SP', 'Bau DT']","['Department of Pediatrics, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. datian@mail.cmuh.org.tw artbau2@gmail.com.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['EC 3.4.24.7 (MMP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.7 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 1)']",IM,,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 1/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood leukemia', 'MMP1', 'Taiwan', 'genotype', 'polymorphism']",2016/11/01 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/11/01 06:00'],"['2016/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['36/10/5127 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11082 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Oct;36(10):5127-5132. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11082.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the accumulation of a distinct class of siRNAs synthesized by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) requires the PIR-1 phosphatase. However, the function of PIR-1 in RNAi has remained unclear. Since mammals lack an analogous siRNA biogenesis pathway, an RNA silencing role for the mammalian PIR-1 homolog (dual specificity phosphatase 11 [DUSP11]) was unexpected. Here, we show that the RNA triphosphatase activity of DUSP11 promotes the RNA silencing activity of viral microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) transcribed precursors. Our results demonstrate that DUSP11 converts the 5' triphosphate of miRNA precursors to a 5' monophosphate, promoting loading of derivative 5p miRNAs into Argonaute proteins via a Dicer-coupled 5' monophosphate-dependent strand selection mechanism. This mechanistic insight supports a likely shared function for PIR-1 in C. elegans Furthermore, we show that DUSP11 modulates the 5' end phosphate group and/or steady-state level of several host RNAP III transcripts, including vault RNAs and Alu transcripts. This study shows that steady-state levels of select noncoding RNAs are regulated by DUSP11 and defines a previously unknown portal for small RNA-mediated silencing in mammals, revealing that DUSP11-dependent RNA silencing activities are shared among diverse metazoans.",['(c) 2016 Burke et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],"['Burke, James M', 'Kincaid, Rodney P', 'Nottingham, Ryan M', 'Lambowitz, Alan M', 'Sullivan, Christopher S']","['Burke JM', 'Kincaid RP', 'Nottingham RM', 'Lambowitz AM', 'Sullivan CS']","['Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'John Ring LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'John Ring LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.', 'John Ring LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Argonaute Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase III)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (DUSP11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual-Specificity Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (RNA triphosphatase)']",IM,,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Argonaute Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dual-Specificity Phosphatases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA Polymerase III/metabolism', 'RNA, Untranslated/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Alu', '*BLV', '*DUSP11', '*RNAi', '*adenovirus', '*vault RNA']",2016/11/01 06:00,2017/06/13 06:00,['2016/11/01 06:00'],"['2016/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['30/18/2076 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.282616.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2016 Sep 15;30(18):2076-2092. doi: 10.1101/gad.282616.116.,,"['R01 AI077746/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM037949/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM037951/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM037951/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5066614,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although addressed in several studies, the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon have remained largely unknown. A major drawback of most previous studies is their primary focus on individual genes, thereby neglecting the putative significance of inter-gene correlations. Here, we aimed at studying GC resistance in MLL-rearranged infant ALL patients by inferring an associated module of genes using co-expression network analysis. The implications of newly identified candidate genes with associations to other well-known relevant genes from the same module, or with associations to known transcription factor or microRNA interactions, were substantiated using literature data. METHODS: A weighted gene co-expression network was constructed to identify gene modules associated with GC resistance in MLL-rearranged infant ALL patients. Significant gene ontology (GO) terms and signaling pathways enriched in relevant modules were used to provide guidance towards which module(s) consisted of promising candidates suitable for further analysis. RESULTS: Through gene co-expression network analysis a novel set of genes (module) related to GC-resistance was identified. The presence in this module of the S100 and ANXA genes, both well-known biomarkers for GC resistance in MLL-rearranged infant ALL, supports its validity. Subsequent gene set net correlation analyses of the novel module provided further support for its validity by showing that the S100 and ANXA genes act as 'hub' genes with potentially major regulatory roles in GC sensitivity, but having lost this role in the GC resistant phenotype. The detected module implicates new genes as being candidates for further analysis through associations with known GC resistance-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: From our data we conclude that available systems biology approaches can be employed to detect new candidate genes that may provide further insights into drug resistance of MLL-rearranged infant ALL cases. Such approaches complement conventional gene-wise approaches by taking putative functional interactions between genes into account.",,"['Mousavian, Zaynab', 'Nowzari-Dalini, Abbas', 'Stam, Ronald W', 'Rahmatallah, Yasir', 'Masoudi-Nejad, Ali']","['Mousavian Z', 'Nowzari-Dalini A', 'Stam RW', 'Rahmatallah Y', 'Masoudi-Nejad A']","['Laboratory of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (LBB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'School of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, 72205, USA.', 'Laboratory of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (LBB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. amasoudin@ut.ac.ir.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161031,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Drug resistance', 'Gene co-expression network', 'Glucocorticoid treatment', 'Systems biology']",2016/11/01 06:00,2017/02/01 06:00,['2016/11/01 06:00'],"['2016/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13402-016-0303-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s13402-016-0303-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2017 Feb;40(1):33-45. doi: 10.1007/s13402-016-0303-7.

Although the contribution of disease biology and therapy resistance to treatment failure continues to be a focus of intense research efforts, the role of medication nonadherence on the part of caregivers or patients has been relatively neglected. Efforts to further improve childhood cancer cure rates must include a focus on improving medication adherence. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia have conclusively demonstrated that nonadherence to oral antimetabolite therapy is associated with a significant increase in relapse risk. The impact of nonadherence to other oral medications in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in other childhood cancers remains unknown. Tools by which clinicians can accurately identify nonadherent families are currently being developed but remain suboptimal. Similarly, while current efforts to develop interventions aimed at increasing adherence rates are underway, their feasibility and effectiveness is still unknown. SUMMARY: Future studies must focus on the development and widespread implementation of methods by which to identify and minimize nonadherence. Doing so will allow for further improve childhood cancer cure outcomes.",,"['Gupta, Sumit', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Gupta S', 'Bhatia S']","['aDivision of Haematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children bFaculty of Medicine, Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation, and Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada cInstitute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, University of Alabama at Birmingham, School of Medicine, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Medication Adherence/psychology', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Recurrence']",,,2016/11/01 06:00,2018/01/09 06:00,['2016/11/01 06:00'],"['2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOP.0000000000000434 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2017 Feb;29(1):41-45. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000434.,,"['R01 CA096670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA174683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7745131,['NIHMS865901'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib is broadly indicated for the treatment of patients with CLL and specifically including those with 17p deletion. The optimal use of ibrutinib in combination with other agents remains controversial.Experimental Design: We report the long-term outcome [median follow-up of 47 months (range, 36-51 months)] of 40 patients with high-risk CLL, treated on the first ibrutinib combination trial with rituximab (IR). The majority of patients (36/40) were previously treated.Results: Median age was 65 years, and 21 patients (52%) had 17p deletion. Median duration on treatment was 41 months (range, 2-51 months), and median number of treatment cycles was 42 (range, 2-49). Overall response rate was 95%, and 9 patients (23%) attained a complete remission. Twenty-one patients discontinued treatment, 10 due to disease progression, 9 for other causes, and 2 due to stem cell transplantation; the remaining 19 patients continue on ibrutinib. Median progression-free survival for all patients was 45 months, which was significantly shorter in the subgroup of patients with del17p (n = 21, 32.3 months, P = 0.02). Fourteen patients (35%) died, five from progressive disease, five from infections, and four from other causes. Median overall survival has not been reached.Conclusions: IR combination therapy leads to durable remissions in high-risk CLL; the possible benefit from the addition of rituximab is currently explored in a randomized trial.

However, the role of ZFX and its underlying mechanism in human leukemic cells remain unclear yet, though accumulating data have demonstrated that ZFX is aberrantly expressed in various human tumors and plays an important role. Herein, we found that ZFX was aberrantly expressed in various human leukemic cell lines and primary cells from leukemia patients compared with control cells. The silence of ZFX led to the growth suppression through either the deregulated cell cycle or the induction of apoptosis in various cells including K562, Jurkat, Namalwa, and THP-1 cells. The gene expression analysis revealed that UDP-Gal:betaGlcNAc beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase, polypeptide 1 (B4GALT1) was significantly down-regulated upon ZFX silencing, which is implicated in the response of K562 cells to the treatment of imatinib mesylate (IM). In addition, lectin blot assay showed that the galactosylation of glycoproteins in K562 cells was suppressed upon ZFX silencing. Interestingly, overexpression of B4GALT1 restored the growth and conferred drug resistance to ZFX-silenced cells. Taken together, we have demonstrated that ZFX is aberrantly expressed in multiple human leukemic cells and it modulates the growth and drug response of leukemic cells partially via B4GALT1, which suggests that ZFX is a new regulator of leukemic cells and warrants intensive investigations on this 'stemness' regulator in these deadly diseases.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Nonetheless, disease relapse attributed to survival of preleukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs) is associated with poor prognosis. Herein, we provide direct evidence that pre-LSCs are much less chemosensitive to existing chemotherapy drugs than leukemic blasts because of a distinctive lower proliferative state. Improving therapies for T-ALL requires the development of strategies to target pre-LSCs that are absolutely dependent on their microenvironment. Therefore, we designed a robust protocol for high-throughput screening of compounds that target primary pre-LSCs maintained in a niche-like environment, on stromal cells that were engineered for optimal NOTCH1 activation. The multiparametric readout takes into account the intrinsic complexity of primary cells in order to specifically monitor pre-LSCs, which were induced here by the SCL/TAL1 and LMO1 oncogenes. We screened a targeted library of compounds and determined that the estrogen derivative 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME2) disrupted both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous pathways. Specifically, 2-ME2 abrogated pre-LSC viability and self-renewal activity in vivo by inhibiting translation of MYC, a downstream effector of NOTCH1, and preventing SCL/TAL1 activity. In contrast, normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells remained functional.

However, the processes underlying the biogenesis, maturation, and secretion of these proteins remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that many secretory proteins produced by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo exosomal maturation and release that is controlled by vacuolar protein sorting protein 33b (VPS33B). Deletion of VPS33B in either mouse or human HSCs resulted in impaired exosome maturation and secretion as well as loss of stemness. Additionally, VPS33B deficiency led to a dramatic delay in leukemogenesis. Exosomes purified from either conditioned medium or human plasma could partially rescue the defects of HSCs and leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). VPS33B co-existed in exosomes with GDI2, VPS16B, FLOT1, and other known exosome markers.

The hypoxic, metabolically challenged bone marrow microenvironment confers chemoresistance to leukemia cells. The impact of autophagy inhibition in the context of microenvironment-mediated resistance in leukemia is less explored. Our recent studies demonstrated that co-culture of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells with marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) induces autophagy in AML cells and increases resistance to genotoxic agents (cytarabine and idarubicin). Genetic silencing of ATG7 in AML enhances the sensitivity to these genotoxic agents, an effect that was more pronounced with concomitant silencing of ATG7 in AML and MSCs. Mechanistically, the increased sensitivity of AML cells to genotoxic agents is associated with alteration of BCL2 family proteins, particularly transcriptional upregulation of PMAIP1/NOXA. In a disseminated AML model in immunocompromised mice, ATG7 knockdown in AML cells results in better survival compared to control mice when treated with chemotherapy.

In this review, we summarize and discuss the general mechanisms of H3K4 methylation, and how the six main enzymes from the SET/MLL family (responsible for H3K4me1/me2/me3) function in hematopoiesis and in hematologic malignancies.",,"['Yang, Weiwei', 'Ernst, Patricia']","['Yang W', 'Ernst P']","['Department of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, University of Colorado, Denver/Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, 03755, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, University of Colorado, Denver/Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA. patricia.ernst@ucdenver.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161031,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Histone Chaperones/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*H3K4 methylation', '*Histone methyltransferase', '*Leukemia', '*MLL1', '*MLL2', '*Wbp7']",2016/11/01 06:00,2017/04/15 06:00,['2016/11/01 06:00'],"['2016/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-016-2118-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-016-2118-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Jan;105(1):7-16. doi: 10.1007/s12185-016-2118-8.

Furthermore, studies in both models demonstrated global changes in chromatin accessibility and structure, in particular increased accessibility at binding sites for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transcription factors. These results suggest that mutations in the cohesin complex may contribute to leukemogenesis through modulation of HSPC chromatin accessibility.

Herein we have discovered for the first time that benzophenone-3 (BP-3), a chemical used as sunscreen in various cosmetic products, enhances the ability of lung cancer cells to undergo metastasis. The exposure of the lung cancer cells to BP-3 at non-toxic concentrations significantly increased the number of anoikis resistant cells in a dose-dependent manner. Also, BP-3 increased the growth rate as well as the number of colonies accessed by anchorage-independent growth assay. We found that the underlying mechanisms of such behaviors were the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of cancer cells, and the increase in caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression. As both mechanistic events mediated anoikis resistance via augmentation of cellular survival signals, our results further revealed that the BP-3 treatment significantly up-regulated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Also, such compounds increased the cellular levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins.

Neutrophils are the first line of innate immunity and respond to pathogens through multiple mechanisms, including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These web-like structures composed of DNA, histones, and granular proteins are also produced under sterile conditions and play important roles in thrombosis and autoimmune disorders. Here we show that neutrophils from CLL patients are more prone to release NETs compared to those from age-matched healthy donors (HD). Increased generation of NETs was not due to higher levels of elastase, myeloperoxidase, or reactive oxygen species production. Instead, we found that plasma from CLL patients was able to prime neutrophils from HD to generate higher amounts of NETs upon activation. Plasmatic IL-8 was involved in the priming effect since its depletion reduced plasma capacity to enhance NETs release. Finally, we found that culture with NETs delayed spontaneous apoptosis and increased the expression of activation markers on leukemic B cells. Our study provides new insights into the immune dysregulation in CLL and suggests that the chronic inflammatory environment typical of CLL probably underlies this inappropriate neutrophil priming.",,"['Podaza, Enrique', 'Sabbione, Florencia', 'Risnik, Denise', 'Borge, Mercedes', 'Almejun, Maria B', 'Colado, Ana', 'Fernandez-Grecco, Horacio', 'Cabrejo, Maria', 'Bezares, Raimundo F', 'Trevani, Analia', 'Gamberale, Romina', 'Giordano, Mirta']","['Podaza E', 'Sabbione F', 'Risnik D', 'Borge M', 'Almejun MB', 'Colado A', 'Fernandez-Grecco H', 'Cabrejo M', 'Bezares RF', 'Trevani A', 'Gamberale R', 'Giordano M']","['Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (CONICET), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunidad Innata, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (CONICET), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (CONICET), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (CONICET), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (CONICET), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (CONICET), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Sanatorio Municipal Dr. Julio Mendez, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Sanatorio Municipal Dr. Julio Mendez, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Municipal Dr. Teodoro Alvarez, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunidad Innata, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (CONICET), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (CONICET), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (CONICET), Academia Nacional de Medicina, Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina. giordanomirta@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161028,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,['0 (Interleukin-8)'],IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Extracellular Traps/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Infections', '*Interleukin 8 (IL-8)', '*Neutrophil', '*Neutrophil extracellular traps']",2016/11/01 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2016/11/01 06:00'],"['2016/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-016-1921-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-016-1921-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2017 Jan;66(1):77-89. doi: 10.1007/s00262-016-1921-7.

Treatment of the elderly remains complicated due to multiple factors, such as comorbidities, decline in functional reserve and fitness. Since chronological age by itself cannot properly predict life expectancy and treatment tolerance, an accurate assessment of the fitness status is of crucial importance for an optimal treatment choice. Areas covered: This review will discuss the most relevant aspects concerning the issues experienced in the management of elderly/unfit patients with CLL. The most frequently observed age-related toxicities, fitness assessments, supportive care measures and treatment options for elderly patients and for patients who are deemed unfit will be discussed. Literature search methodology included examination of PubMed index. Expert commentary: During the last decade, different trials focusing on elderly/unfit patients have investigated more tolerable chemoimmunotherapy schedules and, more recently, the activity and safety of chemo-free regimens. Chlorambucil combined with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody has shown clinical activity with a relatively good profile of toxicity.

AIM: The aim of the authors was to investigate the characteristics of malignancies associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients diagnozed between 2000 and 2015. METHOD: Data of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who had other associated tumours were analysed using the Leukemia/Lymphoma Registry of the Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg County, Hungary and patient records. RESULTS: Between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2015, 526 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were diagnosed. 95 patients of the 526 patients (18.06%) were diagnosed as having associated other tumours. In 48/95 patients (50.5%) the first diagnosed tumour was chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in 23/95 patients (24.2%) the first recognized malignancy was the associated tumour, whereas in 24/95 patients (25.3%) synchron tumours were diagnosed. The number of patients with more than one associated tumour was 10/95 (10.5%). The total number of tumours was 107. The incidence of chronic lymphoid leukemia increased in the period between 2000 and 2015 as compared to the period between 1983 and 1999 (3.19 vs 5.65/100 000 person/year). The occurrence of associated malignancies increased as well (8.06% vs 18.06%). In addition to the most common tumours (colorectal, breast, lung, prostate), skin squamous cell carcinoma (17/95 patients; 17.9%) and melanoma (6/95 patients; 6.3%) also frequently occurred. The second malignancies were most frequently discovered after the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and synchron tumours accounting for 78.5% (84/107) of all associated tumours. The incidence of second malignancies decreased 10 years after the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The possible reasons for the high frequency of other tumours associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are elderly age of patients, immunsuppressed state and, presumably, chemotherapy of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. During the follow up of patients the high risk for the development of associated tumours should be considered. Therapy of patients should be initiated when it is neccessary. Orv.

To study whether patients with these characteristics can be treated within a clinical trial, we conducted a study for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with poor performance, organ dysfunction or comorbidities. Primary endpoint was 60-day survival. Study included stopping rules for survival and response. Treatment consisted on a combination of azacitidine and vorinostat. Thirty patients (16 with MDS, 14 with AML) were enrolled. Median follow-up was 7.4 months (0.3-29). Sixty-day survival was 83%. No stopping rules were met. Main adverse events (AEs) were grades 1 and 2 gastrointestinal toxicities. In view of these results, we expanded the study and treated 79 additional patients: 27 with azacitidine (AZA) and 52 with azacitidine and vorinostat (AZA+V). Median follow-up was 22.7 months (12.6-47.5). Sixty-day survival rate was 79% (AZA=67%, AZA+V=85%, P=0.07). Median overall survival was 7.6 months (4.5-10.7).

CD33 expression quantified in 1583 patients recruited to UK-NCRI-AML17 (younger adults) and UK-NCRI-AML16 (older adults) trials was correlated with clinical outcomes and benefit from GO including a dose randomisation. CD33 expression associated with genetic subgroups, including lower levels in both adverse karyotype and core-binding factor (CBF)-AML, but was not independently prognostic. When comparing GO versus no GO (n=393, CBF-AMLs excluded) by stratified subgroup-adjusted analysis, patients with lowest quartile (Q1) %CD33-positivity had no benefit from GO (relapse risk, HR 2.41 (1.27-4.56), P=0.009 for trend; overall survival, HR 1.52 (0.92-2.52)). However, from the dose randomisation (NCRI-AML17, n=464, CBF-AMLs included), 6 mg/m(2) GO only had a relapse benefit without increased early mortality in CD33-low (Q1) patients (relapse risk HR 0.64 (0.36-1.12) versus 1.70 (0.99-2.92) for CD33-high, P=0.007 for trend).

Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we sequenced the IgHV gene from two independent cohorts: (A) 270 consecutive patient samples obtained at diagnosis and (B) 227 patients from the UK ARCTIC-AdMIRe clinical trials. Using complementary DNA from purified CD19+CD5+ cells, we demonstrate the presence of multiple rearrangements in independent experiments and showed that 24.4% of CLL patients express multiple productive clonally unrelated IgHV rearrangements. On the basis of IgHV-NGS subclonal profiles, we defined five different categories: patients with (a) multiple hypermutated (M) clones, (b) 1 M clone, (c) a mix of M-unmutated (UM) clones, (d) 1 UM clone and (e) multiple UM clones. In population A, IgHV-NGS classification stratified patients into five different subgroups with median treatment-free survival (TFS) of >280(a), 131(b), 94(c), 29(d), 15(e) months (P<0.0001) and a median OS of >397(a), 292(b), 196(c), 137(d) and 100(e) months (P<0.0001). In population B, the poor prognosis of multiple UM patients was confirmed with a median TFS of 2 months (P=0.0038).

Here, we analyzed how clonal heterogeneity affects the responses of 13 AML patients to chemotherapy or targeted treatments using ultra-deep (average 68 000 x coverage) amplicon resequencing. Using amplicon resequencing, we identified 16 variants from 4 patients (frequency 0.54-2%) that were not detected previously by exome sequencing. A correlation-based method was developed to detect mutation-specific responses in serial samples across multiple time points. Significant subclone-specific responses were observed for both chemotherapy and targeted therapy. We detected subclonal responses in patients where clinical European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria showed no response. Subclonal responses also helped to identify putative mechanisms underlying drug sensitivities, such as sensitivity to azacitidine in DNMT3A mutated cell clones and resistance to cytarabine in a subclone with loss of NF1 gene. In summary, ultra-deep amplicon resequencing method enables sensitive quantification of subclonal variants and their responses to therapies.

Though the susceptibility of murine EC cells to retroviral infection has been extensively analyzed, few studies of retrovirus infection of human EC cells have been performed. We tested the susceptibility of human EC cells to transduction by retroviral vectors derived from three different retroviral genera. We show that human EC cells efficiently express reporter genes delivered by vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) but not Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV). In human EC cells, MLV integration occurs normally, but no viral gene expression is observed. The block to MLV expression of MLV genomes is relieved upon cellular differentiation. The lack of gene expression is correlated with transcriptional silencing of the MLV promoter through the deposition of repressive histone marks as well as DNA methylation. Moreover, depletion of SETDB1, a histone methyltransferase, resulted in a loss of transcriptional silencing and upregulation of MLV gene expression. Finally, we provide evidence showing that the lack of MLV gene expression may be attributed in part to the lack of MLV enhancer function in human EC cells. IMPORTANCE: Human embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells are shown to restrict the expression of murine leukemia virus genomes but not retroviral genomes of the lentiviral or betaretroviral families. The block occurs at the level of transcription and is accompanied by the deposition of repressive histone marks and methylation of the integrated proviral DNA. The host machinery required for silencing in human EC cells is distinct from that in murine EC cell lines: the histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is required, but the widely utilized corepressor TRIM28/Kap1 is not. A transcriptional enhancer element from the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus can override the silencing and promote transcription of chimeric proviral DNAs. The findings reveal novel features of human EC gene regulation not present in their murine counterparts.",['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Wang, Gary Z', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Wang GZ', 'Goff SP']","['Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular and Biophysical Studies, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA spg1@cumc.columbia.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161216,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SETDB1 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Methylation', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genome, Viral', 'HIV-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/genetics/immunology', 'Host Specificity', 'Human Embryonic Stem Cells/*immunology/virology', 'Humans', 'Mason-Pfizer monkey virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/virology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*chromatin immunoprecipitation', '*enhancer', '*histones', '*repressor']",2016/11/01 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2016/11/01 06:00'],"['2016/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02075-16 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02075-16 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2016 Dec 16;91(1). pii: JVI.02075-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02075-16.

Specifically, the consistent dependence of GISTs on proto-oncogene c-KIT signaling led to the development and successful implementation of imatinib, a small-molecule c-KIT inhibitor. Imatinib induces, rapid and sustained clinical benefit by blocking the signaling via c-KIT. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>30%) include edema, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, rash, fatigue and abdominal pain. CASE SERIES: Herein, we report a case series of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) occurring secondary to imatinib in two patients treated for GISTs. Both patients were successfully managed with surgical resection of SCC and the discontinuation of the drug. Furthermore, we undertook a comprehensive literature review on this association. Few cases of cutaneous SCC secondary to imatinib therapy were reported in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. However, there was no clinical evidence on causation of imatinib-associated SCC in patients with GIST. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, the present report is the first to describe imatinib-related SCC in patients undergoing treatment for GISTs. This implicates that safety and long-term tolerability of imatinib in patients with GISTs warrant rigorous testing and close monitoring.","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Inayat, Faisal', 'Saif, Muhammad Wasif']","['Inayat F', 'Saif MW']","['Department of Medicine, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, U.S.A.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Tufts Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, U.S.A.

The study covers 15 anticancer drugs - conventional and new-generation. The experiments were performed on Jurkat leukemia cell line and normal lymphocytes, isolated from clinically healthy blood donors. Four parameters were analyzed simultaneously in both cell suspensions treated by drug or 6-ANA (separately, and in combination): cell viability, induction of apoptosis, level of ROS, and level of protein-carbonyl products. Most combinations of drug plus 6-ANA were characterized by synergistic cytotoxic effects on Jurkat cells. The synergism increased with increasing incubation time. Upon combination of 6-ANA with conventional chemotherapeutic (e.g. doxorubicin), synergistic cytotoxic effects were also detected in normal lymphocytes. In both cell types, the cytotoxicity of the combination of doxorubicin plus 6-ANA was accompanied by increased induction of apoptosis, but by a slight reduction of ROS and protein-carbonyl products compared to cells treated with doxorubicin only. Upon combination of 6-ANA with new-generation anticancer drugs (e.g. everolimus or barasertib), the synergistic cytotoxic effect on leukemia lymphocytes was also accompanied by very strong induction of apoptosis through ROS-independent mechanism(s). Neither of these combinations exhibited any cytotoxicity towards normal lymphocytes. The data suggest that 6-ANA could be used as a supplementary component in anticancer chemotherapy, and would allows therapeutic doses of anticancer drugs to be reduced, thereby minimizing their side-effects.","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Zhelev, Zhivko', 'Ivanova, Donika', 'Bakalova, Rumiana', 'Aoki, Ichio', 'Higashi, Tatsuya']","['Zhelev Z', 'Ivanova D', 'Bakalova R', 'Aoki I', 'Higashi T']","['Medical Faculty, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'Institute of Biophysics & Biomedical Engineering, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Medical Faculty, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Molecular Imaging and Theranostics, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, National Institute for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, Chiba, Japan bakalova.rumiana@qst.go.jp.', 'Medical Faculty, Sofia University ""St. Kliment Ohridski"", Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Molecular Imaging and Theranostics, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, National Institute for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Imaging and Theranostics, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, National Institute for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', '*Pentose Phosphate Pathway', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['6-Aminonicotinamide', 'ROS', 'chemotherapeutics', 'leukemia lymphocytes']",2016/10/30 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/10/30 06:00'],"['2016/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['36/11/6011 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11190 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Nov;36(11):6011-6020. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11190.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore it is imperative to explore the mechanisms that result in LSC survival and develop new therapeutic approaches. We now show that major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II and its master regulator class II transactivator (CIITA) are downregulated in CML compared with non-CML stem/progenitor cells in a BCR-ABL kinase-independent manner. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) stimulation resulted in an upregulation of CIITA and MHC-II in CML stem/progenitor cells; however, the extent of IFN-gamma-induced MHC-II upregulation was significantly lower than when compared with non-CML CD34(+) cells. Interestingly, the expression levels of CIITA and MHC-II significantly increased when CML stem/progenitor cells were treated with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (RUX). Moreover, mixed lymphocyte reactions revealed that exposure of CD34(+) CML cells to IFN-gamma or RUX significantly enhanced proliferation of the responder CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells. Taken together, these data suggest that cytokine-driven JAK-mediated signals, provided by CML cells and/or the microenvironment, antagonize MHC-II expression, highlighting the potential for developing novel immunomodulatory-based therapies to enable host-mediated immunity to assist in the detection and eradication of CML stem/progenitor cells.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Tarafdar, Anuradha', 'Hopcroft, Lisa E M', 'Gallipoli, Paolo', 'Pellicano, Francesca', 'Cassels, Jennifer', 'Hair, Alan', 'Korfi, Koorosh', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Vetrie, David', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Michie, Alison M']","['Tarafdar A', 'Hopcroft LE', 'Gallipoli P', 'Pellicano F', 'Cassels J', 'Hair A', 'Korfi K', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Vetrie D', 'Holyoake TL', 'Michie AM']","['Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Wellcome Trust-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medicine, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161028,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/immunology/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tumor Escape/*immunology']",,,2016/10/30 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/10/30 06:00'],"['2016/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33802-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-09-742049 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jan 12;129(2):199-208. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-09-742049.

Internationally, FN is often treated with a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic. We aimed to compare these two regimens in a prospective, randomized, trial in patients with lymphoma or leukaemia with an expected period of neutropenia >/=7 days, and a suspected bacterial infection. METHODS: Adult neutropenic patients with lymphoma or leukaemia, and a suspected bacterial infection, were randomized for treatment with benzylpenicillin plus an aminoglycoside or meropenem. The primary endpoint was clinical success, defined as no modification of antibiotics and clinical stability 72 h after randomization. RESULTS: Among 322 randomized patients, 297 proved evaluable for analyses. Fifty-nine per cent (95% CI 51%-66%), (87/148) of the patients given benzylpenicillin plus an aminoglycoside were clinically stable, and had no antibiotic modifications 72 h after randomization, compared with 82% (95% CI 75%-87%), (122/149) of the patients given meropenem (p <0.001). When the antibiotic therapy was stopped, 24% (95% CI 18%-32%), (36/148) of the patients given benzylpenicillin plus an aminoglycoside, compared with 52% (95% CI 44%-60%), (78/149) of the patients given meropenem, had no modifications of their regimens (p <0.001). In the benzylpenicillin plus an aminoglycoside arm, the all-cause fatality within 30 days of randomization was 3.4% (95% CI 1.2%-7.9%), (5/148) of the patients, compared with 0% (95% CI 0.0%-3.0%), (0/149) of the patients in the meropenem arm (p 0.03). CONCLUSION: Clinical success was more common in FN patients randomized to meropenem compared with the patients randomized to benzylpenicillin plus an aminoglycoside. The all-cause fatality was higher among the patients given benzylpenicillin plus an aminoglycoside.","['Copyright (c) 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious', 'Diseases.

Not only does such noise impact the scientific validity and costs of studies, but when assessed in the context of clinically translatable indications such as phenotype prediction, it can lead to inaccurate conclusions that could ultimately impact patients. We applied a sequence of ranking methods to damp noise associated with microarray outputs, and then tested the utility of the approach in three disease indications using publically available datasets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed in three phases. We first theoretically analyzed the effect of noise in phenotype prediction problems showing that it can be expressed as a modeling error that partially falsifies the pathways. Secondly, via synthetic modeling, we performed the sensitivity analysis for the main gene ranking methods to different types of noise. Finally, we studied the predictive accuracy of the gene lists provided by these ranking methods in synthetic data and in three different datasets related to cancer, rare and neurodegenerative diseases to better understand the translational aspects of our findings. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In the case of synthetic modeling, we showed that Fisher's Ratio (FR) was the most robust gene ranking method in terms of precision for all the types of noise at different levels. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) provided slightly lower performance and the rest of the methods (fold change, entropy and maximum percentile distance) were much less precise and accurate. The predictive accuracy of the smallest set of high discriminatory probes was similar for all the methods in the case of Gaussian and Log-Gaussian noise. In the case of class assignment noise, the predictive accuracy of SAM and FR is higher. Finally, for real datasets (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Inclusion Body Myositis and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) we found that FR and SAM provided the highest predictive accuracies with the smallest number of genes. Biological pathways were found with an expanded list of genes whose discriminatory power has been established via FR. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that noise in expression data and class assignment partially falsifies the sets of discriminatory probes in phenotype prediction problems. FR and SAM better exploit the principle of parsimony and are able to find subsets with less number of high discriminatory genes. The predictive accuracy and the precision are two different metrics to select the important genes, since in the presence of noise the most predictive genes do not completely coincide with those that are related to the phenotype. Based on the synthetic results, FR and SAM are recommended to unravel the biological pathways that are involved in the disease development.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with HC who had undergone BMT at a single pediatric hospital from 2008 to 2015 was conducted. Demographic data, severity of hematuria, HC management, and mortality were analyzed. Bivariate analysis and binary logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors. RESULTS: Out of 43 patients who met inclusion criteria, 67.4% were male with a median age at BMT of 10.2 years (interquartile range 5.8-14.6). Percutaneous nephrostomy catheters were inserted in 5 patients for urinary diversion. All-cause mortality was 32.6% (N = 14). Intravesical retroviral therapy (P <.001), HC grade (P <.001), total Foley time (P <.001), total gross hematuria time (P <.001), total days hospitalized (P = .012), and days to most improved hematuria (P = .032) were associated with significant GU morbidity on bivariate analysis. On multivariable analysis, days to most improved hematuria was associated with significant GU morbidity odds ratio of 1.177 (1.006-1.376) (P = .042). Status of percutaneous nephrostomy was not associated with increased mortality (P = .472); however, in the multivariate model, BK viremia (P = .023), need for renal dialysis (P = .003), and presence of Foley catheter (P = .005) were associated with increased mortality.

In this study, we explore the molecular mechanisms connecting the Hippo signaling pathway with glucose metabolism. We have found that two key regulators of glycolysis, C-MYC and GLUT1, are targets of the Hippo signaling pathway in human leukemia cells. Our results revealed that activation of MST1 by the natural compound shikonin inhibited the expression of GLUT1 and C-MYC. Furthermore, RNAi experiments confirmed the regulation of GLUT1 and C-MYC expression via the MST1-YAP1-TEAD1 axis. Surprisingly, YAP1 was found to positively regulate C-MYC mRNA levels in complex with TEAD1, while it negatively regulates C-MYC levels in cooperation with MST1. Hence, YAP1 serves as a rheostat for C-MYC, which is regulated by MST1. In addition, depletion of MST1 stimulates lactate production, whereas the specific depletion of TEAD1 has an opposite effect. The inhibition of lactate production and cellular proliferation induced by shikonin also depends on the Hippo pathway activity. Finally, a bioinformatic analysis revealed conserved TEAD-binding motifs in the C-MYC and GLUT1 promoters providing another molecular data supporting our observations. In summary, regulation of glucose metabolism could serve as a new tumor suppressor mechanism orchestrated by the Hippo signaling pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Usefulness and choice of sepsis biomarkers to distinguish bloodstream infection (BSI) from other causes of febrile episode is still argued in HSCT recipients in modern epidemiological situations characterized by the emergence of highly resistant gram-negative microorganisms. In this study a comparative analysis of diagnostic values of presepsin, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was performed as sepsis biomarkers in adult patients after HSCT in a condition of high prevalence of gram-negative pathogens. METHODS: A prospective observational clinical study was performed at the Center of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation in Minsk, Republic of Belarus. The biomarkers (presepsin, PCT, and CRP) were assessed in a 4-hour period after the onset of febrile neutropenia episode in adult patients after HSCT. Microbiologically-confirmed BSI caused by a gram-negative pathogen was set as a primary outcome. RESULTS: Clinical and laboratory data were analyzed in 52 neutropenic patients after HSCT aged 18-79years. Out of the biomarkers assessed, the best diagnostic value was shown in presepsin (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.889, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.644-0.987, p<.0001) with 75% sensitivity and 100% specificity, then in PCT (AUC: 0.741, 95% CI: 0.573-0.869, p=.0037) with 62% sensitivity and 88% specificity. The optimal cut-off value for CRP was set as 165mg/L, while it had an average diagnostic value (AUC: 0.707, 95% CI: 0.564-0.825, p=.0049) with low sensitivity (40%) and should not be routinely recommended as a biomarker in adult patients with suspected BSI after HSCT. CONCLUSION: Presepsin may be recommended in adult patients with suspected gram-negative BSI after HSCT as a possible additional supplementary test with a cut-off value of 218pg/mL. PCT is inferior to presepsin in terms of sensitivity and specificity, but still shows a good quality of diagnostic value with an optimal cut-off value of 1.5ng/mL. CRP showed an average diagnostic value with low sensitivity (40%) and should not be routinely recommended as a biomarker in adult patients with suspected BSI after HSCT in a condition of high prevalence of gram-negative pathogens.","['Copyright (c) 2016 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

Herein, high-throughput metabolomics, combined with the other ""-omics"" disciplines, holds promise in identifying disease-specific and clinically relevant features.In this study, we took advantage of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to trace AML-associated metabolic trajectory employing two complementary strategies. On the one hand, we performed a prospective observational clinical trial to identify metabolic changes associated with blast clearance during the first two cycles of intensive chemotherapy in nine adult patients. On the other hand, to reduce the intrinsic variability associated with human samples and AML genetic heterogeneity, we analyzed the metabolic changes in the plasma of immunocompromised mice upon engraftment of primary human AML blasts.Combining the two longitudinal approaches, we narrowed our screen to seven common metabolites, for which we observed a mirror-like trajectory in mice and humans, tracing AML progression and remission, respectively. We interpreted this set of metabolites as a dynamic fingerprint of AML evolution.Overall, these NMR-based metabolomic data, to be consolidated in larger cohorts and integrated in more comprehensive system biology approaches, hold promise for providing valuable and non-redundant information on the systemic effects of leukemia.",,"['Carrabba, Matteo G', 'Tavel, Laurette', 'Oliveira, Giacomo', 'Forcina, Alessandra', 'Quilici, Giacomo', 'Nardelli, Francesca', 'Tresoldi, Cristina', 'Ambrosi, Alessandro', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Bernardi, Massimo', 'Vago, Luca', 'Musco, Giovanna']","['Carrabba MG', 'Tavel L', 'Oliveira G', 'Forcina A', 'Quilici G', 'Nardelli F', 'Tresoldi C', 'Ambrosi A', 'Ciceri F', 'Bernardi M', 'Vago L', 'Musco G']","['Unit of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milan, Italy.', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunogenetics, Leukemia Genomics and Immunobiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milan, Italy.', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology Laboratory, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Statistics in Biomedical Sciences, University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milan, Italy. ciceri.fabio@hsr.it.', 'University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy. ciceri.fabio@hsr.it.', 'Unit of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunogenetics, Leukemia Genomics and Immunobiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Letter', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161028,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Metabolomics/*methods', 'Mice', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Metabolomics', '*Nuclear magnetic resonance', '*Patient-derived xenografts']",2016/10/30 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2016/10/30 06:00'],"['2016/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0346-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0346-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Oct 28;9(1):115. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0346-2.,,,PMC5086061,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted in nine public hospitals in Mexico City. The crude annual average incidence rate and adjusted average annual incidence rate were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 190 patients with diagnosis of de novo acute myeloid leukemia were analyzed. Male sex (57.2%) and acute myeloid leukemia-M3 subtype (25.3%) were more frequent. The adjusted average annual incidence rates for Mexico City and for the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico were 8.18 and 7.74 per million children under 15 years old, respectively.

METHODS: Cases diagnosed as LC by skin biopsy were selected from the database of the Department of Dermatology of National Institute of Medical Science and Nutrition Salvador Zubiran. Cases were searched between the dates of January 1993 and December 2013. RESULTS: Twenty-seven cases which were histologically confirmed with cutaneous leukemic infiltrate were included. Of these patients 60% were male and the mean age at diagnosis was 42 yr (19 to 80 yr). The predominant tipe of LC was acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with 48% of the cases. Nodular neoformations were the main clinical manifestation with 63% of the cases. The mean interval between the diagnosis of LC and death was 10 months (CI 95%).

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the efficacy and tolerability of a chemotherapy regimen of pediatric type on patients 15-35 years old with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Ph(-). METHODS: A retrospective study of patients received from 2001 to 2013, without initial infiltration of the central nervous system. They received the regimen called LALIN. Terminal goals: frequency of initial remission, probability of survival free of leukemia and event-free survival for five years. RESULTS: We included 101 patients; there were 29 relapses and 19 deaths. There was initial remission in 97% of the cases; survival free of leukemia of 0.58 and event-free survival 0.44. No difference in patients aged 16-21 years vs. 22-35 (p > 0.55). Negative prognostic factors: abnormal karyotypes, except hyperdiploids (p = 0.001); > 5% of blasts, on 14 day induction (p = 0. 0001); delay in the punctuality of the courses of the chemotherapy regimen (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: A pediatric type regimen is applicable to patients aged from 16 to 35 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, without greater toxicity and a best survival free of leukemia. The count of > 5% of blasts and the delay in the execution of the stages of the chemotherapy regimen are the stronger negative prognostic factors.",,"['Lopez-Hernandez, Manuel Antonio', 'Alvarado-Ibarra, Martha', 'Alvarez-Veral, Jose Luis', 'Ortiz-Zepeda, Maricela', 'Guajardo-Leal, Martha Lilia', 'Cota-Range, Xochitl']","['Lopez-Hernandez MA', 'Alvarado-Ibarra M', 'Alvarez-Veral JL', 'Ortiz-Zepeda M', 'Guajardo-Leal ML', 'Cota-Range X']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.']",['spa'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,Mexico,Gac Med Mex,Gaceta medica de Mexico,0010333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/methods', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/10/30 06:00,2018/11/20 06:00,['2016/10/30 06:00'],"['2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gac Med Mex. 2016 Sep - Oct;152(5):439-443.,Destino a largo plazo de adolescentes y adultos jovenes con leucemia aguda linfoblastica (LAL) de novo tratados con un protocolo de tipo pediatrico.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent work has identified high frequency promoter point mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene of different cancer types, including melanoma, glioma, liver and bladder cancer. TERT promoter mutations appear to correlate with increased TERT expression and telomerase activity in these cancers. In contrast, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer rarely demonstrate mutations in this region of the gene. TERT promoter mutation prevalence in NHL has not been thoroughly tested thus far. We screened 105 B-cell lymphoid malignancies encompassing nine NHL subtypes and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, for TERT promoter mutations. Our results suggest that TERT promoter mutations are rare or absent in most NHL.

Although FLT3 inhibitors have shown considerable promise for the treatment of AML, they ultimately fail to achieve long-term remissions as monotherapy. To identify genetic targets that can sensitize AML cells to killing by FLT3 inhibitors, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen that identified ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) as being synthetic lethal with FLT3 inhibitor therapy. We found that inactivating ATM or its downstream effector glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) sensitizes AML cells to FLT3 inhibitor induced apoptosis. Examination of the cellular metabolome showed that FLT3 inhibition by itself causes profound alterations in central carbon metabolism, resulting in impaired production of the antioxidant factor glutathione, which was further impaired by ATM or G6PD inactivation. Moreover, FLT3 inhibition elicited severe mitochondrial oxidative stress that is causative in apoptosis and is exacerbated by ATM/G6PD inhibition. The use of an agent that intensifies mitochondrial oxidative stress in combination with a FLT3 inhibitor augmented elimination of AML cells in vitro and in vivo, revealing a therapeutic strategy for the improved treatment of FLT3 mutated AML.",,"['Gregory, Mark A', ""D'Alessandro, Angelo"", 'Alvarez-Calderon, Francesca', 'Kim, Jihye', 'Nemkov, Travis', 'Adane, Biniam', 'Rozhok, Andrii I', 'Kumar, Amit', 'Kumar, Vijay', 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Wempe, Michael F', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Serkova, Natalie J', 'Tan, Aik Choon', 'Hansen, Kirk C', 'DeGregori, James']","['Gregory MA', ""D'Alessandro A"", 'Alvarez-Calderon F', 'Kim J', 'Nemkov T', 'Adane B', 'Rozhok AI', 'Kumar A', 'Kumar V', 'Pollyea DA', 'Wempe MF', 'Jordan CT', 'Serkova NJ', 'Tan AC', 'Hansen KC', 'DeGregori J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO 80045;

However, it remains unclear how cancer subtypes with different oncogenic mutations respond to matrix stiffness. In addition, the relevance of matrix stiffness to in vivo tumor growth kinetics and drug efficacy remains elusive. Here, we designed 3D hydrogels with physical parameters relevant to hematopoietic tissues and adapted them to a quantitative high-throughput screening format to facilitate mechanistic investigations into the role of matrix stiffness on myeloid leukemias. Matrix stiffness regulates proliferation of some acute myeloid leukemia types, including MLL-AF9(+) MOLM-14 cells, in a biphasic manner by autocrine regulation, whereas it decreases that of chronic myeloid leukemia BCR-ABL(+) K-562 cells. Although Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin ligand and matrix softening confer resistance to a number of drugs, cells become sensitive to drugs against protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) and rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) proteins regardless of matrix stiffness when MLL-AF9 and BCR-ABL are overexpressed in K-562 and MOLM-14 cells, respectively. By adapting the same hydrogels to a xenograft model of extramedullary leukemias, we confirm the pathological relevance of matrix stiffness in growth kinetics and drug sensitivity against standard chemotherapy in vivo.

These included dietary modification (13.6%), vitamin therapy (30%), spiritual or mind-body therapy (17.2%), herbal supplements (13.5%), manipulative and body-based therapies (26%), Chinese medicine (3.5%), reiki (3%), and homeopathy (3%). These results definitively demonstrate that a large proportion of HSCT survivors are using one or more form of CAM therapy. Given the potential benefits demonstrated by small studies of specific CAM therapies in this patient group, as well as clearly documented therapies with no benefit or even toxicity, this result shows there is a large unmet need for additional studies to ascertain efficacy and safety of CAM therapies in this growing population.",['(c) 2016 The Authors.

High dose (HD) lenalidomide (50 mg) has activity as frontline therapy in elderly AML but there is limited data in the RR setting. This phase II trial included patients with RR HR-MDS or AML-TD at 2 doses of lenalidomide (15 or 50 mg) on days 1-28 of 42-day cycles. The primary endpoint was response rate using the 2006 International Working Group criteria. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Of 27 patients enrolled, 59% had HR-MDS and 31% AML-TD. No patient had isolated del5q; 41% had poor-risk karyotype. Of 9 patients treated at 15 mg, 56% completed >/=2 cycles with no responses. Of 18 patients treated at 50 mg, 39% completed >/=2 cycles and 11% responded but all experienced grade 3/4 neutropenic fever/infection. The 60-day mortality rate was 30%. Median OS was 114 days with 19% surviving >/=1 year. The study was terminated due to lack of robust clinical activity. In conclusion, lenalidomide at 15 mg is ineffective in RR myeloid malignancies.

The digital droplet PCR (dd-PCR) is a molecular technique that, without standard references, is able to accurately quantitate DNA mutations. ddPCR could be an useful instrument for the detection of the B-RAF V600E mutation in HCL, where the minimal residual disease monitoring is fundamental for planning a patients-targeted treatment in the era of new anti-CD20 and anti-RAF compounds. This retrospective study enrolled 47 patients observed at the Hematology Unit of the University of Pisa, Italy, from January 2005 to January 2014: 27 patients were affected by ""classic"" HCL, two by the variant HCL (vHCL), and 18 by splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL). The aim of the study was to compare dd-PCR to ""classic"" quantitative PCR (QT-PCR) in terms of sensitivity and specificity and to demonstrate its possible use in HCL. Results showed that: (1) the sensitivity of dd-PCR is about half a logarithm superior to QT-PCR (5 x 10(-5) vs. 2.5 x 10(-4)), (2) the specificity of the dd-PCR is comparable to QT-PCR (no patient with marginal splenic lymphoma or HCL variant resulted mutated), (3) its high sensitivity would allow to use dd-PCR in the monitoring of MRD. At the end of treatment, among patients in complete remission, 33% were still MRD-positive by dd-PCR versus 28% by QT-PCR versus 11% by the evaluation of the B-cell clonality, after 12 months, dd-PCR was comparable to QT-PCR and both detected the B-RAF mutation in 15% of cases defined as MRD-negative by IgH rearrangement. Moreover, (4) the feasibility and the costs of dd-PCR are comparable to those of QT-PCR.

Serum and/or synovial fluid (SF) IL-6 is markedly elevated in adult and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and osteoarthritis (OA). IL-6, in concert with IL-17, determines the fate of CD4(+) lymphocytes and therefore TH17 cell differentiation. IL-6 also plays a critical role in modulating B-lymphocyte activity. The recognition that IL-6 trans-signaling regulates inflammation resulted in the development of tocilizumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the biological activity of the IL-6-receptor (IL-6R). Significant clinical benefit was demonstrated as well as reduced serum IL-6 levels with suppression of X-ray progression of disease in several clinical trials in which juvenile or adult RA patients were treated with tocilizumab monotherapy or tocilizumab plus methotrexate. However, levels of serum and/or SF IL-6 cytokine protein superfamily members, adiponectin, oncostatin M, pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor/visfatin and leukemia inhibitory factor are also elevated in RA.

The CAR is a single polypeptide with modular domains, consisting of an antibody-derived targeting moiety, fused in line with T cell-derived signaling domains, allowing for T cell activation upon ligand binding. T cells expressing a CAR are able to eradicate selectively antigen-expressing tumor cells in a MHC-independent fashion. CD19, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) present on normal B cells, as well as most B cell-derived malignancies, was an early target of this technology. Through years of experimental refinement and preclinical optimization, autologously derived CD19-targeting CAR T cells have been successfully, clinically deployed, resulting in dramatic and durable antitumor responses but not without therapy-associated toxicity. As CD19-targeted CAR T cells continue to show clinical success, work at the bench continues to be undertaken to increase further the efficacy of this therapy, while simultaneously minimizing the risk for treatment-related morbidities. In this review, we cover the history and evolution of CAR technology and its adaptation to targeting CD19.

We conducted a prospective trial in 39 patients with MDS or AML who relapsed within 100 days of HCT. Relapse was documented by morphology, flow cytometry, or cytogenetics. Treatment consisted of 5-azacitidine, 75 mg/m(2)/day for 7 days, administered every 28 days. Patients were followed by sequential marrow examinations, and responses were assessed at 6 months. There were 3 complete remissions and 9 partial remissions (30%); an additional 3 patients had stable disease by International Working Group criteria. In multivariate analysis, only the type of induction chemotherapy given before HCT was significantly associated with post-HCT response to 5-azacitidine and overall survival (P = .004). These data support the use of hypomethylating therapy for post-HCT relapse in patients with MDS and AML and suggest that pre-HCT therapy may affect the likelihood of response to this salvage approach.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Median HCT-CI and HCT-CI/age scores were 2 (percentile 25 to 75, 1 to 4) and 3 (percentile 25 to 75, 1 to 5), respectively. Higher HCT-CI and HCT-CI/age scores were associated with higher nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and lower overall survival (OS). The HCT-CI distinguished 2 risk groups (0 to 2 versus >/=3), whereas, with the HCT-CI/age, there was a progressive increase in NRM and decrease in OS with increasing scores in all 4 groups (0 versus 1 to 2 versus 3 to 4 versus >/=5). Higher scores in both models were associated with lower chronic graft-versus-host disease relapse-free survival but not with higher relapse. Both models showed a promising predictive accuracy for NRM (c- = .616 for HCT-CI and c- = .647 for HCT-CI/age). In conclusion, the HCT-CI and HCT-CI/age predict transplant outcomes in CD34-selected allo-HCT, including NRM, OS, and chronic graft-versus-host disease relapse-free survival and may be used to select appropriate patients for this approach.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Initial rapid count recovery from the haplo-hematopoietic progenitors, is gradually replaced by durable engraftment from UCB progenitors. UCB grafts used for haplo-cord are smaller, but better matched than those required for single or double UCB stem cell transplant (SCT). More than 200 patients with hematological malignancies have been transplanted. Median age was 54 years (range 17-74) and 77 were over age 60. One-year survival was 64% for patients with intermediate- and low-risk disease, with no deaths beyond 2 years. In high-risk disease, 1-year survival was 44%. In a comparison with patients undergoing double UCB SCT, haplo-cord transplant resulted in faster hematopoietic recovery, lower rates of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), lower rates of disease recurrence, and improved GVHD- and relapse-free survival (GRFS). Excellent results were also reported for patients with aplastic anemia where 18 of 21 patients had sustained cord blood engraftment. Rates of GVHD and of disease recurrence after haplo-cord are encouraging. However, in the approximately 10% of patients with failure of the UCB graft disease recurrence is high, supporting the important role of UCB-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL). Ongoing efforts are aimed at identifying determinants of UCB engraftment, at reducing rates of disease recurrence in high risk patients and at optimizing dose and schedule of ATG -necessary to avoid early haplo-graft rejection, but also contributing to early post-transplant immunocompromise.

Although stable insertion resulted in successful correction of several monogenic disorders, it also accounts for insertional mutagenesis, a major setback in otherwise successful clinical gene therapy trials due to leukemia development in a subset of treated patients. Despite improvements in vector design, their use is still not risk-free. Lentiviral vector (LV) integration is directed into active transcription units by LEDGF/p75, a host-cell protein co-opted by the viral integrase. We engineered LEDGF/p75-based hybrid tethers in an effort to elicit a more random integration pattern to increase biosafety, and potentially reduce proto-oncogene activation. We therefore truncated LEDGF/p75 by deleting the N-terminal chromatin-reading PWWP-domain, and replaced this domain with alternative pan-chromatin binding peptides. Expression of these LEDGF-hybrids in LEDGF-depleted cells efficiently rescued LV transduction and resulted in LV integrations that distributed more randomly throughout the host-cell genome. In addition, when considering safe harbor criteria, LV integration sites for these LEDGF-hybrids distributed more safely compared to LEDGF/p75-mediated integration in wild-type cells.

We examined how bone health is affected in patients with hematopoietic disorders due to abnormal proliferation of bone marrow cells. The electronic databases Medline, Embase, PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, Web of Science, and Cochrane were searched for studies presenting numerical values for trabecular bone volume or bone mineral density in control and patients with hematopoietic disorders. We identified 5 studies for beta-thalassemia, 6 for sickle cell anemia, 2 for polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, 3 for chronic myelogenous leukemia, 6 for myelofibrosis, 5 for multiple myeloma, and 4 studies each for systemic mastocytosis, lymphocytic leukemia, and hemochromatosis. The effect of the disease state on bone density was significant and negative for beta-thalassemia (r = -2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.41, -0.58; p < 0.005), sickle cell anemia (-0.91; -1.36, -0.47; p < 0.00005), chronic myelogenous leukemia (-0.55; -0.88, -0.22; p < 0005), mastocytosis (-0.99; -1.16, -0.82; p < 0.00001), lymphoblastic leukemia (-0.69; -0.98, -0.40; p < 0.00001), multiple myeloma (-0.67; -0.99, -0.35; p < 0.00005), and hemochromatosis (-1.15; -1.64, -0.66; p < 0.00001). The changes were negative but not significant for polycythemia vera (-0.16; -0.38, 0.05; p = 0.069) and essential thrombocythemia (-0.33; -0.92, 0.26; p = 0.14). In myelofibrosis, disease state was associated with increased bone density (0.74; 0.12, 1.36; p < 0.05). Bone density change significantly and negatively correlated with the level of ferritin and bone marrow cellularity but not with hemoglobin or erythropoietin. Thus, independent of hematopoietic lineage, abnormal proliferation of bone marrow cells appears to be associated with bone loss. Iron metabolism may independently contribute to bone homeostasis.

Although HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) has been introduced as a risk factor for these diseases' progression, it is not sufficient on its own to yield an accurate estimation of the outcome of the infection. In the present study, PVL and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) expression level as viral factors, and IFN lambda3 as a host factor, were evaluated in HAM/TSP patients and HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (ACs). During 2014-2015, 12 HAM/TSP patients and 18 ACs who had been referred to the HTLV-1 Clinic, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (MUMS), Mashhad, Iran, were enrolled in this study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and the DNA and mRNA were extracted for quantification of HBZ, IFN lambda3 expression, and PVL using real-time PCR (TaqMan method). Although the PVL was higher in the HAM/TSP group, with a 94% confidence interval, there were no considerable differences in terms of HBZ mRNA and PVL between ACs and HAM patients. IFN lambda3 expression in the HAM/TSP group was significantly higher than in the ACs (P = 0.02). To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the expression level of IFN lambda3 in HTLV-1 positive patients. The immune response against HTLV-1 viral antigens and virulent factors will therefore further refine our knowledge of interactions between the virus and host in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-related disorders. The virus PVL and the host IFN lambda3 can be used as pathogenic factors of HTLV-1 infected patients at risk of HAM/TSP manifestation. J. Med. Virol. 89:1102-1107, 2017.

Furthermore, targeting miR-155 results in monocytic differentiation and apoptosis. However, the exact role and mechanisms of miR-155 in human AML remains speculative. HL-60 cells were treated with anti-miR-155 for 72 h. Cell growth and apoptosis in vitro were detected by MTT, BrdU proliferation, colony formation and flow cytometry assay. The effect of anti-miR-155 on growth of HL-60 cells was also evaluated in a leukemia mouse model. Slug cDNA and PUMA siRNA trannsfection was used to assess the signal pathway. Different protein expression was detected by western blot assay and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. The results shown that targeting miR-155 resulted in a 24-fold decrease of miR-155 expression compared to negative control in the HL-60 cells. Targeting miR-155 significantly downregulated Slug and upregulated PUMA expression, and decreased HL-60 cell growth by 70% , impaired colony formation by approximately 60%, and increased HL-60 cell apoptosis by 45%. Targeting PUMA reversed miR-155 sliencing-induced proliferation and apoptosis of HL-60 cells. Restoration of Slug decreased PUMA expression. In murine engraftment models of HL-60 cells, we showed that targeting miR-155 was able to reduce tumor growth. This was accompanied with decreased Slug expression and increased PUMA expression in these tumors. Collectively, our findings strongly suggest targeting miR-155 exhibited in vivo and in vitro antileukemic activities in AML through a novel mechanism resulting in inhibition of Slug expression and increase of PUMA expression.",,"['Liang, Hui', 'Dong, Ziyan', 'Liu, Jiang-Feng', 'Chuang, Wei', 'Gao, Li-Zhen', 'Ren, Yu-Guo']","['Liang H', 'Dong Z', 'Liu JF', 'Chuang W', 'Gao LZ', 'Ren YG']","[""Department of Hematology, Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao, China. blooddoc@126.com."", ""Department of Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology, People's Hospital of Lanshan District, Rizhao, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao, China."", ""Department of Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology, People's Hospital of Lanshan District, Rizhao, China."", ""Clinical Laboratory, People's Hospital of Zhangqiu, Jinan, Shandong, China."", ""Clinical Laboratory, People's Hospital of Laiwu, Laiwu, Shandong, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161027,Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SNAI1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2016/11/01 06:00,2018/04/06 06:00,['2016/11/01 06:00'],"['2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['HH-11-837 [pii]', '10.14670/HH-11-837 [doi]']",ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2017 Sep;32(9):899-907. doi: 10.14670/HH-11-837.

We showed that low bone mass is prevalent among children with leukemia, especially in femur. Serum calcium, exercise, chemotherapy protocol, and radiotherapy are the main contributing factors. We suggest that early diagnosis and treatment of this problem could improve bone health in them. INTRODUCTION: Acute leukemia is the most common malignancy in children and has been reported to be associated with low bone mass. Due to lack of sufficient data about the bone mineral density of children with leukemia in the Middle East, and inconsistencies between possible associated factors contributing to decreasing bone density in these children, we aimed to conduct a case-control study in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study was conducted on 60 children with acute leukemia and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Anthropometric data, sun exposure, puberty, physical activity, and mineral biochemical parameters were assessed. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Data analysis was done by SPSS software v. 21. RESULTS: Serum calcium was higher in the control group (P = 0.012) while serum phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase, and serum 25(OH)D3 were higher in children with leukemia with P values of 0.04, 0.002, and 0.036, respectively. Sun exposure and physical activity were more in healthy controls (P values <0.001 and 0.003, respectively). Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in case and control groups was 57.8 and 79.4 %, respectively. This prevalence was higher in healthy controls (P value = 0.007). Both lumbar and femoral neck bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) were higher in the control group (P value <0.001). Serum calcium, physical activity, and radiotherapy were the most relevant factors associated with lumbar BMAD. Femoral neck BMAD was associated with chemotherapy protocol. CONCLUSION: Low bone mass for chronological age is prevalent among children with leukemia, especially in the femoral neck.

After identification of the gene, a truncating 5 bp deletion, 657-661delACAAA, was identified as the disease-causing mutation in patients with the NBS. In this report, we describe two patients with NBS and T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma in a Macedonian family. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first family with NBS reported from Macedonia. Both children presented with microcephaly, syndactyly and the development of T cell lymphoblastic lekemia/lymphoma at the age of 7 and 10 years, respectively. The molecular analysis of NBS1 genes in our patients showed homozygosity for the 657del5 mutation in the NBS1 gene.

CML is usually diagnosed in the chronic phase. Blast crisis represents an advanced phase of CML. Extramedullary blast crisis as the initial presentation of CML with bone marrow remaining in chronic phase is an unusual event. Further, extramedullary blast crisis with T lymphoid/myeloid bilineal phenotype as an initial presentation for CML is extremely unusual. CASE REPORT Here, we report the case of a 49-year-old male with rapidly enlarged submandibular lymph nodes. Biopsy specimen from the nodes revealed a characteristic appearance with morphologically and immunohistochemically distinct myeloblasts and T lymphoblasts co-localized in 2 adjacent regions, accompanied by chronic phase of the disease in bone marrow. The presence of the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene within both cellular populations in this case confirmed the extramedullary disease represented a localized T lymphoid/myeloid bilineal blastic transformation of CML. After 3 courses of combined chemotherapy plus tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, the mass was completely regressed with a 3-log decrease in BCR/ABL1 transcript from baseline. Five months after the diagnosis, the patient showed diminished vision, hand tremors, and weakness of lower extremities. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of cerebrospinal fluid revealed the presence of myeloid blasts. An isolated central nervous system relapse of leukemia was identified. Following high-dose systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy, the patient continued to do well. CONCLUSIONS The possibility of extramedullary blast crisis as an initial presentation in patients with CML should be considered. Further, an isolated central nervous system blast crisis should be considered if neurological symptoms evolve in patients who have shown a good response to therapy.",,"['Gao, Xiaoning', 'Li, Jie', 'Wang, Lili', 'Lin, Ji', 'Jin, Hongshi', 'Xu, Yihan', 'Wang, Nan', 'Zhao, Yu', 'Liu, Daihong', 'Yu, Li', 'Wang, Quanshun']","['Gao X', 'Li J', 'Wang L', 'Lin J', 'Jin H', 'Xu Y', 'Wang N', 'Zhao Y', 'Liu D', 'Yu L', 'Wang Q']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Pathology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20161027,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,,"['*Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,,2016/10/28 06:00,2017/02/17 06:00,['2016/10/28 06:00'],"['2016/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['899621 [pii]', '10.12659/ajcr.899621 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2016 Oct 27;17:793-798. doi: 10.12659/ajcr.899621.,,,PMC5085336,,,['Conflicts of Interest: None declared'],,,,,,,,,,

However, molecular features associated with this sole monosomy subtype (-7 AML), which may give insights into the basis for its poor prognosis, have not been characterized. In this study, we analyzed 36 cases of -7 AML for mutations in 81 leukemia/cancer-associated genes using a customized targeted next-generation sequencing panel (Miseq). Global gene and miRNA expression profiles were also determined using paired RNA and small RNA sequencing data. Notably, gene mutations were detected in all the major AML-associated functional groups, which include activated signaling, chromatin remodeling, cohesin complex, methylation, NPM1, spliceosome, transcription factors, and tumor suppressors. Gene mutations in the chromatin remodeling groups were relatively more frequent in patients <60 years of age, who also had less mutations in the methylation and spliceosome groups compared with patients >/=60 years of age. Novel recurrent mutational events in AML were identified in the SMARCA2 gene. In patients >/=60 years of age, the presence of spliceosome mutations associated with a lower complete remission rate (P = 0.03). RNA sequencing revealed distinct gene and miRNA expression patterns between the sole -7 and non -7 AML cases, with reduced expression, as expected, of many genes and miRNAs mapped to chromosome 7, and overexpression of ID1, MECOM, and PTPRM, among others. Overall, our findings illuminate a number of molecular features of the underlying aggressive pathobiology in -7 AML patients. Cancer Res; 77(1); 207-18.

It has also pioneered the concepts of stem cell therapy and immunotherapy as a tool against cancer. The success of transplant for hematologic malignancies derives both from the ability to treat patients with intensive chemoradiotherapy and from potent graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects mediated by donor immunity. Additionally, HSCT has been a curative therapy for several nonmalignant hematologic disorders through the provision of donor-derived hematopoiesis and immunity. Preclinical and clinical research in the field has contributed to an advanced understanding of histocompatibility, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), GVL effect, and immune reconstitution after transplant. Improved donor selection, tailored conditioning regimens, and better supportive care have helped reduce transplant-related morbidity and mortality and expanded access. The development of unrelated donor registries and increased utilization of cord blood and partially matched related donor transplants have ensured a donor for essentially everyone who needs a transplant. However, significant barriers still remain in the form of disease relapse, GVHD infectious complications, and regimen-related toxicities. Recent developments in the field of cellular therapy are expected to further improve the efficacy of transplant. In this review, we discuss the current science of HSCT from a historical perspective, highlighting major discoveries. We also speculate on future directions in this field.

In 1 patient, the CD19(-) clone appeared as a late relapse 19 months after completion of blinatumomab treatment. All 4 cases showed a cellular phenotype identical to the primary diagnosis except for CD19 negativity. This argued strongly in favor of an isolated molecular event and against a common lymphoid CD19(-) progenitor cell or myeloid lineage shift driving resistance.

Because mTOR signaling is required for initiation of messenger RNA translation, we hypothesized that cotargeting the PI3K and proteasome pathways might synergistically inhibit translation of c-Myc. We found that a novel PI3K delta isoform inhibitor TGR-1202, but not the approved PI3Kdelta inhibitor idelalisib, was highly synergistic with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma cell lines and primary lymphoma and leukemia cells. TGR-1202 and carfilzomib (TC) synergistically inhibited phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), leading to suppression of c-Myc translation and silencing of c-Myc-dependent transcription. The synergistic cytotoxicity of TC was rescued by overexpression of eIF4E or c-Myc. TGR-1202, but not other PI3Kdelta inhibitors, inhibited casein kinase-1 epsilon (CK1epsilon). Targeting CK1epsilon using a selective chemical inhibitor or short hairpin RNA complements the effects of idelalisib, as a single agent or in combination with carfilzomib, in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the protein level of c-Myc. These results suggest that TGR-1202 is a dual PI3Kdelta/CK1epsilon inhibitor, which may in part explain the clinical activity of TGR-1202 in aggressive lymphoma not found with idelalisib.

METHODS: Murine platelets were prepared and cocultured with leukemia L1210 cells, and the aggregation between them was observed by flow cytometry. The levels of several transducer proteins in leukemia cells were analyzed with Western blot. In some experiments, methotrexate, vincristine or doxorubicin was added to the coculture system and the cell proliferation was measured by using CCK8 colorigenic methods to detect the sensitivity of leukemia cells to the therapeuticals drugs. RESULTS: Platelets, either freshly prepared or fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, aggregated with leukemia cells. Both fresh and fixed platelets increased the level of phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in leukemia cells as measured with Western blot. Also, platelets significantly decreased the sensitivity of 3 therapeutics to L1210 cells.

METHODS: Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-550a-5p in 54 MDS patients, 16 acute myeloid leukemia transformed from MDS (sfAML) and 19 healthy controls, and the correlation between the expression of miR-550a-5p and clinical pathologic characteristics of MDS, including chromosome, percentage of marrow blasts, absolute neutrophil count, platelet count and hemoglobin levels were analyzed. The sequence of miR-550 was searched in miRBase database. Target genes of miR-550a-5p were predicted by Microcosm,Miranda and Targetscan, and the predective results were collected, then the enrichment analyses of target gene function(GO) and signalling pathway(pathway of miR-550a-5p) were carried out by using gene ontology darabase and KEGG database. RESULTS: The expression of miR-550a-5p in bone marrow of all MDS patients was higher than that in controls: the expression level of miR-550a-5p in low risk MDS and middl risk 1 MDS was 1.7 times of controls (P=1.23x10(-10)); the expression of miR-550a-5p in midde risk 2 MDS and high risk MDS was 1.9 times of controls (P=1.20x10(-10)); the expression of miR-550a-5p in tAML was 2.0 times of controls (P=5.61x10(-10)). The miR-550a-5p expression level was up-regulated gradually with the enhancement of disease risk of MDS, but there was no correlation between the expression level of miR-550a-5p and clinical pathologic characteristics of MDS(chromosome: Normal: 1.11+/-0.19, Abnormal:1.26+/-0.15, P>0.05; Percentage of Marrow Blasts: r=0.29,P=0.07; absolute neutrophil count: r=-0.02,P=0.89; hemoglobin level: r=0.09,P=0.57; platelet count: r=0.25,P=0.08). The sequence of miR-550 was conservative among different species, and the prediced results indicated that there were 19 target genes in intersection. The functions of target genes were enriched in regulation of stress-activated cascade, MAPK pathway, regulation of muscle organ development, regulation of protein homodimerization activity and other biological processes; they participated in some molecular functions including enzyme activity, combination processes of some molecules as protein, cAMP and domain existed in cell junction, synapse, coated vesicle, dendrite and other cellular components. Two of them-PDLIM2 and PSME1 were selected which might play a role in pathologic mechanism of MDS regulated by miR-550a-5p.

METHODS: A 16-year-old girl presented with complaints of bone and joint pain. The peripheral blood and bone marrow(BM) smears showed 32% and 72% blasts, respectively, which were myeloperoxidase-negative. The blasts were positive for HLA-DR, TdT, CD10, CD19, CD22 and cCD79a and negative for CD34, CD5, CD7, CD13, CD33, CD56 and MPO detected by flow cytometry. BM cytogenetic analysis and fusion gene screening revealed t(1;19)(q23;p13) and E2A/PBX1. She was diagnosed as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and was treated with CALGB8811 protocol. She presented lower abdominal pain with intermittent colick at 7 months after complete remission. The pelvic ultrasound showed a lobulated mixed echogenic mass in the right ovary, and an exploratory laparotomy was performed. RESULTS: Pathologic examination and immunohistochemistry of resected ovarian tumor revealed extensive infiltration by lymphoblasts with positive for TdT, CD20, CD43 and CD79a. Further investigations failed to reveal any other extramedullary involvement. Hemogram, peripheral blood and bone marrow smear examination were unremarkable at the same time. The isolated extramedullary ovarian relapse of ALL was confirmed. Simultaneous, the detection of minimal residual disease by multiparametric flow cytometry showed positive with 5.0x10(-4). The reinduction chemotherapy including a high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine was given to the patients. She experienced the second ovarian relapse after 1 year and refused further treatment. CONCLUSION: Although uncommon, ovarian recurrence after chemotherapy for ALL should be considered in the patients with suggestive symptoms.

METHODS: Eighty-two patients with hematologic malignancies were enrolled in this study, among them 20 patients were with acute leukemia, 48 patients were with lymphoma and 14 patients were with multiple myeloma. The plasma samples of 82 patients with hematologic malignancies and 45 healthy controls were collected. The activities of ADAMTS13 were evaluated by residue collagen binding assay(R-CBA), the levels of TSP1 and vWF antigen were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). RESULTS: The activity of plasma ADAMTS13 in patients with hematologic malignancies was lower than that of normal controls(P<0.05). The levels of vWF antigen and TSP1 in the patients with hematologic malignancies were higher than those in normal controls(P<0.05). After standard induction chemotherapy, the ADAMTS13 activity of the patients with hematologic malignancies at the complete remission was higher than that before therapy(P<0.05); the vWF antigen level was significantly lower than that in the patients with hematologic malignancies before therapy(P<0.05), but still higher than that in controls(P<0.05). There were 25 infection patients in 82 cases of hematologic malignancies, and the ADAMTS13 activity in the patients with newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies complicated with infection before therapy was obviously lower than that in the patients with hematologic malignancies without infection(P<0.05), the levels of vWF antigen and TSP1 were significantly lower than that in patients without infection (P<0.05). In the process of treatment, 8 patients have been speculated to suffer from thrombus, and the ADAMTS13 activity in the patients with thrombus was obviously lower than that in the patients without thrombus(P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Low ADAMTS13 activity and high TSP1 level may participate in the progress of hematologic malignancies, the infection and thrombotic events may lead to further reduction of the ADAMTS13 activity. Assaying the level of ADAMTS13 activity in the patients with malignant tumor may be helpful to prevent the infection and thrombosis in the patients with hematologic malignancies.",,"['Sun, Cai-Feng', 'Zhao, Xia', 'Han, Fang', 'Jia, Qi', 'Wang, Liang', 'Lu, Guang', 'Ding, Hui-Fang']","['Sun CF', 'Zhao X', 'Han F', 'Jia Q', 'Wang L', 'Lu G', 'Ding HF']","['Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Shengli Oilfield, Dongying 257000, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Shengli Oilfield, Dongying 257000, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Shengli Oilfield, Dongying 257000, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Shengli Oilfield, Dongying 257000, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Shengli Oilfield, Dongying 257000, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Shengli Oilfield, Dongying 257000, Shandong Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Shengli Oilfield, Dongying 257000, Shandong Province, China.

The majority of systemic mastocytosis patients carry KIT D816V mutation, which activates constitutively the KIT receptor. Patient with advanced forms of systemic mastocytosis, such as aggressive systemic mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia, are poorly treated to date. Unfortunately, the lack of in vivo models reflecting KIT D816V+ advanced disease hampers pathophysiological studies and preclinical development of new therapies for such patients. Here, we describe a new in vivo model of KIT D816V+ advanced systemic mastocytosis developed by transplantation of the human ROSAKIT D816V-Gluc mast cell line in NOD-SCID IL-2R gamma-/- mice, using Gaussia princeps luciferase as a reporter. Intravenous injection of ROSAKIT D816V-Gluc cells led, in 4 weeks, to engraftment in all injected primary recipient mice. Engrafted cells were found at high levels in bone marrow, and at lower levels in spleen, liver and peripheral blood. Disease progression was easily monitored by repeated quantification of Gaussia princeps luciferase activity in peripheral blood. This quantification evidenced a linear relationship between the number of cells injected and the neoplastic mast cell burden in mice. Interestingly, the secondary transplantation of ROSAKIT D816V-Gluc cells increased their engraftment capability. To conclude, this new in vivo model mimics at the best the features of human KIT D816V+ advanced systemic mastocytosis. In addition, it is a unique and convenient tool to study the kinetics of the disease and the potential in vivo activity of new drugs targeting neoplastic mast cells.",,"['Bibi, Siham', 'Zhang, Yanyan', 'Hugonin, Caroline', 'Mangean, Mallorie Depond', 'He, Liang', 'Wedeh, Ghaith', 'Launay, Jean-Marie', 'Van Rijn, Sjoerd', 'Wurdinger, Thomas', 'Louache, Fawzia', 'Arock, Michel']","['Bibi S', 'Zhang Y', 'Hugonin C', 'Mangean MD', 'He L', 'Wedeh G', 'Launay JM', 'Van Rijn S', 'Wurdinger T', 'Louache F', 'Arock M']","['Molecular and Cellular Oncology Research Group, LBPA CNRS UMR 8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Cachan, France.', 'INSERM Unit U1170, Hematopoiese normale et pathologique, Gustave Roussy Campus, Universite Paris Sud Villejuif, France.', 'Molecular and Cellular Oncology Research Group, LBPA CNRS UMR 8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Cachan, France.', 'INSERM Unit U1170, Hematopoiese normale et pathologique, Gustave Roussy Campus, Universite Paris Sud Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM Unit U1170, Hematopoiese normale et pathologique, Gustave Roussy Campus, Universite Paris Sud Villejuif, France.', 'Molecular and Cellular Oncology Research Group, LBPA CNRS UMR 8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Cachan, France.', 'Laboratoire de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire, Inserm U942, Hopital Lariboisiere, AP-HP, Universite Paris Diderot - Paris VII Paris, France.', 'Neuro-oncology Research Group, Department of Neurosurgery, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherland.', 'Neuro-oncology Research Group, Department of Neurosurgery, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherland.', 'Neuroscience Center, Department of Neurology, Massachussetts General Hospital and Neuroscience Program, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'INSERM Unit U1170, Hematopoiese normale et pathologique, Gustave Roussy Campus, Universite Paris Sud Villejuif, France.', 'Molecular and Cellular Oncology Research Group, LBPA CNRS UMR 8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Cachan, France.', ""Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, AP-HP, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC) Paris VI, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/deficiency/genetics', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/blood/*genetics', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/enzymology/pathology/*transplantation', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",['NOTNLM'],"['KIT D816V mutant', 'NSG mice', 'ROSAKIT D816V cell line', 'advanced systemic mastocytosis', 'gluc reporter']",2016/10/27 06:00,2018/02/22 06:00,['2016/10/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['12824 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12824 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Dec 13;7(50):82985-83000. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12824.,,,PMC5347747,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These aggressive tumours are relatively chemo-resistant, therefore new treatment approaches are urgently required. We have previously reported on the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy (OV) delivered by isolated limb perfusion. In this report, we have improved therapeutic outcomes by combining OV with radiotherapy. In vitro, the combination of oncolytic vaccinia virus (GLV-1h68) and radiotherapy demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity. This effect was not due to increased viral replication, but mediated through induction of intrinsic apoptosis. GLV-1h68 therapy downregulated the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins (MCL-1 and BCL-XL) and the downstream inhibitors of apoptosis, resulting in cleavage of effector caspases 3 and 7. In an in vivo ILP model, the combination of OV and radiotherapy significantly delayed tumour growth and prolonged survival compared to single agent therapy. These data suggest that the virally-mediated down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins may increase the sensitivity of tumour cells to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation. Oncolytic virotherapy represents an exciting candidate for clinical development when delivered by ILP.

Childhood leukemia is a particular concern because of the disease severity, vulnerable population, and short disease latency. A comprehensive review of carcinogens and leukemogens associated with UO&G development is not available and could inform future exposure monitoring studies and human health assessments. The objective of this analysis was to assess the evidence of carcinogenicity of water contaminants and air pollutants related to UO&G development. We obtained a list of 1177 chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids and wastewater from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and constructed a list of 143 UO&G-related air pollutants through a review of scientific papers published through 2015 using PubMed and ProQuest databases. We assessed carcinogenicity and evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma of these chemicals using International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) monographs. The majority of compounds (>80%) were not evaluated by IARC and therefore could not be reviewed. Of the 111 potential water contaminants and 29 potential air pollutants evaluated by IARC (119 unique compounds), 49 water and 20 air pollutants were known, probable, or possible human carcinogens (55 unique compounds). A total of 17 water and 11 air pollutants (20 unique compounds) had evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma, including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, diesel exhaust, and several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Though information on the carcinogenicity of compounds associated with UO&G development was limited, our assessment identified 20 known or suspected carcinogens that could be measured in future studies to advance exposure and risk assessments of cancer-causing agents. Our findings support the need for investigation into the relationship between UO&G development and risk of cancer in general and childhood leukemia in particular.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in Ptpn11 induce a JMML-like MPN through cell-autonomous mechanisms that are dependent on Shp2 catalytic activity. However, the effect of these mutations in the bone marrow microenvironment remains unclear. Here we report that Ptpn11 activating mutations in the mouse bone marrow microenvironment promote the development and progression of MPN through profound detrimental effects on haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Ptpn11 mutations in mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells and osteoprogenitors, but not in differentiated osteoblasts or endothelial cells, cause excessive production of the CC chemokine CCL3 (also known as MIP-1alpha), which recruits monocytes to the area in which HSCs also reside. Consequently, HSCs are hyperactivated by interleukin-1beta and possibly other proinflammatory cytokines produced by monocytes, leading to exacerbated MPN and to donor-cell-derived MPN following stem cell transplantation. Remarkably, administration of CCL3 receptor antagonists effectively reverses MPN development induced by the Ptpn11-mutated bone marrow microenvironment. This study reveals the critical contribution of Ptpn11 mutations in the bone marrow microenvironment to leukaemogenesis and identifies CCL3 as a potential therapeutic target for controlling leukaemic progression in Noonan syndrome and for improving stem cell transplantation therapy in Noonan-syndrome-associated leukaemias.",,"['Dong, Lei', 'Yu, Wen-Mei', 'Zheng, Hong', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Bunting, Silvia T', 'Pauly, Melinda', 'Huang, Gang', 'Zhou, Muxiang', 'Broxmeyer, Hal E', 'Scadden, David T', 'Qu, Cheng-Kui']","['Dong L', 'Yu WM', 'Zheng H', 'Loh ML', 'Bunting ST', 'Pauly M', 'Huang G', 'Zhou M', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Scadden DT', 'Qu CK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94122, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA."", 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine and MGH Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology and Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20161026,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cellular Microenvironment/*genetics', 'Chemokine CCL3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Noonan Syndrome/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Niche/*genetics', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",,,2016/11/04 06:00,2017/03/23 06:00,['2016/11/04 06:00'],"['2015/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['nature20131 [pii]', '10.1038/nature20131 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2016 Nov 10;539(7628):304-308. doi: 10.1038/nature20131.

Rituximab pharmacokinetics shows a time dependency possibly related to changes in the target antigen amount over time. The purpose of this study was to quantify the influence of both CD20 antigenic mass and the FcgammaRIIIA genetic polymorphism on rituximab pharmacokinetics in CLL. METHODS: Rituximab pharmacokinetics was described in 118 CLL patients using a semi-mechanistic model including a latent target antigen turnover, which allowed the estimation of rituximab target-mediated elimination in addition to the endogenous clearance. RESULTS: Target-mediated elimination rate constant increased with the baseline CD20 count on circulating B cells (p = 0.00046) and in patients with the FCGR3A-158VV genotype (p = 0.0016). Physiologic elimination of antigen was lower in the Binet C disease stage (p = 0.00018). The effects of these covariates on rituximab concentrations were mainly visible at the beginning of treatment. Body surface area also increased central and peripheral volumes of distribution (p = 1.3 x 10(-5) and 0.0015, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacokinetic model including target-mediated elimination accurately described rituximab concentrations in CLL and showed that rituximab 'consumption' (target-mediated elimination) increases with increasing baseline antigen count on circulating B cells and in FCGR3A-158VV patients.

Despite numerous clinical studies, the data in the literature are not conclusive. The complexity of the MSI phenomenon in some malignancies may, at least partly, account for the discrepancy. In addition, methodological problems are also pointed out in the assay techniques. We previously established a unique fluorescent technique in which the major methodological problems in conventional assays are overcome. Application of this technique has revealed two distinct modes of microsatellite alterations, i.e. Type A and Type B. More importantly, we demonstrated that Type A MSI is the direct consequence of defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) that causes cellular resistance against antineoplastic agents. METHOD: We first applied this technique to adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL). RESULTS: The MSI phenomenon was indeed observed in ATLLs (4/20, 20%). Intriguingly, the observed microsatellite alterations were invariably Type A, which implies that the tumours were MMR-defective. Indeed, clinical outcomes of patients with these MSI(+) tumours were significantly worse. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that Type A MSI is an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: These observations strongly suggest the possibility of Type A MSI as a prognostic and potentially predictive biomarker in ATLL.",,"['Miyashita, Kaname', 'Fujii, Kei', 'Taguchi, Kenichi', 'Shimokawa, Mototsugu', 'Yoshida, Mitsuaki A', 'Abe, Yasunobu', 'Okamura, Jun', 'Oda, Shinya', 'Uike, Naokuni']","['Miyashita K', 'Fujii K', 'Taguchi K', 'Shimokawa M', 'Yoshida MA', 'Abe Y', 'Okamura J', 'Oda S', 'Uike N']","['Clinical Research Institute, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, 811-1395, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, 811-1395, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Bioregulatory Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Oncology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Institute, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, 811-1395, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Institute, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, 811-1395, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Emergency Medicine, Hirosaki University, Aomori, 036-8560, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, 811-1395, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Institute, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, 811-1395, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Institute, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, 811-1395, Japan. soda@nk-cc.go.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, 811-1395, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161025,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'DNA Mismatch Repair/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Instability', 'Middle Aged', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma', 'Biomarker', 'Chemotherapy', 'DNA mismatch repair', 'Drug resistance', 'Microsatellite instability']",2016/10/27 06:00,2017/02/18 06:00,['2016/10/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-016-2294-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-016-2294-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2017 Mar;143(3):399-408. doi: 10.1007/s00432-016-2294-1.

Data were extracted on patient and health care system-related factors and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was shortest for leukemia (18.5 d) and longest for bone tumors (86.5 d). Tumor type was the only factor associated with time to diagnosis. In 52% of cases an incorrect nononcological diagnosis was initially made. Soft tissue sarcomas and brain tumors were misdiagnosed most often. Neither prolonged time to diagnosis nor initial misdiagnosis was associated with reduced survival.

This cellular response involves nuclear antiviral factors targeting incoming viral genomes. Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is the best-studied model in this context, and it was shown that upon nuclear entry HSV-1 genomes are immediately targeted by components of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and the nuclear DNA sensor IFI16 (interferon gamma inducible protein 16). Based on HSV-1 studies, together with limited examples in other viral systems, these phenomena are widely believed to be a common cellular response to incoming viral genomes, although formal evidence for each virus is lacking. Indeed, recent studies suggest that the case may be different for adenovirus infection. Here we summarize the existing experimental evidence for the roles of nuclear antiviral factors against incoming viral genomes to better understand cellular responses on a virus-by-virus basis. We emphasize that cells seem to respond differently to different incoming viral genomes and discuss possible arguments for and against a unifying cellular mechanism targeting the incoming genomes of different virus families.",,"['Komatsu, Tetsuro', 'Nagata, Kyosuke', 'Wodrich, Harald']","['Komatsu T', 'Nagata K', 'Wodrich H']","['Microbiologie Fondamentale et Pathogenicite, MFP CNRS UMR 5234, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux 33076, France. tetsuro.komatsu@u-bordeaux.fr.', 'Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba 305-8575, Japan. tetsuro.komatsu@u-bordeaux.fr.', 'Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba 305-8575, Japan. knagata@md.tsukuba.ac.jp.', 'Microbiologie Fondamentale et Pathogenicite, MFP CNRS UMR 5234, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux 33076, France. harald.wodrich@u-bordeaux.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161022,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*immunology/*virology', 'DNA Viruses/genetics/*immunology/*physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*IFI16', '*PML nuclear body', '*adenovirus', '*antiviral response', '*herpesvirus', '*incoming viral genomes', '*intrinsic immunity']",2016/10/27 06:00,2017/09/14 06:00,['2016/10/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['v8100290 [pii]', '10.3390/v8100290 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2016 Oct 22;8(10). pii: v8100290. doi: 10.3390/v8100290.,,,PMC5086622,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

The prickly morphology of this Au nanoflower brought a higher catalytic ability with enhanced kinetic parameters than traditional Au nanoparticles that showed a smooth surface. Therefore, based on this discovery, a smart electrochemical aptamer biosensor for K562 leukemia cancer cells was further presented with good performance in selectivity and sensitivity attributed to the excellent mimetic peroxidase catalytic activity of this newly synthesized Au nanoflower decorated graphene-hemin composite (H-RGO-Au NFs).","['(c) 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We conducted a longitudinal study to investigate the variations of AMH in evaluating the acute and chronic effects of cancer therapy on the ovary. Three young female patients with different hematological diseases were registered, and their medical records were reviewed. Patient 1 with myelodysplastic syndrome received reduced-intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at 10 yr of age. Breast development and menarche occurred spontaneously after HSCT; however, AMH level became undetectable and gonadotropin did not increase. Patient 2 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had been receiving chemotherapy since 11 yr of age. AMH level became undetectable but increased after chemotherapy and was associated with regular menstruation. Patient 3 with acute myeloid leukemia received chemotherapy at 13 yr of age and myeloablative HSCT at 14 yr of age. AMH level became undetectable after HSCT, and the patient developed amenorrhea.

To circumvent the genetic heterogeneity of AML patient cohorts, we have developed a model system, driven by the MLL-AF9 (MA9) oncogene, to generate multiple human leukemias using progenitor cells from a single healthy donor. Through stepwise RNA-sequencing data generated using this model and AML patients, we have identified consistent changes associated with MA9-driven leukemogenesis and demonstrate that no recurrent secondary mutations are required. We identify 39 biomarkers whose high expression level is specific to this genetic subtype of AML and validate that many of these have diagnostic utility. We further examined one biomarker, the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) RET, and show through shRNA knockdowns that its expression is essential for in vivo and in vitro growth of MA9-AML.

Due to its heterogeneity and to the high rate of acquired drug resistance and relapse, new treatment strategies are needed. Here, we demonstrate that IFNgamma promotes AML blasts to act as effector cells within the context of antibody therapy. Treatment with IFNgamma drove AML blasts toward a more differentiated state, wherein they showed increased expression of the M1-related markers HLA-DR and CD86, as well as of FcgammaRI, which mediates effector responses to therapeutic antibodies. Importantly, IFNgamma was able to up-regulate CD38, the target of the therapeutic antibody daratumumab. Because the antigen (CD38) and effector receptor (FcgammaRI) were both simultaneously up-regulated on the AML blasts, we tested whether IFNgamma treatment of the AML cell lines THP-1 and MV4-11 could stimulate them to target one another after the addition of daratumumab. Results showed that IFNgamma significantly increased daratumumab-mediated cytotoxicity, as measured both by (51)Cr release and lactate dehydrogenase release assays. We also found that the combination of IFNgamma and activation of FcgammaR led to the release of granzyme B by AML cells. Finally, using a murine NSG model of subcutaneous AML, we found that treatment with IFNgamma plus daratumumab significantly attenuated tumor growth. Taken together, these studies show a novel mechanism of daratumumab-mediated killing and a possible new therapeutic strategy for AML.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Fatehchand, Kavin', 'McMichael, Elizabeth L', 'Reader, Brenda F', 'Fang, Huiqing', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Gautam, Shalini', 'Elavazhagan, Saranya', 'Mehta, Payal', 'Buteyn, Nathaniel J', 'Merchand-Reyes, Giovanna', 'Vasu, Sumithira', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Benson, Don M Jr', 'Blachly, James S', 'Carson, William E 3rd', 'Byrd, John C', 'Butchar, Jonathan P', 'Tridandapani, Susheela']","['Fatehchand K', 'McMichael EL', 'Reader BF', 'Fang H', 'Santhanam R', 'Gautam S', 'Elavazhagan S', 'Mehta P', 'Buteyn NJ', 'Merchand-Reyes G', 'Vasu S', 'Mo X', 'Benson DM Jr', 'Blachly JS', 'Carson WE 3rd', 'Byrd JC', 'Butchar JP', 'Tridandapani S']","['From the Medical Scientist Training Program.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Program, and.', 'Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Program, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Center for Biostatistics, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'From the Medical Scientist Training Program.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'From the Medical Scientist Training Program.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, butchar.2@osu.edu.', 'From the Medical Scientist Training Program, tridandapani.2@osu.edu.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program.', 'Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Program, and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161025,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (IFNG protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '4Z63YK6E0E (daratumumab)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granzymes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Fc receptor', '*antibody', '*interferon', '*signal transduction', '*tumor immunology']",2016/10/27 06:00,2017/05/27 06:00,['2016/10/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)34553-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.753145 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Dec 2;291(49):25656-25666. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.753145.

Inducing nuclear accumulation of these proteins by inhibiting XPO1 causes cancer cell death. First clinical validation of pharmacological inhibition of XPO1 was obtained with the Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compound selinexor (KPT-330) demonstrating activity in phase-II/IIb clinical trials when dosed 1 to 3 times weekly. The second-generation SINE compound KPT-8602 shows improved tolerability and can be dosed daily. Here, we investigate and validate the drug-target interaction of KPT-8602 and explore its activity against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Experimental Design: We examined the effect of KPT-8602 on XPO1 function and XPO1-cargo as well as on a panel of leukemia cell lines. Mutant XPO1 leukemia cells were designed to validate KPT-8602's drug-target interaction. In vivo, anti-ALL activity was measured in a mouse ALL model and patient-derived ALL xenograft models.Results: KPT-8602 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in a panel of leukemic cell lines in vitro Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we demonstrated the specificity of KPT-8602 for cysteine 528 in the cargo-binding groove of XPO1 and validated the drug target interaction. In vivo, KPT-8602 showed potent anti-leukemia activity in a mouse ALL model as well as in patient-derived T- and B-ALL xenograft models without affecting normal hematopoiesis.Conclusions: KPT-8602 is highly specific for XPO1 inhibition and demonstrates potent anti-leukemic activity supporting clinical application of the second-generation SINE compound for the treatment of ALL.

However, existing methods for measuring similarity in large numbers of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with sequencing (ChIP-seq), such as correlation, mutual information or enrichment analysis, are limited in their ability to display functionally relevant TF relationships. In this study, we propose the use of graphical models to determine conditional independence between TFs and showed that network visualization provides a promising alternative to distinguish 'direct' versus 'indirect' TF interactions. We applied four algorithms to measure 'direct' dependence to a compendium of 367 mouse haematopoietic TF ChIP-seq samples and obtained a consensus network known as a 'TF association network' where edges in the network corresponded to likely causal pairwise relationships between TFs. The 'TF association network' illustrates the role of TFs in developmental pathways, is reminiscent of combinatorial TF regulation, corresponds to known protein-protein interactions and indicates substantial TF-binding reorganization in leukemic cell types. With the rapid increase in TF ChIP-Seq data sets, the approach presented here will be a powerful tool to study transcriptional programmes across a wide range of biological systems.",['(c) The Author 2016.

However, the association has not been statistically validated, and there is no consensus regarding optimal management of anticoagulation among patients receiving ibrutinib who develop Afib/Aflutter. We performed a systematic review and pooled analysis to precisely assess the risk of Afib/Aflutter and bleeding associated with ibrutinib treatment in patients with hematologic malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database, and meeting abstracts up to May 15, 2016, for randomized controlled trials comparing ibrutinib to chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody, or a combination. Primary outcomes were serious Afib/Aflutter and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes were all-grade Afib/Aflutter and bleeding. We calculated the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR) and estimated the effect of the treatments using a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Ibrutinib treatment was associated with a significantly higher incidence of serious Afib/Aflutter (3.03% vs. 0.80%, RR = 3.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.56-9.29, P = .003), all-grade Afib/Aflutter (8.18% vs. 0.93%, RR = 8.81, 95% CI = 2.70-28.75, P = .0003), and all-grade bleeding (4.85% vs. 1.55%, RR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.14-7.52, P = .03) compared to control treatments. The observed between-treatment difference in major bleeding rates was not statistically significant (3.69% vs. 2.13%, RR = 1.72, 95% CI = 0.95-3.11, P = .07). The risk of these adverse events was not different between subgroups on the basis of pathology, treatment setting, dose, and duration of ibrutinib exposure. CONCLUSION: The risks of Afib/Aflutter and all-grade bleeding were significantly higher in the ibrutinib group. These results indicate the need for vigilant monitoring while the patient is receiving ibrutinib therapy, and careful assessment of the risks and benefits of anticoagulation is required.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Individuals with CMMRD have high risk to develop a broad spectrum of malignancies and frequently display features reminiscent of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Evaluation of the clinical findings of genetically proven CMMRD patients shows that not only multiple cafe-au-lait macules but also any of the diagnostic features of NF1 may be present in a CMMRD patient. This phenotypic overlap may lead to misdiagnosis of CMMRD patients as having NF1, which impedes adequate management of the patients and their families. The spectrum of CMMRD-associated childhood malignancies includes high-grade glioma, acute myeloid leukaemia or rhabdomyosarcoma, also reported as associated with NF1. Reported associations between NF1 and these malignancies are to a large extent based on studies that neither proved the presence of an NF1 germline mutation nor ruled-out CMMRD in the affected. Hence, these associations are challenged by our current knowledge of the phenotypic overlap between NF1 and CMMRD and should be re-evaluated in future studies.

Diphenhydramine (DPH) is an H1 histamine receptor antagonist and a relatively safe drug. Previous studies have revealed the in vitro cytotoxicity of DPH against melanoma cells, but the mechanisms involved concerning its cytotoxicity and the in vivo anti-melanoma effect remain unknown. We herein present the first evidence supporting that DPH is selectively proapoptotic for a panel of melanoma cell lines irrespective of BRAFV600E status while sparing normal melanocytes. Of note, DPH effectively suppressed tumor growth and prolonged the length of survival of mice bearing B16-F10 melanoma. Mechanistic investigation further revealed that DPH downregulated antiapoptotic MCL-1, whereas MCL-1 overexpression impeded the proapoptotic action of DPH. Moreover, DPH attenuated STAT3 activation, as evidenced by the reduced levels of tyrosine 705-phosphorylated STAT3. Notably, ectopic expression of constitutively active STAT3 mutant reduced DPH-induced apoptosis but also protected MCL-1 from downregulation by DPH, illustrating that DPH impairs STAT3 activation to block STAT3-mediated induction of MCL-1 in eliciting apoptosis. Collectively, we for the first time validate the in vivo antimelanoma effect of DPH and also establish DPH as a drug targeting STAT3/MCL-1 survival signaling pathway to induce apoptosis. Our discovery therefore suggests the potential to repurpose DPH as an anti-melanoma therapeutic agent.",,"['Or, Chi-Hung R', 'Su, Hong-Lin', 'Lee, Wee-Chyan', 'Yang, Shu-Yi', 'Ho, Cheesang', 'Chang, Chia-Che']","['Or CR', 'Su HL', 'Lee WC', 'Yang SY', 'Ho C', 'Chang CC']","['Department of Life Science, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Life Science, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Kuang Tien General Hospital, Dajia Branch, Taichung 43761, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161025,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '8GTS82S83M (Diphenhydramine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diphenhydramine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Melanocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",,,2016/10/26 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/10/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2016.5201 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2016 Dec;36(6):3465-3471. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.5201.

MDR is mainly associated with the overexpression of drug efflux transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins.

Homeobox (HOX) B4, a member of the HOX gene family, has been reported to be correlated with occurrence, development, poor prognosis and drug resistance of human leukemia. In the present study, HOXB4 expression was analyzed in K562 cell line and its MDR subline K562/ADM. Compared with K562 cells, drug-resistant K562/ADM cells demonstrated evidently higher HOXB4 expression. In addition, we firstly investigated the reversal effect of HOXB4 deletion on K562/ADM cells and the underlying mechanism. The Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assays showed that knockdown of HOXB4 enhanced chemosensitivity and decreased drug efflux in K562/ADM cells. Moreover, HOXB4 knockout led to downregulation of P-gp, MRP1 and BCRP expression and PI3K/Akt signaling activity, suggesting that repression of HOXB4 might be a key point to reverse MDR of K562/ADM cells.",,"['Wang, Hong', 'Jia, Xiu-Hong', 'Chen, Jie-Ru', 'Yi, Ying-Jie', 'Wang, Jian-Yong', 'Li, You-Jie', 'Xie, Shu-Yang']","['Wang H', 'Jia XH', 'Chen JR', 'Yi YJ', 'Wang JY', 'Li YJ', 'Xie SY']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, P.R.

Xenografts in severe combined immune deficient mice were used to examine the toxicity and anti CLL activity of acacetin. We evaluated and compared the mechanism of action of acacetin on CLL and healthy B-lymphocytes and their mitochondria. We have found that acacetin (10 muM) can selectively induce apoptosis on CLL B-lymphocyte (25% at 24 h) by directly targeting mitochondria, through increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, MMP collapse, MPT, release of cytochrome c, caspase 3 activation, and finally apoptosis, while sparing normal healthy B-lymphocytes unaffected at similar concentrations. Besides, oral administration of acacetin showed a potent in vivo anticancer activity in CLL xenograft mouse models. Our in vivo findings indicate that acacetin accumulates and kills CLL B-lymphocyte in a rather selective way through targeting cancerous mitochondria and ROS formation, which ends in CLL therapy.

METHODS: Patient outcomes were simulated using a 6-state Markov model, including complete response (CR), no CR, first relapse, second CR, second relapse, and death. A Weibull distribution was fit to the progression-free survival curve of hyper-CVAD-treated AYA patients from a single-center study, and comparable patient data from a retrospective study of pediatric regimen-treated AYA patients were utilized to estimate a relative progression difference (hazard ratio = 0.51) and model survival differences. Health-state utilities were estimated based on treatment stage, with an assumption that the pediatric protocol had 0.10 disutility compared with hyper-CVAD before the maintenance phase of treatment. Total life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were compared between treatment protocols at 1, 5, and 10 years, with additional probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Treatment with the pediatric-inspired protocol was associated with a 0.04 increase in life-years, but a 0.01 decrease in QALYs at 1 year. By years 5 and 10, the pediatric-inspired protocol resulted in 0.18 and 0.24 increase in life-years and 0.25 and 0.32 increase in QALYs, respectively, relative to hyper-CVAD. The lower quality of life associated with the induction and intensification phases of pediatric treatment was offset by more favorable progression-free survival and overall survival relative to hyper-CVAD.

Recently, the cytosolic localization of LMO2 was revealed in multiple epithelial tissues and a variety of solid tumors. However, the function of LMO2 in these epithelia and solid tumors remains largely unclear. The Wnt signaling pathway is a crucial determinant of development, and abnormalities in several key segments of this pathway contribute to oncogenesis. The current study demonstrated that LMO2 participates in the regulation of canonical Wnt signaling in the cytoplasm by binding to Dishevelled-1/2 (DVL-1/2) proteins. These interactions occurred at the PDZ domain of Dishevelled, and LMO2 subsequently attenuated the activation of the key factor beta-catenin in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Meanwhile, significantly decreased expression of LMO2 was detected in breast and colorectal cancers, and the downregulation of LMO2 in these cells increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Taken together, the data in this study revealed a novel crosstalk between LMO2 and the Wnt signaling pathway during tumorigenesis and suggested that LMO2 might be a tumor suppressor in certain solid tumors, in contrast to its traditional oncogenic role in the hematopoietic system.",,"['Liu, Ye', 'Huang, Di', 'Wang, Zhaoyang', 'Wu, Chao', 'Zhang, Zhao', 'Wang, Dan', 'Li, Zongjin', 'Zhu, Tianhui', 'Yang, Shuang', 'Sun, Wei']","['Liu Y', 'Huang D', 'Wang Z', 'Wu C', 'Zhang Z', 'Wang D', 'Li Z', 'Zhu T', 'Yang S', 'Sun W']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics in School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics in School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics in School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics in School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Anorectal, Tianjin Union Medical Center, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem cells in School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics in School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics in School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics in School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161025,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DVL1 protein, human)', '0 (DVL2 protein, human)', '0 (Dishevelled Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*pathology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Dishevelled Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*physiology', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,,2016/10/26 06:00,2018/05/01 06:00,['2016/10/26 06:00'],"['2016/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['srep36050 [pii]', '10.1038/srep36050 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Oct 25;6:36050. doi: 10.1038/srep36050.,,,PMC5078767,,,,,,,,,,,,,

African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension, in fact the incidence, prevalence, and severity of hypertension is highest among African American (AA) women. Previous data suggests that differential gene expression influences individual susceptibility to selected diseases and we hypothesized that this phenomena may affect health disparities in hypertension. Transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from AA or white, normotensive or hypertensive females identified thousands of mRNAs differentially-expressed by race and/or hypertension. Predominant gene expression differences were observed in AA hypertensive females compared to AA normotensives or white hypertensives. Since microRNAs play important roles in regulating gene expression, we profiled global microRNA expression and observed differentially-expressed microRNAs by race and/or hypertension. We identified novel mRNA-microRNA pairs potentially involved in hypertension-related pathways and differently-expressed, including MCL1/miR-20a-5p, APOL3/miR-4763-5p, PLD1/miR-4717-3p, and PLD1/miR-4709-3p. We validated gene expression levels via RT-qPCR and microRNA target validation was performed in primary endothelial cells. Altogether, we identified significant gene expression differences between AA and white female hypertensives and pinpointed novel mRNA-microRNA pairs differentially-expressed by hypertension and race.

Here we have investigated their anti-tumor effect in multiple myeloma (MM). We demonstrate that cannabinoids induce a selective apoptosis in MM cell lines and in primary plasma cells of MM patients, while sparing normal cells from healthy donors, including hematopoietic stem cells. This effect was mediated by caspase activation, mainly caspase-2, and was partially prevented by a pan-caspase inhibitor. Their pro-apoptotic effect was correlated with an increased expression of Bax and Bak, a decrease of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, a biphasic response of Akt/PKB and an increase in the levels of ceramide in MM cells. Inhibition of ceramide synthesis partially prevented apoptosis, indicating that these sphingolipids play a key role in the pro-apoptotic effect of cannabinoids in MM cells. Remarkably, blockage of the CB2 receptor also inhibited cannabinoid-induced apoptosis. Cannabinoid derivative WIN-55 enhanced the anti-myeloma activity of dexamethasone and melphalan overcoming resistance to melphalan in vitro. Finally, administration of cannabinoid WIN-55 to plasmacytoma-bearing mice significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo.

Identification of predictive markers of chemoresistance is beneficial to selecting of the best therapeutic protocol with the lowest effect adverse. Hence, we aimed to find drug targets using the 2DE/MS proteomics study of a DEXA-resistant cell line (REH) as a model for poor DEXA responding patients before and after drug treatment. Using the proteomic methods, three differentially expressed proteins were detected, including voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), sorting Nexin 3 (SNX3), and prefoldin subunit 6 (PFDN6). We observed low expression of three proteins after DEXA treatment in REH cells. We subsequently verified low expression of resulted proteins at the mRNA level using the quantitative PCR method. These proteins are promising proteins because of their important roles in drug resistance and regulation of apoptosis (VDAC1), protein trafficking (SNX3), and protein folding (PFDN6). Additionally, mRNA expression level of these proteins was assessed in 17 bone marrow samples from children with newly diagnosed ALL and 7 non-cancerous samples as controls. The results indicated that independent of the molecular subtypes of leukemia, mRNA expression of VDAC1, SNX3, and PFDN6 decreased in ALL samples compared with non-cancerous samples particularly in VDAC1 (p < 0.001). Additionally, mRNA expression of three proteins was also declined in high-risk samples compared with standard risk cases. These results demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic value of these proteins in childhood ALL. Furthermore, investigation of protein-protein interaction using STRING database indicated that these proteins involved in the signaling pathway of NR3C1 as dexamethasone target. In conclusion, our proteomic study in DEXA resistant leukemic cells revealed VDAC1, SNX3, and PFDN6 are promising proteins that might serve as potential biomarkers of prognosis and chemotherapy in childhood ALL.",,"['Dehghan-Nayeri, Nasrin', 'Rezaei-Tavirani, Mostafa', 'Omrani, Mir Davood', 'Gharehbaghian, Ahmad', 'Goudarzi Pour, Kourosh', 'Eshghi, Peyman']","['Dehghan-Nayeri N', 'Rezaei-Tavirani M', 'Omrani MD', 'Gharehbaghian A', 'Goudarzi Pour K', 'Eshghi P']","['Proteomics Research Center, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Proteomics Research Center, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. gharehbaghian@sbmu.ac.ir.', 'Pediatric Congenital Hematologic Disorders Research Center, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. gharehbaghian@sbmu.ac.ir.', 'Pediatric Congenital Hematologic Disorders Research Center, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

In particular, FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) are characterized by an unfavorable prognosis and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allogeneic SCT) in first complete remission is recommended. In case of imminent or frank relapse following allogeneic SCT, treatment with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) constitutes a promising clinical approach to induce hematologic remission without conventional chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the response to induction chemotherapy and the outcome of 76 patients with FLT3-ITD-positive AML including 50 patients who underwent allogeneic SCT. Furthermore, efficacy of TKI treatment was evaluated in 18 patients (median age 54 years, range 21-74) with relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD-positive AML. RESULTS: Response to induction chemotherapy in 76 FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients was characterized by a complete remission (CR) rate of 68%. In total, 50 of 76 patients (66%) underwent allogeneic SCT including 40 patients (80%) in CR. Relapse of AML was observed in 21 of 47 patients (45%) after allogeneic SCT with a median relapse-free survival (RFS) of 13 months (range 3-224) for patients with CR prior to or at day +30 after SCT. Myeloablative conditioning resulted in an improved median RFS of 29 months (4-217) as compared to a reduced intensity conditioning protocol prior to allogeneic SCT with a RFS of 8 months (1-197, P = 0.048), respectively. Median OS of FLT3-ITD-positive AML was 17 months (5-225) for patients who received an allogeneic SCT as compared to 9 months (1-184) for patients who did not undergo SCT. Response of FLT3-ITD-positive AML to sorafenib was characterized by only 3 of 18 patients achieving a bone marrow response (17%), while there was no response to second-line treatment with ponatinib. CONCLUSION: This ""real-life"" data reflect the continuing challenge of FLT3-ITD-positive AML and confirm the poor outcome even after allogeneic SCT. Furthermore, efficacy of TKI treatment of relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD AML is still limited and requires substantial improvement, e.g., by the introduction of second-generation inhibitors targeting constitutively active FLT3.",,"['Fleischmann, Maximilian', 'Schnetzke, Ulf', 'Schrenk, Karin G', 'Schmidt, Volker', 'Sayer, Herbert G', 'Hilgendorf, Inken', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Scholl, Sebastian']","['Fleischmann M', 'Schnetzke U', 'Schrenk KG', 'Schmidt V', 'Sayer HG', 'Hilgendorf I', 'Hochhaus A', 'Scholl S']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'HELIOS Klinikum Erfurt, Erfurt, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'HELIOS Klinikum Erfurt, Erfurt, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07740, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07740, Jena, Germany. sebastian.scholl@med.uni-jena.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161024,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sorafenib', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Allogeneic transplantation', 'FLT3-ITD', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2016/10/26 06:00,2017/02/10 06:00,['2016/10/26 06:00'],"['2016/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-016-2290-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-016-2290-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2017 Feb;143(2):337-345. doi: 10.1007/s00432-016-2290-5.

It has been consensus that ASXL1 mutations have adversely impact on overall survival (OS), while the effect of TET2 mutations remains controversial and undefined. METHODS: ASXL1 and TET2 mutations were analyzed in 141 patients with CMML using Sanger sequencing, with the aim to identify the interplay of ASXL1 and TET2 mutations in the prognosis of CMML. RESULTS: Sixty-five (46.1%) of the CMML patients harbored ASXL1 mutations (frameshift and nonsense), and 46 (32.6%) had TET2 mutations (frame shift, nonsense and missense). In a separate multivariable analysis that included the Mayo Prognostic Model as a single variable along with ASXL1wt/TET2wt, the respective hazard ratios of ASXL1mut/TET2mut, ASXL1mut/TET2wt and ASXL1wt/TET2mut were 4.7 (95% CI, 2.2-10.3; P<0.001), 2.2 (95% CI, 1.1-4.2; P=0.025) and 1.3 (95% CI, 0.6-2.5; P=0.521).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the role of CpG methylated regions associated with transcribed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) and repetitive genomic elements are poorly understood. Based on MBD-Seq, we characterized the global methylation profile of high CpG-rich regions in different CLL prognostic subgroups based on IGHV mutational status. RESULTS: Our study identified 5800 hypermethylated and 12,570 hypomethylated CLL-specific differentially methylated genes (cllDMGs) compared to normal controls. From cllDMGs, 40 % of hypermethylated and 60 % of hypomethylated genes were mapped to noncoding RNAs. In addition, we found that the major repetitive elements such as short interspersed elements (SINE) and long interspersed elements (LINE) have a high percentage of cllDMRs (differentially methylated regions) in IGHV subgroups compared to normal controls. Finally, two novel lncRNAs (hypermethylated CRNDE and hypomethylated AC012065.7) were validated in an independent CLL sample cohort (48 samples) compared with 6 normal sorted B cell samples using quantitative pyrosequencing analysis. The methylation levels showed an inverse correlation to gene expression levels analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Notably, survival analysis revealed that hypermethylation of CRNDE and hypomethylation of AC012065.7 correlated with an inferior outcome.

Mutations in the KMT2A gene have only recently been identified as the cause of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome; therefore, only 16 patients from 15 families have been described, and new phenotypic features continue to be added. In this report, we describe 2 newly identified patients with Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome who presented with variable severity. One girl exhibited developmental dysplasia of the hip and fibromatosis colli accompanied by other clinical features, including facial dysmorphism, hypertrichosis, patent ductus arteriosus, growth retardation, and borderline intellectual disability. The other patient, a boy, showed severe developmental retardation with automatic self-mutilation, facial dysmorphism, and hypertrichosis at a later age. Exome sequencing analysis of these patients and their parents revealed a de novo nonsense mutation, p.Gln1978*, of KMT2A in the former, and a missense mutation, p.Gly1168Asp, in the latter, which molecularly confirmed the diagnosis of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome.",,"['Min Ko, Jung', 'Cho, Jae So', 'Yoo, Yongjin', 'Seo, Jieun', 'Choi, Murim', 'Chae, Jong-Hee', 'Lee, Hye-Ran', 'Cho, Tae-Joon']","['Min Ko J', 'Cho JS', 'Yoo Y', 'Seo J', 'Choi M', 'Chae JH', 'Lee HR', 'Cho TJ']","['1 Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', '1 Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', '2 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', '2 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', '2 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', '1 Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', '3 Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', '3 Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20161024,United States,J Child Neurol,Journal of child neurology,8606714,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developmental Disabilities/*genetics', 'Face/abnormalities', 'Female', 'Forearm/abnormalities', 'Hand Deformities, Congenital/genetics', 'Hip Dislocation, Congenital/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypertrichosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Musculoskeletal Abnormalities/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Syndrome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*KMT2A', '*Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome', '*congenital hip dislocation', '*fibromatosis colli', '*psychomotor retardation']",2016/11/01 06:00,2018/01/03 06:00,['2016/11/01 06:00'],"['2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['0883073816674095 [pii]', '10.1177/0883073816674095 [doi]']",ppublish,J Child Neurol. 2017 Feb;32(2):237-242. doi: 10.1177/0883073816674095.

During TCR signaling, the adaptor protein Bcl10 is inducibly recruited to the CARD11 scaffold protein as part of a multicomponent complex that induces IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity and NF-kappaB activation. Here, we show that a consequence of this recruitment is the TCR-induced conjugation of Bcl10 with linear-linked polyubiquitin chains to generate the signaling intermediate Lin(Ub)n-Bcl10, which is required for the association of Bcl10 with the NEMO subunit of the IKK complex. The TCR-induced generation of Lin(Ub)n-Bcl10 requires Bcl10 lysines 17, 31, and 63, CARD11, MALT1, and the HOIP subunit of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) but not the HOIP accessory protein SHARPIN. CARD11 promotes signal-induced Lin(Ub)n-Bcl10 generation by co-recruiting Bcl10 with HOIP, thereby bringing substrate to enzyme. The CARD11-HOIP interaction is rendered TCR-inducible by the four autoinhibitory repressive elements in the CARD11 inhibitory domain and involves the CARD11 coiled-coil domain and two independent regions of HOIP. Interestingly, oncogenic CARD11 variants associated with diffuse large B cell lymphoma spontaneously induce Lin(Ub)n-Bcl10 production to extents that correlate with their abilities to activate NF-kappaB and with their enhanced abilities to bind HOIP and Bcl10. Our results define molecular determinants that control the production of Lin(Ub)n-Bcl10, an important signaling intermediate in TCR and oncogenic CARD11 signaling.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Yang, Yong-Kang', 'Yang, Chao', 'Chan, Waipan', 'Wang, Zhaoquan', 'Deibel, Katelynn E', 'Pomerantz, Joel L']","['Yang YK', 'Yang C', 'Chan W', 'Wang Z', 'Deibel KE', 'Pomerantz JL']","['From the Department of Biological Chemistry and Institute for Cell Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.', 'From the Department of Biological Chemistry and Institute for Cell Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.', 'From the Department of Biological Chemistry and Institute for Cell Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.', 'From the Department of Biological Chemistry and Institute for Cell Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.', 'From the Department of Biological Chemistry and Institute for Cell Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.', 'From the Department of Biological Chemistry and Institute for Cell Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205 joel.pomerantz@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161024,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (BCL10 protein, human)', '0 (CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RNF31 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (MALT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (CARD11 protein, human)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (Guanylate Cyclase)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Guanylate Cyclase/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl10', '*CARD11', '*LUBAC', '*NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB)', '*T cell receptor', '*diffuse large B cell Lymphoma', '*gene regulation', '*oncogene', '*scaffold protein', '*signal transduction']",2016/10/26 06:00,2017/05/27 06:00,['2016/10/26 06:00'],"['2016/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)34495-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.754028 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Dec 9;291(50):25921-25936. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.754028.

PI3K pathway signaling inhibitors have been minimally investigated in Ph-like ALL. We hypothesized that targeted inhibition of PI3Kalpha, PI3Kdelta, PI3K/mTOR, or target of rapamycin complex 1/2 (TORC1/TORC2) would decrease leukemia proliferation and abrogate aberrant kinase signaling and that combined PI3K pathway and JAK inhibition or PI3K pathway and SRC/ABL inhibition would have superior efficacy compared to inhibitor monotherapy. We treated 10 childhood ALL patient-derived xenograft models harboring various Ph-like genomic alterations with 4 discrete PI3K pathway protein inhibitors and observed marked leukemia reduction and in vivo signaling inhibition in all models. Treatment with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor gedatolisib resulted in near eradication of ALL in cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2)/JAK-mutant models with mean 92.2% (range, 86.0%-99.4%) reduction vs vehicle controls (P < .0001) and in prolonged animal survival. Gedatolisib also inhibited ALL proliferation in ABL/platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-mutant models with mean 66.9% (range, 42.0%-87.6%) reduction vs vehicle (P < .0001). Combined gedatolisib and ruxolitinib treatment of CRLF2/JAK-mutant models more effectively inhibited ALL proliferation than either inhibitor alone (P < .001) and further enhanced survival. Similarly, superior efficacy of combined gedatolisib and dasatinib was observed in ABL/PDGFR-mutant models (P < .001). Overall, PI3K/mTOR inhibition potently decreased ALL burden in vivo; antileukemia activity was further enhanced with combination inhibitor therapy.

Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an attractive cell source for this population because of the low risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the strong graft-versus-leukemia effect, and prompt donor availability. This retrospective, registry-based study reported UCB transplantation (UCBT) outcomes in 252 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 157) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; n = 95) diagnosed before 1 year of age who received a single-unit UCBT after myeloablative conditioning between 1996 and 2012 in European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation centers. Median age at UCBT was 1.1 years, and median follow-up was 42 months. Most patients (57%) received a graft with 1 HLA disparity and were transplanted in first complete remission (CR; 55%). Cumulative incidence function (CIF) of day 100 acute GVHD (grades II to IV) was 40% +/- 3% and of 4-year chronic GVHD was 13% +/- 2%. CIF of 1-year transplant-related mortality was 23% +/- 3% and of 4-year relapse was 27% +/- 3%. Leukemia-free-survival (LFS) at 4 years was 50% +/- 3%; it was 40% and 66% for those transplanted for ALL and AML, respectively (P = .001). LFS was better for patients transplanted in first CR, regardless of diagnosis. In multivariate model, diagnosis of ALL (P = .001), advanced disease status at UCBT (<.001), age at diagnosis younger than 3 months (P = .012), and date of transplant before 2004 were independently associated with worse LFS. UCBT is a suitable option for patients diagnosed with infant acute leukemia who achieve CR.

In this context, a major contribution was provided by the introduction of the nucleoside analog nelarabine, approved for salvage treatment of T-ALL patients with refractory/relapsed disease. However, nelarabine could induce a life-threatening, dose-dependent neurotoxicity. To improve nelarabine efficacy, we have analyzed its molecular targets, testing selective inhibitors of such targets in combination with nelarabine. METHODS: The effectiveness of nelarabine as single agent or in combination with PI3K, Bcl2, and MEK inhibitors was evaluated on human T-ALL cell lines and primary T-ALL refractory/relapsed lymphoblasts. The efficacy of signal modulators in terms of cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis, and changes in gene and protein expression was assessed by flow cytometry, western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR in T-ALL settings. RESULTS: Treatment with nelarabine as a single agent identified two groups of T-ALL cell lines, one sensitive and one resistant to the drug. Whereas sensitive T-ALL cells showed a significant increase of apoptosis and a strong down-modulation of PI3K signaling, resistant T-ALL cells showed a hyperactivation of AKT and MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways, not caused by differences in the expression of nelarabine transporters or metabolic activators. We then studied the combination of nelarabine with the PI3K inhibitors (both pan and dual gamma/delta inhibitors), with the Bcl2 specific inhibitor ABT199, and with the MEK inhibitor trametinib on both T-ALL cell lines and patient samples at relapse, which displayed constitutive activation of PI3K signaling and resistance to nelarabine alone. The combination with the pan PI3K inhibitor ZSTK-474 was the most effective in inhibiting the growth of T-ALL cells and was synergistic in decreasing cell survival and inducing apoptosis in nelarabine-resistant T-ALL cells. The drug combination caused AKT dephosphorylation and a downregulation of Bcl2, while nelarabine alone induced an increase in p-AKT and Bcl2 signaling in the resistant T-ALL cells and relapsed patient samples. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that nelarabine in combination with PI3K inhibitors may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of T-ALL relapsed patients.",,"['Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Buontempo, Francesca', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Evangelisti, Cecilia', 'Orsini, Ester', 'Zambonin, Laura', 'Neri, Luca Maria', 'Martelli, Alberto Maria', 'Chiarini, Francesca']","['Lonetti A', 'Cappellini A', 'Bertaina A', 'Locatelli F', 'Pession A', 'Buontempo F', 'Evangelisti C', 'Evangelisti C', 'Orsini E', 'Zambonin L', 'Neri LM', 'Martelli AM', 'Chiarini F']","['Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Human Social and Health Sciences, University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, IRCCS, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, IRCCS, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Pediatrics, ""Lalla Seragnoli"" Hematology-Oncology Unit, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, National Research Council, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. alberto.martelli@unibo.it.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, National Research Council, Bologna, Italy. francesca.chiarini@cnr.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161024,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Triazines)', '0 (ZSTK474)', '33E86K87QN (trametinib)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arabinonucleosides/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pyridones/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Triazines/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Combination therapy', '*Drug resistance', '*PI3K signaling']",2016/10/26 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2016/10/26 06:00'],"['2016/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0344-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0344-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Oct 24;9(1):114. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0344-4.,,,PMC5075755,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4568-3189'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, the emergence of unresponsive disease due to low or absent cell surface CD20 urges the need to develop additional strategies. In contrast to mAbs, T-cells via their T-cell receptor (TCR) can recognize not only extracellular but also intracellular antigens in the context of HLA molecules. We hypothesized that T-cells equipped with high affinity CD20-targeting TCRs would be able to recognize B-cell malignancies even in the absence of extracellular CD20. We isolated CD8+ T-cell clones binding to peptide-MHC-tetramers composed of HLA-A*02:01 and CD20-derived peptide SLFLGILSV (CD20SLF) from HLA-A*02:01neg healthy individuals to overcome tolerance towards self-antigens such as CD20. High avidity T-cell clones were identified that readily recognized and lysed primary HLA-A2pos B-cell leukemia and lymphoma in the absence of reactivity against CD20-negative but HLA-A2pos healthy hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. The T-cell clone with highest avidity efficiently lysed malignant cell-lines that had insufficient extracellular CD20 to be targeted by CD20 mAbs. Transfer of this TCR installed potent CD20-specificity onto recipient T-cells and led to lysis of CD20low malignant cell-lines. Moreover, our approach facilitates the generation of an off-the-shelf TCR library with broad applicability by targeting various HLA alleles. Using the same methodology, we isolated a T-cell clone that efficiently lysed primary HLA-B*07:02pos B-cell malignancies by targeting another CD20-derived peptide. TCR gene transfer of high affinity CD20-specific TCRs can be a valuable addition to current treatment options for patients suffering from CD20low B-cell malignancies.",,"['Jahn, Lorenz', 'van der Steen, Dirk M', 'Hagedoorn, Renate S', 'Hombrink, Pleun', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'Schoonakker, Marjolein P', 'de Ridder, Danielle', 'van Veelen, Peter A', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M']","['Jahn L', 'van der Steen DM', 'Hagedoorn RS', 'Hombrink P', 'Kester MG', 'Schoonakker MP', 'de Ridder D', 'van Veelen PA', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Heemskerk MH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematopoiesis, Sanquin Research, 1006 AD Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD20/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Genetic Therapy', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell leukemia and lymphoma', 'CD20', 'TCR gene transfer', 'immunotherapy', 'monoclonal antibodies']",2016/10/25 06:00,2018/02/13 06:00,['2016/10/25 06:00'],"['2016/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['12778 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12778 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 22;7(47):77021-77037. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12778.,,,PMC5363567,,,,,,['Oncotarget. 2017 Feb 21;8(8):12538-12539.

Herein, a novel amphiphilic small molecular prodrug of Ara-C was developed by coupling a short aliphatic chain, hexanoic acid (HA) to 4-NH2 of the parent drug. Based on the amphiphilic nature, the resulting bioconjugate (HA-Ara) could spontaneously self-assemble into stable spherical nanoassemblies (NAs) with an extremely high drug loading ( approximately 71wt%). Moreover, folate receptor (FR)-targeting NAs with high grafting efficient folic acid - bovine serum albumin (FA-BSA) conjugate immobilized on the surface (NAs/FA-BSA) was prepared. The results of MTT assays on FR-positive K562 cells and FR-negative A549 cells demonstrated higher cytotoxicity of HA-Ara NAs than the native drug. Especially, the IC50 values revealed that NAs/FA-BSA was 3 and 2-fold effective than non-targeted NAs after 24 and 48h treatment with K562 cells, respectively indicating FR-mediated enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. In vitro cellular uptake, larger accumulation of HA-Ara NAs were observed in comparative with the free FITC and the results further confirmed the selective uptake of NAs/FA-BSA in folate receptor enriched cancer cells.

Viruses are transmitted by polarized budding and by transfer of viral biofilms at the virological synapse (VS). Formation of the VS requires the viral Tax protein and polarization of the host cytoskeleton, however, molecular mechanisms of HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission remain incompletely understood. Recently, we could show Tax-dependent upregulation of the actin-bundling protein Fascin (FSCN-1) in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Here, we report that Fascin contributes to HTLV-1 transmission. Using single-cycle replication-dependent HTLV-1 reporter vectors, we found that repression of endogenous Fascin by short hairpin RNAs and by Fascin-specific nanobodies impaired gag p19 release and cell-to-cell transmission in 293T cells. In Jurkat T-cells, Tax-induced Fascin expression enhanced virus release and Fascin-dependently augmented cell-to-cell transmission to Raji/CD4+ B-cells. Repression of Fascin in HTLV-1-infected T-cells diminished virus release and gag p19 transfer to co-cultured T-cells. Spotting the mechanism, flow cytometry and automatic image analysis showed that Tax-induced T-cell conjugate formation occurred Fascin-independently. However, adhesion of HTLV-1-infected MT-2 cells in co-culture with Jurkat T-cells was reduced upon knockdown of Fascin, suggesting that Fascin contributes to dissemination of infected T-cells. Imaging of chronically infected MS-9 T-cells in co-culture with Jurkat T-cells revealed that Fascin's localization at tight cell-cell contacts is accompanied by gag polarization suggesting that Fascin directly affects the distribution of gag to budding sites, and therefore, indirectly viral transmission. In detail, we found gag clusters that are interspersed with Fascin clusters, suggesting that Fascin makes room for gag in viral biofilms. Moreover, we observed short, Fascin-containing membrane extensions surrounding gag clusters and clutching uninfected T-cells. Finally, we detected Fascin and gag in long-distance cellular protrusions. Taken together, we show for the first time that HTLV-1 usurps the host cell factor Fascin to foster virus release and cell-to-cell transmission.",,"['Gross, Christine', 'Wiesmann, Veit', 'Millen, Sebastian', 'Kalmer, Martina', 'Wittenberg, Thomas', 'Gettemans, Jan', 'Thoma-Kress, Andrea K']","['Gross C', 'Wiesmann V', 'Millen S', 'Kalmer M', 'Wittenberg T', 'Gettemans J', 'Thoma-Kress AK']","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Campus Rommelaere, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161024,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (FSCN1 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,,"['Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HTLV-I Infections/*transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Microfilament Proteins/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Virus Release/*physiology']",,,2016/10/25 06:00,2017/05/20 06:00,['2016/10/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1005916 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-16-00987 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2016 Oct 24;12(10):e1005916. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005916. eCollection 2016 Oct.,,,PMC5077169,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2643-5849'],['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,

DUX4 rearrangement and overexpression was present in all cases and was accompanied by transcriptional deregulation of ERG, expression of a novel ERG isoform, ERGalt, and frequent ERG deletion. ERGalt uses a non-canonical first exon whose transcription was initiated by DUX4 binding. ERGalt retains the DNA-binding and transactivation domains of ERG, but it inhibits wild-type ERG transcriptional activity and is transforming. These results illustrate a unique paradigm of transcription factor deregulation in leukemia in which DUX4 deregulation results in loss of function of ERG, either by deletion or induced expression of

Most of the RAS molecules including ACE, ACE2, AGT, AGTR1, AGTR2, AKR1C4, AKR1D1, ANPEP, ATP6AP2, CMA1, CPA3, CTSA, CTSD, CTSG, CYP11A1, CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP17A1, CYP21A2, DPP3, EGFR, ENPEP, GPER, HSD11B1, HSD11B2, IGF2R, KLK1, LNPEP, MAS1, MME, NR3C1, NR3C2, PREP, REN, RNPEP, and THOP1 are locally present in the BM microenvironment. Local BM RAS peptides control the hematopoietic niche, myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis, thrombopoiesis and the development of other cellular lineages. Local BM RAS is important in hematopoietic stem cell biology and microenvironment. Angiotensin II regulates the proliferation, differentiation, and engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells. Activation of Mas receptor or ACE2 promotes proliferation of CD34+ cells. BM contains a progenitor that expresses renin throughout development. Angiotensin II attenuates the migration and proliferation of CD34+ Cells and promotes the adhesion of both MNCs and CD34+ cells. Renin cells in hematopoietic organs are precursor B cells. The renin cell requires RBP-J to differentiate. Mutant renin-expressing hematopoietic precursors can cause leukemia. Deletion of RBP-J in the renin-expressing progenitors enriches the precursor B-cell gene programme. Mutant cells undergo a neoplastic transformation, and mice develop a highly penetrant B-cell leukemia with multi-organ infiltration and early death. Many biological conditions during the development and function of blood cells are mediated by RAS, such as apoptosis, cellular proliferation, intracellular signaling, mobilization, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. The aim of this paper is to review recent developments regarding the actions of local BM RAS in the genesis of leukemia and other malignancies molecules.",,"['Haznedaroglu, I C', 'Malkan, U Y']","['Haznedaroglu IC', 'Malkan UY']","['Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. ichaznedaroglu@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Mas1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 3.4.23.15 (Renin)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Renin', '*Renin-Angiotensin System']",,,2016/10/25 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/10/25 06:00'],"['2016/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2016 Oct;20(19):4089-4111.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smoking-attributable cancer mortality estimates are currently available nationally and by cancer, but not by state. Objective: To calculate the proportion of cancer deaths among adults 35 years and older that were attributable to cigarette smoking in 2014 in each state and the District of Columbia. Design, Setting, and Participants: The population-attributable fraction (PAF) of cancer deaths due to cigarette smoking was computed using relative risks for 12 smoking-related cancers (acute myeloid leukemia and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx; esophagus; stomach; colorectum; liver; pancreas; larynx; trachea, lung, and bronchus; cervix uteri; kidney and renal pelvis; and urinary bladder) from large US prospective studies and state-specific smoking prevalence data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Main Outcomes and Measures: The PAF of cancer deaths due to cigarette smoking in each US state and the District of Columbia. Results: We estimate that at least 167133 cancer deaths in the United States in 2014 (28.6% of all cancer deaths; 95% CI, 28.2%-28.8%) were attributable to cigarette smoking. Among men, the proportion of cancer deaths attributable to smoking ranged from a low of 21.8% in Utah (95% CI, 19.9%-23.5%) to a high of 39.5% in Arkansas (95% CI, 36.9%-41.7%), but was at least 30% in every state except Utah. Among women, the proportion ranged from 11.1% in Utah (95% CI, 9.6%-12.3%) to 29.0% in Kentucky (95% CI, 27.2%-30.7%) and was at least 20% in all states except Utah, California, and Hawaii. Nine of the top 10 ranked states for men and 6 of the top 10 ranked states for women were located in the South. In men, smoking explained nearly 40% of cancer deaths in the top 5 ranked states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Kentucky). In women, smoking explained more than 26% of all cancer deaths in the top 5 ranked states, which included 3 Southern states (Kentucky, Arkansas, and Tennessee), and 2 Western states (Alaska and Nevada). Conclusions and Relevance: The proportion of cancer deaths attributable to cigarette smoking varies substantially across states and is highest in the South, where up to 40% of cancer deaths in men are caused by smoking. Increasing tobacco control funding, implementing innovative new strategies, and strengthening tobacco control policies and programs, federally and in all states and localities, might further increase smoking cessation, decrease initiation, and reduce the future burden of morbidity and mortality associated with smoking-related cancers.",,"['Lortet-Tieulent, Joannie', 'Goding Sauer, Ann', 'Siegel, Rebecca L', 'Miller, Kimberly D', 'Islami, Farhad', 'Fedewa, Stacey A', 'Jacobs, Eric J', 'Jemal, Ahmedin']","['Lortet-Tieulent J', 'Goding Sauer A', 'Siegel RL', 'Miller KD', 'Islami F', 'Fedewa SA', 'Jacobs EJ', 'Jemal A']","['Surveillance and Health Services Research, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Surveillance and Health Services Research, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Surveillance and Health Services Research, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Surveillance and Health Services Research, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Surveillance and Health Services Research, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Surveillance and Health Services Research, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Surveillance and Health Services Research, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA Intern Med,JAMA internal medicine,101589534,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*mortality', 'Racial Groups/statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Distribution', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,2016/10/25 06:00,2017/05/26 06:00,['2016/10/25 06:00'],"['2016/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['2571615 [pii]', '10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.6530 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Intern Med. 2016 Dec 1;176(12):1792-1798. doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.6530.,,,,,,,,,"['JAMA Intern Med. 2016 Dec 1;176(12):1799-1800.

Multivalency creates avidity, allowing stable biophysical recognition. Multivalency is an attractive strategy for achieving potent binding to protein targets, as the affinity of bivalent ligands is often greater than the sum of monovalent affinities. The bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family of transcriptional coactivators features tandem bromodomains through which BET proteins bind acetylated histones and transcription factors. All reported antagonists of the BET protein BRD4 bind in a monovalent fashion. Here we describe, to our knowledge for the first time, a bivalent BET bromodomain inhibitor-MT1-which has unprecedented potency. Biophysical and biochemical studies suggest MT1 is an intramolecular bivalent BRD4 binder that is more than 100-fold more potent, in cellular assays, than the corresponding monovalent antagonist, JQ1. MT1 significantly (P < 0.05) delayed leukemia progression in mice, as compared to JQ1.

Here we identified increased copy number and expression of the PIM1 proto-oncogene in genomic data sets of patients with TNBC. TNBC cells, but not nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells, were dependent on PIM1 for proliferation and protection from apoptosis. PIM1 knockdown reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and dynamic BH3 profiling of apoptotic priming revealed that PIM1 prevents mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in TNBC cell lines. In TNBC tumors and their cellular models, PIM1 expression was associated with several transcriptional signatures involving the transcription factor MYC, and PIM1 depletion in TNBC cell lines decreased, in a MYC-dependent manner, cell population growth and expression of the MYC target gene MCL1. Treatment with the pan-PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 impaired the growth of both cell line and patient-derived xenografts and sensitized them to standard-of-care chemotherapy.

FLT3 is mutated in ~30% of patients with AML, either by internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) of the juxta-membrane domain or by a point mutation, usually involving the tyrosine kinase domain. Several FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being evaluated in multiple studies aiming at improving outcomes. The most widely used is sorafenib, a potent multikinase inhibitor approved for hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Sorafenib monotherapy or in combination with conventional chemotherapy, has been evaluated in various settings in AML, including front-line, relapsed or refractory disease including post-allograft failures and, more recently, as post-transplant maintenance therapy. Encouraging data have emerged with several other agents like lestaurtinib, midostaurin, crenolanib, gilteritinib and quizartinib. Although transient responses to FLT3 inhibitors are often observed in case of disease relapse, the most promising approach is the use of FLT3 inhibitors either in combination with induction chemotherapy or as consolidation/maintenance therapy after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.

However, its clinical significance in cervical cancer has not been established. We explored NR2F6 expression and its clinicopathological significance in early-stage cervical cancer. METHODS: NR2F6 expression in cervical cancer cell lines and cervical cancer tissues was determined by Western blotting, real-time PCR, and immunochemistry (IHC). NR2F6 expression in 189 human early-stage cervical cancer tissue samples was evaluated using IHC. The relevance between NR2F6 expression and early-stage cervical cancer prognosis and clinicopathological features was determined. RESULTS: There was marked NR2F6 mRNA and protein overexpression in the cervical cancer cells and clinical tissues compared with an immortalized squamous cell line and adjacent noncancerous cervical tissues, respectively. In the 189 cervical cancer samples, NR2F6 expression was positively related to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (p = 0.006), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (p = 0.006), vital status (p < 0.001), tumor recurrence (p = 0.001), chemotherapy (p = 0.039), and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001). Overall and disease-free survival was shorter in patients with early-stage cervical cancer and higher NR2F6 levels than in patients with lower levels of NR2F6. Univariate and multivariate analysis determined that NR2F6 was an independent prognostic factor of survival in early-stage cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest that high NR2F6 expression predicts pelvic lymph node metastasis, tumor recurrence and poor prognosis in early-stage cervical cancer. NR2F6 might be a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target of cervical cancer.",,"['Niu, Chunhao', 'Sun, Xiaoying', 'Zhang, Weijing', 'Li, Han', 'Xu, Liqun', 'Li, Jun', 'Xu, Benke', 'Zhang, Yanna']","['Niu C', 'Sun X', 'Zhang W', 'Li H', 'Xu L', 'Li J', 'Xu B', 'Zhang Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 651, Dongfeng Road East, Guangzhou 510060, China. niuchh@sysucc.org.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 651, Dongfeng Road East, Guangzhou 510060, China. sunxiaoy@sysucc.org.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 651, Dongfeng Road East, Guangzhou 510060, China. zhangwj@sysucc.org.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 651, Dongfeng Road East, Guangzhou 510060, China. lihan@sysucc.org.cn.', 'Department of Gynecology, Women and Children Hospital of Guangdong Province, No. 13, Guang Yuan Road, Guangzhou 510060, China. xuliqunyang@126.com.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China. lijun37@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Anatomy, Medical School of Yangtzeu University, Jingzhou 434000, China. xubenkehb@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 651, Dongfeng Road East, Guangzhou 510060, China. zhangyn@sysucc.org.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161020,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NR2F6 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Receptors, Steroid/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NR2F6 (nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 6)', '*biomarker', '*cervical cancer', '*lymph node metastasis', '*prognosis']",2016/10/25 06:00,2017/04/08 06:00,['2016/10/25 06:00'],"['2016/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['ijms17101694 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms17101694 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2016 Oct 20;17(10). pii: ijms17101694. doi: 10.3390/ijms17101694.,,,PMC5085726,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have used a mouse model of de novo AML to elucidate the mechanisms by which AML evades NK cell surveillance. NK cells in leukemic mice displayed a marked reduction in the cytolytic granules perforin and granzyme B. Further, as AML progressed, we noted the selective loss of an immature subset of NK cells in leukemic mice and in AML patients. This absence was not due to elimination by cell death or selective reduction in proliferation, but rather to the result of a block in NK cell differentiation. Indeed, NK cells from leukemic mice and humans with AML showed lower levels of TBET and EOMES, transcription factors that are critical for terminal NK cell differentiation. Further, the microRNA miR-29b, a regulator of T-bet and EOMES, was elevated in leukemic NK cells. Finally, deletion of miR-29b in NK cells reversed the depletion of this NK cell subset in leukemic mice.

Leukemia cells can hide in bone marrow niche or vascular niche. Hence, many chemical drugs cannot kill these cells. To characterize migration and adhesion properties of leukemia cells in specific niches, CXCR4/SDF- 1alpha signal pathway has been widely used for investigation. AMD3100 is treated as one of the most common chemical drugs that can inhibit this signal. In the current study, we particularly investigate the effect of AMD3100 on the adhesion property of leukemia cells on stromal cells by using engineering tools, namely, optical tweezers (OT) and dielectrophoresis (DEP), to probe single cell property. AMD3100 not only inhibits the CXCR4/SDF- 1alpha signal pathway but also reduces gene expression of CXCR4 and VLA-4 on leukemia cells. The drug also softens leukemia cells. This work provides a new way to investigate cell behavior under drug treatment.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of the medical records of all pediatric patients with salivaly gland tumors treated in our center between 1998 and 2013. RESULTS: We identified 12 patients. The most common site of tumor location was the parotid gland in 11 patients followed by the sublingual gland in 1 patient. Three patients had previous cancer and radiotherapy history. The diagnosis (histological or radiological) were: 4 hemangiomas, 2 pleomorphic adenomas, 4 mucoepidermoid carcinomas, one acinar cell carcinoma and 1 primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). No patient had metastasis at diagnosis. Preoperative fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed in 6 patients with solid masses, being diagnostic in all cases. Eight patients underwent surgery. In two cases of total parotidectomy initial neuroapraxia appeared but none had permanent facial paralysis. There were no cases of Frey syndrome. The aesthetic results were good. There was only one tumor recurrence and all patients, except one who died of leukemia relapse, survive today. CONCLUSIONS: Salivaly gland tumors are uncommon in pediatric age but their high rate of malignancy makes it necessary to establish a rapid diagnosis. In our experience, FNA showed a high sensitivity. For malignant tumors, definitive treatment is surgical excision, preserving the facial nerve whenever possible. For vascular tumors, surgery is reserved for cases refractory to medical treatment.",,"['Gander, R', 'Guillen, G', 'Garcia Vaquero, J A', 'Molino, J A', 'Marhuenda, C', 'Lloret, J']","['Gander R', 'Guillen G', 'Garcia Vaquero JA', 'Molino JA', 'Marhuenda C', 'Lloret J']","[""Unidad de Cirugia Maxilofacial.

This study aimed to measure the burden of cancer using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) metric based on the newly adopted methodology from the Global Burden of Disease Study in 2010. This study was conducted based on data from the Korean National Cancer Registry. The DALYs were calculated using a prevalence-based method instead of the incidence-based method used by previous studies. The total burden of cancer in 2012 was 3,470.79 DALYs per 100,000 persons. Lung cancer was the most prevalent cancer burden, followed by liver, stomach, colorectal, and breast cancer. The DALYs for lung, liver, stomach, colon and rectum, and pancreatic cancer were high in men, whereas the DALYs for breast, lung, stomach, colorectal, and liver cancer were high in women. Health loss from leukemia and cancer of the brain and nervous system was prevalent for those younger than age 20; from stomach, breast, and liver for those aged 30-50; and from lung, colon and rectum, and pancreas for a large proportion of individuals over the age of 60. The most important differences were that the DALYs were calculated by prevalence and that other components of the DALYs were measured by a population-based perspective.

Kidney transplantation in paraprotein-related kidney disease can be successful in conjunction with treatment of the underlying hematopoietic process; however, when hematologic response to therapy is not achieved, recurrent kidney injury is frequently seen. We describe a young male patient who presented at the age of 23 years with end-stage kidney disease thought to be secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; this patient ultimately received two kidney allografts. He experienced recurrent proteinuria in both kidneys, with a biopsy from his second allograft showing kappa-restricted crystalline light chain podocytopathy, which was identified in both his native and first allograft kidneys upon retrospective review. Recurrent light chain podocytopathy has not been previously reported but poses a diagnostic challenge as it can mimic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, particularly in young patients in whom paraprotein-related kidney injury is usually not suspected.","['(c) 2016 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of', 'Transplant Surgeons.']","['Khalighi, M A', 'Revelo, M P', 'Abraham, J D', 'Shihab, F', 'Ahmed, F']","['Khalighi MA', 'Revelo MP', 'Abraham JD', 'Shihab F', 'Ahmed F']","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Nephrology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Nephrology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Nephrology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20161118,United States,Am J Transplant,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,100968638,,IM,,"['Adult', '*Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental/complications/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Graft Rejection/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Podocytes/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proteinuria/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*biopsy', '*cancer/malignancy/neoplasia: hematogenous/leukemia/lymphoma', '*clinical research/practice', '*kidney (allograft) function/dysfunction', '*kidney transplantation/nephrology', '*pathology/histopathology']",2016/10/25 06:00,2017/12/12 06:00,['2016/10/25 06:00'],"['2016/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajt.14088 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Transplant. 2017 Mar;17(3):824-829. doi: 10.1111/ajt.14088.

We constructed two mathematical models of the soybean metabolic network, a control model and a flooded model, from metabolic profiles in soybean plants. We simulated the metabolic profiles with perturbations before and after the flooding stimulus using the two models. We measured the variation of state that the system could maintain from a state-space description of the simulated profiles. The results showed a loss of variation of state during the flooding response in the soybean plants. Loss of variation of state was also observed in a human myelomonocytic leukaemia cell transcriptional network in response to a phorbol-ester stimulus. Thus, we detected a loss of variation of state under external stimuli in two biological systems, regardless of the regulation and stimulus types. Our results suggest that a loss of robustness may occur concurrently with the loss of variation of state in biological systems.

Survival is much shorter in PMF than in polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET). Post-PV/ET myelofibrosis (MF) is clinically indistinguishable from PMF and approached similarly. Areas covered: Current pharmacologic therapy of MF revolves around the Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) inhibitor ruxolitinib, which dramatically improves constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly in the majority of patients, and improves overall survival (OS). However, allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potential cure. Other JAK inhibitors continue to be developed for MF, and momelotinib and pacritinib are in phase III clinical trials. Anemia is common in MF, and initially worsened by ruxolitinib. Momelotinib and pacritinib may prove advantageous in this regard. Current strategies for managing anemia of MF include danazol, immunomodulatory drugs and erythroid stimulating agents, either alone or in combination with ruxolitinib. Expert opinion: A number of other agents, representing diverse drug classes, are in various stages of development for MF. These include newer JAK inhibitors, other signaling inhibitors, epigenetic modifiers, anti-fibrotic agents, telomerase inhibitors, and activin receptor ligand traps (for anemia). Hopefully, these novel therapies will further extend the clinical benefits of ruxolitinib.",,"['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']","['a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161107,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['Imids', 'JAK inhibitors', 'Myelofibrosis', 'danazol', 'erythroid stimulating agents', 'hydroxyurea', 'hypomethylating agents', 'momelotinib', 'pacritinib', 'ruxolitinib']",2016/10/25 06:00,2017/02/14 06:00,['2016/11/08 06:00'],"['2016/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14656566.2016.1252333 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2016 Dec;17(18):2375-2389. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2016.1252333.

Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) showed an expression pattern, and the levels did not differ between the groups examined.

The concept was introduced in 1978 to model bone marrow sites suited to host hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and favor their self-renewal, while restraining clonal expansion and commitment to differentiation. Studies of the effects of low oxygen tension on HSC maintenance in vitro led us to hypothesize niches were located within bone marrow areas where oxygen tension is lower than elsewhere. We named these areas hypoxic stem cell niches, although a low oxygen tension is to be considered physiological for the environment where HSCs are maintained. HSCs were later shown to have the option of cycling in low oxygen, which steers this cycling to the maintenance of stem cell potential. Cell subsets capable of withstanding incubation in very low oxygen were also detected within leukemia cell populations, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The oncogenetic Bcr/Abl protein is completely suppressed in these subsets, whereas Bcr/Abl messenger ribonucleic acid is not, indicating that CML cells resistant to low oxygen are independent of Bcr/Abl for persistence in culture but remain genetically leukemic. Accordingly, leukemia stem cells of CML selected in low oxygen are refractory to the Bcr/Abl inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Bcr/Abl protein suppression turned out to be actually determined when glucose shortage complicated the effects of low oxygen, indicating that ischemia-like conditions are the driving force of leukemia stem cell refractoriness to imatinib mesylate. These studies pointed to ""ischemic"" stem cell niches as a novel scenario for the maintenance of minimal residual disease of CML.

Here we report multifunctional DNA nanoflowers (NFs) for targeted drug delivery to both chemosensitive and MDR cancer cells and circumvent MDR in both leukemia and breast cancer cell models. NFs are self-assembled via liquid crystallization of DNA generated by Rolling Circle Replication, during which NFs are incorporated with aptamers for specific cancer cell recognition, fluorophores for bioimaging, and Doxorubicin (Dox)-binding DNA for drug delivery. NF sizes are tunable (down to ~200 nm in diameter), and the densely packed drug-binding motifs and porous intrastructures endow NFs with high drug loading capacity (71.4%, wt/wt). The Dox-loaded NFs (NF-Dox) are stable at physiological pH, yet drug release is facilitated in acidic or basic conditions. NFs deliver Dox into target chemosensitive and MDR cancer cells, preventing drug efflux and enhancing drug retention in MDR cells. Consequently, NF-Dox induces potent cytotoxicity in both target chemosensitive cells and MDR cells, but not nontarget cells, thus concurrently circumventing MDR and reducing side effects.

This applies to fludarabine-based regimens, and is also an increasing concern in the era of more targeted therapies. As cells with low-replicative activity rely on repair that triggers checkpoint-independent noncanonical pathways, we reasoned that targeting the nucleotide excision repair (NER) reaction addresses a vulnerability of CLL and might even synergize with fludarabine, which blocks the NER gap-filling step. We interrogated here especially the replication-independent transcription-coupled-NER ((TC)-NER) in prospective trial patients, primary CLL cultures, cell lines and mice. We screen selected (TC)-NER-targeting compounds as experimental (illudins) or clinically approved (trabectedin) drugs. They inflict transcription-stalling DNA lesions requiring TC-NER either for their removal (illudins) or for generation of lethal strand breaks (trabectedin). Genetically defined systems of NER deficiency confirmed their specificity. They selectively and efficiently induced cell death in CLL, irrespective of high-risk cytogenetics, IGHV status or clinical treatment history, including resistance. The substances induced ATM/p53-independent apoptosis and showed marked synergisms with fludarabine. Trabectedin additionally perturbed stromal-cell protection and showed encouraging antileukemic profiles even in aggressive and transforming murine CLL. This proof-of-principle study established (TC)-NER as a mechanism to be further exploited to resensitize CLL cells.",,"['Lohmann, G', 'Vasyutina, E', 'Bloehdorn, J', 'Reinart, N', 'Schneider, J I',

Further, perturbation of the axis regulates the proliferation of MM cells in vivo in a xenograft tumor model. RNA-sequencing and gene set enrichment analyses of CRISPR-engineered cells further suggest that the LIN28/let-7 axis regulates MYC and cell cycle pathways in MM.

The objective of this study was to determine the rates of RBC-transfusion independence after therapy with pomalidomide vs placebo in persons with MPN-associated myelofibrosis and RBC-transfusion dependence. Two hundred and fifty-two subjects (intent-to-treat (ITT) population) including 229 subjects confirmed by central review (modified ITT population) were randomly assigned (2:1) to pomalidomide or placebo. Trialists and subjects were blinded to treatment allocation. Primary end point was proportion of subjects achieving RBC-transfusion independence within 6 months. One hundred and fifty-two subjects received pomalidomide and 77 placebo. Response rates were 16% (95% confidence interval (CI), 11, 23%) vs 16% (8, 26%; P=0.87). Response in the pomalidomide cohort was associated with 4 U RBC/28 days (odds ratio (OR)=3.1; 0.9, 11.1), age 65 (OR=2.3; 0.9, 5.5) and type of MPN-associated myelofibrosis (OR=2.6; 0.7, 9.5).

Among them, the internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation predicts poor prognosis. MZH29 is a novel FLT3 inhibitor synthesized in our laboratory that showed that cellular and kinase assays sustained inhibitory effects on wild-type and mutant FLT3, including the FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835H/Y/V and FLT3-K663Q mutants. More importantly, MZH29 retained its potent inhibitory effect against the FLT3-ITD/F691L mutation, a drug resistance mutation against the well-known FLT3 inhibitor, AC220. MZH29 is a type II FLT3 inhibitor that tolerated the F691L mutation in molecular docking studies. Oral administration of 10 mg/kg MZH29 caused complete tumor regression and extended survival in a mouse model of AML with less toxicity.

Genetic alterations and other mechanisms leading to constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB pathway contribute to cancer development, progression and therapy resistance by activation of downstream anti-apoptotic pathways, unfavorable microenvironment interactions, and gene dysregulation. Not surprisingly, given its importance to normal and cancer cell function, the NF-kappaB pathway has emerged as a target for therapy. In the review, we present the physiologic role of the NF-kappaB pathway and recent advances in better understanding of the pathologic roles of the NF-kappaB pathway in major types of lymphoid neoplasms. We also provide an update of clinical trials that use NF-kappaB pathway inhibitors.

However, as a bifunctional alkylating agent, during clinical use several side effects may occur. In addition, several in vivo and in vitro studies of busulfan have shown a range of genotoxic effects including DNA strand break and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Amifostine, an organic thiophosphate compound, has been shown to exert an important cyto-protective effect in many tissues. The aim of this study was to explore whether amifostine protects against busulfan-induced genotoxicity in HepG2 cell line. Our results showed that amifostine reduced the genotoxic effects of busulfan significantly in both type of experiment conditions, as measured via comet assay. Furthermore, amifostine decreased the intracellular ROS generation induced by busulfan and also increased the intracellular GSH levels in HepG2 cells. Altogether, our results suggest a protective action of amifostine against busulfan cytotoxicity and genotoxicity via various pathways.

BLV infects cattle worldwide and affects both health status and productivity. However, no studies have examined the distribution of BLV in Myanmar, and the genetic characteristics of Myanmar BLV strains are unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect BLV infection in Myanmar and examine genetic variability. Blood samples were obtained from 66 cattle from different farms in four townships of the Nay Pyi Taw Union Territory of central Myanmar. BLV provirus was detected by nested PCR and real-time PCR targeting BLV long terminal repeats. Results were confirmed by nested PCR targeting the BLV env-gp51 gene and real-time PCR targeting the BLV tax gene. Out of 66 samples, six (9.1 %) were positive for BLV provirus. A phylogenetic tree, constructed using five distinct partial and complete env-gp51 sequences from BLV strains isolated from three different townships, indicated that Myanmar strains were genotype-10. A phylogenetic tree constructed from whole genome sequences obtained by sequencing cloned, overlapping PCR products from two Myanmar strains confirmed the existence of genotype-10 in Myanmar. Comparative analysis of complete genome sequences identified genotype-10-specific amino acid substitutions in both structural and non-structural genes, thereby distinguishing genotype-10 strains from other known genotypes.

A total of 226 acute leukemia patients who received unrelated CBT were enrolled in this study, and all these patients received an intensified myeloablative conditioning without ATG. Pre-engraftment BSIs occurred in 72 patients (31.9 %), and the median time of onset was 4.5 days after cord blood infusion, BSIs of gram-negative bacilli, and gram-positive cocci comprised of 63.8 and 36.2 %, respectively. The cumulative incidences of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) were comparable among the non-BSI, gram-negative bacilli BSI, and gram-positive cocci BSI groups. The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM), relapse, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) was similar between the non-BSI and the BSI groups. For subgroups analysis, TRM was lower in gram-positive cocci BSI patients compared with that of gram-negative bacilli BSI patients (8.3 vs 39.3 %) (p = 0.01) (HR = 0.39, p = 0.034), and the 5-year OS was higher in gram-positive cocci BSI cohort (79.1 vs 44.2 %) (p = 0.01) (HR = 0.36, p = 0.046). Our study demonstrated that, for acute leukemia patients who received CBT after myeloablative conditioning that omitted ATG, pre-engraftment BSI had no impact on engraftment, GVHD, TRM, relapse, and long-term survival. Due to the fact that gram-negative bacilli BSI was associated with poor outcomes compared with gram-positive cocci BSI, appropriate early empirical antimicrobial management strategies and better supportive care are required to decrease the gram-negative bacilli BSI-related mortality.",,"['Zheng, Changcheng', 'Tang, Baolin', 'Zhu, Xiaoyu', 'Zhang, Xuhan', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Geng, Liangquan', 'Liu, Huilan', 'Sun, Zimin']","['Zheng C', 'Tang B', 'Zhu X', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang L', 'Geng L', 'Liu H', 'Sun Z']","['Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Lujiang Road No 19, Hefei, 230001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Lujiang Road No 19, Hefei, 230001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Lujiang Road No 19, Hefei, 230001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Lujiang Road No 19, Hefei, 230001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Lujiang Road No 19, Hefei, 230001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Lujiang Road No 19, Hefei, 230001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Lujiang Road No 19, Hefei, 230001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Lujiang Road No 19, Hefei, 230001, China. zmsun_vip@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161022,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antilymphocyte Serum', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sepsis/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods/mortality', '*Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Bloodstream infection', 'Cord blood transplantation', 'Myeloablative conditioning']",2016/10/25 06:00,2017/02/02 06:00,['2016/10/25 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2828-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2828-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Jan;96(1):115-124. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2828-2.

However, there is general agreement that improvements in communicating and documenting research and risk assessment methods are needed. In the case of formaldehyde, the peer-review conducted by a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee questioned the approaches used by the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) in developing draft unit risk values. Using the original data from the key study (Beane Freeman et al., 2009) and documentation provided in the draft IRIS profile, we attempted to duplicate the reported inhalation unit risk values and address the NAS Committee's questions regarding application of the appropriate dose-response model. Overall, documentation of the methods lacked sufficient detail to allow for replication of the unit risk estimates, specifically for Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemias, the key systemic endpoints selected by IRIS.

Although epigenetic therapies have improved the outcomes of MDS patients, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation remains the only curative option. Molecular characterization of MDS using next-generation sequencing has expanded not only the knowledge on MDS but also the depth of understanding of evolution and contribution of recurrent somatic mutations in precursor conditions. Rapidly evolving genomic information on MDS may provide clinicians with better risk stratification tools and may also aid in supplying useful information to allow comprehensive therapeutic decision making for MDS patients. In this concise review, we summarize the current knowledge and understanding of recurrent somatic mutations in MDS and discuss salient genomic information predicting response and influencing therapeutic outcomes in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, as well as the potential application of these findings into future clinical practice.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study analyzed Sokal score, ABCB1, ABCG2 and OCT1 mRNA transporter expression levels as well as P-glycoprotein expression and efflux transporters activity to seek a possible correlation between these factors and the molecular response at 12 months from imatinib start as well as 8-year overall survival (OS). Low plus intermediate Sokal score correlated to optimal imatinib responses, as well as OS at 8-years, thus confirming the established role of Sokal score as a prognostic factor in CML patients. Low ABCB1 and high OCT1 mRNA levels were associated with an optimal molecular response, while the inverse levels were associated with non-responders (warning and failure) patients.

These studies included patients selected according to many inclusion-exclusion criteria, particularly age and comorbidities, with specific treatment obligations. In daily clinical practice (real-life), inclusion-exclusion criteria do not exist, and the treatment outcome does not only depend on the choice of first-line TKI but also on second- and third-line TKIs. To investigate in a real-life setting the response and the outcome on first-line imatinib, with switch to second generation TKIs in case of unsatisfying response or intolerance, we analyzed all newly diagnosed patients (N = 236), living in two Italian regions, registered in a prospective study according to population-based criteria and treated front-line with imatinib. A switch from imatinib to second-generation TKIs was reported in 14% of patients for side effects and in 24% for failure or suboptimal response, with an improvement of molecular response in 57% of them. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-related survival (LRS) were 85% and 93%, respectively; the 4-year rates of MR(3.0) and MR(4.0) were 75% and 48%, respectively. Cardiovascular complications were reported in 4% of patients treated with imatinib alone and in 6% of patients receiving nilotinib as second-line. Older age (>/=70 years) affected OS, but not LRS. These data provide an unbiased reference on the CML management and on the results of TKI treatment in real-life, according to ELN recommendations, using imatinib as first-line treatment and second-generation TKIs as second-line therapy.

Recent studies have shown that miR-9-1 is downregulated in t (8; 21) AML. However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying miR-9-1 downregulation and the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion protein, generated from the translocation of t (8; 21) in AML, remain unclear. RUNX1-RUNX1T1 can induce leukemogenesis through resides in and functions as a stable RUNX1-RUNX1T1-containing transcription factor complex. In this study, we demonstrate that miR-9-1 expression increases significantly after the treatment of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (+) AML cell lines with decitabine (a DNMT inhibitor) and trichostatin A (an HDAC inhibitor). In addition, we show that RUNX1-RUNX1T1 triggers the heterochromatic silencing of miR-9-1 by binding to RUNX1-binding sites in the promoter region of miR-9-1 and recruiting chromatin-remodeling enzymes, DNMTs, and HDACs, contributing to hypermethylation of miR-9-1 in t (8; 21) AML. Furthermore, because RUNX1, RUNX1T1, and RUNX1-RUNX1T1 are all regulated by miR-9-1, the silencing of miR-9-1 enhances the oncogenic activity of these genes. Besides, overexpression of miR-9-1 induces differentiation and inhibits proliferation in t (8; 21) AML cell lines. In conclusion, our results indicate a feedback circuitry involving miR-9-1 and RUNX1-RUNX1T1, contributing to leukemogenesis in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (+) AML cell lines.",['(c) 2016 UICC.'],"['Fu, Lin', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Liu, Anqi', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Jiang, Mengmeng', 'Fu, Huaping', 'Xu, Keman', 'Li, Dandan', 'Deng, Ailing', 'Zhang, Qingyi', 'Pang, Yifan', 'Guo, Yujie', 'Hu, Kai', 'Zhou, Jiansuo', 'Wang, Yapeng', 'Huang, Wenrong', 'Jing, Yu', 'Dou, Liping', 'Wang, Lili', 'Xu, Kailin', 'Ke, Xiaoyan', 'Nervi, Clara', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Yu, Li']","['Fu L', 'Shi J', 'Liu A', 'Zhou L', 'Jiang M', 'Fu H', 'Xu K', 'Li D', 'Deng A', 'Zhang Q', 'Pang Y', 'Guo Y', 'Hu K', 'Zhou J', 'Wang Y', 'Huang W', 'Jing Y', 'Dou L', 'Wang L', 'Xu K', 'Ke X', 'Nervi C', 'Li Y', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221002, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of nuclear medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'College of medical laboratory science and technology, Harbin Medical University, Daqing, 163319, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Medicine, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, 48073.', 'College of Science, North China University of Technology, Beijing, 100144, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of clinical laboratory, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of reproduction center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221002, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, University of Rome ""La Sapienza"" Polo Pontino, Latina, 04100, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161110,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['*21)', '*RUNX1-RUNX1T1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*miR-9-1', '*t (8']",2016/10/23 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2016/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.30481 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2017 Feb 1;140(3):653-661. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30481.

Several survivin splice variants have been described, and none of their expressions have been defined in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). METHODS: Expression of the survivin gene isoforms (survivin, -2alpha, -2B, -DeltaEpsilonx3 and -3B) were analyzed in 50 peripheral blood and 19 bone marrow samples that were collected at different phases of the disease (diagnostic, remission and relapse) in APL patients treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO) as a front-line therapy. In addition, the human APL-derived cell line (NB4) was analyzed for the expression of survivin isoforms and capsase-3 in response to the ATO. RESULTS: Survivin and its variants were overexpressed significantly in patient's bone marrow samples compared to peripheral blood or normal samples. Their expression was decreased after ATO treatment in both NB4 cells (except survivin-2alpha) and APL patients along with PML-RARalpha copy number reduction. Downregulation of survivin isoforms was associated with an increase in both caspase-3 gene expression and its enzymatic activity levels. In a patient who did not respond to ATO treatment, expression of survivin isoforms (except survivin-2alpha) were highly increased during the induction therapy. CONCLUSION: Survivin isoforms are upregulated in APL patients, and their expression is diminished during the ATO treatment. In addition, overexpression of survivin and its variants (except survivin-2alpha) are associated with unfavorable results, suggesting that they may play an important role in mechanisms underlying the resistance of APL cells to ATO.","['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Zaki Dizaji, Majid', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H', 'Hosseini, Elham', 'Alizadeh, Nasrin', 'Rostami, Shahrbano', 'Momeny, Majid', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Zaki Dizaji M', 'Ghaffari SH', 'Hosseini E', 'Alizadeh N', 'Rostami S', 'Momeny M', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161022,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Survivin']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'arsenic trioxide', 'survivin', 'survivin isoforms', 'survivin-2alpha']",2016/10/23 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2016/10/23 06:00'],"['2015/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.12589 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2017 Apr;13(2):e21-e30. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12589.

While gene testing of TPMT is being clinically implemented, it is unclear if additional genetic variation influences TPMT activity with consequences for thiopurine-related toxicity. To examine this possibility, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of red blood cell TPMT activity in 844 Estonian individuals and 245 pediatric ALL cases. Additionally, we correlated genome-wide genotypes to human hepatic TPMT activity in 123 samples. Only genetic variants mapping to chromosome 6, including the TPMT gene region, were significantly associated with TPMT activity (P < 5.0 x 10(-8) ) in each of the three GWAS and a joint meta-analysis of 1,212 cases (top hit P = 1.2 x 10(-72) ).

METHODS: The ""Resilience in Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer"" study was a prospective, multicenter, mixed-methods cohort study. English-speaking patients 14-25 years old with newly diagnosed cancer were invited to complete a comprehensive survey at the time of enrollment (T1) and 3-6 months later (T2). Intimate relationships and health behaviors were assessed with questions adapted from the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventative Services assessment. Descriptive statistics characterized the prevalence of sexual and substance-related behaviors at each time point. RESULTS: Of 42 eligible and enrolled participants, 35 (83%) and 25 (59%) completed T1 and T2 surveys, respectively. Their mean age was 17.6 years (standard deviation 2.3), 57% were male, and the most common diagnoses were sarcoma and acute leukemia. Over a third of participants reported dating at each time point; 26% were sexually active at T1, and 32% at T2. Of those endorsing sexual activity, fewer than half reported consistent birth control or condom use and 4 reported their first sexual intercourse during our observation. In addition, 46% (T1) and 44% (T2) reported alcohol use and 23% (T1) and 26% (T2) reported illicit drug use. Despite these activities, fewer than 10% endorsed a worry or need to discuss these behaviors with oncology providers. CONCLUSIONS: Intimacy and substance use among adolescents and young adults are common during cancer therapy. Clinical and research implications include the identification of optimal communication and patient-centered supports.","['Copyright A(c) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

METHODS: In the current study, we retrospectively evaluated the bone marrow iron scores (BMIS) in patients who underwent alloHSCT (n = 125). The first available bone marrow biopsy specimens prior to the alloHSCT procedure or date of hospitalization (control group) were assessed in a blinded fashion using a standardized scoring system. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were enrolled in the study. Seventy-six (60.8%) of the patients were male, and 49 (39.2%) were female. The median level of pre-transplant serum ferritin was 1023.00 ng/mL (range, 393.80-1627.50 ng/mL). The majority of the patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia (83; 66.4%) and lymphomas (20; 16.0%). The median time for neutrophil engraftment was 14.00 days (range, 13.00-16.00 days) and 11.00 days (range, 10.00-14.00 days) for platelet engraftment. The peri-transplant mortality was similar to international mortality rates (3; 2.4%). The overall survival and disease-free survival were strongly correlated with the degree of BMIS, and both were significantly poorer in patients with high bone marrow iron content (P < .001 and P = .012, respectively). CONCLUSION: The validation of BMIS for risk stratification in patients who undergo alloHSCT may predict posttransplant outcomes.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Consistent with this activity, Icsbp represses a set of genes encoding proteins that promote cell proliferation/survival. One such gene encodes Gas2, a calpain inhibitor. We previously found that increased Gas2-expression in Bcr-abl+ cells stabilized betacatenin; a Calpain substrate. This was of interest, because betacatenin contributes to disease progression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Calpain has additional substrates implicated in leukemogenesis, including Stat5. In the current study, we hypothesized that Stat5 activity in CML is regulated by Gas2/Calpain. We found that Bcr-abl-induced, Shp2-dependent dephosphorylation of Icsbp impaired repression of GAS2 by this transcription factor. The consequent decrease in Calpain activity stabilized Stat5 protein; increasing the absolute abundance of both phospho and total Stat5. This enhanced repression of the IRF8 promoter by Stat5 in a manner dependent on Icsbp, Gas2 and Calpain, but not Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation. During normal myelopoiesis, increased expression and phosphorylation of Icsbp inhibits Calpain. In contrast, constitutive activation of Shp2 in Bcr-abl+ cells impairs regulation of Gas2/Calpain by Icsbp, aberrantly stabilizing Stat5 and enhancing IRF8 repression. This novel feedback mechanism enhances leukemogenesis by increasing Stat5 and decreasing Icsbp. Bcr-abl targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) provide long term disease control, but CML is not cured by these agents. Our studies suggest targeting Calpain might be a rational therapeutic approach to decrease persistent leukemia stem cells (LSCs) during TKI-treatment.",,"['Hjort, Elizabeth E', 'Huang, Weiqi', 'Hu, Liping', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Hjort EE', 'Huang W', 'Hu L', 'Eklund EA']","['The Feinberg School at Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'The Feinberg School at Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'The Feinberg School at Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'The Feinberg School at Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (GAS2 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Calpain/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/chemistry/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['calpain', 'leukemia', 'myeloid', 'phosphatase', 'transcription factor']",2016/10/22 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2016/10/22 06:00'],"['2016/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['12749 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12749 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Nov 22;7(47):77635-77650. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12749.,,"['R01 DK098812/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 BX002067/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 CA174205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 CX001864/CX/CSRD VA/United States', 'P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5363610,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their unique biochemical properties could potentially contribute to differences in the substrate preferences or biological functions of these enzymes. Dnmt3a-C forms tetramers through interactions at the dimer interface, which also promote multimerization on DNA and cooperativity. Similar to the case for processive enzymes, cooperativity allows Dnmt3a-C to methylate multiple sites on the same DNA molecule; however, it is unclear whether Dnmt3b-C methylates DNA by a cooperative or processive mechanism. The importance of the tetramer structure and cooperative mechanism is emphasized by the observation that the R882H mutation in the dimer interface of DNMT3A is highly prevalent in acute myeloid leukemia and leads to a substantial loss of its activity. Under conditions that distinguish between cooperativity and processivity, we show that in contrast to that of Dnmt3a-C, the activity of Dnmt3b-C is not cooperative and confirm the processivity of Dnmt3b-C and the full length Dnmt3b enzyme. Whereas the R878H mutation (mouse homologue of R882H) led to the loss of cooperativity of Dnmt3a-C, the activity and processivity of the analogous Dnmt3b-C R829H variant were comparable to those of the wild-type enzyme. Additionally, buffer acidification that attenuates the dimer interface interactions of Dnmt3a-C had no effect on Dnmt3b-C activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate an important mechanistic difference between Dnmt3b and Dnmt3a and suggest that interactions at the dimer interface may play a limited role in regulating Dnmt3b-C activity. These new insights have potential implications for the distinct biological roles of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b.",,"['Norvil, Allison B', 'Petell, Christopher J', 'Alabdi, Lama', 'Wu, Lanchen', 'Rossie, Sandra', 'Gowher, Humaira']","['Norvil AB', 'Petell CJ', 'Alabdi L', 'Wu L', 'Rossie S', 'Gowher H']","['Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University Center for Cancer Research , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University Center for Cancer Research , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University Center for Cancer Research , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University Center for Cancer Research , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University Center for Cancer Research , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University Center for Cancer Research , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana 47907 , United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161104,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Catalytic Domain', 'DNA/chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Multimerization']",,,2016/10/22 06:00,2019/04/09 06:00,['2016/10/22 06:00'],"['2016/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00964 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2018 Jul 24;57(29):4312-4324. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00964.

The first part of this procedure is focused on determining the hematopoietic lineage and the stage of differentiation of cultured C1498 cells. To achieve this, multi-parametric flow cytometric staining is used to detect hematopoietic cell markers. Immunofluorescence microscopy, cytochemistry and a May-Grunwald Giemsa staining are then performed to assess the expression of myeloperoxidase, the activity of esterases and cellular morphology, respectively. The second part of this protocol is dedicated to describing the leukemia disease that is induced in vivo. The latter can be achieved by determining the frequencies of leukemic and inherent cells in the blood, hematopoietic organs (e.g., bone marrow and spleen) and non-lymphoid tissues (e.g., the liver and lungs) using specific staining and flow cytometry analyses. The nature of the leukemia is then confirmed using May-Grunwald Giemsa staining and staining for specific esterases in the bone marrow.

METHODS: We introduce CC-PROMISE as an integrated data analysis method that combines components of canonical correlation (CC) and projection onto the most interesting evidence (PROMISE). For each gene, CC-PROMISE first uses CC to compute scores that represent the association of two forms of molecular data with each other. Next, these scores are substituted into PROMISE to evaluate the statistical evidence that the molecular data show a biologically meaningful relationship with the endpoints. RESULTS: CC-PROMISE shows outstanding performance in simulation studies and an example application involving pediatric leukemia. In simulation studies, CC-PROMISE controls the type I error (misleading significance) rate very near the nominal level across 100 distinct null settings in which no molecular-endpoint association exists. Also, CC-PROMISE has better statistical power than three other methods that control type I error in 396 of 400 (99 %) alternative settings for which a molecular-endpoint association is present; the power advantage of CC-PROMISE exceeds 30 % in 127 of the 400 (32 %) alternative settings. These advantages of CC-PROMISE are also observed in an example application. CONCLUSION: CC-PROMISE very effectively identifies genes for which some form of molecular data shows a biologically meaningful association with multiple related endpoints.

Several genetic aberrations that disrupt the function of AML1 have been frequently observed in human leukemia. AML1 contains a DNA-binding domain known as the Runt domain (RD), which recognizes the RD-binding double-stranded DNA element of target genes. In this study, we identified high-affinity RNA aptamers that bind to RD by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. The binding assay using surface plasmon resonance indicated that a shortened aptamer retained the ability to bind to RD when 1 M potassium acetate was used. A thermodynamic study using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) showed that the aptamer-RD interaction is driven by a large enthalpy change, and its unfavorable entropy change is compensated by a favorable enthalpy change. Furthermore, the binding heat capacity change was identified from the ITC data at various temperatures. The aptamer binding showed a large negative heat capacity change, which suggests that a large apolar surface is buried upon such binding. Thus, we proposed that the aptamer binds to RD with long-range electrostatic force in the early stage of the association and then changes its conformation and recognizes a large surface area of RD. These findings about the biophysics of aptamer binding should be useful for understanding the mechanism of RNA-protein interaction and optimizing and modifying RNA aptamers.",,"['Amano, Ryo', 'Takada, Kenta', 'Tanaka, Yoichiro', 'Nakamura, Yoshikazu', 'Kawai, Gota', 'Kozu, Tomoko', 'Sakamoto, Taiichi']","['Amano R', 'Takada K', 'Tanaka Y', 'Nakamura Y', 'Kawai G', 'Kozu T', 'Sakamoto T']","['Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Engineering, Chiba Institute of Technology , 2-17-1 Tsudanuma, Narashino, Chiba 275-0016, Japan.', 'Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Engineering, Chiba Institute of Technology , 2-17-1 Tsudanuma, Narashino, Chiba 275-0016, Japan.', 'Facility for RI Research and Education, Instrumental Analysis Center, Yokohama National University , 79-5 Tokiwadai, Hodogaya-ku, Yokohama 240-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo , Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Ribomic Inc. , 3-16-13 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-0071, Japan.', 'Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Engineering, Chiba Institute of Technology , 2-17-1 Tsudanuma, Narashino, Chiba 275-0016, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Clinical Oncology , Saitama Cancer Center, Ina, Saitama 362-0806, Japan.', 'Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Engineering, Chiba Institute of Technology , 2-17-1 Tsudanuma, Narashino, Chiba 275-0016, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161101,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Calorimetry/methods', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Domains', 'Static Electricity', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', '*Thermodynamics']",,,2016/11/02 06:00,2017/05/23 06:00,['2016/11/02 06:00'],"['2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00748 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2016 Nov 15;55(45):6221-6229. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00748.

The therapy is very intensive and associated with many acute and long-term side effects. The early death rate has been reduced to 1-4%. The acute toxicity is a limiting factor for improving survival in low-income countries. Transplant is associated with more endocrinological late effects while cardiotoxicity is more common after relapse. Reducing the physical costs of therapy without jeopardizing survival may be accomplished by optimal supportive care, less cardiotoxic anthracyclines, less consolidation courses and strict indications for stem cell transplantation. Analysing scenarios with different frequency of transplantation in first complete remission show similar overall survival rates, indicating that almost all patients can be spared the procedure in first remission. Reducing relapse risk is an effective way of reducing toxicity and more targeted therapy and improved risk group stratifications are needed.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Hasle, Henrik', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L']","['Hasle H', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Academy of Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161021,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Cardiotoxicity/etiology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*childhood leukaemia', '*late effects']",2016/10/22 06:00,2017/05/23 06:00,['2016/10/22 06:00'],"['2016/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14419 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Jan;176(2):168-178. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14419.

The majority of non-melanoma skin cancers are easily treated with surgery or locally destructive techniques performed under local anesthesia in the cost-effective outpatient setting. However, there is a subset of ""high-risk"" cases that prove challenging in terms of morbidity, mortality, adjuvant treatment required, as well as overall cost to the health care system. In our opinion, the term ""high risk"" when applied to skin cancer can mean one of three things: a high-risk tumor with aggressive histologic and/or clinical features with an elevated risk for local recurrence or regional/distant metastasis, a high-risk patient with the ongoing development of multiple skin cancers, and a high-risk patient based on immunosuppression. We have recently proposed classifying NMSC as a chronic disease in a certain subset of patients. Although no consensus definition exists for a chronic disease in medicine, there are three components that are present in most definitions: duration of at least 1 year, need for ongoing medical care, and functional impairment and/or alteration of activities of daily living (ADLs) and quality of life (QOL). Immunosuppression can refer to exogenous (organ or stem cell transplant patients,) or endogenous (HIV, leukemia, lymphoma, genodermatoses with DNA mismatch repair problems or other immunosuppression) causes.

Aberrancy in its regulation results in hyperactivity of the pathway contributing to leukemia propagation and maintenance. To investigate effects of Wnt pathway inhibition in leukemia, we used human leukemia cell lines (i.e., K562, HL60, THP1, and Jurkat) and several Wnt inhibitors, including XAV939, IWP2 and FH535. Our results showed that leukemia cell lines (>95 % cells) had increased endogenous levels of beta-catenin as compared to mononuclear cells from healthy donors (0 %). Among the tested inhibitors, FH535 demonstrated a markedly suppressive effect (IC50 = 358 nM) on mRNA levels of beta-catenin target genes (LEF1, CCND1, and cMYC). In addition, FH535 significantly potentiated imatinib-induced apoptosis. Evaluation of erythrocyte and megakaryocyte lineage using flow cytometry demonstrated that the potentiation mechanism is independent of the developmental stage, and is more likely due to crosstalk between other pathways and beta-catenin. FH535 also displayed antiproliferative properties in other cell lines used in this study. In summary, FH535 showed significantly high antiproliferative effects at submicromolar dosages, and additionally enhanced imatinib-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cell lines. Our results highlight its potential antileukemic promise when used in conjunction with other conventional therapeutic regimens.",,"['Suknuntha, Kran', 'Thita, Thanyatip', 'Togarrati, Padma Priya', 'Ratanachamnong, Piyanee', 'Wongtrakoongate, Patompon', 'Srihirun, Sirada', 'Slukvin, Igor', 'Hongeng, Suradej']","['Suknuntha K', 'Thita T', 'Togarrati PP', 'Ratanachamnong P', 'Wongtrakoongate P', 'Srihirun S', 'Slukvin I', 'Hongeng S']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand. suknuntha@uwalumni.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand.', 'Cell Therapy Core, Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, 94118, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Dentistry, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, 53792, USA.', 'Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, 53715, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10400, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161020,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FH535)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*drug effects', 'beta Catenin/drug effects/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'CML', 'FH535', 'HL60', 'Imatinib', 'Jurkat', 'K562', 'Leukemia', 'Myeloid', 'Proliferation', 'THP1', 'Wnt inhibitor']",2016/10/22 06:00,2017/04/18 06:00,['2016/10/22 06:00'],"['2016/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-016-2116-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-016-2116-x [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Feb;105(2):196-205. doi: 10.1007/s12185-016-2116-x.

We reviewed data from 329 patients, diagnosed between 2000 and 2010, without extramedullary disease at onset to explore possible risk factors for EMR. The median overall survival of our study cohort was 6.4 years. The risk of EMR was 28 % with a median time from diagnosis to first EMR of 2.2 years (0.2-9.1 years). Patients with soft tissue masses located in extra-osseous organs (EMR-S) showed the worst outcome, compared to those with tumor masses arising from adjacent bone (EMR-B) (median OS 1.6 vs 2.4 years, p = 0.006). In addition, patients with EMR-S showed a significant trend for further development of extramedullary masses in a very short time (3.7 vs 5.7 months for EMR-B, p = 0.043). Multivariate analysis failed to identify any clinically presenting features predictive for EMR. The occurrence of EMR was higher in patients with more complex treatment history, defined on the basis of longer treatment duration (>/=6 vs <6 months) and on elevated number of treatment lines administered (>2 vs </=2 lines) (HR = 4.5, p < 0.001 and HR = 9.0, p < 0.001, respectively, when one or both factors are present).In conclusion, increasing burden of treatment might be a possible risk factor for EMR. MM patients with multiple relapses should be comprehensively investigated including, when possible, a whole-body-targeted radiologic technique to accurately detect EMR.

In BRAF(V600E)-mutant colorectal cancers, treatment failure may be related to BRAF(V600E)-mediated apoptosis resistance that occurs by an as yet undefined mechanism. We found that BRAF(V600E) can upregulate anti-apoptotic MCL-1 in a gene dose-dependent manner using colorectal cancer cell lines isogenic for BRAF BRAF(V600E)-induced MCL-1 upregulation was confirmed by ectopic BRAF(V600E) expression that activated MEK/ERK signaling to phosphorylate (MCL-1(Thr163)) and stabilize MCL-1. Upregulation of MCL-1 was mediated by MEK/ERK shown by the ability of ERK siRNA to suppress MCL-1. Stabilization of MCL-1 by phosphorylation was shown by a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant and an unphosphorylated MCL-1 mutant that decreased or increased MCL-1 protein turnover, respectively. MEK/ERK inhibition by cobimetinib suppressed MCL-1 expression/phosphorylation and induced proapoptotic BIM to a greater extent than did vemurafenib in BRAF(V600E) cell lines. MCL-1 knockdown versus control shRNA significantly enhanced cobimetinib-induced apoptosis in vitro and in HT29 colon cancer xenografts. The small-molecule MCL-1 inhibitor, A-1210477, also enhanced cobimetinib-induced apoptosis in vitro that was due to disruption of the interaction of MCL-1 with proapoptotic BAK and BIM. Knockdown of BIM attenuated BAX, but not BAK, activation by cobimetinib plus A-1210477. In summary, BRAF(V600E)-mediated MEK/ERK activation can upregulate MCL-1 by phosphorylation/stabilization to confer apoptosis resistance that can be reversed by MCL-1 antagonism combined with cobimetinib, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy against BRAF(V600E)-mutant CRCs.

BACKGROUND: Fever is the primary reason pediatric oncology patients present to the ED. The literature states that 0.9% to 39% of febrile nonneutropenic oncology patients are bacteremic, yet few studies have investigated infectious risk factors in this population. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study in a pediatric ED, reviewing medical records from 2002 to 2014. Inclusion criteria were patients with cancer, temperature at least 38 degrees C, presence of a CVC, absolute neutrophil count greater than 500 cells/muL, and age less than 22 years. Exclusion criteria were repeat ED visits within 72 hours, bloodwork results not reported by the laboratory, and patients without oncologic history documented at the study hospital. The primary outcome measure is a positive blood culture (+BC). Other variables include age, sex, CVC type, cancer diagnosis, absolute neutrophil count, vital signs, upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms, and amount of intravenous (IV) normal saline (NS) administered in the ED. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a multiple logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 1322 ED visits were sampled, with 534 enrolled, and 39 visits had +BC (7.3%). Variables associated with an increased risk of +BC included the following: absence of URI symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 2.30; 95% CI, 1.13-4.69), neuroblastoma (OR, 3.65; 95% CI, 1.47-9.09), ""other"" cancer diagnosis (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 1.93-10.76), tunneled externalized CVC (OR, 5.04; 95% CI, 2.25-11.28), and receiving at least 20 mL/kg IV NS (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.2-4.55). The results of a multiple logistic regression model also showed these variables to be associated with +BC. CONCLUSION: The absence of URI symptoms, presence of an externalized CVC, neuroblastoma or other cancer diagnosis, and receiving at least 20 mL/kg IV NS in the ED are associated with increased risk of bacteremia in nonneutropenic pediatric oncology patients with a CVC.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The disease is similar to Enzootic Bovine Leucosis (EBL) caused by Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) in cattle; however, according to our results and those of other studies, the etiology of these lymphomas in buffalo do not appear to be associated with BLV. The objectives of this study are to describe four cases of the disease in buffaloes belonging to the same herd in the Amazon region of Brazil and to perform a clinical-anatomopathological, immunohistochemical, and etiological study of the lymphomas. RESULTS: Over a period of ten years, four buffaloes were observed presenting progressive weight loss, swelling of peripheral lymph nodes, and nodules in the subcutaneous tissue. Upon necropsy, whitish-colored tumor masses were observed in the form of nodules in the subcutaneous tissue, along with miliary nodules on the serosal surfaces of abdominal and thoracic organs and tumors in lymph nodes and other organs. Neoplastic lymphocyte proliferation was observed through histopathology. An immunohistochemical study revealed that the neoplasias were formed by proliferation of predominantly B lymphocytes. The presence of BLV genome was not detected in the lymphomas when using the real-time PCR technique, nor was it detected through immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies against two viral proteins. Bovine herpesvirus 6 was not detected in the tumors. However, Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) was detected in samples of lymphoma and in the lymph nodes and kidneys of one of the animals. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of lymphoma in buffaloes is reported for the first time in Brazil and is characterized by B-cell multicentric lymphoma.

Popular methods for library preparation in RNA-seq such as Illumina TruSeq(R) RNA v2 kit use a poly-A pulldown strategy. Such methods can cause loss of coverage at the 5' end of genes, impacting the ability to detect fusions when used on degraded samples. The goal of this study was to quantify the effects RNA degradation has on fusion detection when using poly-A selected mRNA and to identify the variables involved in this process. RESULTS: Using both artificially and naturally degraded samples, we found that there is a reduced ability to detect fusions as the distance of the breakpoint from the 3' end of the gene increases.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) can remove acetyl group from histone and regulate gene expression via changing chromatin structure. Here, we found miR-451 is abnormally down-regulated in AML patient samples; c-Myc recruits HDAC3 to form a transcriptional suppressor complex, co-localizes on the miR-451 promoter, epigenetically inhibits its transcription and finally induces its downregulation in AML. Furthermore, our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that miR-451 functions as a tumor suppressor via promoting apoptosis and suppressing malignant cell proliferation. The mechanistic study demonstrated that miR-451 directly targets YWHAZ mRNA and suppresses YWHAZ/AKT signaling in AML. Knockdown of c-Myc results in restoration of miR-451 and inhibition of YWHAZ/AKT signaling. In AML patients, low level of miR-451 is negatively correlated with high levels of c-Myc and YWHAZ, while c-Myc level is positively related to YWHAZ expression.

Structural analysis indicates a significant enrichment of proline hydroxylation participating in the secondary structure of substrate proteins. Our study identified and validated Brd4, a key transcription factor, as a novel proline hydroxylation substrate. Functional analysis showed that the inhibition of proline hydroxylation pathway significantly reduced the proline hydroxylation abundance on Brd4 and affected Brd4-mediated transcriptional activity as well as cell proliferation in AML leukemia cells.

CD99 has been shown to be overexpressed on T-ALL cells and is considered to be a reliable detector of the disease. However, the relevance of CD99 overexpression in ALL has not been investigated in a functional context. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional capacity of CD99+ cells in childhood ALL and determine the suitability of CD99 as a therapeutic target. Flow cytometric analyses confirmed higher expression of CD99 in ALL blasts (81.5+/-22.7%) compared to normal hemopoietic stem cells (27.5+/-21.9%) and T cells (3.1+/-5.2%, P</=0.004). When ALL cells were sorted and assessed in functional assays, all 4 subpopulations (CD34+/CD99+, CD34+/CD99-, CD34-/CD99+ and CD34-/CD99-) could proliferate in vitro and establish leukemia in NSG mice. Leukemia propagating cell frequencies ranged from 1 in 300 to 1 in 7.4x104 but were highest in the CD34+/CD99- subpopulation. In addition, all four subpopulations had self-renewal ability in secondary NSG mice. Cells in each subpopulation contained patient specific TCR rearrangements and karyotypic changes that were preserved with passage through serial NSG transplants. Despite high levels of CD99 antigen on the majority of blast cells, leukemia initiating capacity in vivo was not restricted to cells that express this protein. Consequently, targeting CD99 alone would not eliminate all T-ALL cells with the ability to maintain the disease. The challenge remains to develop therapeutic strategies that can eliminate all leukemia cells with self-renewal capacity in vivo.",,"['Cox, Charlotte V', 'Diamanti, Paraskevi', 'Moppett, John P', 'Blair, Allison']","['Cox CV', 'Diamanti P', 'Moppett JP', 'Blair A']","['Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, NHS Blood and Transplant, Filton, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, NHS Blood and Transplant, Filton, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, NHS Blood and Transplant, Filton, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161020,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,,"['12E7 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotype', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism']",,,2016/10/21 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0165210 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-25314 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Oct 20;11(10):e0165210. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0165210. eCollection 2016.,,['RP-PG-0310-1003/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],PMC5072597,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,

While cellular barcoding is the method of choice for experimental studies, patients that underwent gene therapy carry a unique insertional mark within the transplanted cells originating from the integration of the retroviral vector. Close monitoring of such patients allows accessing their clonal dynamics, however, the early detection of events that predict monoclonal conversion and potentially the onset of leukemia are beneficial for treatment. We developed a simple mathematical model of a self-stabilizing hematopoietic stem cell population to generate a wide range of possible clonal developments, reproducing typical, experimentally and clinically observed scenarios. We use the resulting model scenarios to suggest and test a set of statistical measures that should allow for an interpretation and classification of relevant clonal dynamics. Apart from the assessment of several established diversity indices we suggest a measure that quantifies the extension to which the increase in the size of one clone is attributed to the total loss in the size of all other clones. By evaluating the change in relative clone sizes between consecutive measurements, the suggested measure, referred to as maximum relative clonal expansion (mRCE), proves to be highly sensitive in the detection of rapidly expanding cell clones prior to their dominant manifestation. This predictive potential places the mRCE as a suitable means for the early recognition of leukemogenesis especially in gene therapy patients that are closely monitored.

Despite an initial response to therapy, drug resistance remains a problem for some CML patients. Recent studies have shown that resistance mutations that preexist treatment can be detected in a substantial number of patients, and that this may be associated with eventual treatment failure. One proposed method to extend treatment efficacy is to use a combination of multiple targeted therapies. However, the design of such combination therapies (timing, sequence, etc.) remains an open challenge. In this work we mathematically model the dynamics of CML response to combination therapy and analyze the impact of combination treatment schedules on treatment efficacy in patients with preexisting resistance. We then propose an optimization problem to find the best schedule of multiple therapies based on the evolution of CML according to our ordinary differential equation model. This resulting optimization problem is nontrivial due to the presence of ordinary different equation constraints and integer variables. Our model also incorporates drug toxicity constraints by tracking the dynamics of patient neutrophil counts in response to therapy. We determine optimal combination strategies that maximize time until treatment failure on hypothetical patients, using parameters estimated from clinical data in the literature.",,"['He, Qie', 'Zhu, Junfeng', 'Dingli, David', 'Foo, Jasmine', 'Leder, Kevin Zox']","['He Q', 'Zhu J', 'Dingli D', 'Foo J', 'Leder KZ']","['Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Mathematics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161020,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/10/21 06:00,2017/05/17 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005129 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-16-00598 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2016 Oct 20;12(10):e1005129. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005129. eCollection 2016 Oct.,,,PMC5072565,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6561-3647'],['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,

In very high-risk patients receiving combination haploidentical single-unit cord blood transplants, we have added 4 Gy TBI to the widely used fludarabine, melphalan conditioning regimen, in hopes of reducing relapse and decreasing graft rejection. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the posttransplant outcomes of patients who underwent haplocord stem cell transplant between May 2013 and March 2015 and who received fludarabine 30 mg/m day (D)-7 to -3, melphalan 140 mg/m D-2, and 2 Gy TBI D-4 and -3. RESULTS: All 25 patients achieved primary neutrophil engraftment after a median of 12 days. The median time to platelet engraftment was 27 days. The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 16% by D+100 and 33% by 1 year. The cumulative incidence of grade III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 36% by D+100. The CIR was 13% by D+100 and 29% by 1 year. The estimated 1-year overall survival and progression-free survival were 40% and 37%, respectively. In a subgroup analysis, we compared the outcome of 13 acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving this conditioning regimen with age and disease risk index-matched acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving fludarabine-melphalan without TBI.

To the authors' knowledge, outcomes for CML diagnosed in these patients have not been well described. The current study was conducted to determine the outcome of patients with CML and a history of prior malignancies. METHODS: The current study included patients who were enrolled in clinical trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as initial therapy for CML in chronic phase from July 2000 to January 2014. RESULTS: Of the 630 patients with CML who were treated with frontline tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 626 had a known prior malignancy status. Of these, 45 patients (7%) had a prior malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer whereas 17 patients (3%) had a history of nonmelanoma skin cancers alone. Characteristics of CML were similar between the patients with no prior malignancy, those with a prior malignancy, and those with nonmelanoma skin cancer. Patients with a prior malignancy were found to have an older median age compared with the other 2 groups. The most common prior malignancies were nonmelanoma skin cancer in 20 patients, breast cancer in 11 patients, melanoma in 7 patients, prostate cancer in 6 patients, and colorectal cancer in 5 patients. With regard to CML, the event-free survival, transformation-free survival, and failure-free survival rates were found to be similar between the groups. There was a statistically significantly decreased survival in the group with a prior malignancy versus the group with no prior malignancy versus the group with nonmelanoma skin cancer. In a multivariate analysis, advanced age and an elevated creatinine level were found to be associated with worse survival after a diagnosis of CML. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CML with a history of prior malignancies appear to have the same excellent outcome as patients with no prior malignancies. In the few instances in which concomitant therapy for other malignancies was required during therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, this was able to be accomplished without significant toxicity.

Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were reviewed, and skull marrow ADC values were compared before treatment and in complete remission after therapy. RESULTS: Skull marrow infiltration, manifested with abnormal DWI signals, was present in 37 patients (72.5%) before treatment. Of these, 23 (62.2%) showed scattered signal abnormalities and 14 (37.8%) showed a uniform abnormal signal pattern. Compared with the control group, ADC was significantly decreased in patients with ALL. DWI signal intensity and ADC normalized in patients with complete remission.

Key quorum-sensing plaque bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, act as bridging species between early and late colonizer pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, as the biofilm ages and periodontal inflammation increases. This study is designed to determine impact of different F. nucleatum strains on neutrophil function. METHODS: Cells of human promyelocytic leukemia cell line-60 were differentiated into neutrophil-like cells and cultured with F. nucleatum strains of subspecies (ssp.) nucleatum ATCC 25586, ssp. polymorphum ATCC 10953, and ssp. vincentii ATCC 49256. Neutrophil phagocytosis of F. nucleatum strains and neutrophil apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Superoxide generation was measured by cytochrome C reduction in the presence and absence of N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) (1 muM) stimulation. Proinflammatory cytokine release was determined after 2, 6, and 24 hours of culture in the presence/absence of different F. nucleatum strains. Expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B mRNA levels were analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Each experiment was repeated at least three times in triplicate. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance followed by post hoc Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: All strains of F. nucleatum significantly increased phagocytic capacity of neutrophils. Neutrophil phagocytosis of F. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum was significantly greater than that of F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii and ssp. nucleatum (P <0.001). F. nucleatum ssp. nucleatum and ssp. polymorphum significantly blocked fMLP-induced superoxide generation (P <0.001). Although F. nucleatum vincentii also reduced superoxide generation (25%), the impact was not as strong as that of ssp. nucleatum (83%) and ssp. polymorphum (100%). All F. nucleatum strains stimulated significant increase in neutrophil apoptosis compared with control (P <0.001) and significantly increased expression of NF-kappaB mRNA in neutrophils (P <0.05). Levels of interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha produced by neutrophils were significantly increased in all F. nucleatum groups compared with control (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that different strains of F. nucleatum impact neutrophil function in different ways. Two of three subspecies blocked neutrophil superoxide generation in response to a secondary stimulus, preventing oxidative killing by neutrophils.

The decision to treat a patient with RAI should therefore incorporate a careful risk-benefit analysis. The objective of this work was to adapt the risk-estimation models developed by the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation Committee to local epidemiological characteristics in order to assess the carcinogenesis risk from radiation in a population of Brazilian DTC patients treated with RAI. Absorbed radiation doses in critical organs were also estimated to determine whether they exceeded the thresholds for deterministic effects. METHODS: A total of 416 DTC patients treated with RAI were retrospectively studied. Four organs were selected for absorbed dose estimation and subsequent calculation of carcinogenic risk: the kidney, stomach, salivary glands, and bone marrow. Absorbed doses were calculated by dose factors (absorbed dose per unit activity administered) previously established and based on standard human models. The lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of incidence of cancer as a function of age, sex, and organ-specific dose was estimated, relating it to the activity of RAI administered in the initial treatment. RESULTS: The salivary glands received the greatest absorbed doses of radiation, followed by the stomach, kidney, and bone marrow. None of these, however, surpassed the threshold for deterministic effects for a single administration of RAI. Younger patients received the same level of absorbed dose in the critical organs as older patients did. The lifetime attributable risk for stomach cancer incidence was by far the highest, followed in descending order by salivary-gland cancer, leukemia, and kidney cancer. CONCLUSION: RAI in a single administration is safe in terms of deterministic effects because even high-administered activities do not result in absorbed doses that exceed the thresholds for significant tissue reactions. The Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation Committee mathematical models are a practical method of quantifying the risks of a second primary cancer, demonstrating a marked decrease in risk for younger patients with the administration of lower RAI activities and suggesting that only the smallest activities necessary to promote an effective ablation should be administered in low-risk DTC patients.",,"['Correa, Nilton Lavatori', 'de Sa, Lidia Vasconcellos', 'de Mello, Rossana Corbo Ramalho']","['Correa NL', 'de Sa LV', 'de Mello RC']","['1 Department of Nuclear Medicine, State Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology (IEDE) , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil .', '2 Department of Medical Physics, Institute of Radiation Protection and Dosimetry , National Nuclear Energy Commission (IRD/CNEN), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil .', '3 Department of Radiology, University Hospital of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (HUCFF/UFRJ) , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161121,United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', 'Thyroid cancer, Hurthle cell', 'Thyroid cancer, follicular']",IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma, Follicular/*radiotherapy', 'Adenoma, Oxyphilic/*radiotherapy', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*estimation models', '*radiation carcinogenesis', '*radioactive iodine therapy', '*second primary cancer', '*thyroid cancer']",2016/10/21 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/thy.2016.0266 [doi]'],ppublish,Thyroid. 2017 Feb;27(2):261-270. doi: 10.1089/thy.2016.0266.

In this work, we describe the synthesis and characterization of two different polymer conjugates of cytarabine that were designed for the controlled release of cytarabine within the leukemia cells.

The enzymatic release of cytarabine from the conjugate containing a GFLG spacer utilizing cathepsin B was verified. In addition to enzymolysis, the pH-dependent hydrolysis of cytarabine from both copolymers was also confirmed. Approximately 40 % and 20 % of the drug was released by spontaneous hydrolysis at pH 7.4 within 72 h from the polymer conjugates with the GFLG and beta-Ala spacers, respectively. At pH 6.0, the spontaneous hydrolysis slowed down, and less than 10 % of the drug was liberated within 72 h. The results of the cytotoxicity evaluation of the polymer conjugates in vitro against various cell lines showed that the cytotoxicity of the polymer conjugates is approximately three times lower in comparison to free cytarabine.",,"['Pola, R', 'Janouskova, O', 'Etrych, T']","['Pola R', 'Janouskova O', 'Etrych T']","['Department of Biomedicinal Polymers, Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic. pola@imc.cas.cz.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Czech Republic,Physiol Res,Physiological research,9112413,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Methacrylates)', '0 (Polymers)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'UKW89XAX2X (hydroxypropyl methacrylate)']",IM,,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Carriers/*chemical synthesis', 'Humans', 'Methacrylates/*chemistry', 'Polymers/chemistry']",,,2016/10/21 06:00,2017/04/04 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['933424 [pii]', '10.33549/physiolres.933424 [doi]']",ppublish,Physiol Res. 2016 Oct 20;65(Suppl 2):S225-S232. doi: 10.33549/physiolres.933424.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS: The major criterion is presence of multifocal clusters of morphologically abnormal MC in the bone marrow. Minor diagnostic criteria include elevated serum tryptase level, abnormal MC expression of CD25 and/or CD2, and presence of KITD816V. Risk stratification: The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of SM has been shown to be prognostically relevant. Classification of SM patients into indolent (SM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM associated with a clonal non-MC lineage disease (SM-AHNMD) and mast cell leukemia (MCL) subgroups is a useful first step in establishing prognosis. MANAGEMENT: SM treatment is generally palliative. ISM patients have a normal life expectancy and receive symptom-directed therapy; infrequently, cytoreductive therapy may be indicated for refractory symptoms. ASM patients have disease-related organ dysfunction; interferon-alpha (+/-corticosteroids) can control dermatological, hematological, gastrointestinal, skeletal and mediator-release symptoms, but is hampered by poor tolerability. Similarly, cladribine has broad therapeutic activity, with particular utility when rapid MC debulking is indicated; the main toxicity is myelosuppression. Imatinib has a therapeutic role in the presence of an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutation or in KITD816-unmutated patients. Treatment of SM-AHNMD is governed primarily by the non-MC neoplasm; hydroxyurea has modest utility in this setting; there is a role for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in select cases. Investigational drugs: Recent data confirms midostaurin's significant anti-MC activity in patients with advanced SM. Am. J. Hematol. 91:1147-1159, 2016.

Already before formation of the germinal center, activated B cells of low-affinity are negatively selected in a process that is molecularly not well understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanism behind pre-GC affinity-mediated B cell selection. We applied affinity mutants of HEL antigen and found that rapidly after activation B cells become highly dependent on the cytokine BAFF. Moreover, expression of BAFF receptor CD268 is regulated in a BCR-affinity dependent fashion. High affinity responses via BAFF correlated with PI3K activation, which controlled expression of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1, and thereby increased survival. In the presence of excess BAFF, or in absence of the Mcl-1 antagonist Noxa, more low-affinity B cells survived the first two days after antigen encounter. This resulted in increased numbers of antigen-specific B cells of low affinity upon immunization and reduced the overall affinity of cells that contributed to the germinal center reaction. Our findings elucidate a crucial molecular pathway of B cell selection in the earliest phases of activation by identifying a novel link between BCR affinity and BAFF-R signaling towards Mcl-1.",,"['Wensveen, Felix M', 'Slinger, Erik', 'van Attekum, Martijn Ha', 'Brink, Robert', 'Eldering, Eric']","['Wensveen FM', 'Slinger E', 'van Attekum MH', 'Brink R', 'Eldering E']","['Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, 1105AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, 1105AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, 1105AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Immunology Division, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, NSW 2010, Darlinghurst, Australia.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, 1105AZ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161020,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Tnfsf13b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (hen egg lysozyme)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,['Sci Rep. 2017 Jan 12;7:39366.

Current protocols are complex, demanding supportive care, often not optimally available. We de-escalated the UKALL 2003 protocol to improve the outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at our center. METHODS: In 2007-2009, children were treated as per the UKALL 2003 protocol (protocol 1). In 2010 and 2011, a modified version of the UKALL 2003 (protocol 2) was followed. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-four children aged 5.71+3.1 (1-13) years were treated. Remission was achieved in 335 of the 338 who completed induction. Treatment-related mortality decreased significantly with the modified protocol (P </= 0.001). Relapses were similar with both protocols. Protocol used, regimen, counts at diagnosis, weight for age, gender, education of parents and occupation of caregiver were associated with the outcome of death (P < 0.05). On Cox proportional hazard analysis, patients on protocol 1, female gender and weight </=5th centile had a greater hazard of dying (0.46 [P < 0.0001]; 1.5 [P = 0.04] and 1.64 [P = 0.01]). The 3 years overall survival (OS) with protocols 1 and 2 was 54.8% (95% CI 47.4-61.7%) and 73.9% (95% CI 66-79%) (P < 0.001), respectively. The event-free survival with protocols 1 and 2 was 50.8% (95% CI 43-57%) and 65.7% (95% CI 58-72%) (P < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A steady improvement in survival has been observed at our center to a 3-year present OS of 73.9% with reduction in treatment intensity. The way forward for LMICs is to formulate rational treatment protocols at par with resources.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Trehan, Amita', 'Bansal, Deepak', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Vora, Ajay']","['Trehan A', 'Bansal D', 'Varma N', 'Vora A']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Advanced Pediatric Center, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Advanced Pediatric Center, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161020,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*mortality', '*protocol', '*survival']",2016/10/21 06:00,2017/07/21 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26281 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Apr;64(4). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26281.

MicroRNA-155 (miR155), a non-coding transcript of the B-cell integration cluster (BIC) gene, has been reported to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of several types of hematologic malignancies (HMs) in which high miR155 levels have been found. At yet, however, the EV miR155 level and its putative clinical relevance in sera of HM patients have not been reported. METHODS: EVs from sera of representative patients with eight different HMs and healthy subjects (controls) were isolated using differential centrifugation. The identity and quality of the EVs were verified by atomic force and transmission electron microscopy. The EV miR155 levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of differences in EV miR155 levels were determined using ROC curve analyses. RESULTS: We found that the EV miR155 levels were significantly higher in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) cases compared to controls. Conversely, we found that the EV miR155 levels were significantly lower in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and multiple myeloma (MM) cases. No differences were found in follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) cases compared to controls. EV miR155 ROC curve analyses revealed significantly different patterns in CLL and AML cases compared to controls, and in AML cases compared to MDS cases (p = 0.004, p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). In addition, we found that high EV miR155 levels correlated with high white blood cell counts in AML patients. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that EV miR155 may serve as an attractive new, non-invasive diagnostic biomarker in human hematologic malignancies.",,"['Caivano, Antonella', 'La Rocca, Francesco', 'Simeon, Vittorio', 'Girasole, Marco', 'Dinarelli, Simone', 'Laurenzana, Ilaria', 'De Stradis, Angelo', 'De Luca, Luciana', 'Trino, Stefania', 'Traficante, Antonio', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Mansueto, Giovanna', 'Villani, Oreste', 'Pietrantuono, Giuseppe', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Del Vecchio, Luigi', 'Musto, Pellegrino']","['Caivano A', 'La Rocca F', 'Simeon V', 'Girasole M', 'Dinarelli S', 'Laurenzana I', 'De Stradis A', 'De Luca L', 'Trino S', 'Traficante A', ""D'Arena G"", 'Mansueto G', 'Villani O', 'Pietrantuono G', 'Laurenti L', 'Del Vecchio L', 'Musto P']","['Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), 85028, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy. caivanoa@libero.it.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), 85028, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), 85028, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.', 'Institute for the Study of the Structure of Matter, National Research Council (CNR), Rome, Italy.', 'Institute for the Study of the Structure of Matter, National Research Council (CNR), Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), 85028, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.', 'Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection, CNR, Bari, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), 85028, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata (CROB), 85028, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.', 'Unit of Clinical Pathology, IRCCS-CROB, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS-CROB, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS-CROB, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS-CROB, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS-CROB, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy.', 'CEINGE-Biotecnologie Avanzate scarl and Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnologies, Federico II University, Naples, Italy.', 'Scientific Direction, IRCCS-CROB, Rionero in Vulture, Potenza, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161019,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Extracellular Vesicles/*genetics', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Middle Aged', 'ROC Curve', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Extracellular vesicles', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', ""Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia"", 'miR155']",2016/10/21 06:00,2017/02/01 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13402-016-0300-x [doi]', '10.1007/s13402-016-0300-x [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2017 Feb;40(1):97-103. doi: 10.1007/s13402-016-0300-x.

In this work, hamster fibroblast cells exhibiting moderate levels of ER stress were compared to those exhibiting severe ER stress. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation was accomplished via a temperature-sensitive mutation in the Dad1 subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex or by direct inhibition with tunicamycin (Tm). Temperature shift (TS) treatment generated weak activation of ER stress signaling when compared to doses of Tm that are typically used in ER stress studies (500-1000 nM). A dose-response analysis of key ER stress signaling mediators, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), revealed 20-40 nM of Tm to generate activation intensity similar to TS treatment. In parental BHK21 cells, moderate (20-40 nM) and high doses (200-1000 nM) of Tm were compared to identify physiological and signaling-based differences in stress response. Inhibition of ER Ca(2+) release via ITPR activity with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) or Xestospongin C (XeC) was sufficient to protect against apoptosis induced by moderate but not higher doses of Tm. Analysis of kinase activation over a range of Tm exposures revealed the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) to display increasing activation with Tm dosage. Interestingly, Tm induced the extracellular regulated kinases (Erk1/2) only at moderate doses of Tm. Inhibition of ER transmembrane stress sensors (IRE1, PERK) or cytosolic signaling mediators (p38, Jnk1, Erk1/2) was used to evaluate pathways involved in apoptosis activation during ER stress. Inhibition of either PERK or p38 was sufficient to reduce cell death and apoptosis induced by moderate, but not high, doses of Tm. During ER stress, cells exhibited a rapid decline in anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and survivin proteins. Inhibition of PERK was sufficient to block this affect. This work reveals moderate doses of ER stress to generate patterns of stress signaling that are distinct from higher doses and that apoptosis activation at moderate levels of stress are dependent upon PERK and p38 signaling. Studies exploring ER stress signaling should recognize that this signaling acts as a rheostat rather than a simple switch, behaving distinctively in a dose-dependent manner.",,"['Lumley, Emily C', 'Osborn, Acadia R', 'Scott, Jessica E', 'Scholl, Amanda G', 'Mercado, Vicki', 'McMahan, Young T', 'Coffman, Zachary G', 'Brewster, Jay L']","['Lumley EC', 'Osborn AR', 'Scott JE', 'Scholl AG', 'Mercado V', 'McMahan YT', 'Coffman ZG', 'Brewster JL']","['Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu,, CA, 90263, USA.', 'Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu,, CA, 90263, USA.', 'Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu,, CA, 90263, USA.', 'Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu,, CA, 90263, USA.', 'Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu,, CA, 90263, USA.', 'Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu,, CA, 90263, USA.', 'Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu,, CA, 90263, USA.', 'Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu,, CA, 90263, USA. jay.brewster@pepperdine.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161020,Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (Cinnamates)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Macrocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (salubrinal)', '0 (xestospongin C)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'E4ES684O93 (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Hexosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.18 (dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide - protein glycotransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'GYV9AM2QAG (Thiourea)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boron Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cinnamates/toxicity', 'Cricetinae', '*Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Hexosyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Macrocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Oxazoles/pharmacology', 'RNA Splicing/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Temperature', 'Thiourea/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Tunicamycin/toxicity', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'eIF-2 Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Endoplasmic reticulum', '*PERK', '*Protein folding', '*Protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase', '*Unfolded protein response', '*p38 kinase']",2016/10/21 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12192-016-0740-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12192-016-0740-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2017 Jan;22(1):43-54. doi: 10.1007/s12192-016-0740-2.

Approximately 50 patients were enrolled per year, yielding a total of 780 patients with PMF included in this study. The median age at diagnosis was 66 years. At the time of analysis, the median survival duration was 47 months, and the 3-year overall survival rate was 59 %. Infection and disease transformation into acute leukemia were the most frequent causes of death. Of the proposed prognostic models for predicting the outcomes of PMF patients in Japan, the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System of PMF plus model was the most feasible. Forty-three patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) at a median of 343 days after diagnosis.

Besides its localisation in the plasma membrane, MRP4 has been also detected in the membrane of dense granules in resting platelets. In polarised cells it is localised at the basolateral or apical plasma membrane. To date, the mechanism of MRP4 trafficking has not been elucidated; protein interactions may regulate both the localisation and function of this transporter. We approached this issue by searching for interacting proteins by in vitro binding assays, followed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry, and by visualising their co-localisation in platelets and haematopoietic cells. We identified the PDZ domain containing scaffold proteins ezrin-binding protein 50 (EBP50/NHERF1), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and sorting nexin 27 (SNX27), but also the adaptor protein complex 3 subunit beta3A (AP3B1) and the heat shock protein HSP90 as putative interaction partners of MRP4. The knock-down of SNX27, PSD95, and AP3B1 by siRNA in megakaryoblastic leukaemia cells led to a redistribution of MRP4 from intracellular structures to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of HSP90 led to a diminished expression and retention of MRP4 in the endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that MRP4 localisation and function are regulated by multiple protein interactions. Changes in the adaptor proteins can hence lead to altered localisation and function of the transporter.",,"['Schaletzki, Yvonne', 'Kromrey, Marie-Luise', 'Broderdorf, Susanne', 'Hammer, Elke', 'Grube, Markus', 'Hagen, Paul', 'Sucic, Sonja', 'Freissmuth, Michael', 'Volker, Uwe', 'Greinacher, Andreas', 'Rauch, Bernhard H', 'Kroemer, Heyo K', 'Jedlitschky, Gabriele']","['Schaletzki Y', 'Kromrey ML', 'Broderdorf S', 'Hammer E', 'Grube M', 'Hagen P', 'Sucic S', 'Freissmuth M', 'Volker U', 'Greinacher A', 'Rauch BH', 'Kroemer HK', 'Jedlitschky G']","['Gabriele Jedlitschky PhD, Department of Pharmacology, Center of Drug Absorption and Transport (C_DAT), University Medicine Greifswald, Felix-Hausdorff-Str. 3, 17487 Greifswald, Germany, Tel.: +49 3834 8622146, Fax: +49 3834 865631, E-mail: jedlits@uni-greifswald.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161020,Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (AP3B1 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 3)', '0 (Adaptor Protein Complex beta Subunits)', '0 (DLG4 protein, human)', '0 (Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '0 (sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor)', 'I60EH8GECX (monorden)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Protein Complex 3/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adaptor Protein Complex beta Subunits/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Interference', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AP3B1', '*HSP90', '*PDZ domain', '*Protein trafficking', '*delta-storage pool deficiencies']",2016/10/21 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['16-01-0045 [pii]', '10.1160/TH16-01-0045 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2017 Jan 5;117(1):105-115. doi: 10.1160/TH16-01-0045.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate prognostic factors and their effects on survival in ALL patients in the Northeast of Iran. METHODS: In a descriptive and retrospective study from 2009 to 2015, 48 ALL patients referred to hematology-oncology clinic. Age, sex, fever, blood group, type of ALL and consumption of amphotericin B, forms of cytogenetic, survival in the patients, WBC, hemoglobin, and platelet were checked in the first referral for every patient. The mean follow-up was 27.3 months in which 28 patients (59.3%) died. overall survival (OS) was plotted by GraphPad Prism 5 and the Log-rank test was used for analysis of survival with risk factors. RESULTS: The mean age for all the ALL patients at diagnosis was 32.3 years (range, 15-71 years), and 81.3% were male. Of all patients, 62.5% had fever and 25% consumed amphotericin B. 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year OS rates were 62.2%, 52.7%, 40.6%, 39.1%, 22.2%, respectively. 75%, 29.2% and 39.6% of patients had WBC < 20 x 10(3)/mul, Hb < 7 g/dL and platelet < 30 x 10(3)/muL, respectively. There was a significant difference in survival based on age (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, age > 35 years is the most prognostic factor in ALL patients. Also, patients who received amphotericin B had lower life expectancy because these patients were suffering from fungal infection or due to lack of response to antibacterial drugs, they have been treated with amphotericin B.",,"['Allahyari, Abolghasem', 'Hashemi, Seyed-Mehdi', 'Nazemian, Fahimeh', 'Karimi, Mohammad', 'Kazemi, Mohammad-Reza', 'Sadeghi, Masoud']","['Allahyari A', 'Hashemi SM', 'Nazemian F', 'Karimi M', 'Kazemi MR', 'Sadeghi M']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, IR Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, IR Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IR Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, IR Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, IR Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, IR Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160810,Iran,Iran J Cancer Prev,Iranian journal of cancer prevention,101500574,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Age, Northeastern Iran', 'Survival', 'WBC']",2016/10/21 06:00,2016/10/21 06:01,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2015/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/21 06:01 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17795/ijcp-5045 [doi]'],epublish,Iran J Cancer Prev. 2016 Aug 10;9(4):e5045. doi: 10.17795/ijcp-5045. eCollection 2016 Aug.,,,PMC5056011,,,['Conflict of Interest:There is no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Among multiple approaches able to harness the power of the immune system against cancer, T cell based immunotherapies represent one of the most successful examples. In particular, biotechnological engineering of protein structures, like the T cell receptor or the immunoglobulins, allowed the generation of synthetic peptides like chimeric antigen receptors and bispecific antibodies that are able to redirect non-tumor specific T cells to recognize and kill leukemic cells. The anti-CD19/CD3 bispecific antibody blinatumomab and anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART19) have produced deep responses in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute leukemias. However, although the majority of these patients responds to anti-CD19 immunotherapy, a subset of them still relapses. Interestingly, a novel family of leukemia escape mechanisms has been described, all characterized by the apparent loss of CD19 on the surface of leukemic blasts. This extraordinary finding demonstrates the potent selective pressure of CART19/blinatumomab that drives extreme and specific escape strategies by leukemic blasts. Patients with CD19-negative relapsed leukemia have very poor prognosis and novel approaches to treat and ideally prevent antigen-loss are direly needed. In this review we discuss the incidence, mechanisms and therapeutic approaches for CD19-negative leukemia relapses occuring after CD19-directed T cell immunotherapies and present our future perspective.",,"['Ruella, Marco', 'Maus, Marcela V']","['Ruella M', 'Maus MV']","['Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States; Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.']",['eng'],"['Review', 'Journal Article']",20160928,Netherlands,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,101585369,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adoptive cell therapy', 'Bispecific antibodies', 'Blinatumomab', 'CART19', 'CTL019', 'Chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'Leukemia', 'biCAR', 'dualCART', 'tanCAR']",2016/10/21 06:00,2016/10/21 06:01,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/21 06:01 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.csbj.2016.09.003 [doi]', 'S2001-0370(16)30062-9 [pii]']",epublish,Comput Struct Biotechnol J. 2016 Sep 28;14:357-362. doi: 10.1016/j.csbj.2016.09.003. eCollection 2016.,,"['K08 CA166039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 CA212302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA212302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5061074,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Br and Cyperus rotundus L are widely used in ayurvedic preparation for the treatment of diabetes and other diseases. The early literature, so far, does not indicate the presence of any bioactive principle isolated from these plants. OBJECTIVE: To identify free radical scavenging, anti-diabetic and anti- inflammatory principles from these two species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bioassay guided fractionation and isolation of active constituents was done by chromatographic techniques. They also evaluated their anti-oxidant activity by DPPH and ABTS. The anti-diabetic activity was screened by alpha- glucosidase and alpha- amylase assays. Also, the further evaluation of in vitro anti-inflammatory activity using THP-1 monocytic cells and in vivo anti- inflammatory activity, was confirmed by carrageenan induced rat paw edema as model. RESULTS: The activity guided isolation led to isolation of twelve compounds Which are: Stigmasterol([1]), beta- sitosterol([2]), Lupeol([3]), Gallic acid([4]), Quercetin([5]), beta- amyrin([6]), Oleanolic acid([7]), beta- amyrin acetate([8]), 4- hydroxyl butyl cinnamate([9]), 4- hydroxyl cinnamic acid([10]), Caffeic acid,([11]) and Kaempferol([12]) respectively. Among the isolates, the compounds 4 and 5 displayed potent radical scavenging activity with an IC50 values of 0.43 and 0.067 g/ml. The compounds 4, 5 and 10 showed significant anti-diabetic activities. while lupeol([3]) showed potent IL-1 beta activity inhibition in THP-1 monocytic cells and also displayed significant (p<0.0025) in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. CONCLUSION: Inbrief, we isolated twelve compounds from both the species. Collectively, our results suggested that aromatic compounds showed good anti-oxidant and anti-diabetic activities. SUMMARY: The study investigates the free radical scavenging, alpha-glucosidase inhibitory and anti-inflammatory effects of constituents isolated from Indian sedges viz. C. scariosus and C. rotundus. The results indicated that phenolic compounds displayed potent fee radical scavenging activty and alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity. While terpene constituent, Lupeol[3] showed good IL-1(beta) activity inhibition in THP-1 monocytic cells and also displayed significant (p<0.0025) in vivo anti inflammatory activity in carrageenan induced rat paw edema.

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Compound Danshen Tablet (CDT) in preventing thromboembolism in multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated with thalidomide-based regimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS MM patients treated with thalidomide-based regimens were retrospectively reviewed between January 2008 and March 2015. Patients were categorized into 3 cohorts based on thromboembolic prophylaxis used: CDT, Warfarin Tablet, and no prophylaxis. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), other adverse effects (AEs), and the changes of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels were monitored. RESULTS Seven out of 313 MM patients (2.24%) developed venous thrombosis events (VTE) in this retrospective study, all clustering in the no prophylaxis cohort. Three patients of the Warfarin cohort (3.19%) experienced hemorrhage. Neither VTE events nor serious AEs were observed in the CDT cohort. Following Compound Danshen or Warfarin treatment for 3 months, the D-dimer and fibrinogen levels (in particular the D-dimer level) (all P<0.05), were obviously decreased relative to their respective baselines and the no prophylaxis cohort. In contrast, the 2 blotting parameters were significantly increased in the no prophylaxis cohort relative to the baseline level (All P<0.05), and were even higher in the patients experiencing VTE compared to the no VTE patients (P<0.0001 and P=0.016, respectively).

We hypothesized that natural killer (NK) cells and their activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (aKIRs) influence the immune surveillance and clinical outcome of patients with MDSs. Here, we first examined the distribution of aKIR genes and haplotype in 2 independent cohorts of MDS and AML patients. The median number of aKIR genes was lower in MDS patients than healthy controls (2 vs 3 genes; P = .001), and lower in patients with secondary AML (progressed from MDSs) compared with de novo AML patients (2 vs 3; P = .008) and healthy controls (2 vs 3; P = .006). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of KIR haplotype A (characterized by low aKIR content 0-1) independently predicted a higher risk of conversion to AML (relative risk [RR] with 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.67 [1.13-6.71]; P = .02) and worse adjusted progression-free survival (RR with 95% CI, 2.96 [1.59-5.52]; P = .001) and overall survival (2.25 [1.17-4.31]; P = .02), compared with KIR haplotype B (multiple aKIR genes).

Exosomes can potentially transfer their cargo to other cells, implicating them in many patho-physiological processes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), residents of the bone marrow and metastatic niches, potentially interact with cancer cells and/or their derived exosomes. In this study, we investigated whether exosomes derived from adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells act as intercellular messengers delivering leukemia-related genes that modulate the properties of human MSCs in favor of leukemia. We hypothesized that the cargo of ATL-derived exosomes is transferred to MSCs and alter their functional behavior to support the establishment of the appropriate microenvironment for leukemia. RESULTS: We showed that both ATL cells (C81 and HuT-102) and patient-derived cells released Tax-containing exosomes. The cargo of HuT-102-derived exosomes consisted of miR-21, miR-155 and vascular endothelial growth factor. We demonstrated that HuT-102-derived exosomes not only deliver Tax to recipient MSCs, but also induce NF-kappaB activation leading to a change in cellular morphology, increase in proliferation and the induction of gene expression of migration and angiogenic markers. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ATL-derived exosomes deliver Tax and other leukemia-related genes to MSCs and alter their properties to presumably create a more conducive milieu for leukemia. These findings highlight the contribution of leukemia-derived exosomes in cellular transformation and their potential value as biomarkers and targets in therapeutic strategies.",,"['El-Saghir, Jamal', 'Nassar, Farah', 'Tawil, Nadim', 'El-Sabban, Marwan']","['El-Saghir J', 'Nassar F', 'Tawil N', 'El-Sabban M']","['Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Experimental Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon. me00@aub.edu.lb.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161019,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Exosomes/*chemistry/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/chemistry/*physiology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Exosomes', '*Leukemia', '*MSCs', '*NF-kappaB', '*Niche', '*Tax', '*miRNA']",2016/10/21 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/s12977-016-0307-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-016-0307-4 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2016 Oct 19;13(1):73. doi: 10.1186/s12977-016-0307-4.,,,PMC5070229,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Delile: an antiangiogenic, antitumor and antioxidant agent.",396,,"BACKGROUND: Balanite aegyptiaca (L.) Delile, is a plant with extensive medicinal properties. Its stem bark is traditionally known for its spasmolytic and antiepileptic properties and used to treat yellow fever, jaundice and syphilis. Angiogenesis (sprouting of new blood vessels) is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. The goal of this study is investigate the antiangiogenic, cytotoxicity and antioxidant activity as well as antitumor in vivo properties of B. aegyptiaca stem bark extracts. METHOD: The dried powder of stem bark was extracted sequentially with n-hexane, chloroform, methanol and water. Rat aorta ring assay (RARA) was used as a platform to screen for antiangiogenic affect. The most active extract was subjected to further confirmatory antiangiogenic tests i.e. cell migration, tube formation and VEGF inhibition and finally evaluated for its in vivo antitumor efficacy in nude mice. The cytotoxicity of extracts on four cancer cell lines (HCT-116, K562, U937 and MCF-7) and one normal cells line (HUVEC) was evaluated. To assess the antioxidant activity screening, four methods were used, (DPPH*) and ABTS radical scavenging activity, as well as total flavonoids and phenolic contents. RESULTS: Methanol extract of B. aegyptiaca stem bark (MBA) showed the highest antiangiogenic, antioxidant and anticancer properties. It was found selectively cytotoxic to leukemia cell lines as well as breast cancer cell line MCF-7. (MBA) thus exhibited antiangiogenic in ex-vivo rat aorta ring model; it was found to excel its antiangiogenic effect via inhibition of the key growth factor (VEGF) as well as to halt HUVEC cell migration and tube formation, furthermore animals bearing colon cancer treated with (MBA) showed significant reduction in tumor growth. CONCLUSION: Different extracts of B. aegyptiaca stem bark showed various anticancer and antiangiogenic properties. MBA demonstrated potent antiangiogenic, antioxidant and antitumor in vivo. The outcome of this study suggests the potential of stem bark of the B. aegyptiaca for developing chemotherapeutic agent against solid tumor as well as leukemia.",,"['Hassan, Loiy E Ahmed', 'Dahham, Saad S', 'Saghir, Sultan Ayesh Mohammed', 'Mohammed, Abdelhafeez M A', 'Eltayeb, Nagla M', 'Majid, Amin Malik Shah Abdul', 'Majid, Aman Shah Abdul']","['Hassan LE', 'Dahham SS', 'Saghir SA', 'Mohammed AM', 'Eltayeb NM', 'Majid AM', 'Majid AS']","['EMAN Research and Testing Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 USM, Penang, Malaysia.', 'Department of Botany, Faculty of Science & Technology, Omdurman Islamic University, P.O.

Targeting unique cellular metabolism of cancer cells is a potentially less toxic approach. Monotherapy with mitochondrial inhibitors like metformin have met with limited success since escape mechanisms such as increased glycolytic ATP production, especially in hyperglycemia, can overcome the metabolic blockade. As an alternative strategy for metformin therapy, we hypothesized that the combination of 6-benzylthioinosine (6-BT), a broad-spectrum metabolic inhibitor, and metformin could block this drug resistance mechanism. Metformin treatment alone resulted in significant suppression of ROS and mitochondrial respiration with increased glycolysis accompanied by modest cytotoxicity (10-25%). In contrast, 6-BT monotherapy resulted in inhibition of glucose uptake, decreased glycolysis, and decreased ATP with minimal changes in ROS and mitochondrial respiration. The combination of 6-BT with metformin resulted in significant cytotoxicity (60-70%) in monocytic AML cell lines and was associated with inhibition of FLT3-ITD activated STAT5 and reduced c-Myc and GLUT-1 expression. Therefore, although the anti-tumor and metabolic effects of metformin have been limited by the metabolic reprogramming within cells, the novel combination of 6-BT and metformin targets this bypass mechanism resulting in reduced glycolysis, STAT5 inhibition, and increased cell death.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We identify 492 AML-specific cell-essential genes, including several established therapeutic targets such as DOT1L, BCL2, and MEN1, and many other genes including clinically actionable candidates. We validate selected genes using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, and chose KAT2A as a candidate for downstream study. KAT2A inhibition demonstrated anti-AML activity by inducing myeloid differentiation and apoptosis, and suppressed the growth of primary human AMLs of diverse genotypes while sparing normal hemopoietic stem-progenitor cells.

The pro-survival protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) is overexpressed in many cancers, but the development of small molecules targeting this protein that are amenable for clinical testing has been challenging. Here we describe S63845, a small molecule that specifically binds with high affinity to the BH3-binding groove of MCL1. Our mechanistic studies demonstrate that S63845 potently kills MCL1-dependent cancer cells, including multiple myeloma, leukaemia and lymphoma cells, by activating the BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In vivo, S63845 shows potent anti-tumour activity with an acceptable safety margin as a single agent in several cancers. Moreover, MCL1 inhibition, either alone or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, proved effective against several solid cancer-derived cell lines. These results point towards MCL1 as a target for the treatment of a wide range of tumours.",,"['Kotschy, Andras', 'Szlavik, Zoltan', 'Murray, James', 'Davidson, James', 'Maragno, Ana Leticia', 'Le

Here, we report two Chinese boys with novel nonsense KMT2A mutations. Most of their phenotypes are concordant with WDSTS. They, however, lack the key WDSTS feature-hypertrichosis cubiti. Additionally, their transverse palmar creases are absent. We further summarized the genotypes and phenotypes of the KMT2A mutation carriers. The consensus phenotypes include postnatal growth retardation, developmental delay, short stature, and intellectual disability. The common facial features include thick eyebrows, long eyelashes, downslanting, and narrow palpebral fissures, wide nasal bridge, and broad nasal tip. They have generalized hypertrichosis. A hairy back can be observed as frequently as hairy elbows in patients with KMT2A mutations. Absent palmar proximal transverse creases are only observed in these two Chinese boys. This might be due to the difference in ethnic background. Thus far, all mutations in KMT2A are located before the FYRC domain. They would truncate KMT2A mRNA transcripts. Haploinsufficiency of the histone methyltransferase activity would therefore influence transcriptional regulation.

There are 2 broad categories: acute and chronic. In the acute category, there is a leukemic and a lymphomatous variant, whereas in the designated ""chronic"" form, there is mild peripheral blood lymphocytosis. The intermediate ""smoldering"" category is without peripheral blood lymphocytosis with only discernible skin involvement. We present a 68-year-old human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 seropositive female with a mild peripheral blood atypical lymphocytosis who had indurated nodules on her hands of 2 years duration and a new scaly ichthyosiform eruption on her lower extremities. Histopathologic examination of the hand biopsy revealed coalescing nodules of large atypical noncerebriform lymphocytes with focal areas of epidermotropism. Phenotypically, the infiltrate was positive for beta-F1, CD2, CD4, CD5, CD7, Foxp3, and CD25. In both biopsies, there was striking upregulation of TOX (thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box factor) in the nuclei of neoplastic cells. The second biopsy taken from the ichthyotic patch on the patient's left leg showed a subtle pattern of epidermal infiltration by atypical noncerebriform lymphocytes and a distinct compact scale consistent with the clinical picture of ichthyosis. The histopathologic appearance was that of a yet undescribed ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides-like presentation of chronic ATLL. In addition, the observed upregulation of nuclear TOX may play an oncogenic role in ATLL.

It has been reported that vildagliptin can cause hepatic dysfunction in patients. However, the molecular-mechanism of vildagliptin-induced liver dysfunction has not been elucidated. In this study, we employed an expression microarray to determine hepatic genes that were highly regulated by vildagliptin in mice. We found that pro-inflammatory S100 calcium-binding protein (S100) a8 and S100a9 were induced more than 5-fold by vildagliptin in the mouse liver. We further examined the effects of vildagliptin and its major metabolite M20.7 on the mRNA expression levels of S100A8 and S100A9 in human hepatoma HepG2 and leukemia HL-60 cells. In HepG2 cells, vildagliptin, M20.7, and sitagliptin - another DPP-4 inhibitor - induced S100A9 mRNA. In HL-60 cells, in contrast, S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs were significantly induced by vildagliptin and M20.7, but not by sitagliptin.

By interacting with nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), a protein involved in NAD biosynthesis, PCNA coordinates glycolysis and survival, especially in HL-60R cells. These cells showed a dramatic increase in intracellular NAD+ concentration as well as glycolysis including increased expression and activity of hexokinase 1 and increased lactate production.

To address this, we interrogated activated signaling pathways in a comparative analysis of mouse and human leukemias expressing the fusion protein E2A-PBX1, which is present in 5%-7% of pediatric and 50% of pre-B-cell receptor (preBCR(+)) acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). In this study, we describe remodeling of signaling networks by E2A-PBX1 in pre-B-ALL, which results in hyperactivation of the key oncogenic effector enzyme PLCgamma2. Depletion of PLCgamma2 reduced proliferation of mouse and human ALLs, including E2A-PBX1 leukemias, and increased disease-free survival after secondary transplantation. Mechanistically, E2A-PBX1 bound promoter regulatory regions and activated the transcription of its key target genes ZAP70, SYK, and LCK, which encode kinases upstream of PLCgamma2. Depletion of the respective upstream kinases decreased cell proliferation and phosphorylated levels of PLCgamma2 (pPLCgamma2). Pairwise silencing of ZAP70, SYK, or LCK showed additive effects on cell growth inhibition, providing a rationale for combination therapy with inhibitors of these kinases. Accordingly, inhibitors such as the SRC family kinase (SFK) inhibitor dasatinib reduced pPLCgamma2 and inhibited proliferation of human and mouse preBCR(+)/E2A-PBX1(+) leukemias in vitro and in vivo Furthermore, combining small-molecule inhibition of SYK, LCK, and SFK showed synergistic interactions and preclinical efficacy in the same setting. Our results show how the oncogenic fusion protein E2A-PBX1 perturbs signaling pathways upstream of PLCgamma2 and renders leukemias amenable to targeted therapeutic inhibition.

There is no consensus on the optimal graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. This study compared the two most commonly used graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimens (post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based vs. the anti-thymocyte globulin-based) in adults with acute myeloid leukemia reported to the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation. A total of 308 patients were analyzed; 193 received post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based regimen and 115 anti-thymocyte globulin-based regimen as anti-graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. The post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based regimen was more likely to be associated to bone marrow as graft source (60% vs. 40%; P=0.01). Patients in the post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based regimen group had significantly less grade 3-4 acute graft-versus-host disease than those in the anti-thymocyte globulin-based group (5% vs. 12%, respectively; P=0.01), comparable to chronic graft-versus-host disease. Multivariate analysis showed that non-relapse mortality was lower in the post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based regimen group [22% vs. 30%, Hazard ratio (HR) 1.77(95%CI: 1.09-2.86); P=0.02] with no difference in relapse incidence. Patients receiving post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based regimen had better graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival [HR 1.45 (95%CI: 1.04-2.02); P=0.03] and leukemia-free survival [HR 1.48 (95%CI: 1.03-2.12); P=0.03] than those in the anti-thymocyte globulin-based group. In the multivariate analysis, there was also a trend for a higher overall survival [HR 1.43 (95%CI: 0.98-2.09); P=0.06] for post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based regimen versus the anti-thymocyte globulin-based group. Notably, center experience was also associated with non-relapse mortality and graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival.

A report from the IMDSFlow working group.,308-319,10.3324/haematol.2016.147835 [doi],"Current recommendations for diagnosing myelodysplastic syndromes endorse flow cytometry as an informative tool. Most flow cytometry protocols focus on the analysis of progenitor cells and the evaluation of the maturing myelomonocytic lineage. However, one of the most frequently observed features of myelodysplastic syndromes is anemia, which may be associated with dyserythropoiesis. Therefore, analysis of changes in flow cytometry features of nucleated erythroid cells may complement current flow cytometry tools. The multicenter study within the IMDSFlow Working Group, reported herein, focused on defining flow cytometry parameters that enable discrimination of dyserythropoiesis associated with myelodysplastic syndromes from non-clonal cytopenias. Data from a learning cohort were compared between myelodysplasia and controls, and results were validated in a separate cohort. The learning cohort comprised 245 myelodysplasia cases, 290 pathological, and 142 normal controls; the validation cohort comprised 129 myelodysplasia cases, 153 pathological, and 49 normal controls. Multivariate logistic regression analysis performed in the learning cohort revealed that analysis of expression of CD36 and CD71 (expressed as coefficient of variation), in combination with CD71 fluorescence intensity and the percentage of CD117(+) erythroid progenitors provided the best discrimination between myelodysplastic syndromes and non-clonal cytopenias (specificity 90%; 95% confidence interval: 84-94%). The high specificity of this marker set was confirmed in the validation cohort (92%; 95% confidence interval: 86-97%).

However, its function in leukemia remains unknown. METHODS: Clinic samples and cell model were used in this article to investigate the expression of STIP in lymphoblastic leukemia. The functional research of STIP was performed in ARH-77 by siRNA transfection, immunofluorescence, cell count, cell cycle analysis, qRT-PCR, sub-cellular fractionation assays, immunoprecipitation and western blotting. RESULTS: Here, we found that STIP is more highly expressed in both clinical lymphoblastic leukemia samples and cultured leukemia cells than in normal samples. Knockdown of STIP in B lymphoblastic leukemia ARH-77 cells leads to S phase arrest, lower cell proliferation rates, and suppressed AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Interestingly, when protein phosphatase was inhibited by Calyculin A, STIP knockdown did not result in the dephosphorylation of p-ERK1/2, suggesting the dependence of STIP on protein phosphatase in the regulation of ERK1/2. Among those protein phosphatase inhibited by Calyculin A, PP1gamma was found to interact with STIP proven by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays. The binding of STIP with PP1gamma may decrease the phosphatase activity of PP1gamma, resulting in hyper-activated ERK1/2 signaling. CONCLUSION: In summary, the high expression and activation effect on the ERK1/2 signaling of STIP in lymphoblastic leukemia suggest that STIP would be a potential therapy target or diagnosis marker for leukemia.",,"['Sun, S', 'Wang, Y', 'Chen, H', 'Fang, L', 'Cui, Y', 'Han, X', 'Wu, D', 'Li, H', 'Ye, M', 'Zhao, X', 'Liu, J']","['Sun S', 'Wang Y', 'Chen H', 'Fang L', 'Cui Y', 'Han X', 'Wu D', 'Li H', 'Ye M', 'Zhao X', 'Liu J']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China. zhaoxl9198@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genetics & School of Life Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China. liujing2@sklmg.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Curr Mol Med,Current molecular medicine,101093076,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (ELP2 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics']",,,2016/10/21 06:00,2017/10/04 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/04 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['CMM-EPUB-79066 [pii]', '10.2174/1566524016666161018154401 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Mol Med. 2016;16(8):767-775. doi: 10.2174/1566524016666161018154401.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A defined metabolic state in cancer cells is critical for cell growth and long-term self-renewal, and such state is intrinsically associated with redox balance. Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) regulates several biological processes, at least in part, through its ability to control the assembly of PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs). Recent Advances: PML is oxidation-prone, and oxidative stress promotes NB biogenesis. These nuclear subdomains recruit many nuclear proteins and regulate their SUMOylation and other post-translational modifications. Some of these cargos-such as p53, SIRT1, AKT, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-are key regulators of cell fate. PML was also recently shown to regulate oxidation. CRITICAL ISSUES: While it was long considered primarily as a tumor suppressor protein, PML-regulated metabolic switch uncovered that this protein could promote survival and/or stemness of some normal or cancer cells. In this study, we review the recent findings on this multifunctional protein. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Studying PML scaffolding functions as well as its fine role in the activation of p53 or fatty acid oxidation will bring new insights in how PML could bridge oxidative stress, senescence, cell death, and metabolism.

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) has been shown to confer adverse prognosis in CLL, recent data indicating it might also contribute to CLL cell survival and metabolism. We determined LPL mRNA expression in unselected peripheral blood of 84 CLL patients by RT PCR. Results were correlated with other prognostic markers and outcome. 30/84 (40 %) of cases were LPL positive based on the cutoff established by ROC analysis. In LPL positive patients significantly shorter median survival (136 vs 258 months, p < 0.0001) and time to first treatment intervals (36 vs 144 months, p < 0.002) were documented. LPL values correlated with male gender, higher stages, more treatment requirement, CD38 positivity and unmutated IgVH genes. Among cases with 13q deletion, LPL positivity identified a subcohort with poor outcome (median survival 108 months vs NR, p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, cytogenetic aberrations and LPL had significant impact on survival.

However, 9-aminoacridine derivatives, which have the same structural scaffold as amsacrine, induce cancer cell apoptosis by altering the expression of BCL2 family proteins. Therefore, in the present study, we assessed whether BCL2 family proteins mediated the cytotoxic effects of amsacrine on human leukemia U937 cells. Amsacrine-induced apoptosis of U937 cells was characterized by caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, mitochondrial depolarization, and MCL1 down-regulation. Amsacrine induced MCL1 down-regulation by decreasing its stability. Further, amsacrine-treated U937 cells showed AKT degradation and Ca(2+)-mediated ERK inactivation. Blockade of ERK-mediated phosphorylation of MCL1 inhibited the effect of Pin1 on the stabilization of MCL1, and AKT degradation promoted GSK3beta-mediated degradation of MCL1. Restoration of ERK phosphorylation and AKT expression abrogated amsacrine-induced MCL1 down-regulation. Moreover, MCL1 over-expression inhibited amsacrine-induced depolarization of mitochondria membrane and increased the viability of amsacrine-treated cells. Taken together, our data indicate that amsacrine abolishes ERK- and Pin1-mediated stabilization of MCL1 and promotes GSK3beta-mediated degradation of MCL1, leading to activate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway in U937 cells.",,"['Lee, Yuan-Chin', 'Chen, Ying-Jung', 'Huang, Chia-Hui', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Lee YC', 'Chen YJ', 'Huang CH', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan. lschang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, 807, Taiwan. lschang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'Amsacrine', 'ERK', 'GSK3beta', 'Leukemia cells', 'MCL1 stability']",2016/10/21 06:00,2018/03/07 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10495-016-1307-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s10495-016-1307-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2017 Mar;22(3):406-420. doi: 10.1007/s10495-016-1307-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of selective and potent BET (bromo and extra-terminal) inhibitors and their significant activity in diverse tumor models have rapidly translated into clinical studies and have motivated drug development efforts targeting non-BET BRDs. However, the complex multidomain/subunit architecture of BRD protein complexes complicates predictions of the consequences of their pharmacological targeting. To address this issue, we developed a promiscuous BRD inhibitor [bromosporine (BSP)] that broadly targets BRDs (including BETs) with nanomolar affinity, creating a tool for the identification of cellular processes and diseases where BRDs have a regulatory function. As a proof of principle, we studied the effects of BSP on leukemic cell lines known to be sensitive to BET inhibition and found, as expected, strong antiproliferative activity. Comparison of the modulation of transcriptional profiles by BSP after a short exposure to the inhibitor resulted in a BET inhibitor signature but no significant additional changes in transcription that could account for inhibition of other BRDs.

Native unmodified monoclonal antibody therapies, while promising, are inadequately effective for these malignancies, and multiple mechanisms for failure have been described. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis is the primary modality of mAb-mediated cell killing in vivo, but ultimately leads to relapse of the leukemias, in model systems and in humans. By use of a T-cell receptor mimic mAb ESKM, derived against a WT1 peptide expressed in complex with HLA-A*02:01, whose only mechanism of therapeutic action is ADCC, we evaluated the mechanisms of leukemic relapse from its potent therapeutic action in mouse xenograft models of human leukemia. Leukemia escape was not associated with loss of the antigenic target, downregulation of cell surface HLA, antibody pharmacokinetic or biodistribution issues, or development of leukemia cell-intrinsic resistance to ADCC. Interestingly, the rapidity of leukemic growth determined whether leukemia was able to evade cytotoxicity independent of the presence of sufficient effector cells. By engineering leukemia cells with upregulated p27(Kip1) and slower cell cycling times, we show that relapse was inversely correlated with growth rates resulting in the eventual inadequacy of effector to target ratio. Moreover, lack of migration of effector cells into lymphomatous pockets of ALL also allowed local escape. Successful leukemia therapy with mAb might therefore be improved in similar situations by combination with measures to reduce burden and slow leukemia cell growth.",,"['Dubrovsky, Leonid', 'Brea, Elliott Joseph', 'Pankov, Dmitry', 'Casey, Emily', 'Dao, Tao', 'Liu, Cheng', 'Scheinberg, David A']","['Dubrovsky L', 'Brea EJ', 'Pankov D', 'Casey E', 'Dao T', 'Liu C', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA; Immunology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute , New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute , New York, NY, USA.', 'Eureka Therapeutics , Emeryville, CA, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA; Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160803,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ADCC', '*Leukemia', '*T-cell receptor mimicking', '*antibody', '*escape mechanisms']",2016/10/21 06:00,2016/10/21 06:01,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/21 06:01 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2016.1211221 [doi]', '1211221 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2016 Aug 3;5(9):e1211221. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2016.1211221. eCollection 2016.,,"['R01 CA055349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA062948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007739/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5048777,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanistically, MTE enhanced PTEN (phosphatases and tensin homolog) level and inactivated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in Jurkat cells, which mediated the inhibition of cell proliferation by MTE and MTE-induced apoptosis. Finally, MTE significantly inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of lymphocytes from T-ALL patients, compared with lymphocytes from healthy peoples. Taken together, these results reveal an unrecognized function of MTE in inhibiting the proliferation and inducing the apoptosis of T-ALL cells, and identify a pathway of PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR for the effects of MTE on leukemia therapy.",,"['Wang, Ying', 'Chen, Bingyu', 'Wang, Zhen', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Hao, Ke', 'Chen, Yu', 'Li, Kaiqiang', 'Wang, Tongtong', 'Xie, Yiwei', 'Huang, Zhihui', 'Tong, Xiangmin']","['Wang Y', 'Chen B', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang W', 'Hao K', 'Chen Y', 'Li K', 'Wang T', 'Xie Y', 'Huang Z', 'Tong X']","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China.', ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310014, China."", ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310014, China."", ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310014, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, 310014, China."", ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310014, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, 310014, China."", ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310014, China."", ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, 310014, China."", ""Department of Blood Transfusion, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310014, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China.', 'Institute of Neuroscience and Hypoxia Medicine, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, China.', ""Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, 310014, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Marsdenia/chemistry', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['Marsdenia tenacissimae extraction', 'PTEN', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'proliferation']",2016/10/21 06:00,2018/02/22 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['12654 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.12654 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Dec 13;7(50):82851-82863. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.12654.,,,PMC5347737,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UK Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia Forum collected data from UK/Ireland patients with a minimum of 1 year follow-up with pre-planned primary endpoints; the number of patients still on therapy at 1 year ""discontinuation-free survival"" and 1 year overall survival. With a median of 16 months follow up, data on 315 patients demonstrated a 1 year discontinuation-free survival of 73.7% and a 1 year overall survival of 83.8%. Patients with better pre-treatment performance status (0/1 vs. 2+) had superior discontinuation-free survival (77.5% vs. 61.3%; P<0.0001) and overall survival (86.3% vs. 76.0%; P=0.0001). In univariable analysis, overall survival and discontinuation-free survival were not associated with the number of prior lines of therapy or 17p deletion. However, multivariable analysis identified an interaction between prior lines of therapy, age and 17p deletion, suggesting that older patients with 17p deletion did worse when treated with ibrutinib beyond the second line. Overall, 55.6% of patients had no first year dose reductions or treatment breaks of >14 days and had an overall survival rate of 89.7%, while 26% of patients had dose reductions and 13% had temporary treatment breaks of >14 days. We could not demonstrate a detrimental effect of dose reductions alone (1 year overall survival: 91.7%), but patients who had first year treatment breaks of >14 days, particularly permanent cessation of ibrutinib had both reduced 1 year overall survival (68.5%), and also a statistically significant excess mortality rate beyond one year. Although outcomes appear inferior to the RESONATE trial (1 year overall survival; 90%: progression-free survival; 84%), this may partly reflect the inclusion of performance status 2+ patients, and that 17.5% of patients permanently discontinued ibrutinib due to an event other than disease progression.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20161018,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ireland', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom']",,,2016/10/21 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.147900 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.147900 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Dec;101(12):1563-1572. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.147900.

To systematically characterize AML's genetic dependencies, we conducted genome-scale short hairpin RNA screens in 17 AML cell lines and analyzed dependencies relative to parallel screens in 199 cell lines of other cancer types. We identified 353 genes specifically required for AML cell proliferation. To validate the in vivo relevance of genetic dependencies observed in human cell lines, we performed a secondary screen in a syngeneic murine AML model driven by the MLL-AF9 oncogenic fusion protein. Integrating the results of these interference RNA screens and additional gene expression data, we identified the transcription factor ZEB2 as a novel AML dependency. ZEB2 depletion impaired the proliferation of both human and mouse AML cells and resulted in aberrant differentiation of human AML cells. Mechanistically, we showed that ZEB2 transcriptionally represses genes that regulate myeloid differentiation, including genes involved in cell adhesion and migration. In addition, we found that epigenetic silencing of the miR-200 family microRNAs affects ZEB2 expression.

Bone marrow transplantation is currently the only curative therapy for the hematopoietic complications of this disorder. However, long-term morbidity and mortality remain very high, and new therapeutics are badly needed. Here we show that the widely used diabetes drug metformin improves hematopoiesis and delays tumor formation in Fancd2(-/-) mice. Metformin is the first compound reported to improve both of these FA phenotypes. Importantly, the beneficial effects are specific to FA mice and are not seen in the wild-type controls. In this preclinical model of FA, metformin outperformed the current standard of care, oxymetholone, by improving peripheral blood counts in Fancd2(-/-) mice significantly faster. Metformin increased the size of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and enhanced quiescence in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. In tumor-prone Fancd2(-/-)Trp53(+/-) mice, metformin delayed the onset of tumors and significantly extended the tumor-free survival time. In addition, we found that metformin and the structurally related compound aminoguanidine reduced DNA damage and ameliorated spontaneous chromosome breakage and radials in human FA patient-derived cells.

Although BTK inhibitors have transformed therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), patients with high-risk genetics are at risk for relapse and have a poor prognosis. Identification of novel therapeutic strategies for this group of patients is an urgent unmet clinical need, and therapies that target BTK via alternative mechanisms may fill this niche. Herein, we identify a set of microRNAs (miRs) that target BTK in primary CLL cells and show that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) repressor complex is recruited to these miR promoters to silence their expression. Targeting the HDACs by using either RNA interference against HDAC1 in CLL or a small molecule inhibitor (HDACi) in CLL and mantle cell lymphoma restored the expression of the BTK-targeting miRs with loss of BTK protein and downstream signaling and consequent cell death. We have also made the novel and clinically relevant discovery that inhibition of HDAC induces the BTK-targeting miRs in ibrutinib-sensitive and resistant CLL to effectively reduce both wild-type and C481S-mutant BTK. This finding identifies a novel strategy that may be promising as a therapeutic modality to eliminate the C481S-mutant BTK clone that drives resistance to ibrutinib and provides the rationale for a combination strategy that includes ibrutinib to dually target BTK to suppress its prosurvival signaling.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Bottoni, Arianna', 'Rizzotto, Lara', 'Lai, Tzung-Huei', 'Liu, Chaomei', 'Smith, Lisa L', 'Mantel, Rose', 'Reiff, Sean', 'El-Gamal, Dalia', 'Larkin, Karilyn', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Plunkett, William', 'Byrd, John C', 'Blachly, James S', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Sampath, Deepa']","['Bottoni A', 'Rizzotto L', 'Lai TH', 'Liu C', 'Smith LL', 'Mantel R', 'Reiff S', 'El-Gamal D', 'Larkin K', 'Johnson AJ', 'Lapalombella R', 'Lehman A', 'Plunkett W', 'Byrd JC', 'Blachly JS', 'Woyach JA', 'Sampath D']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161017,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)', 'IYO470654U (abexinostat)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Benzofurans/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Piperidines', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,,2016/10/21 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33854-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-07-727750 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Dec 29;128(26):3101-3112. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-07-727750.

The objective of this analysis was to estimate phase-specific, 5-year and lifetime net costs for the 21 most prevalent cancer sites, and remaining tumour sites combined, in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We selected all adult patients diagnosed with a primary cancer between 1997 and 2007, with valid ICD-O site and histology codes, and who survived 30 days or more after diagnosis, from the Ontario Cancer Registry (N = 394,092). Patients were linked to treatment data from Cancer Care Ontario and administrative health care databases at the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences. Net costs (i.e., cost difference between patients and matched non-cancer control subjects) were estimated by phase of care and sex, and used to estimate 5-year and lifetime costs. RESULTS: Mean net costs of care (2009 CAD) were highest in the initial (6 months post-diagnosis) and terminal (12 months pre-death) phases, and lowest in the (3 months) pre-diagnosis and continuing phases of care. Phase-specific net costs were generally lowest for melanoma and highest for brain cancer. Mean 5-year net costs varied from less than $25,000 for melanoma, thyroid and testicular cancers to more than $60,000 for multiple myeloma and leukemia. Lifetime costs ranged from less than $55,000 for lung and liver cancers to over $110,000 for leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma and breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Costs of cancer care are substantial and vary by cancer site, phase of care and time horizon analyzed. These cost estimates are valuable to decision makers to understand the economic burden of cancer care and may be useful inputs to researchers undertaking cancer-related economic evaluations.",,"['de Oliveira, Claire', 'Pataky, Reka', 'Bremner, Karen E', 'Rangrej, Jagadish', 'Chan, Kelvin K W', 'Cheung, Winson Y', 'Hoch, Jeffrey S', 'Peacock, Stuart', 'Krahn, Murray D']","['de Oliveira C', 'Pataky R', 'Bremner KE', 'Rangrej J', 'Chan KK', 'Cheung WY', 'Hoch JS', 'Peacock S', 'Krahn MD']","['Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 33 Russell Street, Room T414, Toronto, ON, M5S 2S1, Canada. claire.deoliveira@camh.ca.', 'Canadian Centre for Applied Research in Cancer Control, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 675 W 10th Ave., Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network, 200 Elizabeth Street, Room EN13-222A, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, G1 72, 2075 Bayview Avenue, Toronto, ON, M4N 3M5, Canada.', 'Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, 2075 Bayview Ave., Room T2 58, Toronto, ON, M4N 3M5, Canada.', 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, 600 W. 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 4E6, Canada.', 'University of California Davis, 2315 Stockton Blvd., Sacramento, CA, 95817, USA.', 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, 675 W 10th Ave., Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.', 'Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative, 144 College Street, Rm 600, Toronto, ON, M5S 3M2, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161018,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', '*Cost of Illness', 'Female', '*Health Care Costs', 'Health Services/*economics/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Economic', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Ontario', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Administrative data', '*Cancer', '*Cost and cost analysis', '*Health care costs', '*Neoplasms']",2016/10/21 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/s12885-016-2835-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-016-2835-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2016 Oct 18;16(1):809. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2835-7.,,,PMC5070134,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous genetic studies demonstrated that chemoresistant ALL is driven by activating mutations in NT5C2, the gene encoding cytosolic 5 -nucleotidase (cN-II). However, molecular mechanisms underlying this hyperactivation are still unknown. Here, we present kinetic and structural properties of cN-II variants that represent 75 % of mutated alleles in patients who experience relapsed ALL (R367Q, R238W and L375F). RESULTS: Enzyme kinetics measurements revealed that the mutants are consitutively active without need for allosteric activators. This shows that hyperactivity is not caused by a direct catalytic effect but rather by misregulation of cN-II. X-ray crystallography combined with mass spectrometry-based techniques demonstrated that this misregulation is driven by structural modulation of the oligomeric interface within the cN-II homotetrameric assembly. These specific conformational changes are shared between the studied variants, despite the relatively random spatial distribution of the mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings define a common molecular mechanism for cN-II hyperactivity, which provides a solid basis for targeted therapy of leukemia. Our study highlights the cN-II oligomerization interface as an attractive pharmacological target.",,"['Hnizda, Ales', 'Skerlova, Jana', 'Fabry, Milan', 'Pachl, Petr', 'Sinalova, Martina', 'Vrzal, Lukas', 'Man, Petr', 'Novak, Petr', 'Rezacova, Pavlina', 'Veverka, Vaclav']","['Hnizda A', 'Skerlova J', 'Fabry M', 'Pachl P', 'Sinalova M', 'Vrzal L', 'Man P', 'Novak P', 'Rezacova P', 'Veverka V']","['Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Flemingovo nam. 2, Prague 6, 166 10, Czech Republic. hnizda@uochb.cas.cz.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Flemingovo nam. 2, Prague 6, 166 10, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, Prague 4, 142 20, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Flemingovo nam. 2, Prague 6, 166 10, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Flemingovo nam. 2, Prague 6, 166 10, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Flemingovo nam. 2, Prague 6, 166 10, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, Prague 4, 142 20, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, Prague 4, 142 20, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Flemingovo nam. 2, Prague 6, 166 10, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, Prague 4, 142 20, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Flemingovo nam. 2, Prague 6, 166 10, Czech Republic. veverka@uochb.cas.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161019,England,BMC Biol,BMC biology,101190720,"[""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.1.3.5 (NT5C2 protein, human)']",IM,,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*genetics/metabolism"", 'Alleles', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recurrence']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Allosteric regulation', '*Cancer mutations', '*Nucleotidase', '*Purine metabolism', '*Relapsed ALL']",2016/10/21 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2016/10/21 06:00'],"['2016/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/s12915-016-0313-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12915-016-0313-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Biol. 2016 Oct 19;14(1):91. doi: 10.1186/s12915-016-0313-y.,,,PMC5070119,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapy in PV and ET focuses on minimizing thrombosis and bleeding risk, while in MF, prolongation of survival is an important goal. Different cytoreductive agents are employed in high risk PV and ET, while the JAK inhibtior ruxolitinib is the cornerstone of therapy in MF. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are pleiotropic agents with diverse epigenetic and non-epigenetic actions, selectively in transformed cells. A number of HDACi have been or are being investigated in MPN. Areas covered: The mechanisms of action of HDACI in neoplastic cells are summarized, and the preclinical rationale and data supporting their development in MPN specifically examined, particularly their synergism with JAK inhibitors. Major findings of clinical trials of HDACi, both alone and in combination with ruxolitinib, in MPN are then discussed, with particular attention to their toxicities and disease-modifying effects. Expert opinion: HDACi are clearly active in MPN, and there is good preclinical rationale for this. Their combination with ruxolitinib in MF is promising, but the long-term tolerability of these agents is an important concern.

The clinical manifestations of PMF include splenomegaly, consequent to extramedullary hematopoiesis, pancytopenias, and an array of potentially debilitating constitutional symptoms. The diagnosis is based on bone marrow morphology and clinical criteria. Mutations in the JAK2 (V617F), MPL (W515), and CALR (exon 9 indel) genes are found in approximately 90% of patients whereas the remaining 10% are so-called triple negatives. Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway results in overproduction of abnormal megakaryocytes leading to bone marrow fibrosis. These mutations might be accompanied by other mutations, such as ASXL1. The commonly used prognostication scoring for PMF is based on the International Prognostic Scoring System. The subsequently developed Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System-plus employs clinical as well as cytogenetic variables. In PMF, CALR mutation is associated with superior survival and ASXL1 with inferior outcome. Patients with triple-negative PMF have a higher incidence of leukemic transformation and lower overall survival compared with CALR- or JAK2-mutant patients. The impact of genetic lesions on survival is independent of current prognostic scoring systems. These observations indicate that driver and passenger mutations define distinct disease entities within PMF. Accounting for them is not only relevant to clinical decision-making, but should also be considered in designing clinical trials.","['(c) 2016 S.

Western blot was used to determine the level of caspase-3, PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase), CDK4 and CyclinD1. Knockdown of PPP5C suppressed the proliferation ability of U937 cells, and led to G0/G1 phase arrest, inducing cell apoptosis in U937 cells. The apoptosis of the U937 cells was associated with upregulating cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, and downregulating CDK4 and CyclinD1. In conclusions, PPP5C knockdown inhibits U937 cell proliferation and might be used as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemia.",,"['Li, G-Y', 'Liu, J-Z', 'Zhang, L', 'Li, S-J', 'Liu, G-Z', 'Xiao, T-W', 'Wang, J-X', 'Wang, L-X', 'Hou, M']","['Li GY', 'Liu JZ', 'Zhang L', 'Li SJ', 'Liu GZ', 'Xiao TW', 'Wang JX', 'Wang LX', 'Hou M']","['Qilu Hospital of Shandong University Department of Hematology Shandong China.', ""Liaocheng People's Hospital Department of Hematology Liaocheng China."", ""Liaocheng People's Hospital Department of Hematology Liaocheng China."", ""Liaocheng People's Hospital Department of Hematology Liaocheng China."", ""Liaocheng People's Hospital Department of Hematology Liaocheng China."", ""Liaocheng People's Hospital Department of Hematology Liaocheng China."", ""Liaocheng People's Hospital Department of Hematology Liaocheng China."", 'Charles Sturt University School of Biomedical Sciences Wagga Wagga Australia lwang@csu.edu.au.', 'Qilu Hospital of Shandong University Department of Hematology Shandong China houming@medmail.com.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160930,France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (protein phosphatase 5)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells']",,,2016/10/19 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/10/19 06:00'],"['2016/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']",,epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2016 Sep 30;62(11):27-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S. frigida Boiss extracts exhibited obvious inhibitory effects on the growth of cancer cells and induced apoptosis. It is suggested that the extracts exert their anti-proliferative effect through multiple implications such as suppressing growth, arresting the cell cycle, increased DNA fragmentation, downregulation of the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and myeloid cell Leukemia-1, and upregulation of pro-apoptotic messenger RNAs like caspase-3 and caspase-9.

Cardiotoxicity has become a significant problem, and the risks of adverse cardiac events induced by systemic drugs need to be seriously considered. Potential cardiovascular toxicities linked to anticancer agents include arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia and infarction, hypertension, thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure. It has been shown that several anticancer drugs seriously affect the cardiovascular system, such as ErbB2 inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, multitargeted kinase inhibitors, Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog inhibitors, and others. Each of these agents has a different mechanism through which it affects the cardiovascular system. ErbB2 inhibitors block the ErbB4/ErbB2 heterodimerization pathway triggered by Neuregulin-1, which is essential for cardiomyocyte survival. VEGF signaling is crucial for vascular growth, but it also has a major impact on myocardial function, and the VEGF pathway is also essential for maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. Drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway lead to a net reduction in capillary density and loss of contractile function. Here, we review the mechanisms and pathophysiology of the most significant cardiotoxic effects of ErbB2 inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs. Moreover, we highlight the role of cardioncology in recognizing these toxicities, developing strategies to prevent or minimize cardiovascular toxicity, and reducing long-term cardiotoxic effects.",,"['Maurea, Nicola', 'Coppola, Carmela', 'Piscopo, Giovanna', 'Galletta, Francesca', 'Riccio, Gennaro', 'Esposito, Emanuela', 'De Lorenzo, Claudia', 'De Laurentiis, Michelino', 'Spallarossa, Paolo', 'Mercuro, Giuseppe']","['Maurea N', 'Coppola C', 'Piscopo G', 'Galletta F', 'Riccio G', 'Esposito E', 'De Lorenzo C', 'De Laurentiis M', 'Spallarossa P', 'Mercuro G']","[""aDivision of Cardiology, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumor 'Fondazione Giovanni Pascale' - IRCCS bCEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate S.C.A.R.L cDepartment of Breast Surgery and Cancer Prevention, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori 'Fondazione Giovanni Pascale' - IRCCS dDepartment of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology, University 'Federico II' eDepartment of Senology, Division of Breast Oncology Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori 'Fondazione Giovanni Pascale' - IRCCS, Naples fClinic of Cardiovascular Diseases, IRCCS San Martino IST, Genoa gDepartment of Medical Sciences 'Mario Aresu', University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),"Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",101259752,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",IM,,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cardiotoxicity/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Heart/physiopathology', 'Heart Failure/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trastuzumab/*adverse effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/chemically induced']",,,2016/10/19 06:00,2017/03/23 06:00,['2016/10/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.2459/JCM.0000000000000377 [doi]', '01244665-201605001-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown). 2016 May;17 Suppl 1 Special issue on Cardiotoxicity from Antiblastic Drugs and Cardioprotection:e19-e26. doi: 10.2459/JCM.0000000000000377.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because aberrant lipid metabolism is a pathogenic feature of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), our objective was to determine if CLL patients have a higher prevalence of MetS preceding diagnosis and to determine the impact of lipid-lowering medications on survival. Methods: We conducted a population-based case-control study in Ontario, Canada, using administrative databases of adults age 66 years and older to compare the prevalence of MetS preceding CLL with age- and sex-matched control subjects. Logistic regression was used to study the association between MetS and its components to CLL. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox Regression were used to investigate survival. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We identified 2124 persons with CLL and 7935 control subjects from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2005, with follow-up until March 31, 2014, three years from the date of last contact with the health care system, or death. The mean age was 75.6 years, 20.2% had diabetes, 35.8% had hypertension, and 17.6% had dyslipidemia. In multivariable analysis, dyslipidemia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.44, P < .001) and hypertension (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.25, P = .03) were associated with the development of CLL, whereas MetS and diabetes were not. Lipid-lowering medication was associated with a statistically significant improved survival in patients with CLL (HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.47 to 0.61, P < .001). Conclusions: We demonstrate a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia preceding a diagnosis of CLL compared with control subjects, supporting preclinical data. Lipid-lowering medications appear to confer a survival advantage in CLL. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results and test their potential as therapeutic applications.","['(c) The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.

The N-hydroxyl group of this motif is highly subject to sulfation/glucoronidation-based inactivation in humans; compounds containing this motif require much higher dosing in clinic to achieve therapeutic concentrations. With the goal of developing a second generation of HDAC inhibitors lacking this hydroxamate, we designed a series of potent and selective class I HDAC inhibitors using a hydrazide motif. These inhibitors are impervious to glucuronidation and demonstrate allosteric inhibition. In vitro and ex vivo characterization of our lead analogues' efficacy, selectivity, and toxicity profiles demonstrate that they possess low nanomolar activity against models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are at least 100-fold more selective for AML than solid immortalized cells such as HEK293 or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",,"['McClure, Jesse J', 'Zhang, Cheng', 'Inks, Elizabeth S', 'Peterson, Yuri K', 'Li, Jiaying', 'Chou, C James']","['McClure JJ', 'Zhang C', 'Inks ES', 'Peterson YK', 'Li J', 'Chou CJ']","['Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, South Carolina, 280 Calhoun Stret, MSC140 QF307, 29425, United States.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, South Carolina, 280 Calhoun Stret, MSC140 QF307, 29425, United States.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, South Carolina, 280 Calhoun Stret, MSC140 QF307, 29425, United States.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, South Carolina, 280 Calhoun Stret, MSC140 QF307, 29425, United States.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, South Carolina, 280 Calhoun Stret, MSC140 QF307, 29425, United States.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston, South Carolina, 280 Calhoun Stret, MSC140 QF307, 29425, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20161026,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydrazones)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,,"['Allosteric Regulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2016/10/19 06:00,2017/06/09 06:00,['2016/10/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01385 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2016 Nov 10;59(21):9942-9959. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01385.

Antigen intensities on bone marrow cells are invariant between individuals.,987-996,10.1002/cyto.a.22999 [doi],"Five reference populations in bone marrow specimens were identified by flow cytometry using specific combinations of reagents in order define the variation of gene product expression intensities both within and between individuals. Mature lymphocytes, uncommitted progenitor cells, promyelocytes, mature monocytes and mature neutrophils can be reproducibly identified as distinct clusters of events in heterogeneous, maturing bone marrow specimens. Support Vector Machines were used to identify the reference populations in order to reduce subjective bias in manually defining boundaries of these populations since they were not discretely separated from the remainder of the cells. Reference populations were identified in 50 randomly selected bone marrow aspirates obtained over a period spanning 3 years and 6 months from pediatric patients following chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The quantitative expression of gene products (cell surface antigens) and light scattering characteristics on these stressed specimens were demonstrated to be tightly regulated both within individuals and between individuals. Within an individual most gene products (CD45, CD34, CD14, CD16, CD64, CD33) demonstrated limited variability with a standard deviation of <0.20 log units while CD13 and CD36 exhibited broader variation >0.25 log units. Surprisingly, with the exception of CD33, the variation of the mean intensities of each antigen between individuals was even less than the variation within an individual. These data confirm that the amounts of gene products expressed on normal developing cells are highly regulated but differ in intensities between different lineages and during the maturational pathway of those lineages. The amounts of gene products expressed at specific stages of development of each lineage are a biologic constant with minimal variation within or between individuals. (c) 2016 The Authors.

The data demonstrated that P-Asp has an enhanced anti-proliferative effect on ALL cells as detected by the WST-8 cell viability assay kit. Cells treated with P-Asp also exhibited a higher degree of early apoptosis compared with asparaginase from Escherichia coli (L-Asp) or its pegylated form Pegasparagas (PEG-ASP) that induced higher rates of late apoptosis and necrosis as detected by an Annexin V/Propidium iodide binding assay. In-vivo experiments indicated that mice treated with P-Asp had less distinct allergenic responses than other bacterial enzyme preparations as indicated by lower serum concentrations of IgG, IgE, IgM and mMCP-1 compared with other treated groups.

This analysis set out to investigate the morbidity and mortality of VZV vaccination without interruption of maintenance therapy in children with ALL. METHODS: Files of 73 seronegative children with ALL were examined for data regarding VZV vaccination and infection, and long-term seroconversion was measured. Criteria before VZV vaccination were (1) seronegative, (2) in complete remission, (3) age >/= 1.0 year, (4) lymphocyte count >/= 0.6 x 10/L at time of vaccination and (5) receiving maintenance therapy. RESULTS: Forty-five children were vaccinated. No child died or experienced serious adverse events due to VZV vaccination. Nine children developed late chickenpox despite vaccination. Long-term protection was found in 86% of children not receiving acyclovir and 78% of the entire population. Long-term seroconversion was found in 52% of the children. There were no severe cases of varicella infection. Acyclovir prophylaxis postvaccination was associated with an increased risk of late chickenpox [hazard ratio = 5.40 (1.43, 20.41), P = 0.01]. In contrast, a vaccine-induced rash reduced the risk of late chickenpox [hazard ratio = 0.08 (0.01, 0.66), P = 0.02]. No child had interruption of maintenance therapy at the time of vaccination, but 33% experienced discontinuation of therapy due to vaccine-induced rash. Dexamethasone was associated with an increased risk of vaccine-induced rash [hazard ratio = 2.9 (1.21, 6.90), P = 0.02]. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicates that VZV vaccination is feasible and justified in seronegative children with ALL, in countries where VZV vaccination is not part of the national vaccination program.",,"['Smedegaard, Lotte Moller', 'Poulsen, Anja', 'Kristensen, Ines Ackerl', 'Rosthoj, Susanne', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Nygaard, Ulrikka']","['Smedegaard LM', 'Poulsen A', 'Kristensen IA', 'Rosthoj S', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Nygaard U']","['From the *Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark; daggerGreat Ormond Street Hospital, London, England; double daggerSection of Biostatistics, Institute of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Denmark; and section signInstitute of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Chickenpox/prevention & control', 'Chickenpox Vaccine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vaccination/*statistics & numerical data']",,,2016/10/19 06:00,2017/06/13 06:00,['2016/10/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/INF.0000000000001279 [doi]', '00006454-201611000-00017 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2016 Nov;35(11):e348-e352. doi: 10.1097/INF.0000000000001279.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Peninsula Technology Assessment Group was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence contained within the company's submission to NICE. The clinical effectiveness data used in the company's economic analysis were derived from a single randomised controlled trial, AZA-AML-001. It was an international, multicentre, controlled, phase III study with an open-label, parallel-group design conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of azacitidine against a conventional care regimen (CCR). The CCR was a composite comparator of acute myeloid leukaemia treatments currently available in the National Health Service: intensive chemotherapy followed by best supportive care (BSC) upon disease relapse or progression, non-intensive chemotherapy followed by BSC and BSC only. In AZA-AML-001, the primary endpoint was overall survival. Azacitidine appeared to be superior to the CCR, with median overall survival of 10.4 and 6.5 months, respectively. However, in the intention-to-treat analysis, the survival advantage associated with azacitidine was not statistically significant. The company submitted a de novo economic evaluation based on a partitioned survival model with four health states: ""Remission"", ""Non-remission"", ""Relapse/Progressive disease"" and ""Death"". The model time horizon was 10 years. The perspective was the National Health Service and Personal Social Services. Costs and health effects were discounted at the rate of 3.5 % per year. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of azacitidine compared with the CCR was pound20,648 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was pound17,423 per QALY. At the willingness-to-pay of pound20,000, pound30,000 and pound50,000 per QALY, the probability of azacitidine being cost effective was 0.699, 0.908 and 0.996, respectively. The ERG identified a number of errors in Celgene's model and concluded that the results of the company's economic evaluation could not be considered robust. After amendments to Celgene's model, the base-case ICER was pound273,308 per QALY gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was pound277,123 per QALY. At a willingness-to-pay of pound100,000 per QALY, the probability of azacitidine being cost effective was less than 5 %. In all exploratory analyses conducted by the ERG, the ICER exceeded the NICE's cost-effectiveness threshold range of pound20,000-30,000 per QALY. Given the evidence provided in the submission, azacitidine did not fulfil NICE's end-of-life criteria. After considering the analyses performed by the ERG and submissions from clinician and patient experts, the NICE Appraisal Committee did not recommend azacitidine for this indication.",,"['Tikhonova, Irina A', 'Hoyle, Martin W', 'Snowsill, Tristan M', 'Cooper, Chris', 'Varley-Campbell, Joanna L', 'Rudin, Claudius E', 'Mujica Mota, Ruben E']","['Tikhonova IA', 'Hoyle MW', 'Snowsill TM', 'Cooper C', 'Varley-Campbell JL', 'Rudin CE', 'Mujica Mota RE']","[""Peninsula Technology Assessment Group, South Cloisters, Room 3.09, St Luke's Campus, Heavitree Road, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK.

B cell-specific TRAF3 deficiency results in enhanced viability and is associated with development of lymphoma and multiple myeloma. We show that TRAF3 deficiency led to induction of two proteins important for glucose metabolism, Glut1 and Hexokinase 2 (HXK2). This was associated with increased glucose uptake. In the absence of TRAF3, anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation were increased in B cells without changes in mitochondrial mass or reactive oxygen species. Chemical inhibition of glucose metabolism or glucose deprivation substantially attenuated the enhanced survival of TRAF3-deficient B cells, with a decrease in the pro-survival protein Mcl-1. Changes in Glut1 and Mcl-1 levels, glucose uptake and B cell number in the absence of TRAF3 were all dependent upon NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK). These results indicate that TRAF3 deficiency suffices to metabolically reprogram B cells, a finding that improves our understanding of the role of TRAF3 as a tumor suppressor, and suggests potential therapeutic strategies.",,"['Mambetsariev, Nurbek', 'Lin, Wai W', 'Wallis, Alicia M', 'Stunz, Laura L', 'Bishop, Gail A']","['Mambetsariev N', 'Lin WW', 'Wallis AM', 'Stunz LL', 'Bishop GA']","['Dept. of Microbiology, The University of Iowa, 3-403 Bowen Science Building, 51 Newton Road, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, The University of Iowa, Carver College of Medicine, 2206 MERF, Iowa City, IA 52242-2600, USA.', 'Immunology Graduate Program, 357 Medical Research Center, Iowa City, IA 52242-1182, USA.', 'Dept. of Microbiology, The University of Iowa, 3-403 Bowen Science Building, 51 Newton Road, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Immunology Graduate Program, 357 Medical Research Center, Iowa City, IA 52242-1182, USA.', 'Dept. of Microbiology, The University of Iowa, 3-403 Bowen Science Building, 51 Newton Road, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Immunology Graduate Program, 357 Medical Research Center, Iowa City, IA 52242-1182, USA.', 'Dept. of Microbiology, The University of Iowa, 3-403 Bowen Science Building, 51 Newton Road, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, 200 Hawkins Drive, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Dept. of Microbiology, The University of Iowa, 3-403 Bowen Science Building, 51 Newton Road, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, The University of Iowa, Carver College of Medicine, 2206 MERF, Iowa City, IA 52242-2600, USA.', 'Immunology Graduate Program, 357 Medical Research Center, Iowa City, IA 52242-1182, USA.', 'Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, 200 Hawkins Drive, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.', 'University of Iowa and DVA Medical Center, 601 Highway 6 West, Iowa City, IA 52246, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, 200 Hawkins Drive, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20161018,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Slc2a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (hexokinase 2, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cellular Reprogramming/genetics', 'Glucose/genetics/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Hexokinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/10/19 06:00,2018/05/10 06:00,['2016/10/19 06:00'],"['2016/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['srep35349 [pii]', '10.1038/srep35349 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Oct 18;6:35349. doi: 10.1038/srep35349.,,"['T32 AI007485/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES005605/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA099997/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI028847/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 BX001702/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI028847/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007337/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5082756,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted to determine a useful scoring system to predict the prognosis of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and identify the probable factors that affect the scoring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. The predictive ability of EUTOS and the factors that affect scoring were analyzed in 234 Chinese chronic-phase CML patients treated with frontline imatinib, including a few patients temporarily administered hydroxyurea for cytoreduction before imatinib. Patients were stratified into different risk groups according to each scoring system to assess the treatment outcomes and the predictive ability of EUTOS scores between patients who received imatinib during the entire follow-up period and patients who received altered treatment because of intolerance, progression, and treatment failure. RESULTS: Sixty-one (26.0%) patients received altered treatments during the follow-up. In the EUTOS low- and high-risk groups, the 5-year overall survival was 94.6% and 84.7% (p=0.011), 5-year event-free survival was 92.6% and 77.6% (p=0.001), and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 95.3% and 82.4% (p=0.001), respectively. The predictive ability of EUTOS was better than that of the Sokal and Hasford scores (p=0.256, p=0.062, p=0.073) without statistical significance. All three scoring systems were valid in predicting early optimal response. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a high association between overall PFS and the EUTOS scores in the standard-dose imatinib group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the EUTOS scoring system could predict the outcome of chronic-phase CML patients treated with standard-dose imatinib. Altered treatment is a crucial factor that affects the prognostic impact of EUTOS scoring. Achieving complete cytogenetic response at 18 months is an essential factor in predicting the prognosis of patients with CML.",,"['Huang, Jing', 'Wang, Leyan', 'Chen, Lu', 'Qun, He', 'Yajing, Xu', 'Fangping, Chen', 'Xielan, Zhao']","['Huang J', 'Wang L', 'Chen L', 'Qun H', 'Yajing X', 'Fangping C', 'Xielan Z']","['Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Department of Hematology, Changsha, China Phone: +8673184896157 E-mail: zhaoxuelan@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161018,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*therapeutic use', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/10/19 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2016/10/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4274/tjh.2016.0156 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2017 Mar 1;34(1):10-15. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2016.0156.

We have previously demonstrated that developmental exposure to a low level of arsenic (50ppb) alters epigenetic processes that underlie deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis leading to aberrant behavior. It is unclear if arsenic impacts the programming and regulation of embryonic neurogenesis during development when exposure occurs. The master negative regulator of neural-lineage, REST/NRSF, controls the precise timing of fate specification and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs). Early in development (embryonic day 14), we observed increased expression of Rest, its co-repressor, CoREST, and the inhibitory RNA binding/splicing protein, Ptbp1, and altered expression of mRNA spliced isoforms of Pbx1 that are directly regulated by these factors in the male brain in response to prenatal 50ppb arsenic exposure. These increases were concurrent with decreased expression of microRNA-9 (miR-9), miR-9*, and miR-124, all of which are REST/NRSF targets and inversely regulate Rest expression to allow for maturation of NSCs. Exposure to arsenic decreased the formation of neuroblasts in vitro from NSCs derived from male pup brains. The female response to arsenic was limited to increased expression of CoREST and Ptbp2, an RNA binding protein that allows for appropriate splicing of genes involved in the progression of neurogenesis. These changes were accompanied by increased neuroblast formation in vitro from NSCs derived from female pups. Unexposed male mice express transcriptomic factors to induce differentiation earlier in development compared to unexposed females. Thus, arsenic exposure likely delays differentiation of NSCs in males while potentially inducing precocious differentiation in females early in development. These effects are mitigated by embryonic day 18 of development. Arsenic-induced dysregulation of the regulatory loop formed by REST/NRSF, its target microRNAs, miR-9 and miR-124, and RNA splicing proteins, PTBP1 and 2, leads to aberrant programming of NSC function that is perhaps perpetuated into adulthood inducing deficits in differentiation we have previously observed.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

FLT3-specific peptides were conjugated onto modified poloxamer 407 using the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. The thin film hydration method was performed for FLT3-specific CM-loaded polymeric micelles (FLT3-CM-micelles) preparation. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were used to determine rate of cellular uptake. 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay was used to test the cytotoxicity of the micelles on leukemic cells. FLT3-CM-micelles demonstrated a mean particle size less than 50 nm, high entrapment efficiency, and high rate of CM uptake by leukemic cells. The intracellular CM fluorescence is related to FLT3 protein levels on the leukemic cell surfaces. Moreover, FLT3-CM-micelles demonstrated an excellent cytotoxic effect and decreased FLT3 protein expression in the leukemic cells. The FLT3-CM-micelles could enhance both solubility and cytotoxicity of CM on FLT3-overexpressing leukemic cells.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases that are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and frequent progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A few cell lines have been established from MDS patients after progression to AML but their characterization is incomplete. Here we provide a detailed description of the immunophenotypic profile of the MDS-derived cell lines SKK-1, SKM-1, F-36P; and MOLM-13. Specifically, we analyzed a comprehensive panel of markers that are currently applied in the diagnostic routine for myeloid disorders. To provide high-resolution genetic data comprising copy number alterations and losses of heterozygosity we performed whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism-based arrays and included the cell line OHN-GM that harbors the frequent chromosome arm 5q deletion. Furthermore, we assessed the mutational status of 83 disease-relevant genes. Our results provide a resource to the MDS and AML field that allows researchers to choose the best-matching cell line for their functional studies.

In light of this observed interdependency, novel therapeutic interventions that target specific cancer stroma cell lineages and their interactions are being sought. Here we studied a mouse model of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) and used intravital microscopy to monitor the progression of disease within the bone marrow at both the tissue-wide and single-cell level over time, from bone marrow seeding to development/selection of chemo-resistance. We observed highly dynamic cellular interactions and promiscuous distribution of leukaemia cells that migrated across the bone marrow, without showing any preferential association with bone marrow sub-compartments. Unexpectedly, this behaviour was maintained throughout disease development, from the earliest bone marrow seeding to response and resistance to chemotherapy. Our results reveal that T-ALL cells do not depend on specific bone marrow microenvironments for propagation of disease, nor for the selection of chemo-resistant clones, suggesting that a stochastic mechanism underlies these processes. Yet, although T-ALL infiltration and progression are independent of the stroma, accumulated disease burden leads to rapid, selective remodelling of the endosteal space, resulting in a complete loss of mature osteoblastic cells while perivascular cells are maintained. This outcome leads to a shift in the balance of endogenous bone marrow stroma, towards a composition associated with less efficient haematopoietic stem cell function. This novel, dynamic analysis of T-ALL interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment in vivo, supported by evidence from human T-ALL samples, highlights that future therapeutic interventions should target the migration and promiscuous interactions of cancer cells with the surrounding microenvironment, rather than specific bone marrow stroma, to combat the invasion by and survival of chemo-resistant T-ALL cells.",,"['Hawkins, Edwin D', 'Duarte, Delfim', 'Akinduro, Olufolake', 'Khorshed, Reema A', 'Passaro, Diana', 'Nowicka, Malgorzata', 'Straszkowski, Lenny', 'Scott, Mark K',

Nevertheless, there has been no consensus on risk factors and treatment strategies for severe ADV infection in children undergoing chemotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 15-year-old boy with a fatal systemic ADV infection. He had received reinduction chemotherapy for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia under continuing antifungal therapy for previously diagnosed fungal pneumonia. He complained of fever and right shoulder pain 4 days after completing the reinduction chemotherapy. In spite of appropriate antibiotic and antifungal therapy, pneumonia was aggravated and gross hematuria was accompanied. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction test for respiratory viruses was positive for ADV in a blood sample, and a urine culture was positive for ADV. He received oral ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin, and intravenous cidofovir therapy; however, he eventually died. Relapsed leukemia, concurrent fungal pneumonia, and delayed cidofovir administration were considered the cause of the grave outcome in this patient. CONCLUSION: ADV may cause severe infections not only in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, but also in patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukemia.

METHODS: Cases of suspected malignancies documented in the German Biker Registry are reviewed in detail. RESULTS: Until Dec 31, 2015, 3695 JIA patients were prospectively followed with a total of more than 13,198 observation years. 12 cases of suspected malignancies, including 7 lymphoid neoplasms, have been reported in patients treated with methotrexate (MTX) , and /or TNF-alpha inhibitors. 11 patients had received MTX, two received cyclosporine A, single patients received sulfasalazine, azathioprine or leflunomide. 10 patients were exposed to biologics, 9 etanercept, two adalimumab, one infliximab and one case was consecutively treated with adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and abatacept. A case of mild myelodysplasia, in which the patient recovered spontaneously, a case of lymphoproliferation without clonality and a case of cervical dysplasia were treated as suspected, but not confirmed malignancies. Cases in which a malignant disease was confirmed included two cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma, one case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, two cases of acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL) and one patient with lymphoproliferative disorder, who recovered after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy. Single confirmed cases of thyroid carcinoma, yolk sac carcinoma and anaplastic ependymoma have also been described. One patient not exposed to biologics died of ALL, all other patients recovered. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of JIA patients, the occurrence of malignancies was higher than in the general population. Whether JIA patients had an increased risk for malignancies, either through their rheumatic disease, or through treatment remains in debate. Treatment with etanercept seems not to further increase the malignancy risk. Long-term observation of JIA patients treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors into adulthood remains an important task.",,"['Horneff, Gerd', 'Klein, Ariane', 'Oommen, Prasad T', 'Hospach, Anton', 'Foeldvari, Ivan', 'Feddersen, Isa', 'Minden, Kirsten']","['Horneff G', 'Klein A', 'Oommen PT', 'Hospach A', 'Foeldvari I', 'Feddersen I', 'Minden K']","['Centre for Paediatric Rheumatology, Department of Paediatrics, Asklepios Clinic Sankt Augustin, Germany. g.horneff@asklepios.com.', 'Centre for Paediatric Rheumatology, Department of Paediatrics, Asklepios Clinic Sankt Augustin, Germany.', ""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Haematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Germany."", 'Olga Hospital, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Hamburger Zentrum fur Kinder- und Jugendrheumatologie, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Klinikum Mutterhaus der Borromaerinnen, Trier, Germany.', 'Charite University Medicine and Epidemiology Unit, German Rheumatism Research Centre, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160908,Italy,Clin Exp Rheumatol,Clinical and experimental rheumatology,8308521,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antirheumatic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/*drug therapy', 'Biological Products/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2016/10/18 06:00,2017/06/21 06:00,['2016/10/18 06:00'],"['2016/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10505 [pii]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Rheumatol. 2016 Nov-Dec;34(6):1113-1120.

The prosurvival function of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is manifested by capturing and neutralizing the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins via their BH3 death domains. Accordingly, strategies to antagonize the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins have largely focused on the development of low-molecular-weight, synthetic BH3 mimetics (""magic bullets"") to disrupt the protein-protein interactions between anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. In this way, apoptosis has been reactivated in malignant cells. Moreover, several such Bcl-2 family inhibitors are presently being evaluated for a range of cancers in clinical trials and show great promise as new additions to the cancer armamentarium. Indeed, the selective Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (Venclexta) recently received FDA approval for the treatment of a specific subset of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This review focuses on the major developments in the field of Bcl-2 inhibitors over the past decade, with particular emphasis on binding modes and, thus, the origins of selectivity for specific Bcl-2 family members.",,"['Yap, Jeremy L', 'Chen, Lijia', 'Lanning, Maryanna E', 'Fletcher, Steven']","['Yap JL', 'Chen L', 'Lanning ME', 'Fletcher S']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy , 20 N.

As2O3 as single agent exhibits poor efficacy for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in phase II trial, suggesting that new modalities of treatment with enhanced therapeutic effect and alleviated toxicity are needed for application of As2O3 on patients with HCC. Survivin is the strongest inhibitor of apoptosis protein over-expressed in tumors, which has been proposed as an attractive target for new anticancer interventions. Disruption of survivin by the plasmid encoding the phosphorylation-defective mouse survivin threonine 34-->alanine mutant (Msurvivin T34A plasmid) has proved a promising strategy for suppressing a variety of murine cancer. In the present study, we attempted to test Msurvivin T34A and arsenic trioxide (ATO) on a cell line and mice bearing subcutaneous tumors, with regard to their effects and mechanisms. We observed that the co-treatment with surivinT34A and ATO significantly enhanced the antitumor activity by induction of apoptosis in Hepa1-6 tumor cells in vitro, compared with control groups. The synergistic apoptosis-inducing effect of combination of these two drugs resulted in elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) level which could be antagonized by the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. The combination treatment induced ROS-dependent collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, the tumor growth in vivo was also remarkably inhibited by combination of surivinT34A and ATO when compared with control groups. Our findings demonstrate that the combination of surivinT34A and ATO exerted synergistic antitumor effects, providing a new perspective for clinical treatment of HCC.",,"['Huang, Anliang', 'Yue, Dan', 'Liao, Danying', 'Cheng, Liuliu', 'Ma, Jinhu', 'Wei, Yuquan', 'Tong, Aiping', 'Cheng, Ping']","['Huang A', 'Yue D', 'Liao D', 'Cheng L', 'Ma J', 'Wei Y', 'Tong A', 'Cheng P']","['State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy/Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy/Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R.

Hematopoietic pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor interacting protein (HPIP) was found to be overexpressed in gastric cancer (GC) tissues compared to normal tissues and to promote GC growth in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism by which HPIP promotes GC cell proliferation remains unknown. In the present study, we found that HPIP activated cap-dependent translation in an AKT/mTORC1 pathway-dependent manner. Blocking capdependent translation with 4EGI-1, a specific eIF4E/eIF4G interaction inhibitor, profoundly abrogated the ability of HPIP to promote G1/S phase transition and GC cell proliferation, while activation of cap-dependent translation by silencing 4E-BP1 expression significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of HPIP knockdown on GC cell proliferation. Furthermore, targeting translation initiation with 4EGI-1 effectively suppre-ssed the ability of HPIP to promote gastric tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model in vivo.

In this study, 8-ADEQ displayed potent cytotoxicity and triggered apoptosis in HL-60 cells as evidenced by DNA fragmentation, DNA ladder formation, and the externalization of Annexin V-targeted phosphatidylserine residues in HL-60 cells. In addition, 8-ADEQ triggered activation of caspases-8, -9, -6 and -3 and cleavage of their substrates such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Moreover, 8-ADEQ induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. Caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk), caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk), caspase-9 inhibitor (z-LEHD), and broad caspase inhibitor (z-VADfmk) significantly suppressed the 8-ADEQ-induced DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, pretreatment with z-IETD-fmk, a caspase-8 inhibitor, completely abolished 8-ADEQ-induced caspase-3 and -9 activation, and subsequent DNA fragmentation. 8-ADEQ also increased the expression of Fas, Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and FasL, and formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Further analysis revealed that 8-ADEQ-induced apoptosis was mediated by upregulation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) generation.

The present study aimed to determine the effect of S. miltiorrhiza and ligustrazine injection (SLI) on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injuries via the Akt serine/threonine kinase (Akt)endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling pathway. Male SpragueDawley rats were randomly assigned into six groups: i) Sham group; ii) I/R group; iii) LowSLI group (6.8 mg/kg/day, i.p.); iv) MediumSLI group (20.4 mg/kg/day, i.p.); v) HighSLI group (61.2 mg/kg/day, i.p.); vi) verapamil group (6 mg/kg/day, i.p.). Prior to surgery, the aforementioned groups were pretreated with a homologous drug once per day for 3 days. The effect of SLI following 35 min coronary artery occlusion and 2 h reperfusion was evaluated by determining infarct size, hemodynamics, biochemical values and histological observations. Additionally, cell viability, caspase3 expression, B cell leukemia/lymphoma2 (Bcl2)/Bcl2associated X protein (Bax) ratio, phosphorylated (p)Akt and peNOS were also investigated following 2 h simulated ischemia and 2 h simulated reperfusion in H9C2 cardiomyocyte cells. Pretreatment with SLI significantly improved cardiac function in a dosedependent manner and reduced myocardial infarct size, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and malondialdehyde levels in blood serum. Additionally, myocardial histopathology changes in the rat model were also alleviated in SLI treatment groups. The present in vitro study revealed that treatment with SLI reduced the apoptotic rate of H9C2 cells by inhibiting the activation of caspase3 and increasing the Bcl2/Bax ratio. The effect of SLI was associated with increased phosphorylation of the survival kinase Akt at Ser473 and its downstream target eNOS following H/R. The present study determined that SLI may alleviate I/R injury in cardiomyocytes and inhibit apoptosis in rats by the activation of the AkteNOS signaling pathway, and downregulation of the expression levels of proapoptotic factors, including caspase-3.",,"['Huang, Wendong', 'Yang, Yongfei', 'Zeng, Zhi', 'Su, Meiling', 'Gao, Qi', 'Zhu, Banghao']","['Huang W', 'Yang Y', 'Zeng Z', 'Su M', 'Gao Q', 'Zhu B']","['Department of Pharmacology, Cardiac and Cerebral Vascular Research Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, P.R.

Real-time quantitative PCR was used to examine the expression of each gene in the HOTAIR signaling pathway in AL patients. The relationship between expression of HOTAIR and downstream genes and AL prognosis was analyzed. Expression of HOTAIR in patients with acute monocytic leukemia (M5) was increased as compared to controls (P<0.05). Compared to patients with low HOTAIR expression, overall survival and event-free survival of patients with high HOTAIR expression was significantly reduced. In addition, the expression of downstream genes in the HOTAIR signaling pathway including EZH2, LSD1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B was significantly increased in AL patients, and showed a significant positive correlation with high expression of HOTAIR (P<0.05). In conclusion, HOTAIR was closely related with a poor prognosis in AL patients.

Previous studies indicate that DADS may induce the differentiation and/or apoptosis of human leukemia cells in vitro. However, the mechanisms underlying these anticancer effects remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in the subcellular localization of protein deglycase DJ1 (also known as Parkinsonism associated deglycase-7, PARK-7) in the cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondria of human leukemia HL60 cells induced by DADS, in order to provide novel experimental evidence for the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer mechanisms of DADS in leukemia cells. HL60 cells induced by DADS were collected at different time points, and proteins from the cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondria of the cells were isolated using specific cellular component isolation kits. The protein expression levels of DJ1 in these subcellular fractions of HL60 cells following exposure to DADS for varying lengths of time, were determined using western blotting, immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence techniques. Following exposure of HL60 cells to 1.25 mg/l DADS for 8 h, the protein expression levels of DJ1 were significantly decreased in the cytoplasm, while nuclear fractions exhibited a significant increase in DJ1 expression when compared with untreated controls. The protein expression levels of DJ1 in mitochondria of HL60 cells were significantly decreased following treatment with 5 and 10 mg/l DADS. These results demonstrate that exposure of HL60 cells to low concentrations of DADS may promote DJ1 protein translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, which suggests that DJ1 may function as a transcription factor or cofactor binding protein in the process of cell differentiation. The expression of DJ1 in mitochondria may be associated with induction of apoptosis in HL60 cells treated with moderate doses of DADS.",,"['Li, Qingye', 'Tang, Yuxian', 'Qin, Jing', 'Yi, Lan', 'Yang, Yening', 'Wang, Juan', 'He, Jie', 'Su, Qi', 'Tan, Hui']","['Li Q', 'Tang Y', 'Qin J', 'Yi L', 'Yang Y', 'Wang J', 'He J', 'Su Q', 'Tan H']","['Cancer Research Institute, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan 421001, P.R.

B-cell CLL/lymphoma 3 (BCL3) was previously found to be a putative proto-oncogene in human cancers and the decoy receptor DcR1 is induced in a p50/Bcl3-dependent manner and attenuates the efficacy of temozolomide in glioblastoma cells. However, its expression status, clinical significance and biological functions in glioma remain largely unknown. In the present study, the levels of BCL3 were overexpressed in glioma compared to normal brain tissues. Furthermore, high expression of BCL3 protein was confirmed by immunoblotting in glioma cells as compared with normal human astrocyte cell line. The positive expression of BCL3 was correlated with adverse prognostic features and reduced overall survival rate of glioma patients. BCL3 silencing resulted in prominent decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and increased apoptosis in U251 cells. In contrast, BCL3 overexpression in U87 cells remarkably facilitated proliferative ability and cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that BCL3 knockdown inhibited the tumor growth of U251 cells in a mouse xenograft model. Mechanistically, BCL3 positively regulated the abundance of STAT3, p-STAT3 and the downstream targets of STAT3 pathway including BCL2, MCL-1 and cyclin D1 in glioma cells. Furthermore, a positive correlation between BCL3 and STAT3 expression was observed in glioma specimens. Notably, we confirmed that STAT3 knockdown abolished the oncogenic roles of BCL3 in glioma. In conclusion, we suggest that BCL3 serves as an oncogene in glioma by modulating proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis, and its oncogenic effects are mediated by the STAT3 signaling pathway.",,"['Wu, Jianheng', 'Li, Linfan', 'Jiang, Guangyuan', 'Zhan, Hui', 'Wang, Nannan']","['Wu J', 'Li L', 'Jiang G', 'Zhan H', 'Wang N']","[""Department of Neurosurgery, The People's Hospital of Gaozhou, Gaozhou, Guangdong 525200, P.R.

In this study, we show that therapeutic antibodies against CD62L (CD62L-Ab) or CD20 (obinutuzumab) were able to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADP) in primary cultures of CLL cells. CLL cells derived from patients with active disease requiring treatment displayed resistance to these antibodies, whereas patients with stable disease were sensitive. Using enrichment strategies and transcriptomic analyses, we show that antibody-dependent tumour cell killing was FcgammaR-dependent and mediated by macrophages. Moreover, we show that resistance cannot be attributed to total numbers or established subtypes of monocytes/macrophages, or the efficiency with which they bind an immune complex. Rather, ADCC/ADP resistance was due to reduced signalling activity through the activating FcgammaRs resulting in the transfer of dominance to the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb within macrophages. Most significantly, we show that resistance is an actionable event that could be reversed using inhibitors of FcgammaRIIb signalling in primary cultures of CLL cells that were previously insensitive to obinutuzumab or CD62L-Ab.",,"['Burgess, M', 'Mapp, S', 'Mazzieri, R', 'Cheung, C', 'Chambers, L', 'Mattarollo, S R', 'Mollee, P', 'Gill, D', 'Saunders, N A']","['Burgess M', 'Mapp S', 'Mazzieri R', 'Cheung C', 'Chambers L', 'Mattarollo SR', 'Mollee P', 'Gill D', 'Saunders NA']","['The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'University of Queensland School of Medicine, Translational Research Institute, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161017,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (FCGR2B protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Monocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",,,2016/10/18 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/10/18 06:00'],"['2016/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016387 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.387 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Apr 27;36(17):2366-2376. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.387.

To address these concerns, we studied the contribution of the pH-sensitive inner core on handling the cytosolic release of siRNA delivered by a series of PG-P(DPAx-co-DMAEMAy)-PCB amphiphilic polycation nanomicelles (GDDC-Ms) with extremely low internalization (<1/4 of lipofactamine 2000 (Lipo2000)). Significantly, just by varying the mole ratio of DPA and DMAEMA to adjust the initial disassembly pH (pHdis) of the core near to 6.8, GDDC4-Ms/siRNA could get nearly 98.8% silencing efficiency at w/w = 12 with 50 nM siRNA and approximately 78% silencing efficiency at w/w = 30 with a very low dose of 5 nM siRNA in HepG-2 cell lines, while Lipo2000 only got 65.7% with 50 nM siRNA. Furthermore, approximately 98.4% silencing efficiency was also realized in the hard-to-transfect human acute monoblastic leukemia cell line U937 by GDDC4-Ms/siRNA (at w/w = 15, 50 nM siRNA), in the inefficient case for Lipo2000. Additionally, the high silencing efficiency ( approximately 80%) in skin tissue in vivo was discovered.

The effect of GVHD on outcomes was analyzed after adjusting for other significant variables. The occurrence of GVHD was treated as a time-dependent covariate. The occurrence of grade 1-2 or 3-4 acute GVHD was significantly associated with a lower relapse rate. Grade 3-4 acute GVHD was associated with a higher risk of non-relapse and overall mortality than no acute GVHD, whereas grade 1-2 acute GVHD was associated with a lower risk of non-relapse and overall mortality than no acute GVHD.

However, we found that most acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, especially M4 and M5 subtypes, produce TNF and show basal level activation of RIP1/RIP3/MLKL signaling, yet do not undergo necroptosis. TNF, through RIP1/RIP3 signaling, prevents degradation of SOCS1, a key negative regulator of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling. Using both pharmacologic and genetic assays, we show here that inactivation of RIP1/RIP3 resulted in reduction of SOCS1 protein levels and partial differentiation of AML cells. AML cells with inactivated RIP1/RIP3 signaling show increased sensitivity to IFN-gamma-induced differentiation. RIP1/RIP3 inactivation combined with IFN-gamma treatment significantly attenuated the clonogenic capacity of both primary AML cells and AML cell lines.

GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA1) is a key regulator of megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation and its deficiency will lead to megakaryoblastic leukemia. Here we show that estrogen can dose-dependently promote MK polyploidization and maturation via activation of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta), accompanied by a significant upregulation of GATA1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and a dual luciferase assay demonstrate that ERbeta can directly bind the promoter region of GATA1 and activate its transcription. Steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC3) is involved in ERbeta-mediated GATA1 transcription. The deficiency of ERbeta or SRC3, similar to the inhibition of GATA1, leads to the impediment of estrogen-induced MK polyploidization and platelet production. Further investigations reveal that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 signaling pathway downstream of GATA1 has a crucial role in estrogen-induced MK polyploidization, and ERbeta-mediated GATA1 upregulation subsequently enhances nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 expression, thereby promoting proplatelet formation and platelet release.

Long-term inhibition of FLT3 activity in these patients has been elusive. To provide a more complete understanding of FLT3 biology, a mass spectroscopy-based screen was performed to search for FLT3-interacting proteins. The screen identified dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2), which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases, and its expression is limited to hematolymphoid cells. We show that DOCK2 is expressed in leukemia cell lines and primary AML samples, and DOCK2 co-immunoprecipitates with wild-type FLT3 and FLT3/ITD. Knockdown (KD) of DOCK2 by shRNA selectively reduced cell proliferation and colony formation in leukemia cell lines with increased FLT3 activity, and greatly sensitized these cells to cytarabine treatment, alone and in combination with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. DOCK2 KD in an FLT3/ITD-positive leukemia cell line also significantly prolonged survival in a mouse xenograft model. These findings suggest that DOCK2 is a potential therapeutic target for novel AML treatments, as this protein regulates the survival of leukemia cells with elevated FLT3 activity and sensitizes FLT3/ITD leukemic cells to conventional antileukemic agents.",,"['Wu, M', 'Hamaker, M', 'Li, L', 'Small, D', 'Duffield, A S']","['Wu M', 'Hamaker M', 'Li L', 'Small D', 'Duffield AS']","['Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161017,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DOCK2 protein, human)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blood Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/*metabolism', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",,,2016/11/05 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/10/18 06:00'],"['2015/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016284 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.284 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Mar;31(3):688-696. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.284.

NPM1, a multifunctional nucleolar phosphoprotein that shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, gets trapped in the cytoplasm when mutated. Immunohistochemical (IHC) demonstration of its aberrant cytoplasmic location (NPMc+) has been suggested as a simple substitute for the standard screening molecular method. This study was aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of IHC on formalin fixed bone marrow biopsies in comparison with the reference molecular method (allele specific oligonucleotide - polymerase chain reaction; ASO-PCR) to predict NPM1 mutation status in AML patients. METHODS: NPM protein IHC was performed using mouse anti-NPM monoclonal antibody on 35 paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsies of patients with primary AML of any French-American-British (FAB) subtype. Results of IHC were compared with those of ASO-PCR. RESULTS: Of the 35 AML patients, 21 (60%) were positive for NPM1 exon 12 gene mutation by ASO-PCR, 19 (90.47%) of these 21 were NPMc+. Thirteen of the 35 patients were negative by both the methods. One NPMc+ patient was not detected by ASO-PCR. IHC had a sensitivity and specificity of 90 and 93 per cent, respectively, compared to the molecular screening gold standard. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Mutation of NPM1 determined by the widely available and inexpensive IHC agrees closely with results of the standard molecular methods. Thus, technically and financially not well endowed laboratories can provide the prognostically and potentially therapeutically important information on NPM1 mutation using IHC.",,"['Chopra, Anita', 'Soni, Sushant', 'Pati, Haraprasad', 'Kumar, Dev', 'Diwedi, Rahul', 'Verma, Deepak', 'Vishwakama, Garima', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Kumar, Suman', 'Gogia, Ajay', 'Kumar, Rajive']","['Chopra A', 'Soni S', 'Pati H', 'Kumar D', 'Diwedi R', 'Verma D', 'Vishwakama G', 'Bakhshi S', 'Kumar S', 'Gogia A', 'Kumar R']","['Department of Laboratory Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Command Hospital (Eastern Command), Kolkata, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Oncology, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Nucleophosmin']",,,2016/10/18 06:00,2017/06/02 06:00,['2016/10/18 06:00'],"['2016/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJMedRes_2016_143_6_763_192027 [pii]', '10.4103/0971-5916.192027 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2016 Jun;143(6):763-768. doi: 10.4103/0971-5916.192027.,,,PMC5094116,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,

Although there are many reports available regarding the different variants of BCR-ABL in CML, we studied the co-expression of e13a2 and e14a2 transcripts and a few polymorphisms in CML patients. METHODS: Molecular genetics approach was adapted to screen for polymorphisms, mutation and translocation in BCR, ABL kinase domain and BCR-ABL breakpoint region in 73 CML patients. RESULTS: All eight patients with dual transcripts were found to harbour an exonic polymorphism (c.2700 T>C) and an intronic polymorphism (g.109366A>G) that were earlier reported to be associated with co-expression of both the transcripts. We also observed c.763G>A mutation in ABL kinase domain and two polymorphisms, c.2387 A>G and c.2736A>G in the BCR gene. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Though our data support the previous findings that co-expression of BCR-ABL transcripts is due to the occurrence of exonic and intronic polymorphisms in the BCR gene, it also shows that the intronic polymorphism can arise without the linked exonic polymorphism.

The objective of this study was to determine the type and frequency of malignancies in HIV infected individuals attending a tertiary care hospital in north India. METHODS: The study design included retrospective analysis of data of all HIV infected individuals registered in the Immunodeficiency clinic from December 2009 to December 2011 and a prospective analysis of HIV infected individuals registered from January 2012 to April 2013. The clinical details and treatment outcomes of all individuals diagnosed to have AIDS defining and non-AIDS defining malignancies were recorded. RESULTS: Records of 2880 HIV infected individuals were reviewed. Thirty one (19 males, 12 females) individuals were diagnosed to have malignancy. AIDS defining malignancy was found in the form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 12 individuals and cervical cancer in six women. Non-AIDS defining malignancies included Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=2); and chronic myelogenous leukaemia, carcinoma base of tongue, carcinoma larynx, carcinoma bronchus, sinonasal carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, anal carcinoma, carcinoma urinary bladder, pleomorphic sarcoma, parathyroid adenoma, and renal cell carcinoma in one individual each. Mean CD4+cell count prior to ART initiation was 250 +/- 195.6 (median: 187; range, 22-805) cells/mul and at the time of diagnosis of malignancy was 272 +/- 202 (median: 202; range, 15-959) cells/mul. The mean CD4+ count of individuals with AIDS defining malignancy was significantly lower when compared with non-AIDS defining malignancy (P<0.001). Fourteen individuals were alive and on regular follow up, 15 had died and two cases were lost to follow up.

Attempts are being made to find the minimal number of antibodies for correctly diagnosing acute leukaemia subtypes. The present study was designed to evaluate the analysis of side scatter (SSC) versus CD45 flow dot plot to distinguish acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), with minimal immunological markers. METHODS: One hundred consecutive cases of acute leukaemia were evaluated for blast cluster on SSC versus CD45 plots. The parameters studied included visual shape, CD45 and side scatter expression, continuity with residual granulocytes/lymphocytes/monocytes and ratio of maximum width to maximum height (w/h). The final diagnosis of ALL and AML and their subtypes was made by morphology, cytochemistry and immunophenotyping. Two sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann Whitney) test and Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank tests were applied to elucidate the significance of the above ratios of blast cluster for diagnosis of ALL, AML and their subtypes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the optimal cut-offs of the w/h ratio to distinguish between ALL and AML determined. RESULTS: Of the 100 cases, 57 of ALL and 43 cases of AML were diagnosed. The median w/h ratio of blast population was 3.8 for ALL and 1 for AML (P<0.001).

Data for FLT3 surface expression in relation to FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) status and outcome are not available from India. The objective of the current study was to investigate adult patients with AML for FLT3 expression and FLT3 ITD mutation, and their association with long-term outcome. METHODS: Total 51 consecutive de novo AML patients aged 18-60 yr were enrolled in the study. FLT3 ITD was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); flowcytometry and qPCR (Taqman probe chemistry) were used for assessment of FLT3 protein and transcript, respectively. Kaplan Meier curves were obtained for survival analysis followed by log rank test. RESULTS: FLT3 ITD was present in eight (16%) patients. Complete remission was achieved in 33 (64.6%) patients. At 57.3 months, event free survival (EFS) was 26.9+/-6.3 per cent, disease free survival (DFS) 52.0+/-9.2 per cent, and overall survival event (OS) 34.5+/-7.4 per cent. FLT3 surface expression was positive (>20%) by flow-cytometry in 38 (88%) of the 51 patients. FLT3 surface expression and transcripts were not associated with FLT3 ITD status. FLT3 expression was significantly associated with inferior EFS (P=0.026) and OS (P=0.018) in those who were negative for FLT3 ITD. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated FLT3 ITD mutation along with FLT3 expression in AML patients, and associated with survival.

Between 2009 and 2014, 355 allotransplanted cases were identified from the SFGM-TC registry as having received either the FB2A2 (n = 316, 56% males, median age: 59.2 years, AML 78.5%, first complete remission [CR1] 72%, median follow-up: 20 months) or the CloB2A2 (n = 39, 62% males, median age: 60.8 years, AML 62%, CR1 69%, median follow-up: 22.4 months) RIC regimen. In multivariate analysis, FB2A2 was associated with significant lower overall survival (OS, HR: 2.14; 95%CI: 1.05-4.35, P = 0.04) and higher relapse incidence (RI, HR: 2.17; 95%CI: 1.02-4.61, P = 0.04) and a trend for lower leukemia-free survival (LFS, HR: 1.75; 95%CI: 0.94-3.26, P = 0.08). These results were confirmed using a propensity score-matching strategy. However, when considering AML and MDS patients separately, the benefit of the CLOB2A2 regimen was restricted to AML patients (2-year OS FB2A2: 38% [14.5-61.6] vs. CloB2A2: 79.2% [62.9-95.4], P = 0.01; 2-year LFS FB2A2: 38% [16-59.9] vs. CloB2A2: 70.8% [52.6-89], P = 0.03). The better survivals were due to the lower risk of relapse in this CloB2A2 AML subgroup (2-year RI FB2A2: 41.2% [19-62.4] vs. CloB2A2: 16.7% [5-34.2], P = 0.05). This retrospective comparison suggests that the CloB2A2 RIC regimen can likely provide longer survival than that awarded by a FB2A2 RIC regimen and may become a new standard of care RIC regimen for allotransplanted AML patients.

Here, we showed that 3G11 specifically and potently blocks HIV-1 infection. By contrast, 3G11 did not block other retroviruses such as HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac ), bovine immunodeficiency virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, equine infectious anemia virus, N-tropic murine leukemia virus, B-tropic murine leukemia virus, and Moloney murine leukemia virus. Analysis of DNA metabolism by real-time PCR revealed that 3G11 blocks the formation of HIV-1 late reverse transcripts during infection prior to the first-strand transfer step. In agreement, an in vitro assay revealed that 3G11 blocks the enzymatic activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase as strong as nevirapine. Docking of 3G11 to the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme suggested a direct interaction between residue L100 and 3G11. In agreement, an HIV-1 virus bearing the reverse transcriptase change L100I renders HIV-1 resistant to 3G11, which suggested that the reverse transcriptase enzyme is the viral determinant for HIV-1 sensitivity to 3G11. Although NMR experiments revealed that 3G11 binds to the HIV-1 capsid, functional experiments suggested that capsid is not the viral determinant for sensitivity to 3G11.

PROCEDURES: Retrospectively, we estimated the effect of CNS involvement and CNS-RT on events and overall survival (OS) in 835 children treated for high-risk ALL in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-92 and ALL-2000 trials. RESULTS: We did not observe a statistically significant difference in the OS or event-free survival (EFS) in patients with CNS involvement at diagnosis, but the risk of isolated CNS relapse was higher (hazard ratio [HR] 7.09, P < 0.001). CNS-RT was given to 169 of the 783 patients in first complete remission, of which 16 had CNS involvement at diagnosis. In general, CNS-RT improved EFS (HR 0.58, P < 0.05) but not OS (HR 0.69, P = n.s.). The adjusted HRs for all relapses, isolated bone marrow relapse, CNS-involving relapse, and isolated CNS relapse, were 0.47 (P < 0.01), 0.50 (P < 0.05), 0.34 (P < 0.01), and 0.12 (P < 0.01), respectively, in irradiated patients.

We analyzed immunophenotypic features of BM cells at diagnosis of children who were referred to the Brazilian Pediatric Cooperative Group of Myelodysplastic Syndromes. METHODS: Diagnosis was based on clinical information, peripheral blood counts, BM cytology and cytogenetics. Patients with Down syndrome were excluded. Children with deficiency anemias or transitory neutropenias were used as controls (CTRLs). Immunophenotyping was performed on an eight-color antibody platform evaluating myelomonocytic maturation and progenitor cells. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients were examined: 6 refractory cytopenia of childhood [RCC]; 5 refractory anemia with excess of blasts [RAEB]; 8 refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation [RAEB-t]; 13 juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia [JMML] and 10 CTRLs. Median age was 66 months (RCC), 68 months (RAEB/RAEB-t), 29 months (JMML) and 70 months (CTRLs). Median number of phenotypic alterations was 4 (range 1-6) in RCC; 6 (range 2-11) in RAEB/RAEB-t and 6 (range 2-11) in JMML (P = 0.004). The percentage of CD34(+) /CD117(+) /CD13(+) cells was 0.5% (range 0.1-2.8) in RCC; 4.2% (range 0.3-10.1) in RAEB/RAEB-t and 3.7 % (range 0.5-8.6) in JMML cases, compared with 0.7% (0.5-1.2) in CTRLs (P < 0.0005). Aberrancies in antigen expression of myeloid progenitors were seen in 63% of JMML and in 45% of RAEB/RAEB-t. CD34(+) /CD19(+) /CD10(+) cells were decreased or absent in patients compared with age-matched controls. T lymphocytes were decreased in JMML. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic abnormalities were similar to those found in adult MDS. A decrease in B-cell precursors was observed especially in RAEB/RAEB-t. JMML and RAEB showed a similar pattern.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Oliveira, Anita F', 'Tansini, Aline', 'Vidal, Daniel O', 'Lopes, Luiz F', 'Metze, Konradin', 'Lorand-Metze, Irene']","['Oliveira AF', 'Tansini A', 'Vidal DO', 'Lopes LF', 'Metze K', 'Lorand-Metze I']","[""Childrens' Cancer Hospital, Barretos Cancer Center, Barretos, SP, Brazil."", 'Morphology/Flow Cytometry Committee, Brazilian Cooperative Group of Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndromes (BCG-MDS-PED), Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Morphology/Flow Cytometry Committee, Brazilian Cooperative Group of Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndromes (BCG-MDS-PED), Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory of Barretos Cancer Center, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory of Barretos Cancer Center, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Oncology Laboratory, Molecular Oncology Research Center, Barretos Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Molecular Biology Committee, Brazilian Cooperative Group of Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', ""Childrens' Cancer Hospital, Barretos Cancer Center, Barretos, SP, Brazil."", 'Chair of the Brazilian Cooperative Group of Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Morphology/Flow Cytometry Committee, Brazilian Cooperative Group of Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndromes (BCG-MDS-PED), Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161017,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell precursors', '*flow cytometry', '*juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', '*myelodysplastic syndromes']",2016/10/18 06:00,2017/07/21 06:00,['2016/10/18 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26285 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Apr;64(4). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26285.

A possible effect of this combination on the innate immunity could take place, and its effects were analysed on THP-1 cell - a human leukaemia monocytic cell line used as a model to study monocyte activity and macrophage activity, assessing cell viability, expression of cell markers and cytokine production. METHODS: THP-1 cells were incubated with GEO, DOX and their combination. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay, cell markers expression by flow cytometry and cytokine production by ELISA. KEY FINDINGS: GEO + DOX did not affect cell viability. GEO alone or in combination increased TLR-4 and CD80 but not HLA-DR and TLR-2 expression. GEO stimulated TNF-alpha production while DOX alone or in combination did not affect it. GEO alone or in combination inhibited IL-6 production. CONCLUSIONS: GEO exerted a pro-inflammatory profile by increasing TLR-4 and CD80 expression and TNF-alpha production, favouring the activation of the immune/inflammatory response. GEO + DOX did not affect cell viability and presented an immunomodulatory action. Lower concentrations of DOX combined to GEO could be used in cancer patients, avoiding side effects and benefiting from the biological properties of GEO.",['(c) 2016 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.'],"['Oliveira, Lucas Pires Garcia', 'Conte, Fernanda Lopes', 'Cardoso, Eliza de Oliveira', 'Conti, Bruno Jose', 'Santiago, Karina Basso', 'Golim, Marjorie de Assis', 'Cruz, Maria Teresa', 'Sforcin, Jose Mauricio']","['Oliveira LP', 'Conte FL', 'Cardoso EO', 'Conti BJ', 'Santiago KB', 'Golim MA', 'Cruz MT', 'Sforcin JM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Biosciences Institute, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Biosciences Institute, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Biosciences Institute, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Biosciences Institute, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Biosciences Institute, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.', 'Botucatu Blood Center, School of Medicine, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Center for Neurosciences and Cellular Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Biosciences Institute, UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20161017,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9009-62-5 (Propolis)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'B7-1 Antigen', '*Bees', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/immunology/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Inflammation Mediators/immunology/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Propolis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*THP-1 cells', '*cell markers', '*chemotherapeutic agent', '*geopropolis', '*immunomodulation']",2016/10/18 06:00,2017/05/17 06:00,['2016/10/18 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jphp.12649 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2016 Dec;68(12):1551-1558. doi: 10.1111/jphp.12649.

Methods: This study was conducted over a 2-year period from January 2011 to February 2013. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to evaluate the degree and site of PHG. APC was applied to areas with mucosal vascular lesions. Results: In total, 200 cirrhotic patients were enrolled; 12 patients were excluded due to death (n = 6) caused by hepatic encephalopathy (n = 3), hepatorenal syndrome (n = 2), or chronic lymphatic leukemia (n = 1), or did not complete the treatment sessions (n = 6), so 188 patients completed the study. PHG was mainly fundic in 73 patients (38.8 %), corporeal in 66 patients (35.1 %), and pangastric in 49 patients (26.1 %) (P = 0.026). Patients were exposed to APC and received proton pump inhibitors together with propranolol at a dose sufficient to reduce the heart rate by 25 % or down to 55 beats/min. The mean (+/- standard deviation) number of sessions was 1.65 +/- 0.8; six patients needed four sessions (3.2 %), 19 patients needed three sessions (10.1 %), 74 patients needed two sessions (39.4 %), and 89 patients needed one session (47.3 %). Patients with fundic and corporeal PHG required the lowest number of sessions (P = 0.000). Patients were followed up every 2 months for up to 1 year; the end point was a complete response with improved anemia and blood transfusion requirement which was achieved after one session in 89 patients (75.4 %), two sessions in 24 patients (20.3 %) and three sessions in five patients (4.3 %). A complete response was more prevalent in patients with corporeal and fundic PHG (P = 0.04). Conclusions: After 2 years' experience in managing PHG, we found that a combination of APC and non-selective beta blockers was highly efficacious and safe in controlling bleeding from PHG. In addition, APC alone is rapid, and effective in the control of PHG induced bleeding, especially when beta blockers are contraindicated.",,"['Hanafy, Amr Shaaban', 'El Hawary, Amr Talaat']","['Hanafy AS', 'El Hawary AT']","['Internal Medicine Department - Hepatology Division, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Internal Medicine Department - Hepatology Division, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161006,Germany,Endosc Int Open,Endoscopy international open,101639919,,,,,,,2016/10/18 06:00,2016/10/18 06:01,['2016/10/18 06:00'],"['2015/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0042-114979 [doi]'],ppublish,Endosc Int Open. 2016 Oct;4(10):E1057-E1062. doi: 10.1055/s-0042-114979.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 95 Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups, the normal control group (A), the methotrexate (MTX) control group (B), the IL-11-pre-treated high-dose group (C), the post-IL-11-treatment high-dose group (D) and the post-IL-11-treatment low-dose group (E). After the intraperitoneal injection of MTX in the groups B-E, the rats were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. The mortality, morphological and ultrastructural changes of small intestine of each group were observed. The cells were then cultured in vitro, and the MTT method was used to investigate the effects of different concentration of IL-11 on CEM proliferation and also on HDMTX-induced mucositis. RESULTS: IL-11 could reduce the intestinal histopathological score, increase the height of small intestinal villi, promote the proliferation of intestinal lacunar cells and reduce the mortality rate of rats. The IL-11 pre-treatment group exhibited the best efficacies, demonstrating significant difference with the control group (P<0.01).

In this study, we investigated the antileukemia activities of KRG and its cellular and molecular mechanisms. METHODS: An established leukemia tumor model induced by xenografted T cell lymphoma (RMA cells) was used to test the therapeutic activity of KRG water extract (KRG-WE). Direct cytotoxic activity of KRG-WE was confirmed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The immunomodulatory activities of KRG-WE were verified by immunohistochemistry, nitric oxide production assay. The inhibitory effect of KRG-WE on cell survival signaling was also examined. RESULTS: Orally administered KRG-WE reduced the sizes of tumor masses. Levels of apoptosis regulatory enzymes and cleaved forms of caspases-3 and -8 were increased by this extract. In addition, expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9, a metastasis regulatory enzyme, was decreased by KRG-WE treatment. The proportion of CD11c+ cells was remarkably increased in the KRG-treated group compared to the control group. However, KRG-WE did not show significant direct cytotoxicity against RMA cells. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest that the KRG might have antileukemia activity through CD11c+ cell-mediated antitumor immunity.",,"['Park, Jae Gwang', 'Son, Young-Jin', 'Aravinthan, Adithan', 'Kim, Jong-Hoon', 'Cho, Jae Youl']","['Park JG', 'Son YJ', 'Aravinthan A', 'Kim JH', 'Cho JY']","['Department of Genetic Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Sunchon National University, Suncheon, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Chonbuk National University, Iksan, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Chonbuk National University, Iksan, Korea.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160804,Korea (South),J Ginseng Res,Journal of ginseng research,100890690,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Korean Red Ginseng', 'Panax ginseng', 'anticancer activity', 'cytotoxicity', 'leukemia']",2016/10/18 06:00,2016/10/18 06:01,['2016/10/18 06:00'],"['2016/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jgr.2016.07.006 [doi]', 'S1226-8453(16)30129-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Ginseng Res. 2016 Oct;40(4):431-436. doi: 10.1016/j.jgr.2016.07.006.

A variety of surface receptors dictates natural killer cell function, including killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor recognition of HLA-C. Previous single-center studies show that HLA-C epitopes, designated C1 and C2, were associated with allogeneic HCT outcomes; specifically, recipients homozygous for the C1 epitope (C1/C1) experienced a survival benefit. Additionally, mismatching at HLA-C was beneficial in recipients possessing at least 1 C2 allele, whereas the opposite was true for homozygous C1 (C1/C1) recipients where HLA-C mismatching resulted in worse outcomes. In this analysis we aimed to validate these findings in a large multicenter study. We also set out to determine whether surface expression of recipient HLA-C, determined by polymorphism in a microRNA (miR-148a/b) binding site within the 3'-region of the HLA-C transcript, was associated with transplant outcomes. In this large registry cohort, we were unable to confirm the prior findings regarding recipient HLA-C epitope status and outcome. Additionally, HLA-C surface expression (ie, surface density), as predicted by the miR-148a/b binding single nucleotide polymorphism, was also not with associated transplant outcomes. Collectively, neither HLA-C surface expression, as determined by miR-148a/b, nor recipient HLA-C epitopes (C1, C2) are associated with allogeneic HCT outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Data were extracted from randomised controlled trials of rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimens for patients with lymphoma or CLL. Fifty-six primary randomised controlled trials were retrievable and met all inclusion criteria. Clinically important benefits in progression-free survival or overall survival were seen in the following settings: (i) addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy for initial treatment of aggressive B-cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma and HIV-related lymphoma with CD4 count >/=50/mm(3); (ii) addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy for initial and subsequent treatment of follicular lymphoma and other indolent B-cell lymphomas; (iii) use of rituximab maintenance in patients with indolent B-cell lymphomas who have responded to chemoimmunotherapy; (iv) addition of rituximab to fludarabine-based chemotherapy or chlorambucil for initial treatment of CLL.

Over-expression of MCL-1 has been closely related to tumor progression as well as to resistance, not only to traditional chemotherapies but also to targeted therapeutics including BCL-2 inhibitors such as ABT-263. Therefore, there has been extensive research and development in the last decade in both academic and industrial settings to address this unmet medical need. Areas covered: This review covers the research and patent literature of the past 10 years in the field of discovery and development of small-molecule inhibitors of the MCL-1 anti-apoptotic protein. Expert opinion: Small-molecule strategies to disrupt the protein-protein interactions between MCL-1 and its pro-apoptotic counterparts, such as BAK and BIM, have recently emerged.

Since bone marrow cell transplantation is seriously limited by the availability of the immune-paired donor sources, the therapy for pediatric leukemia (PL) remains challenging. Autophagy is essential for the regulation of cell survival in the harsh environment. However, the role of autophagy in the survival of PL cells under the oxidative stress, e.g. chemotherapy, remain ill-defined. In the current study, we addressed these questions. METHODS: We analyzed the effects of oxidative stress on the cell viability of PL cells in vitro, using a CCK-8 assay. We analyzed the effects of oxidative stress on the apoptosis and autophagy of PL cells. We analyzed the levels of Beclin-1 and microRNA-93 (miR-93) in PL cells. Prediction of binding between miR-93 and 3'-UTR of Beclin-1 mRNA was performed by a bioinformatics algorithm and confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay. The relationship between levels of miR-93 and patients' survival was analyzed in PL patients. RESULTS: We found that oxidative stress dose-dependently increased autophagy in PL cells. While low-level oxidative stress did not increase apoptosis, high-level oxidative stress increased apoptosis, seemingly from failure of autophagy-mediated cell survival. High-level oxidative stress appeared to suppress the protein levels of an autophagy protein Beclin-1 in PL cells, possibly through induction of miR-93, which inhibited the translation of Beclin-1 mRNA via 3'-UTR binding. CONCLUSION: Beclin-1-mediated autophagy plays a key role in the survival of PL cells against oxidative stress. Induction of miR-93 may increase the sensitivity of PL cells to oxidative stress during chemotherapy to improve therapeutic outcome.","['(c) 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

However 5% to 10% of patients who present with variant Ph translocations (vPh) have been an area of research for their significance in predicting response to various therapies including tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as prognosticating survival outcomes for many years involving varied patient populations, with conflicting results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed our data from January 2002 to December 2014. Patients with vPh in chronic phase of CML (CML-CP) were analyzed with respect to their demographic parameters, response to imatinib therapy, and survival and their data were compared with data of patients with classical Ph translocation (cPh). RESULTS: Of 615 patients diagnosed with CML-CP, 72 patients (11.7%) showed vPh. Most common chromosomes involved in these translocations were 14 (13.9%), 11 (12.5%), 19 (9.7%), and 7 (8.3%). Rates of complete hematological response, complete cytogenetic response, and major molecular response were not statistically different between the groups. At 5 years, event-free survival, failure-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 60% versus 67.9%, 62.7% versus 69.7%, 84.7% versus 92.1%, and 87.5% versus 92.4%, respectively, in vPh and cPh. The differences in survival were statistically not significant. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest series of variant translocations in CML-CP, pertaining to the Indian population. Our data suggest that the presence of vPh in CML has no significant effect in predicting response to imatinib as well as in prognosticating survival.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Asparaginase represents a key agent in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The toxicity of asparaginase includes coagulopathy such as thrombotic or bleeding tendency. We report a case of fatal cerebral hemorrhage in a 12-year-old girl treated for ALL. Cerebral hemorrhage occurred after three injections of L-asparaginase. The patient presented with hypofibrinogenemia (0.36g/L), associated with thrombocytopenia (24,000/mm(3)). Despite maximal medical and surgical treatment (platelets and fresh-frozen plasma transfusions, red blood cells transfusion, fibrinogen replacement therapy, and craniotomy discharge), the patient died. L-asparaginase is well known for its prothrombotic action. By inhibiting the synthesis of fibrinogen and factors V, VII, VIII, and IX, it causes an increased risk of bleeding, including intracranial bleeding. Predictive scores for ICH onset have been established but there is no consensus on the management of coagulation disorders induced by L-asparaginase. It is recommended to check fibrinogen and antithrombin (AT) blood values in order to substitute them if they drop to < 1 g/L for fibrinogen and < 60% for AT. The management of asparaginase-induced ICH does not differ from that of ICH of other origin. The risk of death is high, and surgical treatment has not proven superior to medical therapy in terms of mortality rates and 6-month survival.

We also evaluated the applicability of L. plantarum L67 as a yogurt starter culture. We measured the ability of Lactobacillus strains to induce the production of IL-12 and IFN- gamma in cultured splenocytes by ELISA. Bisphenol A (50muM)-treated RBL-2H3 cells were cotreated with a glycoprotein (18kDa) isolated from L. plantarum L67 (5-100microg/mL) for 30min. We measured the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK and p38), AP-1 (c-Fos and c-Jun), T-bet, and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) using Western blotting to examine the differentiation of T helper cells. Furthermore, we evaluated the gene expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 using real-time quantitative PCR. Finally, we evaluated the applicability of L. plantarum L67 as a yogurt starter by measuring pH, enumeration of bacteria, and sensory scores. Our results showed that L67 protein inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase through the transcriptional activation of AP-1 in bisphenol A-treated RBL-2H3 cells. During differentiation of T helper cells, the expression of transcription factor GATA-3 was significantly suppressed by L67 protein (100microg/mL) treatment, whereas expression of transcription factor T-bet was increased. In addition, the L67 protein significantly attenuated the expression of T helper 2-linked cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10. These results indicate that L. plantarum L67, made available as yogurt starters and dietary supplements, has the potential to prevent allergy-related immune disorders.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

This process is closely linked with ovarian and pituitary hormones, growth factors, and local regulators. Accumulating evidence suggests that the myoepithelial cells also play a role in ductal development in addition to their well-recognized importance in the milk ejection reflex. Following reports that myoepithelial cells changed in correspondence with decreased mammary growth after ovariectomy of prepubertal heifers, we evaluated myoepithelial cells in mammary tissue collected from prepubertal heifers treated with the antiestrogen tamoxifen. Briefly, heifers were given placebo (n=7) or tamoxifen (n=8; 0.3mg/kg per day) beginning on d 28 of life until the animals were euthanized on d 120. Tissues were collected from each of 3 zones (near the gland cistern, midway between the gland cistern and mammary fat pad, and at the interface of the parenchyma and mammary fat pad). Samples were processed to measure expression of transformation-related protein 63 (p63), smooth muscle actin, and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen. We found that smooth muscle actin and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen were expressed in the cytoplasm and p63 in the nuclei of myoepithelial cells. In concert with a 50% impairment in mammary growth after tamoxifen, we found that the number of myoepithelial cells around developing mammary ducts was reduced. But the average intensity of p63 expression per nucleus was not affected. We used the very distinct and exclusive staining of p63 in myoepithelial cell nuclei to capture hundreds of nuclear images for subsequent analysis using CellProfiler software. From this image analysis, we found that the area of myoepithelial cell nuclei and perimeter distances were reduced by tamoxifen. When nuclei were classified based on nuclear shape (eccentricity), we found differences in area, perimeter, and patterns of p63 expression based on Zernike number evaluations as well as treatment differences within each shape classification. These data provide support to the concept that myoepithelial cells are also the involved in mammary development in the prepubertal bovine mammary gland and that use of multispectral imaging combined with image analysis software can provide quantitative data to better understand the complex cellular interactions that ultimately regulate mammary morphogenesis in the bovine.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Serum levels of 25(OH)D3 , the precursor to the active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, are frequently lower in patients with hematological disease compared to healthy individuals. This often correlates with worse disease outcome. Furthermore, diseased cells typically highly express the vitamin D receptor, which is required for many of the anti-cancer effects observed in multiple in vivo and in vitro cancer models. In abnormal hematological cells, vitamin D supplementation promotes apoptosis, induces differentiation, inhibits proliferation, sensitizes tumor cells to other anti-cancer therapies, and reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although the dosage of vitamin D required to achieve these effects may induce hypercalcemia in humans, analogs and combinatorial treatments have been developed to circumvent this side effect. Vitamin D and its analogs are well tolerated in clinical trials, and thus, further investigation into the use of these agents in the clinic is warranted.

Since histone methylation status correlates with disease aggressiveness and relapse, we investigated the therapeutic potential of inhibiting histone 3 Lys27 demethylase KDM6B, in vitro, using the small molecule inhibitor GSK-J4. KDM6B is overexpressed in the germinal center B-cell subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and higher KDM6B levels are associated with worse survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP. GSK-J4-induced apoptosis was observed in five (SU-DHL-6, OCI-Ly1, Toledo, OCI-Ly8, SU-DHL-8) out of nine germinal center B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines. Treatment with GSK-J4 predominantly resulted in downregulation of B-cell receptor signaling and BCL6. Cell lines expressing high BCL6 levels or CREBBP/EP300 mutations were sensitive to GSK-J4. Our results suggest that B-cell receptor-dependent downregulation of BCL6 is responsible for GSK-J4-induced cytotoxicity.

Intrinsic resistance can occur through activation of the nonclassical NF-kappaB pathway and acquired resistance may involve the BTK C481S mutation. Outcomes after ibrutinib failure are dismal, indicating an unmet medical need. We reasoned that newer heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors could overcome ibrutinib resistance by targeting multiple oncogenic pathways in MCL. HSP90 inhibition induced the complete degradation of both BTK and IkappaB kinase alpha in MCL lines and CD40-dependent B cells, with downstream loss of MAPK and nonclassical NF-kappaB signaling. A proteome-wide analysis in MCL lines and an MCL patient-derived xenograft identified a restricted set of targets from HSP90 inhibition that were enriched for factors involved in B-cell receptor and JAK/STAT signaling, the nonclassical NF-kappaB pathway, cell-cycle regulation, and DNA repair. Finally, multiple HSP90 inhibitors potently killed MCL lines in vitro, and the clinical agent AUY922 was active in vivo against both patient-derived and cell-line xenografts. Together, these findings define the HSP90-dependent proteome in MCL.

Patients with ALL who consecutively underwent transplantation in Frankfurt/Main, Germany between January 1, 2005 and July 1, 2014 were included in this retrospective study. Chimerism monitoring was performed in all, and MRD assessment was performed in 58 of 89 patients. IT was guided in 19 of 24 patients with mixed chimerism (MC) and MRD and by MRD only in another 4 patients with complete chimerism (CC). The 3-year probabilities of event-free survival (EFS) were .69 +/- .06 for the cohort without IT and .69 +/- .10 for IT patients. Incidences of relapse (CIR) and treatment-related mortality (CITRM) were equally distributed between both cohorts (without IT: 3-year CIR, .21 +/- .05, 3-year CITRM, .10 +/- .04; IT patients: 3-year CIR, .18 +/- .09, 3-year CITRM .13 +/- .07). Accordingly, 3-year EFS and 3-year CIR were similar in CC and MC patients with IT, whereas MC patients without IT experienced relapse. IT was neither associated with an enhanced immune recovery nor an increased risk for acute graft-versus-host disease. Relapse prevention by IT in patients at risk may lead to the same favorable outcome as found in CC and MRD-negative-patients. This underlines the importance of excellent MRD and chimerism monitoring after transplantation as the basis for IT to improve survival in childhood ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Its prognosis is variable and depends on several baseline characteristics with a highly heterogeneous presentation. In Mexico, large-scale descriptive studies have not yet been published; the objective of this study was to analyze the initial basic characteristics of patients diagnosed with AL in our population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective study, 1018 patients >/= 16 years of age and diagnosed with AL between 2009 and 2014, were included. We described age, gender, complete blood count, and AL subtype according to flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was as common as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (51% vs. 49%). The median age was 31 years. Only 9.6% of patients with ALL were positive for the Philadelphia chromosome. No gender differences were observed. The median age at presentation of AML was 43 years. Acute promyelocytic leukemia was the most frequent AML subtype (38.3%), with a median age of 37 years. CONCLUSION: ALL is equally as frequent as AML in patients >/=16 years of age. Philadelphia-positive prevalence is less frequent than that reported in literature. AML cases occur in a younger age in comparison with other countries. There is a higher rate of acute promyelocytic leukemia among our patients compared with other non-Latin American populations.

Extramedullary (EM) involvement has frequently been reported in this subgroup as resulting in a poor prognosis. However, characteristics or standard treatments of t(8;21) AML with EM involvement (EM-positive t(8;21)) have not yet been elucidated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 154 adult AML patients with t(8;21). Among them, 17 were EM positive and 137 were EM negative at the time of diagnosis. EM involvement was evaluated only when a patient showed suspicious signs or symptoms. All EM-positive patients were treated according to a strategy based on allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). RESULTS: Central nervous system was the most frequently involved site (70.6%). EM-positive t(8;21) was associated with age </= 45 years, leukocytosis (>/= 30 x 10(9)/L), and c-kit mutation compared to EM-negative t(8;21) in multivariate analysis. After intensive chemotherapy with or without local therapy, high-risk t(8;21) AML including EM-positive t(8;21) underwent allo-HCT for postremission therapy. Three-year OS (52.3% vs. 60.0%, P = .658) and event-free survival (51.5% vs. 58.0%, P = .496) were not different between the 2 groups. The subgroup of patients who underwent allo-HCT also showed similar outcomes. CONCLUSION: EM-positive t(8;21) was associated with young age, leukocytosis, and c-kit mutation, and central nervous system was frequently involved. Allo-HCT resulted in good outcomes in EM-positive t(8;21).",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Over the past 20years, a number of techniques have evolved into routine laboratory tools to detect MRD, most notably, multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular methods. There is growing evidence that the presence of MRD detected by MFC or molecular methods provides independent prognostic information and is associated with an increased risk of relapse and shortened survival. However, the predictive value of MRD may be affected by a lack of consensus as to the timing for assessment, the methodology used, and interlaboratory variation in test performance.

Detection of deletion of TP53 locus (17p deletion) by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) has become standard and performed prior to every line of treatment as the incidence dramatically increases as relapses occur. As monoallelic mutations of TP53 equally affect outcome, novel methods are being developed to improve detection of TP53 defects and include next-generation sequencing (NGS) and functional assays. TP53 defects highly affect outcome of immunochemotherapy but also alter response durations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although BCR-targeting agents and Bcl-2-inhibitos have achieved durable responses in some patients with TP53 defects, long-term follow-up is currently lacking. In this review biological and clinical consequences of TP53 dysfunction as well as applicability of currently available methods to detect TP53 defects are described. In addition, proposed novel therapeutic strategies specifically for patients with TP53 dysfunction are discussed. In summary, the only curative treatment option for TP53-defective CLL is still allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Prognostic factors such as chromosome abnormalities (trisomy 12, 11q deletions and 17p deletions), beta2 microglobulin, thymidine kinase, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, IGHV mutation status, and mutations in genes such as NOTCH1, MYD88, SF3B1, and ATM are also predictors of prognosis. These biological markers have enabled the development of multiparameter risk models to predict overall survival. In addition, these models are useful for treatment decisions, as they can identify patients that could be treated with clinical trials vs. standard of care therapies.

Recently, however, the term 'personalized medicine' (or, better, 'precision medicine') has been introduced to define 'a form of medicine that uses information about a person's genes, proteins, and environment to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease'. This concept has gained momentum thanks to next-generation-sequencing (NGS) techniques that allow identification of molecular characteristics unique to the patient and to the tumour. It is hoped that NGS will not only contribute to a better understanding of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), but will identify disease subsets that could benefit from specific treatment interventions.

Activating MEK mutations have not been discovered in leukemia, in which pathway activation is caused by mutations in upstream components such as RAS or Flt3. The anti-leukemic potential of MEK inhibitors is being tested in clinical trials; however, downregulation of MEK1 promotes Emu-Myc-driven lymphomagenesis and MEK1 ablation induces myeloproliferative disease in mice, raising the concern that MEK inhibitors may be inefficient or counterproductive in this context. We investigated the role of MEK1 in the proliferation of human leukemic cell lines and in retroviral models of leukemia. Our data show that MEK1 suppression via RNA interference and genomic engineering does not affect the proliferation of human leukemic cell lines in culture; similarly, MEK1 ablation does not impact the development of MYC-driven leukemia in vivo. In contrast, MEK1 ablation significantly reduces tumorigenesis driven by Nras alone or in combination with Myc. Thus, while MEK1 restricts proliferation and tumorigenesis in some cellular and genetic contexts, it cannot be considered a tumor suppressor in the context of leukemogenesis. On the contrary, its role in NRAS-driven leukemogenesis advocates the use of MEK inhibitors, particularly in combination with PI3K/AKT inhibitors, in hematopoietic malignancies involving RAS activation.",,"['Nowacka, Joanna D', 'Baumgartner, Christian', 'Pelorosso, Cristiana', 'Roth, Mareike', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Baccarini, Manuela']","['Nowacka JD', 'Baumgartner C', 'Pelorosso C', 'Roth M', 'Zuber J', 'Baccarini M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Max F.

This study evaluated the safety and activity of a combination of low-dose clofarabine and cytarabine for these patients. METHODS: Seventy patients with higher-risk MDS who had no response, progressed, or relapsed after at least 4 cycles of HMA therapy were treated. RESULTS: The median age was 72 years. Thirty-nine percent of the patients had high-risk disease according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, and 50% of the patients had poor-risk cytogenetics. Twenty-three percent of the patients had therapy-related MDS. The median number of prior cycles of HMA was 6 (range, 4-45). The overall response rate was 44%. The 6-week mortality rate was 9%. Grade 3 and higher nonhematologic toxicities were rare, but infections occurred in 52% of the patients, and fever of unknown origin occurred in 33%. The median overall survival (OS) was 10 months (95% confidence interval, 1-37 months). Thirteen percent of the patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The responding patients had a median OS of 22 months, whereas the nonresponding patients had a median OS of 4 months. A complex karyotype was associated with worse response rates and OS.

We report a case of WDSM that showed excellent clinical and cutaneous response to imatinib in the absence of known molecular genetic abnormalities. CLINICAL FINDINGS/DIAGNOSES: We present a 24-year-old woman with childhood onset of skin manifestations that progressed to mediator-related systemic events, and a gastrointestinal tract mastocytoma. A subsequent bone marrow examination showed WDSM. Treatment with imatinib resulted in complete resolution of cutaneous lesions and systemic symptoms, which relapsed with the discontinuation of the drug.

We sought to resolve these contrasting effects of miR-155 overexpression using murine models of AML and human paediatric AML data sets. We show that the highest miR-155 expression levels inhibited proliferation in murine AML models. Over time, enforced miR-155 expression in AML in vitro and in vivo, however, favours selection of intermediate miR-155 expression levels that results in increased tumour burden in mice, without accelerating the onset of disease. Strikingly, we show that intermediate and high miR-155 expression also regulate very different subsets of miR-155 targets and have contrasting downstream effects on the transcriptional environments of AML cells, including genes involved in haematopoiesis and leukaemia. Furthermore, we show that elevated miR-155 expression detected in paediatric AML correlates with intermediate and not high miR-155 expression identified in our experimental models.

Results were correlated with occurrence of aGVHD and relapse. In univariate analysis, iNKT cells were the only graft cell populations associated with occurrence of aGVHD. In multivariate analysis, CD4(-) iNKT/T cell frequency could predict grade II-IV aGVHD in bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts, while CD4(-) iNKT expansion capacity was predictive in PBSC grafts. Receiver operating characteristic analyses determined the CD4(-) iNKT expansion factor as the best predictive factor of aGVHD. Incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was reduced in patients receiving a graft with an expansion factor above versus below 6.83 (9.7 vs 80%, P<0.0001), while relapse incidence at two years was similar (P=0.5).The test reached 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the subgroup of patients transplanted with human leukocyte antigen 10/10 PBSCs without active disease.

To identify kinases important for survival of CALR-mutant cells, we developed a novel strategy (KISMET) that utilizes the full range of kinase selectivity data available from each inhibitor and thus takes advantage of off-target noise that limits conventional small-interfering RNA or inhibitor screens. KISMET successfully identified known essential kinases in haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic cell lines and identified the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway as required for growth of the CALR-mutated MARIMO cells. Expression of mutant CALR in murine or human haematopoietic cell lines was accompanied by myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL)-dependent activation of MAPK signalling, and MPN patients with CALR mutations showed increased MAPK activity in CD34 cells, platelets and megakaryocytes. Although CALR mutations resulted in protein instability and proteosomal degradation, mutant CALR was able to enhance megakaryopoiesis and pro-platelet production from human CD34(+) progenitors.

We observed that responders, including those in complete remission (CR), can have persistent measurable tumor burden (that is, mutations) for at least 1 year without disease progression. Using an ultrasensitive sequencing approach, we detected extremely rare mutations (equivalent to 1 heterozygous mutant cell in 2000 non-mutant cells) months to years before their expansion at disease relapse. While patients can live with persistent clonal hematopoiesis in a CR or stable disease, ultimately we find evidence that expansion of a rare subclone occurs at relapse or progression. Here we demonstrate that sequencing of serial samples provides an alternative measure of tumor burden in MDS or AML patients and augments traditional response criteria that rely on bone marrow blast percentage.",,"['Uy, G L', 'Duncavage, E J', 'Chang, G S', 'Jacoby, M A', 'Miller, C A', 'Shao, J', 'Heath, S', 'Elliott, K', 'Reineck, T', 'Fulton, R S', 'Fronick, C C', ""O'Laughlin, M"", 'Ganel, L', 'Abboud, C N', 'Cashen, A F', 'DiPersio, J F', 'Wilson, R K', 'Link, D C', 'Welch, J S', 'Ley, T J', 'Graubert, T A', 'Westervelt, P', 'Walter, M J']","['Uy GL', 'Duncavage EJ', 'Chang GS', 'Jacoby MA', 'Miller CA', 'Shao J', 'Heath S', 'Elliott K', 'Reineck T', 'Fulton RS', 'Fronick CC', ""O'Laughlin M"", 'Ganel L', 'Abboud CN', 'Cashen AF', 'DiPersio JF', 'Wilson RK', 'Link DC', 'Welch JS', 'Ley TJ', 'Graubert TA', 'Westervelt P', 'Walter MJ']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Genomics and Bioinformatics, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20161014,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)'],IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Exome', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden']",,,2016/10/16 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2016/10/15 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016282 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.282 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Apr;31(4):872-881. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.282.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are rapidly gaining the status of particularly stable transcriptome members with distinctive qualities. RNA-seq identified thousands of circRNAs with developmental stage- and tissue-specific expression corroborating earlier suggestions that circular isoforms are a natural feature of the cell expression program. CircRNAs are abundantly expressed also in the hematopoietic compartment. There are a number of studies on circRNAs in blood cells, a specific overview is however lacking. In this review we first present current insight in circRNA biogenesis discussing the relevance for hematopoiesis of the highly interleaved processes of splicing and circRNA biogenesis. Regarding molecular functions circRNAs modulate host gene expression, but also compete for binding of microRNAs, RNA-binding proteins or translation initiation and participate in regulatory circuits. We examine circRNA expression in the hematopoietic compartment and in hematologic malignancies and review the recent breakthrough study that identified pathogenic circRNAs derived from leukemia fusion genes. CircRNA high and regulated expression in blood cell types indicate that further studies are warranted to inform the position of these regulators in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.",,"['Bonizzato, A', 'Gaffo, E', 'Te Kronnie, G', 'Bortoluzzi, S']","['Bonizzato A', 'Gaffo E', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Bortoluzzi S']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161014,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*blood/genetics', 'RNA/*blood/genetics', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Circular', 'Transcriptome/genetics']",,,2016/10/16 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/10/15 06:00'],"['2016/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201681 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2016.81 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2016 Oct 14;6(10):e483. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2016.81.,,,PMC5098259,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only a very small number of lncRNAs have been experimentally validated and functionally annotated during human hematopoiesis. Here, we report an lncRNA, HOTAIRM1, which is associated with myeloid differentiation and has pivotal roles in the degradation of oncoprotein PML-RARA and in myeloid cell differentiation by regulating autophagy pathways. We first revealed that HOTAIRM1 has different variants that are expressed at different levels in cells and that the expression pattern of HOTAIRM1 is closely related to that of the PML-RARA oncoprotein in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. We further revealed that the downregulation of HOTAIRM1 could inhibit all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) -induced degradation of PML-RARA in APL cells and repress the process of differentiation from promyelocytic to granulocytic cells. More importantly, we found that HOTAIRM1 regulates autophagy and that autophagosome formation was inhibited when HOTAIRM1 expression was reduced in the cells. Finally, through the use of a dual luciferase activity assay, AGO2 RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down, HOTAIRM1 was revealed to act as a microRNA sponge in a pathway that included miR-20a/106b, miR-125b and their targets ULK1, E2F1 and DRAM2. We constructed a human APL-ascites SCID mouse model to validate the function of HOTAIRM1 and its regulatory pathway in vivo. This is the first report showing that a lncRNAs regulates autophagy and the degradation of the PML-RARA oncoprotein during the process of myeloid cell differentiation blockade, suggesting that lncRNAs may be the potential therapeutic targets for leukemia.",,"['Chen, Zhen-Hua', 'Wang, Wen-Tao', 'Huang, Wei', 'Fang, Ke', 'Sun, Yu-Meng', 'Liu, Shu-Rong', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Chen, Yue-Qin']","['Chen ZH', 'Wang WT', 'Huang W', 'Fang K', 'Sun YM', 'Liu SR', 'Luo XQ', 'Chen YQ']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Biotechnology Research Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Biotechnology Research Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Biotechnology Research Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Biotechnology Research Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Biotechnology Research Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Biotechnology Research Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatric, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Biotechnology Research Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161014,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (AGO2 protein, human)', '0 (Argonaute Proteins)', '0 (DRAM2 protein, human)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (long non-coding RNA HOTAIRM1, human)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ULK1 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Argonaute Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Autophagy/drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,2016/10/16 06:00,2018/01/19 06:00,['2016/10/15 06:00'],"['2016/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['cdd2016111 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2016.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2017 Feb;24(2):212-224. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2016.111.

This review is a compilation of the current knowledge about cardiotoxicity after AML treatment and of how future directions in treatment may affect its incidence. A total of six studies concerning AML and cardiotoxicity were identified. The incidence of late subclinical cardiotoxicity varied between 1.3 and 15.3%, and late clinical cardiotoxicity varied between 1.3 and 9.3%. Cumulative dose of anthracyclines (ACs) and history of relapse were the most common risk factors identified. No conclusions could be drawn about new, potentially less toxic ACs. Differences in treatment data and variations in study populations made comparisons uncertain. The echocardiographic techniques used in the majority of the studies are inferior to more modern echocardiographic methods. This decreases reproducibility and may increase the risk of overestimation of cardiotoxicity. In summary, AML cannot be cured today without ACs. However, some ACs may cause less cardiotoxicity than others. Furthermore there is currently no consensus on equipotent doses of ACs and risk factors for cardiotoxicity. Further research including randomized trials is needed to evaluate whether or not the potentially less cardiotoxic agents fulfil their promise.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Jarfelt, Marianne', 'Andersen, Niels H', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Jarfelt M', 'Andersen NH', 'Hasle H']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, The Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden."", 'Department of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161014,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protective Agents)']",IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Child', 'Heart Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Prevalence', 'Protective Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*anthracyclines', '*cardiotoxicity', '*childhood acute myeloid leukaemia', '*echocardiography', '*long-term follow-up']",2016/10/16 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2016/10/15 06:00'],"['2016/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14374 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Nov;175(4):577-587. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14374.

The extracts from the aerial parts and roots of Boenninghausenia japonica, as well as the leaves and roots of Ruta graveolens showed potent antiproliferative effects. After activity-guided fractionation, we isolated 44 compounds from two rutaceous plants, including three new compounds (1-3), which were classified into 26 coumarin analogs (13 coumarins, 8 furanocoumarins, 4 dihydrofuranocoumarins and one dihydropyranocoumarin), 15 alkaloid analogs (7 quinolone alkaloids, 4 acridone alkaloids, 3 furanoquinoline alkaloids and one tetrahydroacridone alkaloid) and 3 flavonoid glycosides. Structure-activity relationship studies were also evaluated. The coumarin compounds (2, 3 and 7-9) bearing a 3-dimethylallyl moiety showed potent activity. Similarly, of all the furanocoumarins evaluated in the current study, compound 17 bearing a 3-dimethylallyl group also showed potent activity. A dihydrofuranocoumarin (27) bearing a 3-dimethylallyl moiety showed the most potent activity. Following 27, compound 28 showed potent activity.

Several factors, including the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Cytarabine (Ara-C) and Daunorubicin (Dnr), could contribute to difference in treatment outcome in AML. METHODS: In the present study, we evaluated the plasma PK of Dnr, the influence of genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in transport and metabolism of Dnr on the PK, and also the influence of these factors on clinical outcome. Plasma levels of Dnr and its major metabolite, Daunorubicinol (DOL), were available in 70 adult de novo AML patients. PK parameters (Area under curve (AUC) and clearance (CL)) of Dnr and DOL were calculated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling analysis performed with Monolix. Genetic variants in ABCB1, ABCG2, CBR1, and CBR3 genes as well as RNA expression of CBR1, ABCB1, and ABCG2 were compared with Dnr PK parameters. RESULTS: The AUC and CL of Dnr and DOL showed wide inter-individual variation. Patients with an exon1 variant of rs25678 in CBR1 had significantly higher plasma Dnr AUC [p = 0.05] compared to patients with wild type. Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) had significantly lower plasma Dnr AUC, Cmax, and higher CL compared to patients who did not achieve CR.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, cohort study. Adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML admitted for reinduction chemotherapy between November 1, 2006 and June 15, 2015 were screened for inclusion. A protocol initiating levofloxacin prophylaxis was implemented on December 1, 2013. Patients receiving hypomethylating agents (decitabine/azacitidine) were not administered antibacterial prophylaxis and thus not included in this analysis. Patients receiving broad spectrum antibiotics on day 1 of reinduction chemotherapy or receiving another antibacterial agent for prophylaxis were also excluded. Ninety-seven patients were included in the control group (no prophylaxis), while 48 patients received levofloxacin prophylaxis. Patients in the prophylaxis group received levofloxacin 500 mg once daily on day 1 of chemotherapy and continued until neutrophil recovery (or hospital discharge or death). RESULTS: There was a reduction in the rate of bacteremia in the prophylaxis group (37.5 %) compared to the control group (53.6 %, p = 0.0789), largely due to a reduction in gram-negative bacteremia (2.1 vs. 21.6 % respectively, p = 0.001). No difference was found between prophylaxis and the control groups in the incidence of neutropenic fever, incidence of multidrug resistance, length of hospital or ICU stay, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin prophylaxis reduced the rate of infections overall in adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML, without increasing rates of multidrug-resistant organisms.",,"['Ganti, Beejal R', 'Marini, Bernard L', 'Nagel, Jerod', 'Bixby, Dale', 'Perissinotti, Anthony J']","['Ganti BR', 'Marini BL', 'Nagel J', 'Bixby D', 'Perissinotti AJ']","['Department of Pharmacy Services and College of Pharmacy, University of Michigan Health System, 1111 E.

METHODS: miR-183 expression in bone marrow and patients' sera of childhood AML was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Functions of miR-183 in malignant phenotypes of two leukemia cell lines were then evaluated. Additionally, putative targets of miR-183 were predicted using three miRNA target prediction algorithms and validated by luciferase reporter assay. Clinical relevance of miR-183 and its target gene were further determined. RESULTS: miR-183 expression in bone marrow and patients' sera of childhood AML was both significantly higher than those in the corresponding normal controls (both P < 0.001). Enforced expression of miR-183 dramatically enhanced cell proliferation and G1/S transition, but inhibited cell apoptosis of leukemia cells. Bioinformatics prediction and luciferase reporter assay identified programmed cell death 6 (PDCD6) as a direct target gene of miR-183. Moreover, high serum miR-183 combined with low serum PDCD6 mRNA was significantly associated with French-American-British classification subtype M7 (P = 0.01) and unfavorable karyotypes (P = 0.006). Further multivariate analysis identified the combination of serum miR-183 and PDCD6 levels as an independent prognostic factor for both relapse-free and overall survivals. Functionally, re-introduction of PDCD6 markedly reversed the effects of miR-183 in cell cycle, proliferation and apoptosis of two leukemia cell lines. CONCLUSION: Combined serum miR-183 and PDCD6 mRNA may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for pediatric AML. Interestingly, miR-183 may function as an oncogene and may enhance cell proliferation by targeting PDCD6, implying a potential therapeutic target for this malignancy.",,"['Wang, Xiang', 'Zuo, Dongjian', 'Yuan, Yufang', 'Yang, Xiaochun', 'Hong, Ze', 'Zhang, Rongrong']","['Wang X', 'Zuo D', 'Yuan Y', 'Yang X', 'Hong Z', 'Zhang R']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 6 Beijing Road West, Huai'an, 223300, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Neurosurgery, Huai'an Hospital Affiliated to Xuzhou Medical College and Huai'an Second People's Hospital, 62 Huaihai Road South, Huai'an, 223002, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 6 Beijing Road West, Huai'an, 223300, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 6 Beijing Road West, Huai'an, 223300, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 6 Beijing Road West, Huai'an, 223300, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, 6 Beijing Road West, Huai'an, 223300, Jiangsu, China. zrrhayy@sina.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161013,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MIRN183 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (PDCD6 protein, human)']",IM,,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA Interference', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['Pediatric acute myeloid leukemia', 'Prognosis', 'Programmed cell death 6', 'Proliferation', 'microRNA-183']",2016/10/16 06:00,2017/02/10 06:00,['2016/10/15 06:00'],"['2016/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-016-2277-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-016-2277-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2017 Jan;143(1):169-180. doi: 10.1007/s00432-016-2277-2.

While several phosphorylation sites and kinases have been implicated in mitotic arrest-induced Mcl-1 phosphorylation, a comprehensive biochemical analysis has been lacking. Contrary to previous reports suggesting that T92 phosphorylation by Cdk1 regulates Mcl-1 degradation, a T92A Mcl-1 mutant expressed in HeLa cells was phosphorylated and degraded with the same kinetics as wild-type Mcl-1 following vinblastine treatment. Similarly, when Mcl-1 with alanine replacements of all five putative Cdk sites (S64, T92, S121, S159, T163) was expressed, it was also phosphorylated and degraded in response to vinblastine. To analyze Mcl-1 phosphorylation in more detail, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) was performed. While untreated cells expressed mainly unphosphorylated Mcl-1 with two minor phosphorylated species, Mcl-1 from vinblastine treated cells migrated during 2D-PAGE as a train of acidic spots representing nine or more phosphorylated species. Immunopurification and mass spectrometry of phosphorylated Mcl-1 derived from mitotically arrested HeLa cells revealed nine distinct sites, including several previously unreported.

We also examined UHRF2 expression in cord blood progenitors and compared its expression to methylation status in 6 leukemia cell lines and 15 primary human leukemias. UHRF2 is highly expressed, paralleling that of 5hmC, in most non-neoplastic, differentiated tissue with low Ki-67 defined proliferative activity. UHRF2 is expressed in common lymphoid progenitors and mature lymphocytes but not common myeloid progenitors or monocytes. In contrast, UHRF2 immunostaining in human cancer tissues revealed widespread reduction or abnormal cytoplasmic localization which correlated with a higher Ki-67 and reduced 5hmC. UHRF2 expression is reduced in some leukemia cell lines, this correlates with promoter hypermethylation, and similar UHRF2 methylation profiles are seen in primary human leukemia samples.

Here, we demonstrate that the combination of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and ascorbic acid (AA) efficiently converts mouse primed pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into naive PSCs. Signaling by the lipid LPA through its receptor LPAR1 and downstream effector Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) cooperated with LIF signaling to promote this conversion. BMP4, which also stimulates conversion to naive pluripotency, bypassed the need for exogenous LPA by increasing the activity of the extracellular LPA-producing enzyme autotaxin (ATX). We found that LIF and LPA-LPAR1 signaling affect the abundance of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which induces a previously unappreciated Kruppel-like factor (KLF)2-KLF4-PR domain 14 (PRDM14) transcription factor circuit key to establish naive pluripotency.

In vitro, imatinib and nilotinib inhibit osteoclastogenesis, and in patients they reduce levels of bone resorption. One of the mechanisms that might underlie these effects is an increase in the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG). In the current work we report that platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta) signaling regulates OPG production in vitro. In addition, we have shown that TKIs have effects on RANKL signaling through inhibition of the PDGFRbeta and other target receptors. These findings have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms by which TKIs affect osteoclastogenesis, and the role of PDGFRbeta signaling in regulating osteoclastogenesis.

Classical multi-drug resistant (MDR) cells remain sensitive to arsenic trioxide, which may even reverse the drug resistance. Arsenic trioxide is also effective in leukemias/tumors that persist despite conventional cytotoxic or targeted drugs. We obtained a highly arsenic-resistant MDR leukemic cell line, HL-60/RS, by exposing leukemic HL-60 cells to adriamycin selection. We compared the arsenic sensitivity, and the expression and responses to arsenic of the arsenic-related transporters, MRP1, MRP2, and ASNA1, in paired parent/arsenic-resistant HL-60/RS/HL-60 and arsenic-sensitive/parental K562/ADM/K562 cells. Expression levels of MRP1, MRP2, and ASNA1 were negatively correlated with cell sensitivities to arsenic trioxide, and ASNA1 expression notably was highest in HL-60/RS cells and lowest in K562/ADM cells. Expression levels of MRP1, MRP2, and ASNA1 were significantly enhanced in HL-60/RS cells and inhibited in K562/ADM cells by arsenic trioxide treatment, compared with their parental sensitive cells, in accord with the high-resistance of HL-60/RS cells and high-sensitivity of K562/ADM cells. In conclusion, the cross-resistance of conventional chemotherapeutics-resistant leukemic cells to arsenic trioxide is determined by both levels of MRP1, MRP2, and ASNA1, and also by the responses of these transporters to arsenic stress.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about the clinical impact of galectin-3 in non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (non-M3 AML). Peripheral blood of 298 patients with primary non-M3 AML and 30 normal donors was collected for measurement of galectin-3. Galectin-3 levels were significantly higher compared with the control group (p < .001). Patients with higher galectin-3 levels had lower CR rates (p = .001) and 1-year overall survival (OS) rates (p = .002). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that higher galectin-3 levels group had significantly shorter OS. Cox regression model revealed high galectin-3 level was an independent poor prognostic factor. A scoring system incorporating galectin-3 and other prognostic factors (age, WBC, karyotype, NPM1/FLT3-ITD, CEBPA(double-mutation) and c-KIT, WT1) was formulated to predict prognosis. In conclusion, galectin-3 may be a reliable prognostic marker in AML patients.

Iron complexed to transferrin is delivered to the metabolism after endocytosis via the CD71 surface receptor. We found that transformed cells from a murine PTEN-deficient T-cell lymphoma model and from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/T-LL) cell lines overexpress CD71. As a consequence, the cells developed an addiction toward iron whose chelation by deferoxamine (DFO) dramatically affected their survival to induce apoptosis.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting Bcr-Abl oncoprotein are the first-line therapy for most CML patients, however, some are unresponsive to it or develop resistance. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the progression of CML and the development of TKI resistance based on their important regulatory function in cell homeostasis. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Since microRNAs can function either as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in leukemogenesis, the potential of using them as therapeutic targets by inhibiting or amplifying their activity, opens up new opportunities for leukemia therapy.

Various genetic mutations are associated with AML. FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), a member of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family, plays an important role in stem cell survival, and the development of dendritic and natural killer cells. FLT3/TKD mutations are generally missense mutations or in-frame alterations of residues D835 and I836 within the activation loop of the FLT3 protein. D835 mutations have been reported to occur in approximately 7% of AML patients. Mutations have also been reported in exon 4 of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in approximately 9% of AML patients. Mutations in FLT3/TKD and IDH1 genes were studied in AML patients from Pakistan and correlated with the laboratory findings. FLT3/TKD mutations were found in 7%, while IDH1 mutations were found in 10% Pakistani AML patients. Neither of these mutations was significantly correlated with age and sex, although the incidence of these mutations was higher in female patients. These mutations were found to be positively associated with each other. IDH1 mutations were positively associated with FAB type M1 and negatively associated with FAB type M2. In conclusion, the overall incidence of all these mutations in Pakistani patients was within the globally reported ranges. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 1174-1181, 2017.

We used mesenchymal Prx1-directed conditional EF expression in mice to study bone development and to establish a reliable sarcoma model. EF expression arrested early chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation due to changed signaling pathways such as hedgehog, WNT or growth factor signaling. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) expressing EF showed high self-renewal capacity and maintained an undifferentiated state despite high apoptosis. Blocking apoptosis through enforced BCL2 family member expression in MSCs promoted efficient and rapid sarcoma formation when transplanted to immunocompromised mice. Mechanistically, high BCL2 family member and CDK4, but low P53 and INK4A protein expression synergized in Ewing-like sarcoma development.

In this study, we used a dual-luciferase assay to identify that pectolinarigenin inhibited STAT3 activity. Further studies showed pectolinarigenin inhibited constitutive and interleukin-6-induced STAT3 signaling, diminished the accumulation of STAT3 in the nucleus and blocked STAT3 DNA-binding activity in osteosarcoma cells. Mechanism investigations indicated that pectolinarigenin disturbed the STAT3/DNA methyltransferase 1/HDAC1 histone deacetylase 1 complex formation in the promoter region of SHP-1, which reversely mediates STAT3 signaling, leading to the upregulation of SHP-1 expression in osteosarcoma. We also found pectolinarigenin significantly suppressed osteosarcoma cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and reduced the level of STAT3 downstream proteins cyclin D1, Survivin, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma extra-large (Bcl-xl) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). In addition, pectolinarigenin inhibited migration, invasion and reserved epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in osteosarcoma cells. In spontaneous and patient-derived xenograft models of osteosarcoma, we identified administration (intraperitoneal) of pectolinarigenin (20 mg/kg/2 days and 50 mg/kg/2 days) blocked STAT3 activation and impaired tumor growth and metastasis with superior pharmacodynamic properties.

Among other regimens, cladribine, cytarabine, and idarubicin (CLA-Ida) is used. METHODS: We analyzed relapsing AML patients receiving CLA-Ida chemotherapy between July 2012 and April 2015 at three academic centers in Switzerland. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients underwent at least one cycle of CLA-Ida chemotherapy, with 6 patients having two cycles. Treatment-related mortality was 5.9% (2/34 patients). Eighteen patients (52.9%) achieved a complete remission (CR2), and 16 (47.1%) received subsequent allogeneic transplantation, with 8 (23.5%) of these patients remaining in complete remission after a median follow-up of 6 months. In contrast, all 16 patients not achieving CR2 died within 12 months after relapse due to progressive disease.

Environmental and genetic factors have been studied extensively in children with childhood leukemia. Other factors, such as the prenatal parental use of controlled substances, have not been investigated to the same degree. We review what is currently known about environmental and parental factors and the occurrence of leukemia in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for studies correlated pediatric leukemia with (1) ionizing radiation; (2) benzene; (3) parental drug use (4) parental alcohol use; (5) genetic factors. RESULTS: The two known significant environment risk factors for the occurrence leukemia are ionizing radiation and benzene. However, at least 4 studies have been published over the last century have looked at other environmental factors such as pesticides and drug and alcohol use as well as genetic factors such as gene fusions and translocations.

METHODS: We reviewed the clinical features of CD56 expression in 588 consecutive ALL patients treated with systemic chemotherapy regimens between 2000 and 2014. The categorical data from CD56(+) ALL patients were compared with those from CD56(-) ALL patients. RESULTS: Among the 588 patients studied, 18.9% showed CD56 expression. The expression was significantly associated with CD33(+), CD10(-), CD15(+), TdT(-), and CD5(+) immunophenotypes. After systemic chemotherapy, 8.8% patients showed CNS involvement, of which 3.2% exhibited combined recurrences and 5.6% exhibited isolated CNS involvement. The 5-year event-free survival was significantly lower for patients with CD56(+) immunophenotype compared with patients with CD56(-) immunophenotype (22.5% vs. 32.7%, P = 0.04). Cumulative incidences of CNS involvement were significantly greater in the CD56(+) cohort compared with the CD56(-) cohort (14.4% vs. 7.5%, P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis revealed CD56 expression to be statistically significant risk factors for CNS involvement.

As aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-activity is enriched in various stem cells we investigated its value for HSC isolation in adult B-ALL. Based on ALDH-activity patients could be stratified in ALDH-numerous (>/=1.9% ALDH(+ )cells) and ALDH-rare (<1.9% ALDH(+ )cells) cases. In ALDH-rare B-ALL clonal-marker negative HSC could be separated by the CD34(+)CD38(-)ALDH(+ ) phenotype, whereas this separation was not possible in ALDH-numerous B-ALL. Functional analysis confirmed the HSC-potential of isolated cells, which were uniformly CD19-negative. However, addition of ALDH-activity further improved HSC-purity. In summary, we provide a method to separate functionally normal HSC from leukemic cells in a subgroup of B-ALL patients that can be identified prospectively.

Blocking mitochondrial protein synthesis through genetic and chemical approaches kills human AML cells at all stages of development in vitro and in vivo. Tigecycline is an antimicrobial that we found inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis in AML cells. Therefore, we conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation study of tigecycline administered intravenously daily 5 of 7 days for 2 weeks to patients with AML. A total of 27 adult patients with relapsed and refractory AML were enrolled in this study with 42 cycles being administered over seven dose levels (50-350 mg/day). Two patients experienced DLTs related to tigecycline at the 350 mg/day level resulting in a maximal tolerated dose of tigecycline of 300 mg as a once daily infusion. Pharmacokinetic experiments showed that tigecycline had a markedly shorter half-life in these patients than reported for noncancer patients. No significant pharmacodynamic changes or clinical responses were observed. Thus, we have defined the safety of once daily tigecycline in patients with refractory AML.

The distinction between leukemic and normal stem cells relies on the expression of antigen combinations defining leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs), which are absent or extremely infrequent in normal bone marrow. However, LAIPs are very different from patient to patient and are not necessarily stable over the course of the disease. Accordingly, we addressed the applicability of human myeloid inhibitory C-lectin (hMICL) by flow cytometry as a specific leukemic myeloid stem cell marker for the diagnosis of AML in CD34(+) and CD34(-) cases and evaluated the stability of hMICL during the course of the disease. hMICL expression was assessed in 78 bone marrow aspirate specimens obtained from AML patients at diagnosis (n = 40), complete remission (CR) (n = 28), and relapse (n = 10). AML patients at diagnosis were compared to 20 newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and 20 healthy controls. hMICL was reevaluated in CR and relapse specimens. hMICL was expressed in 100% AML patients at diagnosis (mean +/- standard deviation [SD], 60.3 +/- 19.9%), both CD34(+) and CD34(-) , but not in ALL (mean +/- SD, 3.3 +/- 1.9%) or healthy controls (mean +/- SD, 3.4 +/- 2.6%) (P < .001). hMICL median fluorescence intensity ratio was higher in AML (mean +/- SD, 15.9 +/- 11.7) compared to ALL (mean +/- SD, 4.5 +/- 1.4) and healthy controls (mean +/- SD, 4.4 +/- 1.6) (P < .001). hMICL was expressed in all studied AML morphologic subtypes. Preserved stable expression of hMICL was found in CR and relapse specimens with no antigen loss. hMICL is a robust pan-AML-associated antigen with excellent diagnostic impact, extreme specificity to AML blasts, and stability throughout the course of the disease. hMICL could be incorporated into the routine flow cytometry setting within the initial diagnostic work-up and follow-up of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Eissa, Deena Samir', 'Kandeel, Eman Zaghloul', 'Ghareeb, Mohamed']","['Eissa DS', 'Kandeel EZ', 'Ghareeb M']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161013,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Lectins, C-Type)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'human myeloid inhibitory C-lectin', 'minimal residual disease', 'relapse']",2016/10/21 06:00,2018/01/06 06:00,['2016/10/14 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2352 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2017 Dec;35(4):814-820. doi: 10.1002/hon.2352.

TLRs are widely expressed on both immune cells and non-immune cells, including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, effector immune cell populations, and endothelial cells. In addition to their well-known role in the innate immune response to acute infection or injury, accumulating evidence supports a role for TLRs in the development of hematopoietic and other malignancies. Several hematopoietic disorders, including lymphoproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes, which possess a high risk of transformation to leukemia, have been linked to aberrant TLR signaling. Furthermore, activation of TLRs leads to the induction of a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which can promote tumorigenesis by driving cell proliferation and migration and providing a favorable microenvironment for tumor cells. Beyond hematopoietic malignancies, the upregulation of a number of TLRs has been linked to promoting tumor cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis in a variety of cancers, including those of the colon, breast, and lung. This review focuses on the contribution of TLRs to hematopoietic malignancies, highlighting the known direct and indirect effects of TLR signaling on tumor cells and their microenvironment. In addition, the utility of TLR agonists and antagonists as potential therapeutics in the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies is discussed.",,"['Monlish, Darlene A', 'Bhatt, Sima T', 'Schuettpelz, Laura G']","['Monlish DA', 'Bhatt ST', 'Schuettpelz LG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis, MO , USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis, MO , USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis, MO , USA.']",['eng'],"['Review', 'Journal Article']",20160928,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HSC', 'MyD88', 'leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'toll-like receptors']",2016/10/14 06:00,2016/10/14 06:01,['2016/10/14 06:00'],"['2016/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2016.00390 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2016 Sep 28;7:390. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2016.00390. eCollection 2016.,,['T32 HD007499/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5039188,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children presenting with multiple de novo leukemias are more likely to suffer from genetic predisposition. Here, we selected five of these patients and analyzed the mutational spectrum of normal and malignant tissues. In two patients, we identified germline mutations in TYK2, a member of the JAK tyrosine kinase family. These mutations were located in two adjacent codons of the pseudokinase domain (p.Pro760Leu and p.Gly761Val). In silico modeling revealed that both mutations affect the conformation of this autoregulatory domain.

Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we identified 5 distinct patterns of mutation dynamics arising following tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. This study demonstrates that patterns of mutation acquisition, persistence, and clearance vary but have a number of interesting correlations with clinical outcomes. Mutation burden often persisted despite successful TKI response (pattern 1), providing indirect evidence that these mutations also originated from preleukemic mutations, whereas patients exhibiting mutation clearance (pattern 3) showed mixed clinical outcomes. Unsurprisingly, patients acquiring new mutations during treatment failed TKI therapy (pattern 2).

Thus, we have established a human leukemia xenograft mouse model in which a large cohort of patient samples successfully engrafted, which covered all of the important genetic and risk subgroups. We found that by providing a humanized environment, stem cell self-renewal properties were better maintained as determined by serial transplantation assays and genome-wide transcriptome studies, and less clonal drift was observed as determined by exome sequencing. The human leukemia xenograft mouse models that we have established here will serve as an excellent resource for future studies aimed at exploring novel therapeutic approaches.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Antonelli, Antonella', 'Noort, Willy A', 'Jaques, Jenny', 'de Boer, Bauke', 'de Jong-Korlaar, Regina', 'Brouwers-Vos, Annet Z', 'Lubbers-Aalders, Linda', 'van Velzen, Jeroen F', 'Bloem, Andries C', 'Yuan, Huipin', 'de Bruijn, Joost D', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Martens, Anton C M', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Groen, Richard W J', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Antonelli A', 'Noort WA', 'Jaques J', 'de Boer B', 'de Jong-Korlaar R', 'Brouwers-Vos AZ', 'Lubbers-Aalders L', 'van Velzen JF', 'Bloem AC', 'Yuan H', 'de Bruijn JD', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Martens AC', 'Vellenga E', 'Groen RW', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Xpand Biotechnology BV, Bilthoven, The Netherlands; and.', 'Queen Mary University of London, School of Engineering and Materials Science, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology, Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161012,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Cell Separation', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', '*Stem Cell Niche', 'Stromal Cells/pathology', 'Tissue Scaffolds/*chemistry', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/10/14 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/10/14 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33878-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-05-719021 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Dec 22;128(25):2949-2959. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-05-719021.

Sequencing studies demonstrate that the leukemic cell population consists of multiple clones. The genetic relationship between the different clones, referred to as the clonal hierarchy, shows high interindividual variability. So far, the source of this heterogeneity and its clinical relevance remain unknown. We propose a mathematical model to study the emergence and evolution of clonal heterogeneity in acute leukemias. The model allows linking properties of leukemic clones in terms of self-renewal and proliferation rates to the structure of the clonal hierarchy. RESULTS: Computer simulations imply that the self-renewal potential of the first emerging leukemic clone has a major impact on the total number of leukemic clones and on the structure of their hierarchy. With increasing depth of the clonal hierarchy the self-renewal of leukemic clones increases, whereas the proliferation rates do not change significantly. The emergence of deep clonal hierarchies is a complex process that is facilitated by a cooperativity of different mutations. CONCLUSION: Comparison of patient data and simulation results suggests that the self-renewal of leukemic clones increases with the emergence of clonal heterogeneity. The structure of the clonal hierarchy may serve as a marker for patient prognosis.

With the advent of highly efficacious therapy, the focus has shifted toward managing TKI adverse effects, such as vascular adverse events (VAEs). We used an in vitro angiogenesis model to investigate the TKI-associated VAEs. Our data show that imatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib reduce human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) viability. Pharmacological concentrations of ponatinib induced apoptosis, reduced migration, inhibited tube formation of HUVECs, and had a negative effect on endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function.

We carried out this study to assess the prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations on a larger informative cohort of CMML patients (n = 261). DNMT3A mutations were seen in 6% (n = 16); 56% (n = 9) male, with a median age of 64 years. Eighty-one % of DNMT3A mutations were missense, with the Arg882 mutational hot spot accounting for 63% of all changes. Five (31%) patients had an abnormal karyotype whereas concurrent gene mutations (SF3B1/SRSF2/U2AF1-56%, TET2-50%, and ASXL1-25%) were seen in all patients. Apart from a higher frequency of SF3B1 (P = 0.0001) and PTPN11 (P = 0.005) mutations and a lower frequency of SRSF2 (P = 0.004) mutations, there were no significant differences between DNMT3A mutated patients and their wildtype counterparts. In univariate analysis, survival was shorter in DNMT3A mutated (median 8 months) versus wildtype (median 27 months) patients (P = 0.0007; HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.7); with other variables of significance including lower hemoglobin (P = 0.002), higher leukocyte count (P = 0.0009), higher monocyte count (P = 0.0012), circulating blast % (P = 0.001), circulating immature myeloid cells (P = 0.01), bone marrow blast % (P = 0.045), abnormal karyotype (P = 0.02), and ASXL1 (P = 0.01) mutations. In a multivariable model that included the aforementioned variables, when both DNMT3A and ASXL1 mutations were added, only DNMT3A (P < 0.0001) and ASXL1 (P = 0.004) mutations remained significant. DNMT3A mutations were also predictive of a shortened leukemia-free survival. These findings warrant inclusion of DNMT3A mutations in molecularly integrated CMML prognostic models. Am. J.

The zinc-thiolate coordination is critical for structural stability of zinc finger proteins, including the PML moiety of PML/RARalpha. Based on the known interaction of redox-active selenium compounds with thiolate ligands of zinc, we herein have investigated the abrogatory effects of selenite alone or in combination with all-trans retinoic acid on PML/RARalpha and the possible effects on differentiation in these cells. At pharmacological concentrations, selenite inhibited the proliferation and survival of APL originated NB4 cells. In combination with ATRA, it potentiated the differentiation of NB4 cells without any differentiating effects of its own as a single agent. Concordant with our hypothesis, PML/RARalpha oncoprotein expression was completely abrogated by selenite. Increased expression of RARalpha, PU.1 and FOXO3A transcription factors in the combined treatment suggested the plausible basis for increased differentiation in these cells. We show that selenite at clinically achievable dose targets PML/RARalpha oncoprotein for degradation and potentiates differentiation of promyelocytic leukemic cells in combination with ATRA.

Previously described unique BCR Ig-class-specific sequences (proximal domains (PDs)), are not expressed in serum Ig (sIg). As a consequence of sequence and structural differences in the membrane IgM (mIgM) micro-Constant Domain 4, additional epitopes distinguish mIgM from sIgM. mAbs generated to linear and conformational epitopes, restricted to mIgM and not reacting with sIgM, were generated despite the relative hydrophobicity of the PDm sequence. Anti-PD mAbs (mAb1, mAb2, and mAb3) internalize mIgM. Anti-mIgM mAb4, which recognizes a distinct non-ligand binding site epitope, mediates mIgM internalization, and in low-density cultures, growth inhibition, anti-clonogenic activity, and apoptosis. We show that mAb-mediated mIgM internalization generally does not interrupt BCR-directed cell growth, however, mAb4 binding to a non-ligand binding site in the mIgM PDm-muC4 domain induces both mIgM internalization and anti-tumor effects. BCR micro-clustering in many B-cell leukemia and lymphoma lines is demonstrated by SEM micrographs using these new mAb reagents. mAb4 is a clinical candidate as a mediator of inhibition of the BCR signaling pathway.

However, it is not clear to which extent comorbidities contribute to this effect. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of pretreatment comorbidities on survival of AML patients. In a single-center retrospective study 194 adult AML patients were included. The Hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI), the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (ACE-27) score and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) as well as data on demographics, cytogenetics, treatment and outcome were evaluated at the time of initial diagnosis by univariate and multivariate analysis. The study included 102 male and 92 female (median age 60.9 years) of which 173 (89.2%) received intensive chemotherapy. Median overall survival (OS) was 17 months. In univariate analysis, cardiovascular disease (26 vs 12 months, p = .005), severe hepatic disease (19 vs 4 months, p = .013) and renal impairment (17 vs 7 months, p = .016) was associated with inferior OS. For each index, the highest comorbidity burden was associated with reduced OS. However, in multivariate analysis only the ACE-27 score was associated with outcome.

A portion of PI metabolism and signaling takes place in the nuclear compartment of eukaryotic cells, where an array of kinases and phosphatases localize and modulate PI. Among these, Diacylglycerol Kinases (DGKs) are a class of phosphotransferases that phosphorylate diacylglycerol and induce the synthesis of phosphatidic acid. Nuclear DGKalpha modulates cell cycle progression, and its activity or expression can lead to changes in the phosphorylated status of the Retinoblastoma protein, thus, impairing G1/S transition and, subsequently, inducing cell cycle arrest, which is often uncoupled with apoptosis or autophagy induction. Here we report for the first time not only that the DGKalpha isoform is highly expressed in the nuclei of human erythroleukemia cell line K562, but also that its nuclear activity drives K562 cells through the G1/S transition during cell cycle progression.

However, such patients are not treated simultaneously with antivirals and chemotherapy, owing to overlapping toxicities with previous standard of care treatment of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. AIM: To examine the safety and clinically-significant drug-drug interactions observed in patients who received simultaneous treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and chemotherapy. METHODS: Safety was determined by the presence of adverse events which were graded according to the division of AIDS Table (version 2.0). Adverse events were monitored throughout antiviral treatment and up to 3 months after its completion. Drug-drug interactions were assessed using current online databases. Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as absence of serum HCV RNA 12 weeks after end of DAA treatment. Cirrhosis was diagnosed via imaging, biopsy or with the use of non-invasive fibrosis markers. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received concomitant treatment with DAAs and chemotherapy between January 2013 and September 2016. Concomitant treatment was started either for virological (14; 67%) or oncologic (7; 33%) reasons. DAAs used were sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, simeprevir, daclatasvir +/- ribavirin. The adverse events observed were mainly constitutional (12; 57%), hematological and gastrointestinal (7; 33% each). Physicians changed the DAA regimens in two patients (10%) in anticipation of drug-drug interactions with daclatasvir and dexamethasone. The overall SVR rate was 95% (20/21). CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus-targeted antiviral therapy can be used concomitantly with selected anti-neoplastic agents under close monitoring for drug-drug interactions.

Circulating miRNA level assessed in body fluids commonly reflects their expression in tumor cells. In leukemias, however, both leukemic and nonleukemic cells compose circulating miRNA expression profile of peripheral blood. The latter contribution to extracellular miRNA pool may result in specific microenvironmental signaling, which promotes proliferation and survival. In our study, we used qT-PCR to assay peripheral blood serum of 22 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients for the expression of 84 miRNAs associated with activation and differentiation of B and T lymphocytes. Results were analyzed regarding the most important prognostic factors. We have found that the general expression of examined miRNAs in CLL patients was lower as compared to healthy volunteers. Only miR-34a-5p, miR31-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-15a-3p, and miR-29a-3p were expressed on a higher level. Alterations of expression observed in CLL patients involved miRNAs associated both with B and T lymphocyte differentiation and activation.

A reciprocal chromosomal translocation proceeding to the 'Philadelphia chromosome', involving the ABL proto-oncogene and BCR gene residing on Chromosome 9 and 22 respectively, is observed to be attributed to CML pathogenesis. Recent studies have been unraveling the crucial role of genomic 'dark matter' or the non-coding repertoire in cancer initiation and progression. The intricate cross-talk between competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) provides a scaffold to systematically functionalize the miRNA response element harboring non-coding RNAs and incorporate them with the protein-coding RNA dimension in complex ceRNA networks. This network of coding and non-coding transcriptome linked by shared miRNAs evidently offers a platform to elucidate the complex regulatory interactions at the post-transcriptional level in human cancers. In this context, analyzing CML, from the perspective of the ceRNA hypothesis, surely craves intensive attention and a comprehensive discussion. Here, we performed RNA-seq data analysis to retrieve Lymphoblastoid and CML coding as well as non-coding repertoire and constructed a ceRNA network for the CML cell line, considering the non-cancer lymphoblastoid cell line as the control. We investigated if any alteration exists in the ceRNA landscape of the transcripts which are exhibiting differential expression across the two cell lines and observed that the major ceRNA regulators vary in cancer network when compared with the Lymphoblastoid network. The top ranked significant functional modules in the ceRNA network display cancer associated attributes and reveal putative regulators in CML pathogenesis.",,"['Sen, Kamalika', 'Sarkar, Arijita', 'Maji, Ranjan Kumar', 'Ghosh, Zhumur', 'Gupta, Sanjib', 'Ghosh, Tapash Chandra']","['Sen K', 'Sarkar A', 'Maji RK', 'Ghosh Z', 'Gupta S', 'Ghosh TC']","['Bioinformatics Centre, Bose Institute, P 1/12, C.I.T.

Whereas several fusion proteins induce leukemogenesis by activating Hox gene expression (Hox-activating fusions), others impinge on different pathways that do not involve the activation of Hox genes (non-Hox-activating fusions). It has been postulated that one of the main oncogenic properties of the HOXA9 transcription factor is its ability to control the expression of the p16/p19 tumor suppressor locus (Cdkn2a), thereby compensating Polycomb-mediated repression, which is dispensable for leukemias induced by Hox-activating fusions. We show, by genetically depleting the H2A ubiquitin ligase subunits of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), Ring1a and Ring1b, that Hoxa9 activation cannot repress Cdkn2a expression in the absence of PRC1 and its dependent deposition of H2AK119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119Ub). This demonstrates the essential role of PRC1 activity in supporting the oncogenic potential of Hox-activating fusion proteins. By combining genetic tools with genome-wide location and transcription analyses, we further show that PRC1 activity is required for the leukemogenic potential of both Hox-activating and non-Hox-activating fusions, thus preventing the differentiation of leukemic cells independently of the expression of the Cdkn2a locus. Overall, our results genetically demonstrate that PRC1 activity and the deposition of H2AK119Ub are critical factors that maintain the undifferentiated identity of cancer cells, positively sustaining the progression of different types of leukemia.",,"['Rossi, Alessandra', 'Ferrari, Karin J', 'Piunti, Andrea', 'Jammula, SriGanesh', 'Chiacchiera, Fulvio', 'Mazzarella, Luca', 'Scelfo, Andrea', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Pasini, Diego']","['Rossi A', 'Ferrari KJ', 'Piunti A', 'Jammula S', 'Chiacchiera F', 'Mazzarella L', 'Scelfo A', 'Pelicci PG', 'Pasini D']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.; Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161007,United States,Sci Adv,Science advances,101653440,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['MLL-AF9', 'PRC1', 'Polycomb', 'histone modifications', 'leukemia']",2016/10/13 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2016/10/13 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1126/sciadv.1600972 [doi]', '1600972 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Adv. 2016 Oct 7;2(10):e1600972. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.1600972. eCollection 2016 Oct.,,,PMC5055382,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3344-8755', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9879-6486']",,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have evaluated the cytotoxicity of 17 methanol extracts from 11 Cameroonian medicinal plants against the sensitive leukemia CCRF-CEM cells and the best ones were further tested on a panel of 8 other human cancer cell lines, including various MDR phenotypes as well as against the normal AML12 hepatocytes. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of the extracts was determined using a resazurin reduction assay meanwhile flow cytometry was used to measure cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reactive oxygen species. RESULTS: In an initial screening using leukemia CCRF-CEM cells, ten extracts from five plants namely Alchornea floribunda, Annona muricata, Euphorbia prostata, Pachypodanthium staudtii and Passiflora edulis displayed IC50 values below 20 microg/mL. They were further tested in 8 other cell lines as well as in normal AML12 hepatocytes. All selected extracts were active against leukemia CEM/ADR5000 cells with IC50 value below 40 microg/mL. IC50 values ranging from 10.13 microg/mL (towards CEM/ADR5000 cells) to 72.01 microg/mL [towards resistant colon carcinoma HCT116 (p53(-/-)) cells] for Pachypodanthium staudtii roots and from 0.11 microg/mL (towards CCRF-CEM cells) to 108 microg/mL (towards P-glycoprotein-over-expressing CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin were obtained in the eight other cancer cell lines studied. Extracts from Annona muricata leaves (AML) and seeds (AMS), and Passiflora edulis fruit (PEF) had IC50 values below 1 microg/mL against CCRF-CEM cells and below 10 microg/mL against its MDR subline CEM/ADR5000 cells. AML, AMS and PEF induced MMP-loss-mediated apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study suggest that some of the tested plants namely Alchornea floribunda, Annona muricata, Euphorbia prostata, Pachypodanthium staudtii and Passiflora edulis represent a source of anticancer drugs. Annona muricata and Passiflora edulis are good cytotoxic plants that could be exploited to develop phytomedicine to fight mostly hematological cancers including MDR phenotypes.",,"['Kuete, Victor', 'Dzotam, Joachim K', 'Voukeng, Igor K', 'Fankam, Aime G', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Dzotam JK', 'Voukeng IK', 'Fankam AG', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, 55128 Mainz, Germany ; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, P.O.

To assess the safety and influences of pre-transplant HMT focusing on debulking effects and transplant outcomes, we retrospectively analyzed consecutive HSCT-eligible patients who received HMT for higher-risk MDS with excess blasts. Of all 98 patients, 11 patients failed to proceed to HSCT and HMT-related mortality occurred in 8 patients. When excluding 9 patients who refused HSCT, 87% of scheduled HSCT (77 of 89) was performed after a median of 3 cycles (range, 1-8) of HMT. The 4-year overall survival after HMT (n = 98) and HSCT (n = 77) was 44.0% and 53.6%, respectively. Transplant outcomes were significantly different by the final response at HSCT; marrow response group (complete remission, marrow complete remission with or without hematologic improvement) showed significantly better 4-year disease-free survival compared to no marrow response group (n = 36, 87.3% vs. n = 41, 10.7%, P < 0.001). This difference between the groups was also evident in overall survival (90.9% vs. 8.6%, P < 0.001) and cumulative incidences of relapse (6.5% vs. 45.4%, P < 0.001) and treatment-related mortality (6.2% vs. 43.9%, P < 0.001). These observations indicate that pre-transplant HMT is a feasible bridging treatment in patients with excess blasts regarding high success rate of proceeding to transplantation and good survival rate.

In contrast, jaceosidin does not induce apoptosis in normal human umbilical vein cells (EA.hy926).

In an effort to characterize demographics, treatment modalities, and prognostic factors, we performed a systematic review. METHODS: We systematically reviewed EMBASE, Medline, TRIPdatabase, SCOPUS and the Cochrane database for invasive fungal nasal and sinus infections limited to individuals <18 years of age. Case series including 3 or more patients were included. Demographics, treatment and outcomes were analyzed using R Gui statistical software. RESULTS: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria (103 patients). There was male preponderance of 48.5% with median age of 11 years old. Majority of patients had underlying leukemia (44.6%). Aspergillus was the predominant organism (47%). Isolated nasal findings occurred in 14% of patients and nasal findings occurred in 49% overall. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of immunocompromised patients was below 600 in most patients (99%). Average and median length of neutropenia was 2 weeks. All patients were prescribed amphoterocin with 50% as single medicinal therapy. Surgery occurred in 82.8% of cases. The mortality rate was 46%. Univariate analysis identified presenting with facial pain as a negative predictor of overall mortality (OR 0.296, 95% CI: 0.104-0.843, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mortality remains high in pediatric patients with IFS. An ANC of <600 occurred in the majority of immunocompromised patients at a duration of 2 weeks. Presenting with facial pain was a negative predictor of mortality. Many studies label this condition as invasive fungal sinusitis; however, approximately one seventh presented with only nasal findings and half overall had nasal involvement.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We introduce a mechanism-based strategy to enhance PARPi efficacy based on DNA damage-related binding between DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and PARP1. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and breast cancer cells, DNMT inhibitors (DNMTis) alone covalently bind DNMTs into DNA and increase PARP1 tightly bound into chromatin. Low doses of DNMTis plus PARPis, versus each drug alone, increase PARPi efficacy, increasing amplitude and retention of PARP1 directly at laser-induced DNA damage sites. This correlates with increased DNA damage, synergistic tumor cytotoxicity, blunting of self-renewal, and strong anti-tumor responses, in vivo in unfavorable AML subtypes and BRCA wild-type breast cancer cells.

Instead, syngeneic CLL transplantation of CLL cells into Lyn- or Btk-deficient recipients results in a strongly delayed leukemic progression and prolonged survival.

We analyzed economic risks in hospitalized patients with CLL from a management perspective. METHODS: One hundred and twelve patients with CLL hospitalized in 2013 and 2014 at the University Hospital of Cologne were analyzed. To assess profit margins (PMs) per case, diagnosis-related group (DRG) reimbursement data were merged with an internal cost accounting scheme depending on age, prognostic factors, and DRG key performance indicators. RESULTS: In 112 patients, 284 cases coded by 19 different DRG with strongly fluctuating cost revenue ratios were found with an overall negative PM of euro137 147. The DRG R61H was identified as the one most commonly coded (174 cases, 61.3%) with a deficit per case of euro814. Subanalysis demonstrated that the payments were not cost covering due to excessive length of stay and staff costs. Significant differences in PM per case concerning age, length of stay and number of operation and procedure key (OPS) codes (P < 0.05) were found. CONCLUSION: In our research-driven tertiary care hospital, inpatient treatment of patients with CLL is not cost covering.

In addition, Plzf is a prominent candidate gene for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). In the current study, we tested the effects of Plzf gene targeting in the SHR using TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases). SHR ova were microinjected with constructs pTAL438/439 coding for a sequence-specific endonuclease that binds to target sequence in the first coding exon of the Plzf gene. Out of 43 animals born after microinjection, we detected a single male founder. Sequence analysis revealed a deletion of G that resulted in frame shift mutation starting in codon 31 and causing a premature stop codon at position of amino acid 58. The Plzftm1Ipcv allele is semi-lethal since approximately 95% of newborn homozygous animals died perinatally. All homozygous animals exhibited manifestations of a caudal regression syndrome including tail anomalies and serious size reduction and deformities of long bones, and oligo- or polydactyly on the hindlimbs. The heterozygous animals only exhibited the tail anomalies. Impaired development of the urinary tract was also revealed: one homozygous and one heterozygous rat exhibited a vesico-ureteric reflux with enormous dilatation of ureters and renal pelvis. In the homozygote, this was combined with a hypoplastic kidney. These results provide evidence for the important role of Plzf gene during development of the caudal part of a body-column vertebrae, hindlimbs and urinary system in the rat.",,"['Liska, Frantisek', 'Peterkova, Renata', 'Peterka, Miroslav', 'Landa, Vladimir', 'Zidek, Vaclav', 'Mlejnek, Petr', 'Silhavy, Jan', 'Simakova, Miroslava', 'Kren, Vladimir', 'Starker, Colby G', 'Voytas, Daniel F', 'Izsvak, Zsuzsanna', 'Pravenec, Michal']","['Liska F', 'Peterkova R', 'Peterka M', 'Landa V', 'Zidek V', 'Mlejnek P', 'Silhavy J', 'Simakova M', 'Kren V', 'Starker CG', 'Voytas DF', 'Izsvak Z', 'Pravenec M']","['Institute of Biology and Medical Genetics, 1st Medical Faculty, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Medicine, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Medicine, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Biology and Medical Genetics, 1st Medical Faculty, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Biology and Medical Genetics, 1st Medical Faculty, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Experimental Medicine, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161011,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (ZBTB16 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.- (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases)']",IM,['PLoS One. 2020 Jan 16;15(1):e0228139.

Regardless of disease origin, good clinical effects are dependent on proper immune reconstitution. T cells are responsible for both the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect against malignant cells and protection against infections. The immune recovery of T cells relies initially on peripheral expansion of mature cells from the graft and later on the differentiation and maturation from donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells. The formation of new T cells occurs in the thymus and as a byproduct, T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) are released upon rearrangement of the T cell receptor. Detection of TRECs by PCR is a reliable method for estimating the amount of newly formed T cells in the circulation and, indirectly, for estimating thymic function. Here, we discuss the role of TREC analysis in the prediction of clinical outcome after allogeneic HSCT. Due to the pivotal role of T cell reconstitution we propose that TREC analysis should be included as a key indicator in the post-HSCT follow-up.",,"['Gaballa, Ahmed', 'Sundin, Mikael', 'Stikvoort, Arwen', 'Abumaree, Muhamed', 'Uzunel, Mehmet', 'Sairafi, Darius', 'Uhlin, Michael']","['Gaballa A', 'Sundin M', 'Stikvoort A', 'Abumaree M', 'Uzunel M', 'Sairafi D', 'Uhlin M']","['Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.

We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of the efficacy of mogamulizumab in ATL treatment in patients on Hokkaido Island, Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 125 patients with ATL treated from January 2010 to December 2014 in 20 hospitals affiliated with the Hokkaido Hematology Study Group were enrolled in the present retrospective study. RESULTS: Of the 125 ATL patients, 62 (46.6%) presented with the acute type, 51 (38.3%) with the lymphoma type, and 12 (9.0%) with the chronic type; the latter group included 7 unfavorable chronic cases. The median age at diagnosis was 68 years (range, 35-86 years). The median survival for those with acute, lymphoma, and unfavorable chronic types was 302, 279, and 921 days, respectively. Advanced age, high lactate dehydrogenase level, poor performance status (3-4), and the existence of B symptoms were unfavorable prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). Survival rate calculated from the day of diagnosis was significantly higher in patients treated with mogamulizumab. The OS of individuals receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was superior to that of the non-HSCT group. The median interval between the last mogamulizumab dose and allogeneic HSCT was 38 days (range, 21-53 days). Of the 22 HSCT recipients who were not treated with mogamulizumab, overall acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and grade III-IV aGVHD occurred in 12 (54.5%) and 3 (13.6%) patients, respectively. However, overall aGVHD and grade III-IV aGVHD developed in 8 (88.9%) and 3 (33.3%) of the 9 HSCT recipients treated with mogamulizumab, respectively. CONCLUSION: Mogamulizumab improves OS in patients with ATL, although its use in HSCT patients might trigger severe GVHD. Determining the optimal pre-HSCT mogamulizumab treatment regimen is thus a priority.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, most investigations were carried out clinically or radiographically and updated exhaustive, comprehensive autopsy studies are lacking. In our study, we aimed to assess the relationship between malignancy and grade of atherosclerosis in different locations (general, coronary) in a large study population over the course of 14 years. METHODS: 2370 patients (autopsy reports) were analyzed retrospectively in regard to various parameters including demographics, organ weights, distribution and severity of atherosclerosis and presence or absence of malignancy. RESULTS: Our study shows that malignant disease is usually associated with less general and coronary atherosclerosis (p=0.002 and p<0.001). Especially breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancer as well as lymphomas/lymphoid leukaemia and sarcomas were associated with significantly less general and coronary AS (p-values<0.001-0.031). In addition, a positive correlation between coronary atherosclerosis and heart weight could be detected (rho=0.302, p<0.001). As a common observation, male sex was associated with increased severity of general and coronary atherosclerosis in both cancer and non-cancer groups (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that an inverse correlation between atherosclerosis and cancer in general is still sound today despite tremendous changes and advances in therapy strategies and diagnostics. Additionally, we could highlight that the effect was most pronounced in breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancer, sarcomas and lymphomas/lymphoid leukaemia.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Acidic and basic dyes had allowed him to recognize eosinophil and basophil granules, respectively, work that was a direct continuation of his discovery of the tissue mast cell described in his doctoral thesis. Ehrlich went on to develop neutral dyes that identified epsilon granules in neutrophils (""cells with polymorphous nuclei""). He also speculated, for the most part correctly, on the formation, function, and fate of blood neutrophils and eosinophils. Before Ehrlich, a number of important observations had been made on white cells and their role in health and disease. Among the most notable were William Hewson's studies of blood and lymph; the early descriptions of leukemia by Alfred Donne, John Hughes Bennett, Rudolf Virchow, and others; as well as seminal observations on inflammation by William Addison, Friedrich von Recklinghausen, and Julius Cohnheim. Eosinophils were almost certainly recognized previously by others. In 1846, Thomas Wharton Jones (1808-1891) described ""granule blood-cells"" in several species including humans. The term ""granule cell"" had also been used by Julius Vogel (1814-1880), who had previously observed similar cells in inflammatory exudates. Vogel, in turn, was aware of the work of Gottlieb Gluge (1812-1898), who had observed ""compound inflammatory globules"" in pus and serum that resembled eosinophils. Almost 20 years before Ehrlich developed his staining methods, Max Johann Schultze (1825-1874) performed functional experiments on fine and coarse granular cells using a warm stage microscopic technique and showed they had amoeboid movement and phagocytic abilities. Despite these earlier observations, it was Ehrlich's use of stains that heralded the modern era of studies of leukocyte biology and pathology.",,"['Kay, A Barry']",['Kay AB'],"['Inflammation, Repair, and Development, National Heart & Lung Institute, Imperial College, London, SW3 2AZ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Microbiol Spectr,Microbiology spectrum,101634614,,IM,,"['Allergy and Immunology/*history', 'Animals', 'Cytological Techniques/*methods', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'History, 19th Century', 'Humans', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods']",,,2016/10/12 06:00,2017/07/06 06:00,['2016/10/12 06:00'],"['2016/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1128/microbiolspec.MCHD-0032-2016 [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Spectr. 2016 Aug;4(4). doi: 10.1128/microbiolspec.MCHD-0032-2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is composed of a combination of hematopoietic red marrow and fatty yellow marrow, and its composition changes throughout life in response to normal maturation (red to yellow conversion) and stress (yellow to red reconversion). MR imaging is highly sensitive for detection of altered marrow signal intensity, and the T1-weighted spin-echo sequence provides the most robust contrast between yellow marrow and disease. Heterogeneous red marrow and red marrow hyperplasia can mimic marrow disease, but should be distinguished from neoplastic replacement (leukemia, lymphoma, primary bone sarcomas, hematogenous metastases) and expected posttreatment changes (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, colony-stimulating factor, bone marrow transplant). Nonneoplastic edema-like processes can also alter marrow signal intensity, including trauma, infection, inflammation (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, juvenile inflammatory arthritis), altered biomechanics, and chronic regional pain syndrome. Unfortunately, MR imaging findings are often nonspecific and overlap among many of these vastly different causes. Therefore, a definitive diagnosis is reliant on a combination of imaging findings, clinical evaluation, laboratory assessment, and occasionally tissue analysis.

To investigate the influence of dasatinib on signal transduction pathways, we investigated the changes in JAK-STAT, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and AKT in cytotoxic lymphocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), before and after dasatinib treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Among a total of 30 patients, 18 were treated with dasatinib, nine with imatinib, and three with nilotinib. At constitutive levels, the expression of phosphorylated proteins, pSTAT1, pSTAT3, and pERK in NK cells and pSTAT3 in CTLs, was significantly higher in dasatinib-treated patients. Among the patients evaluated, only dasatinib-treated patients showed inhibition of multiple signaling pathways after taking a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The magnitude of pERK and pAKT inhibition was closely associated with an increase in NK cells and CTLs, respectively, after taking a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Those responses were more evident in patients with cytomegalovirus IgG positivity.

However, few have investigated treatment-induced changes in neurocognitive function during the first months of treatment. Additionally, dysfunction during treatment may be preceded by changes in biomarkers measured within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Identification of acute declines in neurocognitive function, as well as predictive genotypes or biomarkers, could guide therapeutic trials of protective interventions. METHODS: This study collects CSF while prospectively assessing neurocognitive functioning (working memory, executive function, learning, processing speed, and attention) of ALL patients using the Cogstate computerized battery at six time points during and after the 2 years of leukemia treatment on a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium trial. RESULTS: Baseline data collected during the first 3 weeks of induction chemotherapy indicate reliable data as all subjects (N = 34) completed Cogstate baseline testing, while completion and performance checks indicate that 100 % of subjects completed testing and complied with test requirements. The majority (85 %) exhibited normal function compared with age peers. Preliminary analysis of CSF biomarkers (folate, homocysteine, 8-isoprostane, and myelin basic protein) similarly reveals values at baseline within expected normal ranges. CONCLUSIONS: The first month of induction therapy for ALL is a reliable baseline for detecting treatment-induced changes in neurocognitive functioning.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 323 specimens of hematolymphoid malignancies using six-colored flow cytometry (FC) was carried out in Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan from June 2012 to June 2016. The criterion for specimen adequacy was that the cases have abnormal populations by FC, and the specimen age (time from biopsy to being examined by the six-color FC tube) of three days or less was to be included in the study. Clinical follow-up of greater than six months was required for a negative flow cytometric study without a subsequent biopsy. Data analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare diagnosis with some antibodies used. RESULTS: The number of specimen within certain age groups included were: 0-15 years; 111 (34.3%), 16-30 years; 65 (20.12%), 31-45 years; 47 (14.5%), 46-60 years; 46 (14.2%) and >/= 60 years; 54 (16.7%). Hematological malignancies were documented in descending order of sequence with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (27.9%), acute myeloid leukemia (26.3%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (13.3%), T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (7.7%), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (5%), hairy cell leukemia (1.9%), chronic myeloid leukemia (0.3%), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (0.6%) and plasma cell dyscrasias (0.6%). The mean number of antibodies used were 12.68 +/- 2.97. One-way ANOVA was used to compare diagnosis with some antibodies used. Statistical significance was found between diagnosis and number of antibodies used (F= 5.23 p<0.001). CONCLUSION: B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is most commonly diagnosed at tertiary care units in Pakistan using six-colored flow cytometry.

However, the mechanisms whereby ephA2/ephirnA1 signaling regulates miR-302b expression and attenuates malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cell growth are not known. Our study identified a novel mechanism of ephrin-A1 mediated anti-oncogenic signaling in MPM. Ephrin-A1 treatment up regulates miR-302b expression in MPM cells and attenuates cell proliferation and tumorsphere formation via repression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). The expression of miR-302b was analyzed by qPCR, the expression of Mcl-1 was analyzed by RT-PCR, immuno-blotting and Immunofluorescence staining. To confirm that ephrin-A1 regulates the expression of Mcl-1 mRNA through miR-302b up regulation, cells were transfected with and without miR-302b and miR-302b inhibitor prior to ephrinA1 treatment. The cell proliferation and tumorsphere formation was measured by WST-1 and matrigel assays respectively. In addition, to confirm the binding of miR-302b to the 3'UTR of Mcl-1 Luciferase assay was performed. Ephrin-A1 treatment induced several fold increases of miR-302b expression in MM cells. In ephrin-A1 treated MM cells, Mcl-1 expression was significantly down regulated when compared to control. Moreover, ephrin-A1 activation significantly inhibited MM cell proliferation and tumorsphere growth. Furthermore, ephrinA1 and miR-302b induced apoptosis in MM cells. The present data suggests that ephrin-A1 induces the expression of miR-302b in MM cells which targets Mcl-1 thereby inhibits MM tumorsphere growth by inducing apoptosis.",,"['Khodayari, Nazli', 'Mohammed, Kamal A', 'Lee, Hungyen', 'Kaye, Frederick', 'Nasreen, Najmunnisa']","['Khodayari N', 'Mohammed KA', 'Lee H', 'Kaye F', 'Nasreen N']","['Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Florida Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of FloridaGainesville, Florida, USA; NF/SG Veterans Health System, Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of FloridaGainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of FloridaGainesville, Florida, USA; NF/SG Veterans Health System, Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of FloridaGainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Hematology Oncology-Cancer Center, University of Florida Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of FloridaGainesville, Florida, USA; NF/SG Veterans Health System, Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of FloridaGainesville, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160901,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EphA2', 'EphrinA1', 'Malignant pleural mesothelioma', 'Mcl-1', 'miR-302b']",2016/10/12 06:00,2016/10/12 06:01,['2016/10/12 06:00'],"['2016/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2016 Sep 1;6(9):1996-2009. eCollection 2016.,,,PMC5043109,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poor clinical outcomes have been associated with overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, which have garnered great interest as therapeutic targets. While the Bcl-2-selective inhibitor ABT-199 has demonstrated promising preclinical anti-leukemic activities, intrinsic drug resistance remains a problem. In our most recent study, we identified Mcl-1 sequestration of Bim as a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to ABT-199 in AML cells, thus upregulating Bim could overcome such resistance. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACI) are a class of agents that have been confirmed to upregulate Bim. This prompted our hypothesis that combining an HDACI with ABT-199 would overcome intrinsic resistance to ABT-199 and result in synergistic anti-leukemic activity against AML. In this study, we investigated the anti-leukemic activity of panobinostat, a pan-HDACI, in combination with ABT-199 in AML cell lines and primary patient samples. We found that the combined drug treatment resulted in synergistic induction of cell death in both AML cell lines and primary patient samples. Panobinostat treatment resulted in upregulation of Bim, which remained elevated in the presence of ABT-199. In addition, shRNA knockdown of Bim in AML cell lines significantly attenuated apoptosis induced by combined panobinostat and ABT-199. Our results provide compelling evidence that Bim plays a key role in the combined anti-leukemic activity of panobinostat and ABT-199 against AML, and support clinical evaluation of combined panobinostat and ABT-199 in the treatment of AML.",,"['Schwartz, Jonathan', 'Niu, Xiaojia', 'Walton, Eric', 'Hurley, Laura', 'Lin, Hai', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Wang, Zhihong', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Schwartz J', 'Niu X', 'Walton E', 'Hurley L', 'Lin H', 'Edwards H', 'Taub JW', 'Wang Z', 'Ge Y']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan Detroit, MI, USA."", 'National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology & Engineering, The Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University Changchun, China.', 'MD/PhD Program, School of Medicine, Wayne State University Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Graduate Program, School of Medicine, Wayne State University Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Hospital of Jilin University Changchun, China.', 'Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, School of Medicine, Wayne State UniversityDetroit, MI, USA; Department of Oncology, School of Medicine, Wayne State UniversityDetroit, MI, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of MichiganDetroit, MI, USA; Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Wayne State UniversityDetroit, MI, USA."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of MichiganDetroit, MI, USA; Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Wayne State UniversityDetroit, MI, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Wayne State UniversityDetroit, MI, USA; Molecular Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, School of Medicine, Wayne State UniversityDetroit, MI, USA; Department of Oncology, School of Medicine, Wayne State UniversityDetroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160915,United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-199', 'Bcl-2', 'Bim', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'panobinostat']",2016/10/12 06:00,2016/10/12 06:01,['2016/10/12 06:00'],"['2016/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2016 Sep 15;8(9):3893-3902. eCollection 2016.,,['T32 CA009531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5040686,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effects of WZ811 on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells have not yet been defined. The effect of WZ811 on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells TF-1 and UT-7 cells in proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration in vitro were measured respectively. Decreased in cell viability, colony formation, migration, and survival with cell cycle arrest and higher sensitivity to docetaxel in vitro was observed upon WZ811 treatment. In mouse xenograft models developed with human leukemia cells, WZ811 exhibited tumor growth inhibition.

Cyr61 is overexpressed in human tumors and is involved in the development of tumors. However, the role that Cyr61 plays in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells remains undetermined. The aim of this study was to identify the role of Cyr61 in regulating ALL cell survival. Here, we found that the level of Cyr61 was increased in the plasma and bone marrow (BM) from ALL patients compared with samples from normal control patients. Furthermore, we observed that Cyr61 could effectively stimulate Jurkat (T ALL cell lines), Nalm-6 (B ALL cell lines), and primary ALL cell survival.

However, several features of LSCs have recently been challenged. It has become increasingly evident that LSC phenotypes vary among patients. Technical variation of xenograft assays also affects the results, with a trend for more immunodeficient strains allowing the engraftment of variable LSC populations. Studies using mouse leukemia models have shown that not all leukemias are driven by rare and primitive LSCs, instead containing a large population of LSCs expressing mature markers.

The exhausted T cells are characterized phenotypically by the surface expression of immunoinhibitory receptors, such as programmed death 1 (PD-1), lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). However, there is still a fundamental lack of knowledge about the immunoinhibitory receptors in the fields of veterinary medicine. In particular, very little is known about mechanism of T cell dysfunction in chronic infection in cattle. Recent our studies have revealed that immunoinhibitory molecules including PD-1/ programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) play critical roles in immune exhaustion and disease progression in case of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, Johne's disease and bovine anaplasmosis.

The expression and function of SIRT1 may differ completely depending on cell type and gene subtype, and it can act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene. We describe how SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels are overexpressed in t(8;21) AML cells. AML1-ETO triggers the activation of SIRT1 by binding at AML1 binding sites on the SIRT1 promoter. Pharmacologic targeting or RNAi-mediated inhibition of SIRT1 induces G1 arrest, apoptosis, and proliferation inhibition that is more sensitive in AML1-ETO-positive than AML1-ETO-negative cell lines.

We examined the relationship between maternal diet quality before pregnancy, as summarised by a diet quality index, and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in a case-control study in California. Dietary intake in the year before pregnancy was assessed using FFQ in 681 ALL cases, 103 AML cases and 1076 matched controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate OR and 95 % CI for diet quality continuous score and quartiles (Q1-Q4). Higher maternal diet quality score was associated with reduced risk of ALL (OR 0.66; 95 % CI 0.47, 0.93 for Q4 v. Q1) and possibly AML (OR 0.42; 95 % CI 0.15, 1.15 for Q4 v. Q1). No single index component appeared to account for the association. The association of maternal diet quality with risk of ALL was stronger in children diagnosed under the age of 5 years and in children of women who did not report using vitamin supplements before pregnancy.

A broad spectrum of molecular techniques has been employed so far, including both direct Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing. Oxford Nanopore Technologies recently released the MinION an USB-interfaced sequencer. In this paper we report our experience, with the MinION technology for the detection of the TP53 gene mutation in CLL patients. Twelve CLL patients at diagnosis were included in this study. All except one patient showed the TP53 gene deletion in Fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments. Patients were investigated for TP53 mutation by Sanger and by MinION sequencing. Analysis by Sanger was performed according with the IARC protocol. Analysis by MinION was performed adopting a strategy based on long template PCR, read error correction, and post variant calling filtering. RESULTS: Due to the high error rate of nanopore technology, sequence data were both used directly and before correction with two different in silico methods: ALEC and nanocorrect. A mean error rate of 15 % was detected before correction that was reduced to 4-5 % after correction. Analysis by Sanger sequencing was able to detect four patients mutated for TP53. MinION analysis detected one more mutated patient previously not detected from Sanger. CONCLUSION: In our hands, the Nanopore technology shows correlation with Sanger sequencing but more sensitive, manageable and less expensive, and therefore has proven to be a useful tool for TP53 gene mutation detection.",,"['Minervini, Crescenzio Francesco', 'Cumbo, Cosimo', 'Orsini, Paola', 'Brunetti, Claudia', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Minervini, Angela', 'Casieri, Paola', 'Coccaro, Nicoletta', 'Tota, Giuseppina', 'Impera, Luciana', 'Giordano, Annamaria', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Minervini CF', 'Cumbo C', 'Orsini P', 'Brunetti C', 'Anelli L', 'Zagaria A', 'Minervini A', 'Casieri P', 'Coccaro N', 'Tota G', 'Impera L', 'Giordano A', 'Specchia G', 'Albano F']","['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.)

Recently, a relapse case report of AML extramedullary disease has showed that AML cells harboring DNMT3A variation were detected in the cerebral spinal fluid. However, whether a causal relationship exists between DNMT3A mutation (D3Amut) and extramedullary infiltration (EMI) is unclear. METHODS: We took advantage of DNMT3A (R882C) mutation-carrying AML cell strain, that is, OCI-AML3, assessing its migration ability in vitro and in vivo. By RNA interfering technology and a xenograft mouse model, we evaluated the effect of DNMT3A mutation on cell mobility and explored the possible mechanism. RESULTS: OCI-AML3 displayed extraordinary migration ability in vitro and infiltrated into meninges of NOD/SCID mice after intravenous transfusion. We found that this leukemic migration or infiltration capacity was significantly compromised by the knockdown of DNMT3A mutant.

PATIENT AND METHOD: Thirty-four patients with acute leukemia and lacking a match donor were treated with alphabeta T-cell-depleted allografts from haploidentical family donors. A total of 24 patients had acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 10 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 84.4% of patients were in the high-risk group, and 55.9% were not in remission. The preparative regimen included thiotepa, melphalan, fludarabine, and anti-thymocyte globulin-Fresenius. Grafts were peripheral blood stem cells engineered by TcR-alpha/beta depletion. RESULTS: Neutrophil and platelet engraftment was achieved on days +12 (range, 10.5-15) and +11 (range, 10-12). All but three patients were engrafted with full donor chimerism. Grade III-IV acute GVHD occurred in two (5.9%) patients and chronic GVHD in two (6.1%). Disease-free survival and overall survival were 42 and 54% at 1 year, respectively. AML as disease type (HR: 4.87, 95% CI: 1.50-15.87) and mother as donor (HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.11) were found to be independent risk factors on patient survival. Mortality and NRM in the first 100 days were 5 of 34 (14.7%) and 4 of 34 (11.7%). Relapse was the main cause of death (56.3%). T-cell reconstitution appears to be faster than that reported in published data with CD3/CD19-depleted grafts. CONCLUSION: alphabeta T-cell-depleted haploidentical transplantation may be a good alternative for high-risk patients if there are no human leukocyte antigen matched donors.",,"['Kaynar, Leylagul', 'Demir, Koray', 'Turak, Esra Ermis', 'Ozturk, Cigdem Pala', 'Zararsiz, Gokmen', 'Gonen, Zeynep Burcin', 'Gokahmetoglu, Selma', 'Sivgin, Serdar', 'Eser, Bulent', 'Koker, Yavuz', 'Solmaz, Musa', 'Unal, Ali', 'Cetin, Mustafa']","['Kaynar L', 'Demir K', 'Turak EE', 'Ozturk CP', 'Zararsiz G', 'Gonen ZB', 'Gokahmetoglu S', 'Sivgin S', 'Eser B', 'Koker Y', 'Solmaz M', 'Unal A', 'Cetin M']","['a Hematology Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'a Hematology Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'a Hematology Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'a Hematology Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'b Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital , Ankara , Turkey.', 'c Biostatistics Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'd Genome and Stem Cell Center (GENKOK) , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'e Microbiology Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'a Hematology Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'a Hematology Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'f Immunology Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'a Hematology Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'a Hematology Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.', 'a Hematology Department, Medical Faculty , Erciyes University , Kayseri , Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161010,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics/immunology', '*Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/mortality/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['haploidentical transplantation', 'immune reconstitution', 'alphabeta T cell depletion']",2016/10/12 06:00,2017/04/07 06:00,['2016/10/12 06:00'],"['2016/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2016.1238182 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2017 Apr;22(3):136-144. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2016.1238182.

However, the lack of a genetic diversification approach has impeded our ability to interrogate functions of genetic variants in mammalian cells. Current screening methods can only be used to disrupt a gene or alter its expression. Here we report the fusion of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) with nuclease-inactive clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (dCas9) for efficient genetic diversification, which enabled high-throughput screening of functional variants. Guided by single guide (sg)RNAs, dCas9-AID-P182X (AIDx) directly changed cytidines or guanines to the other three bases independent of AID hotspot motifs, generating a large repertoire of variants at desired loci. Coupled with a uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor, dCas9-AIDx converted targeted cytidines specifically to thymines, creating specific point mutations. By targeting BCR-ABL with dCas9-AIDx, we efficiently identified known and new mutations conferring imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Thus, targeted AID-mediated mutagenesis (TAM) provides a forward genetic tool to screen for gain-of-function variants at base resolution.",,"['Ma, Yunqing', 'Zhang, Jiayuan', 'Yin, Weijie', 'Zhang, Zhenchao', 'Song, Yan', 'Chang, Xing']","['Ma Y', 'Zhang J', 'Yin W', 'Zhang Z', 'Song Y', 'Chang X']","['Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences &Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTUSM), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences &Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTUSM), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences &Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTUSM), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences &Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTUSM), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences &Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTUSM), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161010,United States,Nat Methods,Nature methods,101215604,"['0 (CRISPR-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Guide)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,,"['CRISPR-Associated Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/*genetics', 'Cytidine Deaminase/chemistry/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Targeting', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', '*Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', '*RNA, Guide', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/*genetics']",,,2016/11/01 06:00,2017/05/27 06:00,['2016/11/08 06:00'],"['2016/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['nmeth.4027 [pii]', '10.1038/nmeth.4027 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Methods. 2016 Dec;13(12):1029-1035. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.4027.

It was a prospective observational study that included all the episodes of inpatients with febrile neutropenia (February 1997- November 2014), also including the first episode in a same patient in different hospitalizations. Of 946 episodes here included, 821 presented high risk febrile neutropenia. A total of 264 cases (27.9%) received levofloxacin prophylaxis. This group consisted of a higher proportion of high risk febrile neutropenia (99.2% vs. 82.3%, p = 0.0001) and patients that had received an hematopoietic stem cell transplant (67.8% vs. 29.3%, p = 0.0001) compared to those who didn't receive prophylaxis.

This study aims to compare the efficacy between reduced-intensity idarubicin plus cytarabine and daunorubicin plus cytarabine (IA regimen and DA regimen, respectively) in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 74 patients with newly diagnosed non-M3 AML aged >60 years, where 33 patients received IA regimen, 30 patients received DA regimen, while 11 patients received supportive treatment. We observed the complete remission (CR) rates, overall survival (OS) and side effects in different arms. RESULTS: The CR rate in IA arm (70.4 %, 19/27) was significantly higher than that in DA arm (40 %, 10/25) in de novo AML (p = 0.028), and further significantly higher when white blood cell (WBC) count >10 x 10(9)/L (p = 0.042) and ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) score <2 (p = 0.021). The overall survival of the entire population was poor with a median survival of 10 months, 1- and 2-year survival rates were 40.5 % (30/74) and 9.5 % (7/74). The median survival of the patients with chemotherapy was 12 months, which was significantly longer than patients treated supportively (4 months) (p < 0.001). There were no differences of median survival and duration of CR between two arms. Early mortality decreased in the past 5 years in both groups. Meanwhile, low-dose idarubicin was well tolerated in elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced-intensity chemotherapy offered an improvement in survival, and the reduced-intensity IA regimen could improve CR rate in elderly patients with de novo AML.",,"['Liu, Hui', 'Fu, Rong', 'Li, Lijuan', 'Wang, Guojin', 'Song, Jia', 'Ruan, Erbao', 'Wang, Huaquan', 'Wu, Yuhong', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Ding, Kai', 'Shao, Zonghong']","['Liu H', 'Fu R', 'Li L', 'Wang G', 'Song J', 'Ruan E', 'Wang H', 'Wu Y', 'Wang X', 'Ding K', 'Shao Z']","[""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, 154 Anshan Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China. shaozonghong@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,New Zealand,Clin Drug Investig,Clinical drug investigation,9504817,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Safety', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/10/11 06:00,2017/02/24 06:00,['2016/10/11 06:00'],"['2016/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40261-016-0469-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s40261-016-0469-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Drug Investig. 2017 Feb;37(2):167-174. doi: 10.1007/s40261-016-0469-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fourteen IUGR and seven normal birth weight (NBW) neonatal male piglets were selected. Piglets were weaned at 7 days of postnatal age and fed the control formula milk (NBW-CON and IUGR-CON groups) or the control formula milk supplemented with 1.2 g/kg NAC (IUGR-NAC group) for 14 days (n = 7). The plasma and liver samples were analyzed for the parameters related to hepatic damage, redox status, apoptosis, and autophagy. RESULTS: Compared with the NBW-CON group, IUGR-CON group exhibited increased activities of plasma aminotransferases, increased numbers of apoptotic hepatocytes, as well as higher concentrations of protein carbonyl, malondialdehyde (MDA), microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta, and phospholipid-conjugated form (MAP1LC3B-II), along with a decrease in the content of reduced glutathione (GSH). NAC treatment increased GSH content and GSH-to-oxidized GSH ratio in the liver of IUGR-NAC group, most likely owing to the improved activities of gamma-glutamine-cysteine ligase, gamma-glutamine-cysteine synthetase, and glutathione reductase. The hepatic protein carbonyl and MDA contents were decreased in the IUGR-NAC group compared with the IUGR-CON group. In addition, NAC-treated piglets had an increased content of B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 protein, whereas a decreased expression level of MAP1LC3B-II in the liver.

The use of natural Tregs (nTregs) yielded positive pre-clinical results and are actively under investigation to reduce GVHD. However, broad application of this approach may require standardization of Treg expansion methods and dosing. Inducible Tregs (iTregs) can be seamlessly generated, but controversial pre-clinical findings and phenotype instability have hampered their translation into the clinic.

He initially presented with several-day history of nausea and vomiting, 10-pound weight loss, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain with evidence of acute hepatocellular liver injury (elevations in aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase) and elevation in serum creatinine. Further history revealed that he just joined the Marine Corp; in preparation, he had been lifting weights and taking protein and creatine supplements. A complete serological evaluation for liver disease was negative and creatine phosphokinase was normal. His aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase declined, and he was discharged with expected improvement. However, he returned one week later with continued symptoms and greater elevation of aminotransferases. Liver biopsy was nondiagnostic, revealing scattered portal and lobular inflammatory cells (primarily lymphocytes) felt to be consistent with drug-induced liver injury or viral hepatitis. Given his elevated creatinine, unresponsive to aggressive volume expansion, a kidney biopsy was performed, revealing normal histology. He subsequently developed an extensive left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. Given his deep venous thrombosis, his peripheral blood was sent for flow cytometry, which revealed lymphoblasts.

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and laboratory findings of 55 AML patients who had relapsed between 2004 and 2013 and who had been treated at the Division of Hematology of the Pusan National University Hospital. RESULTS: The event-free survival (EFS) was related to prognostic karyotype classification at the time of diagnosis and relapse (unfavorable vs. favorable or intermediate karyotypes at diagnosis, 8.2 vs. 11.9 mo, P=0.003; unfavorable vs. favorable or intermediate karyotypes at relapse, 8.2 vs. 11.9 mo, P=0.009). The overall survival (OS) was significantly correlated with karyotype classification only at diagnosis (unfavorable vs. favorable or intermediate vs. karyotypes at diagnosis, 8.5 vs. 21.8 mo, P=0.001; unfavorable vs. favorable or intermediate karyotypes at relapse, 8.5 vs. 21.2 mo, P=0.136). A change in karyotype between diagnosis and relapse, which is regarded as a factor of resistance against treatment, was not a significant prognostic factor for OS, EFS, and post-relapse survival (PRS). A Cox proportional hazards model showed that the combined use of fludarabine, cytosine arabinoside, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG) as a salvage regimen, was a significant prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio=0.399, P=0.010) and the PRS (hazard ratio=0.447, P=0.031). CONCLUSION: The karyotype classification at diagnosis predicts survival including PRS in relapsed AML patients as well as in treatment-naive patients. We suggest that presently, administration of salvage FLAG could be a better treatment option.",,"['Kim, Hyojeong', 'Seol, Young Mi', 'Song, Moo-Kon', 'Choi, Young Jin', 'Shin, Ho-Jin', 'Park, Sang Hyuk', 'Lee, Eun Yup', 'Chung, Joo-Seop']","['Kim H', 'Seol YM', 'Song MK', 'Choi YJ', 'Shin HJ', 'Park SH', 'Lee EY', 'Chung JS']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Pusan National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Pusan National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Pusan National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Pusan National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Pusan National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Pusan National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160923,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLAG regimen', 'Karyotypic change', 'Relapsed AML']",2016/10/11 06:00,2016/10/11 06:01,['2016/10/11 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2016.51.3.175 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2016 Sep;51(3):175-180. doi: 10.5045/br.2016.51.3.175.

Examination revealed pallor, cervical lymphadenopathy, and bilateral scrotal swellings. He was diagnosed as a case of Philadelphia-positive ALL (B-cell type) based on peripheral smear, bone marrow examination, and flow cytometry of the marrow aspirate. Ultrasonography of scrotum revealed bilateral hydrocele with normal testes. Cytopathological analysis of the hydrocele fluid showed the presence of lymphoblasts. The patient was treated with modified BFM-90 protocol along with imatinib mesylate (600 mg/day). He achieved complete remission with a minimal residual disease of <0.001% at the end of induction therapy. However, the hydrocele persisted and a repeat cytological examination of the aspirate did not reveal any lymphoblasts. The patient was treated with consolidation (high-dose methotrexate), bilateral testicular irradiation, and re-induction following which the hydrocele disappeared. The patient is currently on maintenance phase of BFM-90 protocol and is alive at one year of follow-up.

AIM: This study investigates the correlation between patient adherence and failure of TKIs' treatment in a follow-up study. METHODS: This is a follow-up study of a new cohort of CML patients. Adherence to IM is assessed using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS 6 TrackCap, AARDEX Ltd). The 9-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, medication possession ratio (MPR) calculation, and the electronic medical records are used for identifying potential factors that influence adherence. Clinical outcomes are assessed according to the European Leukemia Net 2013 guidelines via reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurement of the level of BCR-ABL1 transcripts in peripheral blood. Response is classified at the hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular levels into optimal, suboptimal, or failure. RESULTS: A total of 36 CML patients (5 citizens and 31 noncitizen residents) consented to participate in the study. The overall mean MEMS score was 89. Of the 36 patients, 22 (61%) were classified as adherent (mean: 95) and 14 (39%) were classified as nonadherent (mean: 80.2). Adherent patients were significantly more likely to obtain optimal response (95%) compared to the nonadherent group (14.3%; P < 0.0001). The rate of poor adherence was as high as 39% using MEMS, which correlates with 37% treatment failure rate. The survey results show that 97% of patients increased the IM dose by themselves when they felt unwell and 31% of them took the missing IM dose when they remembered. Other factors known to influence adherence show that half of patients developed one or more side effects, 65% of patients experienced lack of funds, 13% of patients declared unavailability of the drug in the NCCCR pharmacy, and 72% of patients believed that IM would cure the disease. The MPR results reveal that 16% of patients had poor access to treatment through the hospital pharmacy. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This is the first prospective study to evaluate CML patients' adherence and response to IM in Qatar. The high rate of treatment failure observed in Qatar is explained by poor adherence. An economic factor (unaffordable drug prices) is one of the main causes of nonadherence and efforts should be made locally to improve access to medication for cancer diseases. Other risk factors associated with poor adherence could be improved by close monitoring and dose adjustment. Monitoring risk factors for poor adherence and patient education that include direct communication between the health-care teams, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and patients are essential components for maximizing the benefits of TKI therapy and could rectify this problem. The preliminary results show that patients' response to treatment may be directly linked to patients' adherence to treatment. However, further in-depth and specific analysis may be necessary in a larger cohort.",,"['Al-Dewik, Nader I', 'Morsi, Hisham M', 'Samara, Muthanna M', 'Ghasoub, Rola S', 'Gnanam, Cinquea C', 'Bhaskaran, Subi K', 'Nashwan, Abdulqadir J', 'Al-Jurf, Rana M', 'Ismail, Mohamed A', 'AlSharshani, Mohammed M', 'AlSayab, Ali A', 'Ben-Omran, Tawfeg I', 'Khatib, Rani B', 'Yassin, Mohamed A']","['Al-Dewik NI', 'Morsi HM', 'Samara MM', 'Ghasoub RS', 'Gnanam CC', 'Bhaskaran SK', 'Nashwan AJ', 'Al-Jurf RM', 'Ismail MA', 'AlSharshani MM', 'AlSayab AA', 'Ben-Omran TI', 'Khatib RB', 'Yassin MA']","[""Qatar Medical Genetics Center, Hamad General Hospital (HGH), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.; National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.; Interim Translational Research Institute (iTRI), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.; Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences, Kingston University and St. George's University of London, London, UK."", ""Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences, Kingston University and St. George's University of London, London, UK.; Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.; Quality of Life Unit, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar."", 'Department of Psychology, Kingston University, London, UK.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Interim Translational Research Institute (iTRI), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Interim Translational Research Institute (iTRI), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Interim Translational Research Institute (iTRI), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.; Primary Health Care Center (PHCC), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Qatar Medical Genetics Center, Hamad General Hospital (HGH), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Medicines Management and Pharmacy Services, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, NHS Trust, Leeds, UK.; Faculty of Medicines and Health, LICAMM, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161002,United States,Clin Med Insights Oncol,Clinical Medicine Insights.

Recurring mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes are detected in approximately 20% of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 5% of adults with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). IDH proteins are homodimeric enzymes involved in diverse cellular processes, including adaptation to hypoxia, histone demethylation and DNA modification. The IDH2 protein is localized in the mitochondria and is a critical component of the tricarboxylic acid (also called the 'citric acid' or Krebs) cycle. Both IDH2 and IDH1 (localized in the cytoplasm) proteins catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG). Mutant IDH enzymes have neomorphic activity and catalyze reduction of alpha-KG to the (R) enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which is associated with DNA and histone hypermethylation, altered gene expression and blocked differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The prognostic significance of mutant IDH (mIDH) is controversial but appears to be influenced by co-mutational status and the specific location of the mutation (IDH1-R132, IDH2-R140, IDH2-R172). Treatments specifically or indirectly targeted to mIDH are currently under clinical investigation; these therapies have been generally well tolerated and, when used as single agents, have shown promise for inducing responses in some mIDH patients when used as first-line treatment or in relapsed or refractory AML or MDS. Use of mIDH inhibitors in combination with drugs with non-overlapping mechanisms of action is especially promising, as such regimens may address the clonal heterogeneity and the multifactorial pathogenic processes involved in mIDH myeloid malignancies. Advances in mutational analysis have made testing more rapid and convenient, and less expensive; such testing should become part of routine diagnostic workup and repeated at relapse to identify patients who may benefit from treatments that target mIDH.",,"['Medeiros, B C', 'Fathi, A T', 'DiNardo, C D', 'Pollyea, D A', 'Chan, S M', 'Swords, R']","['Medeiros BC', 'Fathi AT', 'DiNardo CD', 'Pollyea DA', 'Chan SM', 'Swords R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Cancer Center, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20161010,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/epidemiology/*genetics/mortality', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/enzymology/epidemiology/genetics', 'Prognosis']",,,2016/10/11 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/10/11 06:00'],"['2016/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016275 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.275 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):272-281. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.275.

On the basis of the differential expression of cell-surface markers, here we identify a mesenchymal stromal progenitor hierarchy, where CD45(-)Ter119(-)CD31(-)CD166(-)CD146(-)Sca1(+)(Sca1(+)) progenitors give rise to CD45(-)Ter119(-)CD31(-)CD166(-)CD146(+)(CD146(+)) intermediate and CD45(-)Ter119(-)CD31(-)CD166(+)CD146(-)(CD166(+)) mature osteo-progenitors. All three progenitors preserve HSC long-term multi-lineage reconstitution capability in vitro; however, their in vivo fates are different. Post-transplantation, CD146(+) and CD166(+) progenitors form bone only. While Sca1(+) progenitors produce CD146(+), CD166(+) progenitors, osteocytes and CXCL12-producing stromal cells. Only Sca1(+) progenitors are capable of homing back to the marrow post-intravenous infusion. Ablation of Sca1(+) progenitors results in a decrease of all three progenitor populations as well as haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Moreover, suppressing production of KIT-ligand in Sca1(+) progenitors inhibits their ability to support HSCs.

METHODS: Through searching the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, ASCO, ESMO, CNKI, and Wanfang, we collected open published clinical controlled trials-related high-dose IM treatment of CML. The pooled complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and hematologic toxicities were calculated by the statistical software. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in this study with 1137 cases received high-dose IM treatment and 958 cases received regular-dose IM treatment. The pooled results showed that patients received high-dose IM had higher CCyR compared with regular-dose with the odds ratio (OR) of 1.75 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.44-2.1, P < 0.05) and 1.58 (95% CI: 1.38-1.81, P < 0.05) in 6 and 12 months.

Musashi 2 (MSI2), a RNA-binding protein, was proposed to be a potent oncogene playing key roles in myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal malignancies. However, it remains elusive how MSI2 regulates stem cell features in HCC. Herein, we demonstrated that MSI2 was highly expressed in liver CSCs. Overexpression or knockdown of MSI2 altered CSC-related gene expression, self-renewal as well as resistance to chemotherapy in HCC cell lines. In mouse xenograft models, MSI2 could markedly enhance tumorigenicity. Mechanistically, overexpression of MSI2 resulted in the upregulation of Lin28A. Stemness and chemotherapeutic drug resistance induced by MSI2 overexpression were dramatically reduced by Lin28A knockdown. Moreover, MSI2 and LIN28A levels positively correlated with the clinical severity and prognosis in HCC patients. In conclusion, MSI2 might play a crucial role in sustaining stemness and chemoresistance of liver CSCs via LIN28A-dependent manner in HCC. Our findings revealed that MSI2 and Lin28A might be used as potential therapeutic targets for eradicating liver CSCs.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

It is well known that RA induces differentiation of human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) HL60 cells, fresh human APL cells, and clinical remission in patients with APL. Retinoylation (acylation of proteins by RA) is a possible pathway for RA action. However, an understanding of the role that retinoylation plays in the actions of RA is lacking. In the current study, several retinoylated proteins were detected in RA-treated HL60 fractions following Mono Q anion exchange chromatography and analysis using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One of the retinoylated proteins was identified as Rho-GDIbeta (28kDa) by TOF-MS and co-migration with Rho-GDIbeta (28kDa). Truncated Rho-GDIbeta (23kDa, N19), a product of cleavage by caspase-3, was not retinoylated. RA covalently bound to the Thr2 residue in Rho-GDIbeta (5kDa), which is the second product resulting from the cleavage of Rho-GDIbeta (28kDa) by caspase-3. RA treatment increased the level of Rho-GDIbeta (28kDa) and decreased the level of Rho-GDIbeta (23kDa). RA did not induce caspase-3 activity or Rho-GDIbeta mRNA expression.

Cost-effective, pertinent animal models are needed to link in vitro studies with the development of new therapeutic agents in clinical trials on a high-throughput scale. However, targeted therapies have had limited success moving from bench to clinic, often due to unexpected off-target effects. The zebrafish has emerged as a reliable in vivo tool for modeling human leukemia. Zebrafish genetic and xenograft models of acute leukemia provide an unprecedented opportunity to conduct rapid, phenotype-based screens.

In this study, we evaluated PBA2, a novel BCR-ABL inhibitor, for its anti-cancer activity against BCR-ABL expressing BaF3 cells. PBA2 shows potent activity against wild-type and T315I mutated BaF3 cells as compared with imatinib. PBA2 inhibited the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and its downstream signaling in BaF3/WT and BaF3/T315I cells. PBA2 inhibited the mRNA expression of BCR-ABL in BaF3/WT and BaF3/T315I cells. Mechanistically, PBA2 increased the cell population in sub G1 phase of the cell cycle, induced apoptosis and elevated ROS production in both BaF3/WT and BaF3/T315I cells.

The discovery of sufficient amounts of 4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)benzaldehyde in fresh plant material of N. ossifragum to allow complete structure elucidation by NMR and HRMS supports the possibility that fungi associated with N. ossifragum may be able to produce enough toxins to play a significant role in the pathogenicity of N. ossifragum. 4-Hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)benzaldehyde showed mild toxicity towards normal rat kidney (NRK) and more profound activity towards MOLM13 acute myeloid leukemia cells (IC50 = 430 muM and 68 muM, respectively).

The economic impacts of the infection have been debated in the literature. The present study was conducted to determine the lifetime effects of BLV infection on longevity and milk production of dairy cows in Canada. The data were aggregated from a combination of two data sets: 1) BLV serum-ELISA test results from Canada-wide surveys of production limiting diseases, which took place between 1998 and 2003 in 8 provinces, and 2) longitudinal production data for all cows in the former study, extracted from the Canadian dairy herd improvement database. All participant cows had been culled or died by the onset of this study. A historical cohort study was designed, including cows which tested positive to BLV-antibodies in their first lactation (positive cohort, n=1858) and cows which tested negative in their second or later lactations (negative cohort, n=2194). To assess the impacts of infection with BLV on longevity (the number of lifetime lactations), a discrete-time survival analysis was carried out. The effect of BLV on the lifetime milk production (the sum of all life 305-day milk production) was evaluated using a multilevel linear regression model. Overall, 4052 cows from 348 herds met the eligibility criteria and were enrolled in the study. In the longevity model, the interaction term between time (lactation number) and BLV-status was highly significant. Cows which were positive to BLV had consistently greater probabilities of being culled (or dying) than the test-negative cows. In the milk production model, the interaction term between BLV-status and longevity of the cows was highly significant; indicating that lifetime BLV effects on the total milk production was dependent on the lactation in which the study cows were culled/died. Infected cows with 2 and 3 lactations showed significantly lower life milk productions [-2554kg (-3609 to -1500) and -1171kg (-2051 to -292), respectively] compared with their negative counterparts with 2 and 3 lactations. As the cows lived longer (>3 lactations), the differences in life milk production between the two cohorts were no longer significant.

He initially compensated by increasing his oral fluid intake at home, but later developed septic shock and was admitted with orders to be kept nil per os (NPO). This prompted an episode of acute hypernatremia during which he exhibited continued polyuria with inappropriately dilute urine. Desmopressin challenge yielded no response in the urine osmolality, indicating a nephrogenic source of his diabetes insipidus (DI). He had no known exposure to other causative agents and had demonstrated a robust response to chemotherapy. The patient became eunatremic once oral intake was resumed and his infection was treated. Two months after presentation, he remained symptomatic. A trial with hydrochlorothiazide resulted in a significant increase in urine osmolality and subsequent decrease in urine output. To our knowledge, this is the first case of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus after rituximab and bendamustine exposure.

Methods: Using K562 cells and HL-60 cells, we prepared high- and low-level BCR-ABL internal quality control substance. The BCR-ABL (P210) transcript levels of internal quality control substance have been determined for 184 times together with clinical samples from August 2013 to October 2015. The slope rate, intercept and correlation coefficient of standard curve were calculated according to different reagent lots (lots number 20130303, 20131212, 20140411 and 20150327 are called R1R2R3 and R4 for short respectively), and the detection results of quality control substance were calculated according to different reagent lots and quality control substance lots (lots number 20130725, 20140611 are called Q1Q2 for short respectively). Then the results were analyzed by Levey-Jennings quality control chart combined with Westgard multi-rules theory. Results: 1 in circleWe analyzed the slope rate and intercept of standard curve. Fifty-three times of the R1 reagent detection, 80 times of the R3 reagent detection and 14 times of the R4 reagent detection were all under control. For 37 times detection of R2 reagent, the slope rate was out of control for 6 times. It was lower than x-s for the 2-8 tests and upper the average for the 12-37 tests. The intercept was out of control for 9 times, upper the x+s for the 1-8 tests and lower the average for the 12-37 tests. 2 in circle According to the detection results of quality control substance, for Q1 quality control substance, 49 tests by R1 reagent were under control, and 1 out of 23 tests by R2 reagent was out of control. For Q2 quality control substance, 14 tests by R2 reagent detection, 72 tests by R3 reagent detection and 14 tests by R4 reagent were all under control. Conclusion: The preparation of high- and low-level quality control substance using K562 and HL-60 cells was convenient and the detection results were reliable and stable.

Recent studies have revealed an important role for CK2 in tumorigenesis. High levels of CK2 are noted in many malignancies including leukemia. Use of CK2 inhibitors in various malignancies including breast, prostate, and lung cancer are being tested. Although many CK2 inhibitors exist, only a few have emerged as selective inhibitors that are potent and effective. CX-4945 is a selective, orallybioavailable small molecule inhibitor, which has shown encouraging results in pre-clinical models of leukemia. METHODS: In this review we will elaborate on the structure and physiological function of the CK2 protein as well as its role in cancer. We will review, in depth, the role of CK2 in leukemia and its mechanisms of tumorigenesis via phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein Ikaros. We will discuss both the importance of Ikaros in leukemia suppression and the restoration of Ikaros' tumor suppressor function after CK2 inhibition by CX-4945 (a CK2-specific inhibitor). RESULTS: CK2 is an oncogene that is overexpressed in hematological malignancies. In high risk Pre-B ALL, CK2 phosphorylates Ikaros tumor suppressor and promotes leukemogenesis. Inhibition of CK2 using CX4945 restores Ikaros function and leads to anti leukemic effects in vitro and in pre-clinical leukemia models. CONCLUSION: CK2 is an attractive target in treatment of various cancers. Currently only a few specific CK2 inhibitors are available. Preclinical studies using CK2 inhibitor, CX4945 in high risk pediatric leukemias have shown promising results and warrants further testing in other types of leukemia.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Gowda, Chandrika', 'Sachdev, Mansi', 'Muthusami, Sunil', 'Kapadia, Malika', 'Petrovic-Dovat, Lidija', 'Hartman, Melanie', 'Ding, Yali', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Payne, Jonathon L', 'Tan, Bi-Hua', 'Dovat, Sinisa']","['Gowda C', 'Sachdev M', 'Muthusami S', 'Kapadia M', 'Petrovic-Dovat L', 'Hartman M', 'Ding Y', 'Song C', 'Payne JL', 'Tan BH', 'Dovat S']","['Department of Pediatrics, H085, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, 500 University Drive, P.O.

METHODS: We evaluated the expression of markers above on CLL by ELISA, qRT-PCR, flow cytometric analysis and nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the mRNA levels of IL-17A and IL-22 in PBMCs of CLL patients were upregulated compared with those from healthy subjects (mean +/- SD: 1.96 +/- 0.232 vs.0.72 +/- 0.15, P < 0.001 and mean +/- SD: 2.45 +/- 0.534 vs.0.81 +/- 0.26, P < 0.001, respectivily). In addition, findings showed that the IL-17A and IL-22 plasma level was significantly elevated than that from healthy control group (P < 0.001). The median IL-17A and IL-22 in CLL patients and healthy control group were 48.28 +/- 17.2 pg mL(-1) ; 20.01 +/- 11.16 pg mL(-1) and 58.68 +/- 23.4 pg mL(-1) ;16.47 +/- 10.31 P < 0.001, respectively. The levels of IL-17A and IL-22 was not significantly associated with the different stages of disease (Rai stages; Kruskal-Wallis test P > 0.05).No significant relationship was found between expression of CD38 and higher median serum levels of IL-17A in patients, but patients with negative expression of ZAP-70 showed a significant association with higher median serum levels of IL-17A compared with healthy subjects. (57.84 pg mL(-1) vs. 31.67 pg mL(-1) ; P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: IL-22 is elevated and associated with CD38 and Zap-70 expression in patients with CLL. No significant correlation was found between expression of CD38 and increased levels of IL-17A, negative expression of ZAP-70 showed a significant association with increased levels of IL-17A.

Human serum transferrin is the most abundant serum protein responsible for the transport of iron ions and many endogenous and exogenous ligands. In this study the mechanism of interactions between the imatinib mesylate and all states of transferrin (apo-Tf, Htf and holo-Tf) has been investigated by fluorescence, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), circular dichroism (CD) and zeta potential spectroscopic methods. Based on the experimental results it was proved that under physiological conditions the imatinib mesylate binds to the each form of transferrin with a binding constant c.a. 10(5)M(-1). The thermodynamic parameters indicate that hydrogen bonds and van der Waals were involved in the interaction of apo-Tf with the drug and hydrophobic and ionic strength participate in the reaction of Htf and holo-Tf with imatinib mesylate. Moreover, it was shown that common metal ions, Zn(2+) and Ca(2+) strongly influenced apo-Tf-Imt binding constant. The CD studies showed that there are no conformational changes in the secondary structure of the proteins. No significant changes in secondary structure of the proteins upon binding with the drug and instability of apo-Tf-Imt system are the desirable effects from pharmacological point of view.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

PROCEDURE: Clinical characteristics and vaccination records were collected. Antibodies against VPDs were measured after completion of chemotherapy and after a booster dose of vaccine. Immunization status of household members was evaluated. RESULTS: Sixty children were included. Median interval between the end of chemotherapy and enrolment in the study was 13 months (range 1-145). At ALL diagnosis, 81.3% of the children were up to date with their vaccination schedule. This proportion decreased to 52.9% at enrolment. Among the parents, 21% were up to date with their immunization schedule and 42% had received seasonal influenza vaccination. After chemotherapy, less than 50% of the patients were seroprotected against tetanus, diphtheria, polio 3, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and mumps and no more than 80% were seroprotected against polio 1 and 2, measles, rubella, and varicella. After a booster dose of vaccine, the rate of protection increased to over 90% for each of the following antigens: TT, DT, polio 1, Hib, measles, and rubella. Nevertheless, polio 3, mumps, and varicella-zoster virus antibodies titers/concentrations remained below seroprotective thresholds in over 20% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: After chemotherapy for ALL, most of the children were not protected against VPDs. As the majority mounted a robust response to booster vaccines, efforts need to be done to improve protection against VPDs by implementing a systematic vaccine booster schedule. This could also be helped by reinforcing household members' immunization.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['de de la Fuente Garcia, Isabel', 'Coic, Lena', 'Leclerc, Jean-Marie', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Rousseau, Celine', 'Ovetchkine, Philippe', 'Tapiero, Bruce']","['de de la Fuente Garcia I', 'Coic L', 'Leclerc JM', 'Laverdiere C', 'Rousseau C', 'Ovetchkine P', 'Tapiero B']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Sainte-Justine-Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Sainte-Justine-Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Sainte-Justine-Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Sainte-Justine-Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, CHU Sainte-Justine-Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Sainte-Justine-Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, CHU Sainte-Justine-Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161008,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Vaccines)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunization Schedule', 'Immunization, Secondary/*methods', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Virus Diseases/immunology/*prevention & control']",['NOTNLM'],"['*chemotherapy', '*children', '*immunization', '*leukemia', '*vaccination coverage']",2016/10/09 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2016/10/09 06:00'],"['2016/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26187 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Feb;64(2):315-320. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26187.

However, its applicability is still limited to 90% of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCPALL) due to two major issues, i.e. a proportion of cases do not express adequate leukemia associated immunophenotype (LAIPs) with currently used markers and drug-induced antigen modulation. Hence, the incorporation of additional reliable markers is required for the further improvement of MFC-based MRD evaluation. We studied the utility of new markers in improvising MFC-based MRD detection in BCPALL. METHODS: Expression-patterns of six new markers, i.e. CD24, CD44, CD72, CD73, CD86, and CD200 were studied in leukemic-blasts from ninety childhood BCPALL patients and in hematogones from 20 uninvolved staging bone marrow (BM) and ten postinduction non-BCPALL BM samples using eight-color MFC. The utility of these new markers in the day 35 postinduction MRD evaluation was determined. RESULTS: Frequencies of LAIPs of CD73, CD86, CD72, CD44, CD200, and CD24 in diagnostic samples were 76.7, 56.7, 55.6, 50, 28.9, and 20%, respectively. Differential expression of all new markers was highly significant (P < 0.01) between early (CD10+ CD19+ CD34+) hematogones, late (CD10+ CD19+ CD34-) hematogones and BCPALL blasts except between early hematogones and BCPALL blasts for CD200 (P = 0.1). In MRD-positive samples, CD73 showed the maximum (83%) frequency of LAIP and CD86 showed the highest (100%) stability of aberrant expression. Inclusion of CD73 and CD86 increased the applicability of MFC-MRD assay to 98.9% MRD samples. CONCLUSION: CD73 and CD86 are the most relevant markers to incorporate in the routine MRD evaluation of BCPALL.

The first line treatment for CML consists on BCR-ABL inhibitors such as Imatinib. Nevertheless, such treatment may lead to the selection of resistant cells. Therefore, it is of great value to find molecules that enhance the anti-proliferative effect of first-line drugs. Hyaluronan is the main glycosaminglican of the extracellular matrix which is involved in tumor progression and multidrug resistance. We have previously demonstrated that the inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis by 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) induces senescence and can revert Vincristine resistance in CML cell lines. However, the effect of 4MU on Imatinib therapy remains unknown. The aim of this work was to determine whether the combination of 4MU with Imatinib is able to modulate the proliferation as well as apoptosis and senescence induction in human CML cell lines. For this purpose the ATCC cell line K562, and its multidrug resistant derivate, Kv562 were used. Cells were exposed to 4MU, Imatinib or a combination of both. We demonstrated that 4MU and Imatinib co-treatment abrogated the proliferation of both cell lines. However, such co-treatment did not increase the levels of apoptosis when compared with the treatment with Imatinib alone. For both cell lines the mechanisms of tumor suppression involved was senescence, since the combination of 4MU and Imatinib arrested the cell cycle and increased senescence associated beta-galactosidase activity and senescence associated heterochromatin foci presence when compared to each drug alone. Moreover, 4MU, Imatinib and 4MU + Imatinib decreased pAkt/Akt ratio in both cell lines and reduced the pERK/ERK ratio only in K562 cells. These findings highlight the potential use of 4MU together with Imatinib for CML therapy.",,"['Lompardia, Silvina Laura', 'Diaz, Mariangeles', 'Papademetrio, Daniela Laura', 'Pibuel, Matias', 'Alvarez, Elida', 'Hajos, Silvia Elvira']","['Lompardia SL', 'Diaz M', 'Papademetrio DL', 'Pibuel M', 'Alvarez E', 'Hajos SE']","['Department of Immunology, School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires (UBA), IDEHU-CONICET, 1113, Buenos Aires, Argentina. sil.lompardia@gmail.com.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires (UBA), IDEHU-CONICET, 1113, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires (UBA), IDEHU-CONICET, 1113, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires (UBA), IDEHU-CONICET, 1113, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires (UBA), IDEHU-CONICET, 1113, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires (UBA), IDEHU-CONICET, 1113, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161008,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '3T5NG4Q468 (Hymecromone)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hymecromone/*pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*4-methylumbelliferone', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Imatinib', '*Senescence']",2016/10/09 06:00,2017/12/15 06:00,['2016/10/09 06:00'],"['2016/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10637-016-0397-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-016-0397-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2017 Feb;35(1):1-10. doi: 10.1007/s10637-016-0397-9.

Bosutinib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, suggesting drug interaction potential with other CYP3A4 modulators. This open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period crossover study assessed the effect of single-dose aprepitant, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the single-dose pharmacokinetic profile of oral bosutinib 500 mg. METHODS: Nineteen healthy, fed adults received bosutinib (100 mg x 5) alone or coadministered with aprepitant (125 mg x 1) in each treatment period (with a >/=14-day washout); serial blood samples were analyzed. Safety was evaluated. RESULTS: Following coadministration of aprepitant with bosutinib, the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf) and maximum plasma concentration (C max) were higher than in bosutinib alone (AUCinf, 4719 and 2268 ng*h/mL; C max, 146.0 and 94.94 ng/mL). For bosutinib with aprepitant versus bosutinib alone, mean terminal elimination half-life was similar (25.99 vs 27.79 h), time to C max was longer (6.02 vs 4.15 h), and apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was decreased (105.9 vs 220.4 L/h). The ratio of adjusted geometric means of AUCinf and C max for bosutinib with aprepitant relative to bosutinib alone were 199 % (90 % confidence interval, 167-237 %) and 153 % (127-184 %), respectively. Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: In healthy volunteers, administering a single dose of aprepitant increased the AUC and C max following a single dose of bosutinib by 99 and 53 %, respectively. These results are consistent with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor effect of aprepitant on bosutinib (Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02058277).",,"['Hsyu, Poe-Hirr', 'Pignataro, Daniela Soriano', 'Matschke, Kyle']","['Hsyu PH', 'Pignataro DS', 'Matschke K']","['Pfizer Inc, 10646 Science Center Drive, La Jolla, CA, 92121, USA.

The effect of bosutinib on dabigatran etexilate mesylate (EM) absorption, a P-gp substrate, was evaluated. METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, single-dose, one-cohort, two-sequence, two-period crossover study, healthy, fed subjects received dabigatran EM (150 mg x 1 orally) alone or 1 h after receiving bosutinib tablets (100 mg x 5 orally). RESULTS: Dabigatran EM monotherapy and concurrent administration of dabigatran EM with bosutinib resulted in similar values for concentration time curves from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), but slightly lower maximum plasma concentration (C max) values (AUCinf, 1182 and 1186 ng.h/mL, respectively; C max, 129.8 and 114.1 ng/mL). The time to maximum concentration for dabigatran was 2.99 and 3.99 h for combination therapy. The ratio of the adjusted geometric means (test/reference) of dabigatran AUCinf and C max (90 % confidence interval) were 101.4 % (89.6-114.9 %) and 89.7 % (77.8-103.4 %), respectively, following administration of dabigatran EM with bosutinib (test) relative to dabigatran EM administered alone (reference). Six subjects receiving combination treatment reported a total of seven adverse events (AEs) versus none for subjects receiving monotherapy alone. All AEs were mild to moderate and considered treatment related. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that single doses of bosutinib do not affect dabigatran exposure, suggesting that bosutinib is not a clinical inhibitor of P-gp.

AKT1 or the protein kinase B is frequently activated in ALL, and contributes to the development of glucocorticoid resistance. We examined impact of AKT1 on glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-induced transcriptional activity in cooperation with phospho-serine/threonine-binding protein 14-3-3. AKT1 has two distinct actions on GR transcriptional activity, one through segregation of GR in the cytoplasm by phosphorylating GR at Ser-134 and subsequent association of 14-3-3, and the other through direct modulation of GR transcriptional activity in the nucleus. For the latter, AKT1 and 14-3-3 are attracted to DNA-bound GR, accompanied by AKT1-dependent p300 phosphorylation, H3S10 phosphorylation and H3K14 acetylation at the DNA site. These two actions of AKT1 regulate distinct sets of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. Our results suggest that specific inhibition of the AKT1/14-3-3 activity on the cytoplasmic retention of GR may be a promising target for treating glucocorticoid resistance observed in ALL.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In order to understand the underlying action mechanism of 8a, three compounds of the same class with structures optimized step-by-step, 9(10H)-acridone (A), 10-(3,5-dimethoxy) benzyl-9(10H)-acridone (I) and 8a, were exposed to CCRF-CEM leukemia cell to determine the N-glycosylation changes using the microfluidic HPLC-chip-TOF MS platform. N-Glycans from whole cell lysates (WCL) and cell membranes (CM) were analyzed using isomer-sensitive chip-based porous graphitized carbon nano-LC/MS. A total of 223 N-glycan compositions and 398 N-glycan compounds were identified. Comparison of the two analyses showed that more apparent changes were observed in the CM compared with WCL, suggesting that CM may be a more sensitive indicator of changes in glycosylation. Upon 8a exposure to CCRF-CEM cells, a significant decrease in high-mannose-type glycans was observed. Different expressions of oligosaccharyltransferase subunits appear to play a key functional role in regulating the hypoglycosylation and contribute to the action mechanism of 8a. Taken together our findings suggest that glycosylation is strongly affected by therapeutic potency and can be used as possible biomarkers for monitoring toxicity and antitumor activity of 8a.","['(c) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, some patients may show gains on several chromosomes simultaneously suggesting a hyperdiploid karyotype. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyse by FISH the frequency and prognostic impact of hyperdiploidy in CLL. METHOD: A review of 1359 consecutive cases diagnosed with CLL referred for FISH analysis to a unique institution was carried out. Hyperdiploidy was considered when a gain of at least three of the five FISH probes used was observed. RESULTS: Seven cases (0.51%) with hyperdiploidy were found, confirming that it is a rare event in this disease. Although most patients presented with early Binet stages at diagnosis, six of seven (86%) shortly progressed. The median of time to the first therapy (TTFT) and overall survival (OS) for the patients with hyperdiploidy were short (1.4 months and 20 months, respectively). Moreover, comparing them with a control group of patients (non-hyperdiploid) with completed follow-up data, TTFT and OS of the patients with hyperdiploidy were significantly shorter than the control group.

RESULTS: The criterion for entry into this cohort was fulfilled by 57 patients among 302 seen over a 14-yr period (19%): 12 patients who never achieved complete remission (CR), 21 patients who relapsed after CR achievement, and 24 patients who achieved CR and did not relapse, including three patients who died while in CR and 21 patients still alive in first CR at the time of analysis. The pretreatment prognostic importance of cytogenetics was still apparent. However, some patients with secondary AML and/or unfavorable-risk markers belonged to long survivors.

Clinical and molecular knowledge about infant T-ALL is still nearly completely lacking and it is also still unclear whether it represents a distinct disease compared to childhood T-ALL. To address this, we performed exome sequencing of three infant cases, which enabled the detection of mutations in NOTCH2, NOTCH3, PTEN, and KRAS. When analyzing the transcriptomes and miRNomes of the three infant and an additional six childhood T-ALL samples, we found 760 differentially expressed mRNAs and 58 differentially expressed miRNAs between these two cohorts. Correlation analysis for differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA target pairs revealed 47 miRNA-mRNA pairs, with many of them previously described to be aberrantly expressed in leukemia and cancer. Pathway analysis revealed differentially expressed pathways and upstream regulators related to the immune system or cancerogenesis such as the ERK5 pathway, which was activated in infant T-ALL. In summary, there are distinct molecular features in infant compared to childhood T-ALL on a transcriptomic and epigenetic level, which potentially have an impact on the development and course of the disease.

The project surveillance of rare cancers in Europe (RARECARE) had, among others, the objective of assessing rare cancer data quality in population-based cancer registries (CRs). Eight rare cancers were considered: mesothelioma, liver angiosarcoma, sarcomas, tumors of oral cavity, CNS tumors, germ cell tumors, leukemia, and malignant digestive endocrine tumors. METHODS: We selected data on 18,000 diagnoses and revised, on the basis of the pathologic and clinical reports (but not on pathologic specimens), unspecified morphology and topography codes originally attributed by CR officers and checked the quality of follow-up of long-term survivors of poor prognosis cancers. RESULTS: A total of 38 CRs contributed from 13 European countries. The majority of unspecified morphology and topography cases were confirmed as unspecified. The few unspecified cases that, after the review, changed to a more specific diagnosis increased the incidence of the common cancer histotypes. For example, 11% of the oral cavity epithelial cancers were reclassified from unspecified to more specific diagnoses: 8% were reclassified as squamous cell carcinoma (commoner) and only 1% as adenocarcinoma (rarer). The revision confirmed the majority of long-term survivors revealing a relative high proportion of mesothelioma long-term survivors.

This phase I study evaluated nintedanib in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) in elderly patients with untreated or relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy in a 3+3 design. Nintedanib (dose levels 100, 150, and 200 mg orally twice daily) and LDAC (20 mg subcutaneous injection twice daily for 10 days) were administered in 28-day cycles. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as non-hematological severe adverse reaction CTC grade >/= 4 with possible or definite relationship to nintedanib. Between April 2012 and October 2013, 13 patients (median age 73 [range: 62-86] years) were enrolled. One patient did not receive study medication and was replaced. Nine (69%) patients had relapsed or refractory disease and 6 (46%) patients had unfavorable cytogenetics. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events (AE) were gastrointestinal events. Twelve SAEs irrespective of relatedness were reported. Two SUSARs were observed, one fatal hypercalcemia and one fatal gastrointestinal infection. Two patients (17%) with relapsed AML achieved a complete remission (one CR, one CRi) and bone marrow blast reductions without fulfilling PR criteria were observed in 3 patients (25%). One-year overall survival was 33%. Nintedanib combined with LDAC shows an adequate safety profile and survival data are promising in a difficult-to-treat patient population. Continuation of this trial with a phase II recommended dose of 2 x 200 mg nintedanib in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study is planned. The trial is registered to EudraCT as 2011-001086-41.

The micelles exhibit excellent drug-loading capacities for paclitaxel (PTX) and exhibited a typical pH-responsive drug release pattern. The release of PTX from the micelles was significantly accelerated by decreasing pH from 7.4 to 5.0 which just fitted the pathological process. The most important advantage of this design is that the polymeric micelles provide an effective approach for rapid transport of cargo into the cytosol, which significantly increases the antitumor efficacy of PTX against K562 cancer cells. Paclitaxel-loaded polymer micelles (PTX-M) showed significantly higher cytotoxic effect than that of free PTX. The PTX-M exhibited a superior apoptosis effect in cancer cells compared to that of free PTX at all time points. We have showed that the PTX-M activated upstream of apoptosis signaling and inhibited the anti-apoptotic factors. The PTX-M remarkably increased the upregulation of Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP-1 expression and downregulated the Bcl-2 expression in K562 cancer cells. The results show that PTX-M induced cell apoptosis through intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. Importantly, PTX had a remarkably prolonged plasma circulation time after administration of PTX-M. Overall, this novel cancer specific, pH-responsive, and potentially in vivo stable unimolecular micelles may provide a very promising approach for targeted cancer therapy in the effective treatment of Leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The transcription factor (TF) CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (CEBPB) is important for maintaining the tumor initiating capacity and invasion ability. To investigate the regulation mechanism of CEBPB in glioma, microarray data GSE47352 was analyzed. METHODS: GSE47352 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including three samples of SNB19 human glioma cells transduced with non-target control small hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral vectors for 72 h (normal glioma cells) and three samples of SNB19 human glioma cells transduced with CEBPB shRNA lentiviral vectors for 72 h (CEBPB-silenced glioma cells). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using limma package and then annotated. Afterwards, the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) software was applied to perform enrichment analysis for the DEGs. Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and transcriptional regulatory network were constructed using Cytoscape software. RESULTS: Total 529 DEGs were identified in the normal glioma cells compared with the CEBPB-silenced glioma cells, including 336 up-regulated and 193 down-regulated genes. The significantly enriched pathways included chemokine signaling pathway (which involved CCL2), focal adhesion (which involved THBS1 and THBS2), TGF-beta signaling pathway (which involved THBS1, THBS2, SMAD5, and SMAD6) and chronic myeloid leukemia (which involved TGFBR2 and CCND1). In the PPI network, CCND1 (degree = 29) and CCL2 (degree = 12) were hub nodes. Additionally, CEBPB and TCF12 might function in glioma through targeting others (CEBPB --> TCF12, CEBPB --> TGFBR2, and TCF12 --> TGFBR2). CONCLUSIONS: CEBPB might act in glioma by regulating CCL2, CCND1, THBS1, THBS2, SMAD5, SMAD6, TGFBR2, and TCF12.",,"['Du, Chenghua', 'Pan, Pan', 'Jiang, Yan', 'Zhang, Qiuli', 'Bao, Jinsuo', 'Liu, Chang']","['Du C', 'Pan P', 'Jiang Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Bao J', 'Liu C']","['Department of Neurosurgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia University for the Nationalities, Huolinhe Street No.1742, Tongliao, Inner Mongolia, 028007, China.

The copy number and clinical data were then used to preform survival analysis on a gene by gene basis on sub-populations of patients exposed to a given drug. RESULTS: Several gene-drug interactions are identified, where the copy number of a gene is associated to survival of a patient exposed to a certain drug. Both Irinotecan/HAS2 (Hyaluronan synthase 2) and Bevacizumab/PGAM1 (Phosphoglycerate mutase 1) are interactions found in this study with independent confirmation. Independent work in colon, breast cancer and leukemia (Gyorffy, Breast Cancer Res Treat 123:725-731, 2010; Mueller, Mol Cancer Ther 11:3024-3032, 2010; Hitosugi, Cancer Cell 13:585-600, 2012) showed these two interactions can lead to increased survival. CONCLUSION: While the pipeline produced several possible interactions where increased survival is linked to normal or increased copy number of a given gene for patients treated with a given drug, no instance of low copy number or full deletion was linked to increased survival. The development of this pipeline shows a promising utility to identify possible beneficial gene-drug interactions that could improve patient survival and may illustrate some of the problems inherent in this kind of analysis on these data.",,"['Spainhour, John Christian Givhan', 'Qiu, Peng']","['Spainhour JC', 'Qiu P']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, 313 Ferst Dr. NW, Atlanta, GA, 30332, USA.

Two signal transducer and activator of transcription factors, STAT1 and STAT3, are constitutively active in T-LGLL. Disruption of this activation induces apoptosis in T-LGLL cells. Therefore, considerable efforts are focused on developing treatments that inhibit STAT activation. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, has been shown to decrease STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in cancer cell lines and autoimmune disease mouse models. Thus, we investigated whether calcitriol could be a valid therapeutic for T-LGLL. Calcitriol treatment of the TL-1 cell line (model of T-LGLL) led to decreased phospho-Y701 STAT1 and phospho-Y705 STAT3 and increased vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels. Doses of 10 and 100 nM calcitriol also significantly decreased the inflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma in the TL-1 cell line. The overall cell viability did not change when the TL-1 cell line was treated with 0.1 to 1000 nM calcitriol. Studies with primary T-LGLL patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that the majority of T-LGLL patients have detectable VDR and activated STATs in contrast to normal donor controls. Treatment of primary T-LGLL patient cells with calcitriol recapitulated findings from the TL-1 cell line. Overall, our results suggest that calcitriol may reprogram T-cells to decrease essential STAT activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine output. These data support further investigation into calcitriol as an experimental therapeutic for T-LGLL.",,"['Olson, Kristine C', 'Kulling, Paige M', 'Olson, Thomas L', 'Tan, Su-Fern', 'Rainbow, Rebecca J', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Olson KC', 'Kulling PM', 'Olson TL', 'Tan SF', 'Rainbow RJ', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['a University of Virginia Cancer Center , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'b Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'a University of Virginia Cancer Center , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'b Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'c Department of Pathology , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'a University of Virginia Cancer Center , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'b Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'a University of Virginia Cancer Center , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'b Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'a University of Virginia Cancer Center , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'b Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'a University of Virginia Cancer Center , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'b Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'a University of Virginia Cancer Center , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'b Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20161007,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (IFNG protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (VDR protein, human)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/immunology', 'Calcitriol/*administration & dosage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/metabolism/pathology', 'Vitamin D/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Calcitriol', '*LGL leukemia', '*STAT1', '*STAT3', '*inflammatory cytokine', '*peripheral blood mononuclear cells', '*phosphorylation', '*vitamin D', '*vitamin D receptor']",2016/10/08 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2016/10/08 06:00'],"['2016/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384047.2016.1235669 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2017 May 4;18(5):290-303. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2016.1235669.

Lagunamides A-C from marine cyanobacterium, Lyngbya majuscula, exhibit exquisite growth inhibitory activities against cancer cells. In this study, we have systematically investigated the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of a concise collection of lagunamide A and its analogues constructed by total chemical synthesis against a broad panel of cancer cells derived from various tissues or organs, including A549, HeLa, U2OS, HepG2, BEL-7404, BGC-823, HCT116, MCF-7, HL-60, and A375. The R configuration of lagunamide A at C-39 position was found to be the structure determinant for anticancer activity. Further molecular mechanism study in A549 cells revealed that lagunamide A induced caspase-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. Accompanied with the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltaphim) and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lagunamide A led to mitochondrial dysfunction and finally caused cell death. Moreover, both anti- and pro-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins participated in lagunamide A-induced mitochondrial apoptosis, especially myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Overexpression of Mcl-1 partly rescued A549 cells from lagunamide A-induced apoptosis. This study suggests that lagunamide A may exert anticancer property through mitochondrial apoptosis. Together, our findings would provide insightful information for the design of new anticancer drugs derived from lagunamides.",,"['Huang, Xiaoxing', 'Huang, Wei', 'Li, Li', 'Sun, Xihuan', 'Song, Siyang', 'Xu, Qingyan', 'Zhang, Lianru', 'Wei, Bang-Guo', 'Deng, Xianming']","['Huang X', 'Huang W', 'Li L', 'Sun X', 'Song S', 'Xu Q', 'Zhang L', 'Wei BG', 'Deng X']","['State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State-Province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Targeted Drugs from Natural Products, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State-Province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Targeted Drugs from Natural Products, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'Department of Natural Products Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University , 826 Zhangheng Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State-Province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Targeted Drugs from Natural Products, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State-Province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Targeted Drugs from Natural Products, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State-Province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Targeted Drugs from Natural Products, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State-Province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Targeted Drugs from Natural Products, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State-Province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Targeted Drugs from Natural Products, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'Department of Natural Products Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University , 826 Zhangheng Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.', 'State-Province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Targeted Drugs from Natural Products, Xiamen University , Xiamen, Fujian 361102, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161017,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (lagunamide A)']",IM,,"['A549 Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Depsipeptides/*pharmacology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl-2 family', '*apoptosis', '*lagunamide A', '*marine natural products', '*mitochondria']",2016/10/08 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2016/10/08 06:00'],"['2016/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00564 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2016 Nov 7;13(11):3756-3763. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00564.

METHODS: From national registries, we identified survivors (n = 3243) born from 1960 to 1992 and aged below 16 at cancer diagnosis (years 1964-2009) as well as their controls (n = 16,215). Data on educational achievements, yearly income, employment status, and retirement were retrieved from Statistics Finland. RESULTS: The median (range) age at study was 28 (17-50) years. The proportion of those with no education after comprehensive school was higher than controls for all the diagnostic groups: brain tumor (BT) (33.5 vs 23.0 %), solid tumor (ST) (25.0 vs 21.4 %), and leukemia/NHL (29.2 vs 23.1 %). Odds ratios (OR) for unemployment were not significantly elevated in any survivor group compared to controls, but OR for being retired was elevated in each survivor group (BT 14.8, ST 2.2, leukemia/NHL 4.0). Irradiation significantly increased that OR only in BT survivors. Leukemia/NHL survivors treated after 1992 had lower risk for early retirement (OR 0.6) compared to those diagnosed earlier. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors had higher frequencies than controls for lacking further education after comprehensive school. Unemployment was not common, but risk for early retirement was significantly increased in each three survivor group. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Reassuring is that premature retirement was less common during the most recent treatment era. Screening and follow-up of psychosocial performance more effectively might be essential, and there is a need for studies on possibility for effective rehabilitation of the survivors.",,"['Ahomaki, Ritva', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Matomaki, Jaakko', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M']","['Ahomaki R', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Matomaki J', 'Lahteenmaki PM']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescence, Turku University Hospital, Tuijulankatu 24, 20540, Turku, Finland. rijohu@utu.fi.', 'Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Stockholm, Sweden.', ""Department of Pediatrics and Adolescence, Oulu University Hospital, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Turku, Finland."", 'The University of Turku, Turun Yliopisto, 20014, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescence, Turku University Hospital, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, 20520, Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161006,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Education/*trends', 'Employment/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Finland', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Retirement/*statistics & numerical data', 'Survivors/psychology', 'Unemployment/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Childhood', '*Education', '*Registry based study', '*Survivor']",2016/10/08 06:00,2017/09/14 06:00,['2016/10/08 06:00'],"['2016/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11764-016-0574-z [doi]', '10.1007/s11764-016-0574-z [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2017 Apr;11(2):284-294. doi: 10.1007/s11764-016-0574-z.

The efficacy of these drugs has been repeatedly demonstrated, as has their tolerability in most patients. However, late and chronic toxicities become an important issue for many patients facing long-term TKI exposure. For patients on long-term imatinib, gastrointestinal events, fluid retention, muscle cramps, fatigue, and hepatotoxicity are among the most common and most clinically relevant adverse events (AEs). A few of these have also emerged as important AEs with some of the newer TKIs. Distinct long-term toxicity concerns have emerged for dasatinib (pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension, headache, and dyspnea) and nilotinib (rash, headache, myalgia, alopecia, and hyperglycemia), whereas due to the recent approval of bosutinib and ponatinib, their long-term toxicity profiles have not been fully characterized.

New antiplatelet drugs and many other drugs have been developed, but some drugs may have adverse effects on platelet functions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish an evaluation method for evaluating the effect and adverse effect of various drugs on platelet functions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human erythroid leukemia (HEL) cells were used after megakaryocytic differentiation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as an alternative to platelets. Drugs were evaluated by changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) mobilization in Fura2-loaded phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced HEL cells. Aspirin and cilostazol were selected as antiplatelet drugs and ibuprofen and sodium valproate as other drugs. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between [Ca(2+)]i and platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. Aspirin (5.6-560 microM) and cilostazol (5-10 microM) significantly inhibited thrombin-induced increases in [Ca(2+)]i in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, ibuprofen (8-200 microM) and sodium valproate (50-1,000 microg/mL) also significantly inhibited thrombin-induced increases in [Ca(2+)]i in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the interaction effects of the simultaneous combined use of aspirin and ibuprofen or sodium valproate were evaluated. When the inhibitory effect of aspirin was higher than that of ibuprofen, the effect of aspirin was reduced, whereas when the inhibitory effect of aspirin was lower than that of ibuprofen, the effect of ibuprofen was reduced. The combination of aspirin and sodium valproate synergistically inhibited thrombin-induced [Ca(2+)]i. CONCLUSION: It is possible to induce HEL cells to differentiate into megakaryocytes, which are a useful model for the study of platelet functions, and the quantification of the inhibition of thrombin-induced increases in [Ca(2+)]i is applicable to the evaluation of the effects of various drugs on platelets.",,"['Tada, Tomoki', 'Aki, Kensaku', 'Oboshi, Wataru', 'Kawazoe, Kazuyoshi', 'Yasui, Toshiyuki', 'Hosoi, Eiji']","['Tada T', 'Aki K', 'Oboshi W', 'Kawazoe K', 'Yasui T', 'Hosoi E']","['Subdivision of Biomedical Laboratory Sciences, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Tokushima University.', 'Department of Cells and Immunity Analytics, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima.', 'Subdivision of Biomedical Laboratory Sciences, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Tokushima University; Department of Medical Technology, Kagawa Prefectural University of Health Sciences, Kagawa.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy Practice Pedagogy, Institute of Biomedical Sciences.', 'Department of Reproductive and Menopausal Medicine, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Department of Cells and Immunity Analytics, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160926,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Tetrazoles)', '20839-06-9 (phorbol-12-myristate)', 'N7Z035406B (Cilostazol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,['Drug Des Devel Ther. 2017 Feb 08;11:371.

Blocking channel activity impairs the growth of some tumors, both in vitro and in vivo, which opens a new field for pharmaceutical research. However, ion channel blockers may produce serious side effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias. For instance, Kv11.1 (hERG1) channels are aberrantly expressed in several human cancers, in which they control different aspects of the neoplastic cell behaviour. hERG1 blockers tend to inhibit cancer growth. However they also retard the cardiac repolarization, thus lengthening the electrocardiographic QT interval, which can lead to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Several possibilities exist to produce less harmful compounds, such as developing specific drugs that bind hERG1 channels in the open state or disassemble the ion channel/integrin complex which appears to be crucial in certain stages of neoplastic progression. The potential approaches to improve the efficacy and safety of ion channel targeting in oncology include: (1) targeting specific conformational channel states; (2) finding ever more specific inhibitors, including peptide toxins, for channel subtypes mainly expressed in well-identified tumors; (3) using specific ligands to convey traceable or cytotoxic compounds; (4) developing channel blocking antibodies; (5) designing new molecular tools to decrease channel expression in selected cancer types.

Genomic studies of MCL have also identified recurrent mutations in the coding region of CCND1. However, the functional consequence of these mutations is not known. Here, we showed that, compared to wild type (WT), single E36K, Y44D or C47S CCND1 mutations increased CCND1 protein levels in MCL cell lines. Mechanistically, these mutations stabilized CCND1 protein through attenuation of threonine-286 phosphorylation, which is important for proteolysis through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In addition, the mutant proteins preferentially localized to the nucleus. Interestingly, forced expression of WT or mutant CCND1 increased resistance of MCL cell lines to ibrutinib, an FDA-approved Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor for MCL treatment.

The conclusions have been inconsistent and the purpose of this study is to conduct a network meta-analysis. RESULTS: Rankings of event-free survival are ATRA+RIF (81.2%), ATRA+ATO (69.6%), ATO (50.6%). Rankings of complete remission are ATRA+RIF (79.3%), ATRA+ATO (64.8%), RIF (60.3%), ATO (55.9%). Rankings of avoiding differentiation syndromes are CT (84.3%), ATO (80.3%), RIF (71.6%), ATRA+RIF (49%), ATRA+ATO (40.8%). METHODS: A total of 1,666 patients from 12 RCTs were enrolled. The frequentist method was used. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. We produced a network plot, a contribution plot, and a forest plot predictive intervals. The inconsistency factor, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve and the publication bias were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: ATRA+ATO is eligible to be the first-line treatment for APL. ATRA+RIF is a prospective alternative to the first-line treatment.

SVM was used for training with setting the initial disease data to 1 as the flag and setting 15 healthy persons to set 0 as the flag. Based on the two training groups, parameters were optimized, and a predictive model was built to analyze MRD data from each patient. The automated analysis results from the SVM model were compared to those obtained through conventional analysis to determine reliability. Automated analysis results based on the model did not differ from and were correlated with results obtained through conventional analysis (correlation coefficient c = 0.986, P > 0.05).

An Evaluation of the Validity and Interpretability of the EQ-5D-5L and Preference-Based Questionnaires Derived from the EORTC QLQ-C30.,834-843,S1098-3015(16)30495-8 [pii] 10.1016/j.jval.2016.05.008 [doi],"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the validity and interpretability of different preference-based questionnaires (generic 5-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L], cancer-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire Preference-Based Measure, and European Organization of Randomized Controlled Trials 8 Dimension [EORTC-8D]) in patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: Patients who participated in Hemato-Oncologie voor Volwassenen Nederland (HOVON - the Haemato Oncology Foundation for Adults in the Netherlands) clinical trials between 1999 and 2011 at a single hospital were invited to complete the questionnaires. Interpretability was evaluated by the frequency of incomplete data and highest and lowest possible scores. Content validity was evaluated by exploring the health-related quality-of-life domains included in the questionnaires. Construct validity was assessed using correlations with other quality-of-life scales (EQ-visual analogue scale score and global quality-of-life scale of the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire) and ability to distinguish between patients with different health statuses. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by 89% (111 of 125) of the patients. Six to seven respondents did not return full questionnaires. Perfect health on the EQ-5D-5L was reported by 32 respondents and many of them (N = 17) did report health problems on other questionnaires. All questionnaires were strongly correlated (range 0.61-0.78) with other quality-of-life scales and yielded substantially different utility values for patients with different health statuses. Nevertheless, the disease-specific preference-based questionnaires showed greater discriminatory power. CONCLUSIONS: Although the Quality of Life Questionnaire Preference-Based Measure and the EORTC-8D appear to have better validity, this study does not provide any strong evidence against the use of the EQ-5D-5L for measuring quality-of-life utilities in acute leukemia. However, our findings need to be confirmed in larger longitudinal studies.","['Copyright (c) 2016 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes', 'Research (ISPOR).

We examined the effectiveness of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in adults with B-ALL age 55 years and older and explored prognostic factors associated with long-term outcomes. Using CIBMTR registry data, we evaluated 273 patients (median age 61, range 55-72) with B-ALL with disease status in CR1 (71%), >CR2 (17%) and Primary Induction Failure (PIF)/Relapse (11%), who underwent RIC HCT between 2001 and 2012 using mostly unrelated donor (59%) or HLA-matched sibling (32%). Among patients with available cytogenetic data, the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) was present in 50%. The 3-year cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and relapse were 25% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 20-31%) and 47% (95% CI: 41-53%), respectively. Three-year overall survival (OS) was 38% (95% CI: 33-44%). Relapse remained the leading cause of death accounting for 49% of all deaths. In univariate analysis, 3 year risk of NRM was significantly higher with reduced Karnofsky performance status (KPS <90: 34% (95% CI: 25-43%) versus KPS >/=90 (18%; 95% CI: 12-24%, P = 0.006).

We evaluated whether the presence of ctDNA was associated with outcome after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in lymphoma patients. We studied 88 patients drawn from a phase 3 clinical trial of reduced-intensity conditioning HSCT in lymphoma. Conventional restaging and collection of peripheral blood samples occurred at pre-specified time points before and after HSCT and were assayed for ctDNA by sequencing of the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes. Tumour clonotypes were identified in 87% of patients with adequate tumour samples. Sixteen of 19 (84%) patients with disease progression after HSCT had detectable ctDNA prior to progression at a median of 3.7 months prior to relapse/progression.

However, lists of many differentially expressed genes are often generated, and unraveling meaningful biological processes from the lists can be challenging. For this reason, investigators have sought to quantify the statistical probability of compiled gene sets rather than individual genes. The gene sets typically are organized around a biological theme or pathway. We compute correlations between different gene set tests and elect to use Fisher's self-contained method for gene set analysis. We improve Fisher's differential expression analysis of a gene set by limiting the p-value of an individual gene within the gene set to prevent a small percentage of genes from determining the statistical significance of the entire set. In addition, we also compute dependencies among genes within the set to determine which genes are statistically linked.

In this pilot study we investigated a total of 124 proteins in plasma from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with the purpose of identifying proteins that are differently expressed at diagnosis and after tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment initiation. METHODS: Samples were taken from 14 CML patients at diagnosis and after three months of TKI treatment (imatinib or dasatinib). Samples were analyzed by Mesoscale Discovery, Myriad RBM MAP technology and Olink Proseek. RESULTS: Multiple plasma proteins were differentially expressed before and after initiation of TKI therapy. Protein patterns demonstrated a possible shift towards Th1-immunity and reduced angiogenic stimuli. Further, some plasma proteins were identified that can be of potential interest to study further for biologic, prognostic or therapeutic significance such as E-selectin, uPAR, growth hormone and carbonic anhydrase IX. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma proteomics seems feasible and useful in CML patients, both for studying patterns of protein expression and for identifying single proteins differentially expressed before and after treatment. Plasma proteomics may be useful to map disease activity and biological processes. Hence, plasma proteomics can be used to understand drug mechanisms and treatment responses in CML.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Proteasome inhibitors can inhibit the growth of a broad spectrum of human cancer cells by altering the balance of intracellular proteins. However, the targets of these compounds in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells have not been fully characterized. Herein, we combined large-scale quantitative analysis by SILAC-MS and targeted quantitative proteomic analysis in order to identify proteins regulated upon proteasome inhibition in two AML cell lines displaying different stages of maturation: immature KG1a cells and mature U937 cells. In-depth data analysis enabled accurate quantification of more than 7000 proteins in these two cell lines. Several candidates were validated by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) measurements in a large number of samples. Despite the broad range of proteins known to be affected by proteasome inhibition, such as heat shock (HSP) and cell cycle proteins, our analysis identified new differentially regulated proteins, including IL-32, MORF family mortality factors and apoptosis inducing factor SIVA, a target of p53. It could explain why proteasome inhibitors induce stronger apoptotic responses in immature AML cells.","['(c) 2016 The Authors. Proteomics Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Compared with individual or pairwise administration of homoharringtonine, aclarubicin, or cytarabine, HAA showed the strongest inhibition of growth and induction of apoptosis in SKNO-1 and Kasumi-1 cells. HAA caused cleavage of the AML1-ETO (AE) oncoprotein to form truncated AE (DeltaAE).

However, other non-HLA genes may also influence the immune process, such as the genes encoding the immunoglobulin-like receptors of natural killer cells (KIRs). The discovery that NK cell KIR receptors interact with conservative epitopes (C1, C2, Bw4) presented in HLA class I molecules that are genetically polymorphic, also observed in KIR genes, led to the investigation of the relevance of the KIR system to hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The cure of patients with leukemias and other hematological malignancies after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been attributed in part to the ability of the donor immune cells, present in the graft, to recognize and eliminate neoplastic cells of the patient. The cytotoxic activity of NK cells is mediated by the absence of HLA class I-specific ligands on the target cell surface to inhibitory KIR receptors (hypothesis of ""missing-self""). METHODS: We analyzed, by PCR typing-SSOP technique, the presence or absence of 16 KIR genes and haplotypes of 39 patients with hematopoietic disorders and 136 healthy individuals from Parana State. The comparisons made between the patient and control group were performed using chi(2) test or Fisher exact test (bilateral p-value), as appropriated. Significance level was considered when p-value </= 0.05. RESULTS: Framework genes KIR3DL3, KIR3DP1, KIR2DL4 and KIR3DL2 were positive in all samples. The comparison between KIR repertoire of patients and healthy individuals revealed significant differences (p < 0.05) in inhibitors genes KIR2DL2 (p = 0.0005) and KIR2DL5 (p = 0.0067) and activating genes KIR2DS1 (p = 0.0013), KIR2DS2 (p = 0.0038), KIR2DS3 (p = 0.0153) that are more frequent in controls than in patients. The KIR2DS3 was significantly more frequent (p = 0.0031) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) when compared to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We observed a higher frequency of haplotype A (59 %) in the patients. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that susceptibility to leukemia can be influenced, at least, partly byKIR receptors.",,"['Sugioka, Daniele Kazue', 'Goncalves, Carlos Eduardo Ibaldo', 'Bicalho, Maria da Graca']","['Sugioka DK', 'Goncalves CE', 'Bicalho MD']","['Departamento de Genetica, Laboratorio de Imunogenetica e Histocompatibilidade (LIGH), Universidade Federal do Parana, R.

Mature miRNAs transcribed from the miR-17-92 cluster have an oncogenic activity, which are overexpressed in chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients compared with normal individuals. Besides, the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL oncoprotein from the Philadelphia chromosome in CML can affect this miRNA cluster. Genes with similar mRNA expression profiles are likely to be regulated by the same regulators. We hypothesize that target genes regulated by the same miRNA are co-expressed. In this study, we aim to explore the difference in the co-expression patterns of those genes potentially regulated by miR-17-92 cluster between the normal and the CML groups. We applied a statistical method for gene pair classification by identifying a disease-specific cutoff point that classified the co-expressed gene pairs into strong and weak co-expression classes. The method effectively identified the differences in the co-expression patterns from the overall structure. Functional annotation for co-expressed gene pairs showed that genes involved in the metabolism processes were more likely to be co-expressed in the normal group compared to the CML group. Our method can identify the co-expression pattern difference from the overall structure between two different distributions using the distribution-based statistical method. Functional annotation further provides the biological support. The co-expression pattern in the normal group is regarded as the inter-gene linkages, which represents the healthy pathological balance. Dysregulation of metabolism may be related to CML pathology. Our findings will provide useful information for investigating the novel CML mechanism and treatment.",,"['Wang, Fengfeng', 'Meng, Fei', 'Wang, Lili']","['Wang F', 'Meng F', 'Wang L']","['Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160921,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'co-expression', 'disease-specific cutoff point', 'metabolism', 'microRNA']",2016/10/07 06:00,2016/10/07 06:01,['2016/10/07 06:00'],"['2016/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2016.00167 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2016 Sep 21;7:167. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2016.00167. eCollection 2016.,,,PMC5030476,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pivotal study indicated that favorable-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia patients can be cured without any cytotoxic chemotherapy. Even high-risk patients are treatable with cytotoxic agents. Acute promyelocytic leukemia does not develop only by the dedifferentiation caused by PML-RARA. A determined oncogene other than PML-RARA which promotes cell proliferation would be required. CASE PRESENTATION: We recently treated a 30-year-old Japanese female who achieved molecular remission with only the administration of all-trans retinoic acid. The patient's leukemic clones concomitantly had a del(5q) aberrant chromosome with t(15;17) (q22;q12). The patient's bone marrow cells indicated clonal evolution of the tumor cells expressing CD13dim, CD33+, CD117+, and lacking HLA-DR, CD34 and CD11b. A fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis detected PML-RARA fusion genes in the patient's bone marrow specimens, leading to the diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: A del(5q) is one of the characteristic chromosomal abnormalities observed in myelodysplastic syndrome. On the other hand, up to 40 % of acute promyelocytic leukemia cases are known to harbor the addition of a clonal cytogenetic abnormality. However, such a case acute promyelocytic leukemia with del(5q) would be rare, rather than myelodysplastic syndrome, consequently obtaining t(15;17). Which cytogenetic abnormalities, acute promyelocytic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, came first is informative to make a clinical decision for the initial therapy. In this case, we speculated the PML-RARA translocation is an original pathogenesis and thereafter additional cytogenetic abnormalities (del(5q) and -6) common in myelodysplastic syndrome. All-trans retinoic acid lead the patient into molecular remission. We propose that an assessment of additional cytogenetic abnormality in acute promyelocytic leukemia would contribute to the clinical decisions regarding whether to treat disease with all-trans retinoic acid and cytotoxic agents. It would be of interest to know the extent of cytogenetic abnormality in the patients regarding to mixed leukemia. One or more additional cytogenetic abnormalities other than PML-RARA could account for the biological malignant grade and prognostic index.",,"['Imataki, Osamu', 'Uemura, Makiko']","['Imataki O', 'Uemura M']","['Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa 761-0793 Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, 1750-1 Ikenobe, Miki-cho, Kita-gun, Kagawa 761-0793 Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20161004,England,BMC Clin Pathol,BMC clinical pathology,101088665,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)', 'All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)', 'Arsenic oxide (ATO)', 'Case report', 'Clonal cytogenetic aberration (CCA)', 'PML-RARA']",2016/10/07 06:00,2016/10/07 06:01,['2016/10/07 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12907-016-0038-4 [doi]', '38 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Clin Pathol. 2016 Oct 4;16:16. doi: 10.1186/s12907-016-0038-4. eCollection 2016.,,,PMC5050668,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The level of CRP indicates the progress and prognosis of certain diseases; it is therefore necessary to measure CRP levels in the blood accurately. The normal concentration of CRP is reported to be 1-3 mg/L. Inflammatory events increase the level of CRP by up to 500 times; accordingly, CRP is a biomarker of acute inflammatory disease. In this study, we demonstrated the preparation of DNA aptamer-conjugated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Apt-PBMCs) that specifically capture human CRP. Live PBMCs functionalized with aptamers could detect different levels of human CRP by producing immune complexes with reporter antibody. The binding behavior of Apt-PBMCs toward highly concentrated CRP sites was also investigated. The immune responses of Apt-PBMCs were evaluated by measuring TNF-alpha secretion after stimulating the PBMCs with lipopolysaccharides. In summary, engineered Apt-PBMCs have potential applications as live cell based biosensors and for in vitro tracing of CRP secretion sites.",,"['Hwang, Jangsun', 'Seo, Youngmin', 'Jo, Yeonho', 'Son, Jaewoo', 'Choi, Jonghoon']","['Hwang J', 'Seo Y', 'Jo Y', 'Son J', 'Choi J']","['School of Integrative Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Integrative Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Integrative Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Integrative Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Integrative Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161006,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,,"['Aptamers, Nucleotide/*chemistry/genetics', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/blood/diagnosis', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology/pharmacology', 'Prognosis']",,,2016/10/07 06:00,2018/06/21 06:00,['2016/10/07 06:00'],"['2016/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['srep34778 [pii]', '10.1038/srep34778 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Oct 6;6:34778. doi: 10.1038/srep34778.,,,PMC5052522,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of co-signaling molecules on T-cell attack against leukemia mediated by CD19/CD3-bispecific T-cell engager. Primary CD19+ ALL blasts (n>/=10) and physiologic CD19+CD10+ bone marrow precursors were screened for 20 co-signaling molecules. PD-L1, PD-1, LAG-3, CD40, CD86, CD27, CD70 and HVEM revealed different stimulatory and inhibitory profiles of pediatric ALL compared to physiologic cells, with PD-L1 and CD86 as most prominent inhibitory and stimulatory markers. PD-L1 was increased in relapsed ALL patients (n=11) and in ALLs refractory to Blinatumomab (n=5). Exhaustion markers (PD-1, TIM-3) were significantly higher on patients' T cells compared to physiologic controls. T-cell proliferation and effector function was target-cell dependent and correlated to expression of co-signaling molecules. Blockade of inhibitory PD-1-PD-L and CTLA-4-CD80/86 pathways enhanced T-cell function whereas blockade of co-stimulatory CD28-CD80/86 interaction significantly reduced T-cell function. Combination of Blinatumomab and anti-PD-1 antibody was feasible and induced an anti-leukemic in vivo response in a 12-year-old patient with refractory ALL. In conclusion, ALL cells actively regulate T-cell function by expression of co-signaling molecules and modify efficacy of therapeutic T-cell attack against ALL.

Unbiased clustering and correlation showed that homoharringtonine (HHT), also known as omacetaxine mepesuccinate, exhibited preferential antileukemia effect against AML carrying internal tandem duplication of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD). It worked synergistically with FLT3 inhibitors to suppress leukemia growth in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, the effect was mediated by protein synthesis inhibition and reduction of short-lived proteins, including total and phosphorylated forms of FLT3 and its downstream signaling proteins. A phase 2 clinical trial of sorafenib and HHT combination treatment in FLT3-ITD AML patients resulted in complete remission (true or with insufficient hematological recovery) in 20 of 24 patients (83.3%), reduction of ITD allelic burden, and median leukemia-free and overall survivals of 12 and 33 weeks. The regimen has successfully bridged five patients to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and was well tolerated in patients unfit for conventional chemotherapy, including elderly and heavily pretreated patients. This study validated the principle and clinical relevance of in vitro drug testing and identified an improved treatment for FLT3-ITD AML.

We showed previously that G-CSF treatment generates low-density splenic granulocytes that inhibit experimental aGVHD. In this article, we show that aGVHD protection relies on incoming IL-10(+) neutrophils from G-CSF-treated donor spleen (G-Neutrophils). These G-Neutrophils have high phagocytic capacity, high peroxide production, low myeloperoxidase activity, and low cytoplasmic granule content, which accounts for their low density. Furthermore, they have low expression of MHC class II, costimulatory molecules, and low arginase1 expression. Also, they have low IFN-gamma, IL-17F, IL-2, and IL-12 levels, with increased IL-10 production and NO synthase 2 expression. These features are in accordance with the modulatory capacity of G-Neutrophils on regulatory T cell (Treg) generation. In vivo, CD25(+) Treg depletion shortly after transplantation with splenic cells from G-CSF-treated donors blocks suppression of aGVHD, suggesting Treg involvement in the protection induced by the G-Neutrophils. The immunocompetence and specificity of the semiallogeneic T cells, long-term after the bone marrow transplant using G-Neutrophils, were confirmed by third-party skin graft rejection; importantly, a graft-versus-leukemia assay showed that T cell activity was maintained, and all of the leukemic cells were eliminated. We conclude that G-CSF treatment generates a population of activated and suppressive G-Neutrophils that reduces aGVHD in an IL-10- and Treg-dependent manner, while maintaining immunocompetence and the graft versus leukemia effect.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Perobelli, Suelen Martins', 'Mercadante, Ana Carolina Terra', 'Galvani, Romulo Goncalves', 'Goncalves-Silva, Triciana', 'Alves, Ana Paula Gregorio', 'Pereira-Neves, Antonio', 'Benchimol, Marlene', 'Nobrega, Alberto', 'Bonomo, Adriana']","['Perobelli SM', 'Mercadante AC', 'Galvani RG', 'Goncalves-Silva T', 'Alves AP', 'Pereira-Neves A', 'Benchimol M', 'Nobrega A', 'Bonomo A']","['Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil.', 'Divisao de Medicina Experimental, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro 20231-050, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Pesquisa Sobre o Timo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.', 'Divisao de Medicina Experimental, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro 20231-050, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil.', 'Divisao de Medicina Experimental, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro 20231-050, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Pesquisa Sobre o Timo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil.', 'Divisao de Medicina Experimental, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro 20231-050, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Pesquisa Sobre o Timo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.', 'Divisao de Medicina Experimental, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro 20231-050, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Bioquimica Medica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia, FIOCRUZ Pernambuco, Pernambuco 50670-420, Brazil.', 'Universidade do Grande, Rio de Janeiro 25071-202, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Biologia Estrutural e Bioimagem da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil; and.', 'Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Imunologia, Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 21941-590, Brazil; adriana.bonomo@fiocruz.br acbonomo@gmail.com.', 'Divisao de Medicina Experimental, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro 20231-050, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Pesquisa Sobre o Timo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.', 'Programa FIOCancer, Vice Presidencia de Pesquisa e Laboratorios de Referencia/FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161005,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology/*metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neutrophil Activation', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2016/10/07 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/10/07 06:00'],"['2015/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1502023 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1502023 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 Nov 1;197(9):3725-3734. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1502023.

Mutants of the phosphorylated serine 61 also have been reported to have defects in the early life cycle. Here we show that a phosphorylated peptide motif derived from human papillomavirus 8 (HPV-8), the E2 hinge region including residues 240 to 255, can functionally replace the main phosphorylated motif of MLV p12 and can rescue the viral titer of a strain with the lethal p12-PM14 mutation. Complementation with the HPV-8 E2 hinge motif generated multiple second-site mutations in live viral passage assays. Additional p12 phosphorylation sites were detected, including the late domain of p12 (PPPY) as well as the late domain/protease cleavage site of matrix (LYPAL), by mass spectrometry and Western blotting. Chromatin binding of p12-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein and functional complementation of p12-PM14 occurred in a manner independent of the E2 hinge region phosphorylation. Replacement of serine 61 by alanine within the minimal tethering domain (61SPMASRLRGRR71) maintained tethering, but in the context of the full-length p12, mutants with substitutions in S61 remained untethered and lost infectivity, indicating phosphorylation of p12 serine 61 functions to temporally regulate early and late p12 functions. IMPORTANCE: The p12 protein, required for both early and late viral functions, is the predominant phosphorylated viral protein of Moloney MLV and is required for virus viability. Our studies indicate that the N terminus of p12 represses the early function of the chromatin binding domain and that deletion of the N terminus activates chromatin binding in the wild-type Moloney MLV p12 protein. Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis studies suggest that phosphorylation of both the repression domain and the chromatin binding domain acts to temporally regulate this process at the appropriate stages during infection.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

This acts to anchor the viral PIC in the nucleus as the nuclear envelope re-forms postmitosis. Mutations within the p12 C terminus (p12 PM13 to PM15) block early stages in viral replication. Within the p12 PM13 region (p12 60PSPMA65), our studies indicated that chromatin tethering was not detected when the wild-type (WT) p12 protein (M63) was expressed as a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion; however, constructs bearing p12-I63 were tethered. N-terminal truncations of the activated p12-I63-GFP indicated that tethering increased further upon deletion of p12 25DLLTEDPPPY34, which includes the late domain required for viral assembly. The p12 PM15 sequence (p12 70RREPP74) is critical for wild-type viral viability; however, virions bearing the PM15 mutation (p12 70AAAAA74) with a second M63I mutant were viable, with a titer 18-fold lower than that of the WT. The p12 M63I mutation amplified chromatin tethering and compensated for the loss of chromatin binding of p12 PM15. Rescue of the p12-M63-PM15 nonviable mutant with prototype foamy virus (PFV) and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) tethering sequences confirmed the function of p1270-74 in chromatin binding. Minimally, full-strength tethering was seen with only p12 61SPIASRLRGRR71 fused to GFP. These results indicate that the p12 C terminus alone is sufficient for chromatin binding and that the presence of the p12 25DLLTEDPPPY34 motif in the N terminus suppresses the ability to tether. IMPORTANCE: This study defines a regulatory mechanism controlling the differential roles of the MLV p12 protein in early and late replication. During viral assembly and egress, the late domain within the p12 N terminus functions to bind host vesicle release factors. During viral entry, the C terminus of p12 is required for tethering to host mitotic chromosomes. Our studies indicate that the p12 domain including the PPPY late sequence temporally represses the p12 chromatin tethering motif. Maximal p12 tethering was identified with only an 11-amino-acid minimal chromatin tethering motif encoded at p1261-71 Within this region, the p12-M63I substitution switches p12 into a tethering-competent state, partially rescuing the p12-PM15 tethering mutant. A model for how this conformational change regulates early versus late functions is presented.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Pharmacologic inhibition of Myb is therefore emerging as a potential therapeutic strategy for these diseases. By using a Myb reporter cell line, we have identified plumbagin and several naphthoquinones as potent low-molecular weight Myb inhibitors. We demonstrate that these compounds inhibit c-Myb by binding to the c-Myb transactivation domain and disrupting the cooperation of c-Myb with the coactivator p300, a major driver of Myb activity. Naphthoquinone-induced inhibition of c-Myb suppresses Myb target gene expression and induces the differentiation of the myeloid leukemia cell line HL60. We demonstrate that murine and human primary acute myeloid leukemia cells are more sensitive to naphthoquinone-induced inhibition of clonogenic proliferation than normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Overall, our work demonstrates for the first time the potential of naphthoquinones as small-molecule Myb inhibitors that may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of leukemia and other tumors driven by deregulated Myb.

Our previous study demonstrated that overexpression of Ik6 enhances proliferation and chemoresistance of leukemia cells, with a possible underlying mechanism that involves antiapoptosis. In the present study, we investigated whether Ik6 protects against apoptosis by regulating the Akt-FoxO1 pathway. Bone marrow samples from children with ALL were collected and evaluated. In Ik6(+) patients, the Akt-FoxO1 pathway was activated such that expression of phosphorylated Akt and FoxO1 was significantly increased, but that of Bim and p27 decreased. In vitro experiments in this study were performed by using human ALL Nalm-6 cells that were stably transfected with Ik6 (Nalm-6/Ik6) or Sup-B15 and Ik6 shRNA (Sup-B15/Ik6 shRNA). Upon treatment with daunorubicin, Nalm-6/Ik6 cells exhibited a statistically significant reduction in apoptosis, with increased expression of p-Akt and p-FoxO1. In contrast, an increase in apoptosis with decreased expression of p-Akt and p-FoxO1 was observed in Sup-B15/Ik6 shRNA cells. This protection was dependent on activation of caspase-3 cleavage. By using an activator and an inhibitor of Akt or FoxO1, we demonstrated that Akt or FoxO1 activation had no effect on Ik6 expression. In conclusion, Ik6, the upstream factor of Akt-FoxO1 pathway, can protect ALL cells against daunorubicin-induced apoptosis and can potentially be explored as a therapeutic target in the treatment of patients with ALL.",['(c) Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Han, Juan', 'Jin, Runming', 'Zhang, Meiling', 'Guo, Qing', 'Zhou, Fen']","['Han J', 'Jin R', 'Zhang M', 'Guo Q', 'Zhou F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China daisy_may@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161005,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (Ikaros 6 protein, human)', '0 (MK 2206)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Cytoprotection/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B lymphocyte', '*gene', '*signal transduction']",2016/10/07 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/10/07 06:00'],"['2016/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.2A0116-040RR [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.2A0116-040RR [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2017 Mar;101(3):675-681. doi: 10.1189/jlb.2A0116-040RR.

These blood culture specimens yielded a Gram-positive bacillus identified as E. rhusiopathiae by mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF (Microflex Bruker). The strain was sensitive to beta-lactam, fluoroquinolones and macrolides, resistant to vancomycin (natural resistance), and amikacin but sensitive to gentamicin. After 5 days of treatment by AAC, the patient became apyretic. One year after this episode, we reported no further symptoms of infection, or endocarditis. The natural resistance of E. rhusiopathiae in glycopeptides underlines the importance of a microbiological diagnosis.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 274 patients transplanted at our centre between 2004 and 2014. RESULTS: The ELN grouping is comparable to the Southwest Oncology Group/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (SWOG/ECOG) stratification in predicting the outcome after alloSCT [overall P = 0.0064 for disease-free survival (DFS), overall P = 0.003 for relapse]. Patients with an intermediate-1 profile have a significantly elevated 5-yr relapse incidence as compared to favourable risk patients, that is 40% vs. 15%, [hazard ratio (HR) 2.58, P = 0.048]. An intermediate-1 risk profile is an independent predictor for relapse as determined by multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR 3.05, P = 0.023). In intermediate-1 patients, the presence of an FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) is associated with a significantly increased relapse incidence (P = 0.0323), and a lower DFS (P = 0.0465). FLT3-ITD is an independent predictor for overall survival, DFS and relapse incidence in the intermediate-1 subgroup.

In this study, we analyzed the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in combination with interleukin (IL)-15 on the inflammatory immune response and expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in mononuclear cells of T2DM and DN uremia (DNU) patients. The human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was treated with peripheral blood serum isolated from 30 healthy controls and T2DM and DNU patients each, cultured in the presence or absence of 1,25-(OH)2D3, and subsequently treated with LPS and IL-15. The VDR mRNA and protein expression in THP-1 cells was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot (and immunofluorescence assay), respectively, and IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations in the culture supernatant were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. LPS treatment induced a significant decrease in VDR mRNA expression in T2DM and DNU serum-treated THP-1 cells compared to the control cells (P < 0.05). The VDR protein expression in DNU serum-treated THP-1 cells was also significantly down-regulated (P < 0.05). LPS treatment induced IL-6 secretion in serum-treated THP-1 cells (P < 0.05), while 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment inhibited IL-6 secretion to some extent. These findings suggested that LPS down-regulates the expression of VDR in mononuclear cells of T2DM and DNU patients and induces an imbalance in the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine response, while 1,25-(OH)2D3 partially reversed the effect of LPS and protected patients with T2DM and DNU.",,"['Wu, E L', 'Cui, H X']","['Wu EL', 'Cui HX']","[""Hemopurification Center, Binzhou People's Hospital, Binzhou, China wuelwu@163.com."", ""Hemopurification Center, Binzhou People's Hospital, Binzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160829,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (VDR protein, human)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Diabetic Nephropathies/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Interleukin-15/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/immunology', 'Uremia/blood/*immunology/pathology']",,,2016/10/06 06:00,2017/02/23 06:00,['2016/10/06 06:00'],"['2016/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr8553 [pii]', '10.4238/gmr.15038553 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2016 Aug 29;15(3). pii: gmr8553. doi: 10.4238/gmr.15038553.,,,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the active ingredients of cinnamon were isolated, purified, and identified. The transwell transport pool formed with the Caco-2 cell model was used to filter the active ingredients of cinnamon by simulating the gastrointestinal barrier in vitro. Moreover, the cell morphology, cell cycle status, apoptosis status, and antigenic variation of the cell surface antigens were observed and measured in K562 cells after treatment with the active ingredients of cinnamon. Our results showed that 50-75 muM was a safe concentration of cinnamon extract for treatment of K562 cells for 72 h. The cinnamon extract caused growth inhibition of K562 cells. Cinnamon extract seemed to arrest the cells at the G1 stage and increased the apoptosis rate significantly.

METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 2,314 patients (AML, n = 1754; MDS, n = 560) to determine the overall safety and efficacy of this regimen. RESULTS: The complete response (CR) rate of AML patients (53%) was significantly higher than that of MDS/transformed-AML patients (45%; P = 0.007). The CR rate of patients with newly diagnosed AML (62%) was significantly higher than in patients with relapsed/refractory AML (50%; P = 0.001). There were no significant difference in CR rates between elderly AML patients (54%) and all AML patients (P = 0.721). When compared with non-HAG regimens for AML/MDS induction therapy, the CR rate of patients treated with HAG was significantly higher than in treated with intensive chemotherapy (P = 0.000). No significant differences in CR rates were observed between patients treated with HAG and those treated with CAG (cytarabine, aclarubicin, G-CSF) regimens (P = 0.073). HAG regimen was well tolerated, with early death (ED) in 2%, grade IV myelosurrpression in 52% and infection in 50%. Reports of ED and rates of myelosuppression were reduced as compared with intensive chemotherapy (P = 0.000 and P = 0.000, respectively). CONCLUSION: The HAG regimen is an effective and safe regimen for the treatment of AML and MDS, and appears to be more effective and better tolerated than intensive chemotherapy. Future randomized controlled trials and further meta-analyses are strongly needed to confirm its efficacy and safety, especially in comparison with intensive chemotherapy.",,"['Xie, Mixue', 'Jiang, Qi', 'Li, Li', 'Zhu, Jingjing', 'Zhu, Lixia', 'Zhou, De', 'Zheng, Yanlong', 'Yang, Xiudi', 'Zhu, Mingyu', 'Sun, Jianai', 'Xie, Wanzhuo', 'Ye, Xiujin']","['Xie M', 'Jiang Q', 'Li L', 'Zhu J', 'Zhu L', 'Zhou', 'Zheng Y', 'Yang X', 'Zhu M', 'Sun J', 'Xie W', 'Ye X']","['Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20161005,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Harringtonines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Harringtonines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/10/06 06:00,2017/06/21 06:00,['2016/10/06 06:00'],"['2016/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0164238 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-23367 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Oct 5;11(10):e0164238. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0164238. eCollection 2016.,,,PMC5051946,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,

The nuclear contents are mainly composed of the histone-DNA complex and neutrophil elastase. This study investigated whether leukemic cells could release ET and the released histone could induce endothelial activation, eventually resulting in leukemic progression. METHODS: The circulating ET were measured in 80 patients with hematologic diseases and 40 healthy controls. ET formation and ROS levels were investigated during leukemic cell proliferation in vitro. Histone-induced endothelial adhesion molecules expression and cell survival were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Acute leukemia patients had high levels of ET, which correlated with peripheral blast count. Leukemic cells produced high ROS levels and released extracellular histone, which was significantly blocked by antioxidants. Histone significantly induced 3 endothelial adhesion molecules expression, and promoted leukemic cell adhesion to endothelial cells, which was inhibited by histone inhibitors (heparin, polysialic acid, and activated protein C), neutralizing antibodies against these adhesion molecules, and a Toll like receptor(TLR)9 antagonist. When leukemic cells were co-cultured with endothelial cells, adherent leukemic cells showed better survival than the non-adherent ones, demonstrating that histone-treated endothelial cells protected leukemic cells from both spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced death. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate for the first time that extracellular histone can be released from leukemic cells through a ROS-dependent mechanism. The released histone promotes leukemic cell adhesion by inducting the surface expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and eventually protects leukemic cells from cell death.",,"['Yoo, Hyun Ju', 'Lee, Jee-Soo', 'Kim, Ji-Eun', 'Gu, JaYoon', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Kim, Inho', 'Kim, Hyun Kyung']","['Yoo HJ', 'Lee JS', 'Kim JE', 'Gu J', 'Koh Y', 'Kim I', 'Kim HK']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161005,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Extracellular Traps/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",,,2016/10/06 06:00,2017/06/16 06:00,['2016/10/06 06:00'],"['2016/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0163982 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-25598 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Oct 5;11(10):e0163982. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0163982. eCollection 2016.,,,PMC5051947,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that both SET and c-MYC expression are frequently elevated in T-ALL cell lines and primary samples compared to healthy T cells. Treatment of T-ALL cells with the SET antagonist OP449 restored the activity of PP2A and reduced SET interaction with the PP2A catalytic subunit, resulting in a decrease in cell viability and c-MYC expression in a dose-dependent manner. Since a tight balance between phosphatases and kinases is required for the growth of both normal and malignant cells, we sought to identify a kinase inhibitor that would synergize with SET antagonism. We tested various T-ALL cell lines against a small-molecule inhibitor screen of 66 compounds targeting two-thirds of the tyrosine kinome and found that combined treatment of T-ALL cells with dovitinib, an orally active multi-targeted small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and OP449 synergistically reduced the viability of all tested T-ALL cell lines. Mechanistically, combined treatment with OP449 and dovitinib decreased total and phospho c-MYC levels and reduced ERK1/2, AKT, and p70S6 kinase activity in both NOTCH-dependent and independent T-ALL cell lines.

After an iterative design process, the lead, or designed, peptide X-A possesses a six-fold longer life in a cytosolic lysate than that of the starting peptide. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of purified ABL kinase for the lead peptide (125 s(-1) muM(-1)) is similar to that of the starting peptide (103 s(-1) muM(-1)) demonstrating preservation of the peptide's ability to serve as a kinase substrate. When incubated in cytosolic lysates, the lead peptide is slowly degraded into 4 fragments over time. In contrast, when loaded into intact cells, the peptide is metabolized into 5 fragments, with only 2 of the fragments corresponding to those in the lysate. Thus the two environments possess differing peptidase activities, which must be accounted for when designing peptidase-resistant peptides. In both settings, the substrate is phosphorylated by BCR-ABL providing a readout of BCR-ABL activity. A small panel of tyrosine kinase inhibitors verified the substrate's specificity for BCR-ABL/ABL kinase activity in both lysates and cells in spite of the multitude of other kinases present.

Ibrutinib is a new biologic agent used for treatment of CLL, mantle cell lymphoma, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. It acts by inhibiting Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a kinase downstream of the B-cell receptor critical for B-cell survival and proliferation. Ibrutinib use has not been associated previously with cryptococcal disease. However, recent evidence suggested that treatments aimed at blocking the function of Bruton's tyrosine kinase could pose a higher risk for cryptococcal infection in a mice model.

Survival time for the two treatments was modeled based on the results of CLL11 clinical trial and external sources. Each health state was associated with a utility value and direct medical costs. The utilities were obtained from a utility elicitation study conducted in the UK. Costs and general background mortality data were obtained from published Spanish sources. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were conducted, with a time frame of 20 years. The health outcomes were measured as life years (LYs) gained and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Efficiency was measured as the cost per LY or per QALY gained of the most effective regimen. RESULTS: In the deterministic base case analysis, each patient treated with GClb resulted in 0.717 LYs gained and 0.673 QALYs gained versus RClb. The cost per LY and per QALY gained with GClb versus RClb was euro23,314 and euro24,838, respectively. The results proved stable in most of the univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, with a probabilistic cost per QALY gained of euro24,734 (95% confidence interval: euro21,860-28,367). CONCLUSION: Using GClb to treat patients with previously untreated CLL for whom full-dose fludarabine-based therapy is unsuitable allows significant gains in terms of LYs and QALYs versus treatment with RClb. Treatment with GClb versus RClb can be regarded as efficient when considered the willingness to pay thresholds commonly used in Spain.",,"['Casado, Luis Felipe', 'Burgos, Amparo', 'Gonzalez-Haba, Eva', 'Loscertales, Javier', 'Krivasi, Tania', 'Orofino, Javier', 'Rubio-Terres, Carlos', 'Rubio-Rodriguez, Dario']","['Casado LF', 'Burgos A', 'Gonzalez-Haba E', 'Loscertales J', 'Krivasi T', 'Orofino J', 'Rubio-Terres C', 'Rubio-Rodriguez D']","['Hematology Department, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain.', 'Pharmacy Department, Hospital General Universitario de Alicante, Alicante, Spain.', 'Pharmacy Department, Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Deparment, Hospital Universitario De La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland.', 'Roche Farma SA, Madrid, Spain.', 'Health Value, Madrid, Spain.', 'Health Value, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160921,New Zealand,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,101560564,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chlorambucil', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'cost-effectiveness', 'obinutuzumab', 'rituximab']",2016/10/06 06:00,2016/10/06 06:01,['2016/10/06 06:00'],"['2016/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CEOR.S114524 [doi]', 'ceor-8-475 [pii]']",epublish,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res. 2016 Sep 21;8:475-484. doi: 10.2147/CEOR.S114524. eCollection 2016.,,,PMC5036824,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the triazole posaconazole in these patients is missing. This multicenter survey analyzed trough concentrations of 33 pediatric patients with a median age of 8 years during 108 neutropenic episodes who received prophylactic posaconazole oral suspension. A total of 172 posaconazole trough levels were determined to median 438 ng/ml (range 111-2011 ng/ml; mean 468 +/- 244 ng/ml). Age and gender had no influence on posaconazole plasma levels. Posaconazole was not discontinued due to adverse events in any of the patients. Only hepatic parameters significantly increased beyond the upper normal limit to median values of ALT of 87 U/l (P < .0001), and AST of 67 U/l (P < .0001). One patient with a median posaconazole trough concentration of 306 ng/ml experienced an invasive fungal infection. In conclusion, posaconazole was effective, safe and feasible in 33 pediatric patients with neutropenia >/=5 days after chemotherapy. Median posaconazole plasma concentrations were approximately 1.6-fold lower than the recommended plasma level of 700 ng/ml. Larger patient cohorts are needed to evaluate these findings.","['(c) The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The', 'International Society for Human and Animal Mycology.

No consensus for optimal treatment modalities is available today and the full characterization of this leukemia is still emerging. We identified here a BPDCN-specific transcriptomic profile when compared with those of acute myeloid leukemia and T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as the transcriptomic signature of primary PDCs. This BPDCN gene signature identified a dysregulation of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis, some of them being liver X receptor (LXR) target genes. LXR agonist treatment of primary BPDCN cells and BPDCN cell lines restored LXR target gene expression and increased cholesterol efflux via the upregulation of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1. LXR agonist treatment was responsible for limiting BPDCN cell proliferation and inducing intrinsic apoptotic cell death. LXR activation in BPDCN cells was shown to interfere with 3 signaling pathways associated with leukemic cell survival, namely: NF-kappaB activation, as well as Akt and STAT5 phosphorylation in response to the BPDCN growth/survival factor interleukin-3. These effects were increased by the stimulation of cholesterol efflux through a lipid acceptor, the apolipoprotein A1. In vivo experiments using a mouse model of BPDCN cell xenograft revealed a decrease of leukemic cell infiltration and BPDCN-induced cytopenia associated with increased survival after LXR agonist treatment. This demonstrates that cholesterol homeostasis is modified in BPDCN and can be normalized by treatment with LXR agonists which can be proposed as a new therapeutic approach.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Ceroi, Adam', 'Masson, David', 'Roggy, Anne', 'Roumier, Christophe', 'Chague, Cecile', 'Gauthier, Thierry', 'Philippe, Laure', 'Lamarthee, Baptiste', 'Angelot-Delettre, Fanny', 'Bonnefoy, Francis', 'Perruche, Sylvain', 'Biichle, Sabeha', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Macintyre, Elisabeth', 'Lagrost, Laurent', 'Garnache-Ottou, Francine', 'Saas, Philippe']","['Ceroi A', 'Masson D', 'Roggy A', 'Roumier C', 'Chague C', 'Gauthier T', 'Philippe L', 'Lamarthee B', 'Angelot-Delettre F', 'Bonnefoy F', 'Perruche S', 'Biichle S', 'Preudhomme C', 'Macintyre E', 'Lagrost L', 'Garnache-Ottou F', 'Saas P']","['Unite 1098, INSERM, Besancon, France.', 'Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Unite Mixte de Recherche 1098, Besancon, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', ""Laboratoires d'Excellence (LabEx) Lipoproteines et Sante: Prevention et Traitement des Maladies Inflammatoires et du Cancer (LipSTIC), Besancon/Dijon, France."", ""Laboratoires d'Excellence (LabEx) Lipoproteines et Sante: Prevention et Traitement des Maladies Inflammatoires et du Cancer (LipSTIC), Besancon/Dijon, France."", 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, INSERM Unite 866, Dijon, France.', 'Unite 1098, INSERM, Besancon, France.', 'Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Unite Mixte de Recherche 1098, Besancon, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Besancon, France.', ""Laboratoires d'Excellence (LabEx) Lipoproteines et Sante: Prevention et Traitement des Maladies Inflammatoires et du Cancer (LipSTIC), Besancon/Dijon, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre de Biologie Pathologie, Institut de Recherches sur le Cancer de Lille, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire de Lille, INSERM Unite 837, Lille, France;

There was a significant difference in cumulative incidence of relapse in favor of those transplanted after 2006 (p = .008), whereas non-relapse mortality did not differ between the two groups (p = .683). Our findings suggest that the introduction of ATO may have reduced post-transplantation relapse without increasing non-relapse mortality, resulting in significant improvements in overall outcomes for relapsed APL patients undergoing autologous HCT during CR2.",,"['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Yano, Shingo', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Gotoh, Moritaka', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Watakabe, Kyoko', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Nishikawa, Akinori', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Tomita, Naoto', 'Murata, Makoto', 'Hashimoto, Hisako', 'Henzan, Hideho', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Sawa, Masashi', 'Kohno, Akio', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Takami, Akiyoshi']","['Yanada M', 'Yano S', 'Kanamori H', 'Gotoh M', 'Emi N', 'Watakabe K', 'Kurokawa M', 'Nishikawa A', 'Mori T', 'Tomita N', 'Murata M', 'Hashimoto H', 'Henzan H', 'Kanda Y', 'Sawa M', 'Kohno A', 'Atsuta Y', 'Ichinohe T', 'Takami A']","['a Fujita Health University School of Medicine , Toyoake , Japan.', 'b Jikei University School of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan.', 'c Kanagawa Cancer Center , Yokohama , Japan.', 'd Tokyo Medical University , Tokyo , Japan.', 'a Fujita Health University School of Medicine , Toyoake , Japan.', 'e Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital , Tokyo , Japan.', 'f Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan.', 'g Wakayama Medical University , Wakayama , Japan.', 'h Keio University School of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan.', 'i Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine , Yokohama , Japan.', 'j Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine , Nagoya , Japan.', 'k Kobe Medical Center Central Hospital/Foundation of Biomedical Research and Innovation , Kobe , Japan.', 'l Hamanomachi Hospital , Fukuoka , Japan.', 'm Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University , Saitama , Japan.', 'n Anjo Kosei Hospital , Anjo , Japan.', 'o JA Aichi Konan Kosei Hospital , Konan , Japan.', 'j Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine , Nagoya , Japan.', 'p Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation , Nagoya , Japan.', 'q Hiroshima University Hospital , Hiroshima , Japan.', 'r Aichi Medical University School of Medicine , Nagakute , Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161005,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*arsenic trioxide', '*autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*second complete remission']",2016/10/06 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/10/06 06:00'],"['2016/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2016.1231406 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2017 May;58(5):1061-1067. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2016.1231406.

Pseudoreticulocytosis and an abnormal reticulocyte profile were observed in a dog with large form babesiosis presented at our institution. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this retrospective study were to determine if dogs with babesiosis and other dogs had abnormal reticulocyte profiles, and to correlate these profiles with the primary diagnosis. METHODS: All canine CBCs obtained with the Sysmex XT-2000iV or Procyte DX were reviewed. Cases of large form babesiosis were identified and their reticulocyte dot plots were analyzed. Dogs with abnormal reticulocyte profiles but without microscopically apparent intraerythrocytic Babesia piroplasms were identified. The reticulocyte profiles and fluorescence ratios of dogs with and without babesiosis were compared. RESULTS: Twenty of 92 dogs with babesiosis had abnormal reticulocyte profiles, including 8 with a separation between the reticulocyte and mature RBC plots or a continuum of reticulocytes from the RBC plot but with a higher density of dots in the middle of the ""comet tail"" than in the left quarter of the dot plot. Thirteen of 6980 dogs without Babesia on the blood smear had abnormal reticulocyte profiles, including 3 with leukemia. The medium-fluorescence reticulocyte ratios tended to be higher in dogs with babesiosis and abnormal dot plots than in other dogs, whereas the high-fluorescence ratio was higher in one dog with leukemia. CONCLUSION: Abnormal reticulocyte dot plots and atypical reticulocyte fluorescence ratios may occur in dogs with babesiosis and alert clinical pathologists to consider this diagnosis.",['(c) 2016 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.'],"['Piane, Laetitia', 'Young, Karen M', 'Giraud, Lena', 'Bourges-Abella, Nathalie', 'Trumel, Catherine']","['Piane L', 'Young KM', 'Giraud L', 'Bourges-Abella N', 'Trumel C']","['Equipe de Biologie Medicale-Histologie, CREFRE, Universite de Toulouse, INSERM, UPS, ENVT, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Pathobiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Unite de Medecine Interne, Universite de Toulouse, UPS, INP, ENVT, Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe de Biologie Medicale-Histologie, CREFRE, Universite de Toulouse, INSERM, UPS, ENVT, Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe de Biologie Medicale-Histologie, CREFRE, Universite de Toulouse, INSERM, UPS, ENVT, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20161004,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Babesia/*isolation & purification', 'Babesiosis/*blood/parasitology', 'Blood Cell Count/instrumentation/veterinary', 'Dog Diseases/*blood/parasitology', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Reticulocyte Count/instrumentation/veterinary', 'Reticulocytes/cytology', 'Reticulocytosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['Babesia', 'dot plots', 'pseudoreticulocytosis', 'reticulocyte fluorescence ratios']",2016/10/05 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2016/10/05 06:00'],"['2016/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/vcp.12396 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2016 Dec;45(4):598-603. doi: 10.1111/vcp.12396.

The aim of the conference was to develop recommendations on critical subjects difficult to consider in detail in the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines. The following areas were identified: (i) the elderly patient, (ii) prognostic factors suitable for clinical use and (iii) the 'ultra-high-risk' group. Before the conference, the expert panel was divided into three working groups; each group focused on one of these areas in order to address four clinically relevant questions relating to that topic. All relevant scientific literature, as identified by the experts, was reviewed in advance. During the consensus conference, each working group developed recommendations to address each of the four questions assigned to their group. These recommendations were then presented to the entire panel and a consensus was reached. This manuscript presents recommendations dedicated to the second area of interest, i.e. prognostic factors suitable for clinical use. The four topics [i.e. interim positron emission tomography (PET), TP53 mutations, cell of origin (COO) and minimal residual disease (MRD)] were primarily chosen because of the bulk of available data together with the lack of clear guidance regarding their use in clinical practice and within clinical trials. Results, including a summary of evidence supporting each recommendation, are detailed in this manuscript. The panel acknowledged that detection of TP53 inactivation by deletion or mutation in CLL should be implemented in clinical practice (level of evidence I, strength of recommendation A). Due to their potentially high prognostic value, at least in some lymphoma entities, implementation of interim PET, COO and MRD was highly recommended in the context of clinical trials. All expert panel members approved this final article.","['(c) The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the', 'European Society for Medical Oncology. All rights reserved.

A report by the Polish Adult Leukaemia Group.,154-159,10.1111/ejh.12814 [doi],"OBJECTIVES: The epidemiology of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) differs among countries. Here, we present the first epidemiological indices determined for Poland. METHODS: Twenty-one haematological centres participated in the study. Patients diagnosed with MDS and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-29% blasts were enrolled. Data collection was conducted for strictly predefined period. RESULTS: The overall crude incidence rate for all MDS subtypes was 1.95 (95% CI, 1.81-2.09) per 100 000 person-years: 2.46 (95% CI, 2.24-2.69) for males and 1.47 (95% CI, 1.31-1.65) for females; after excluding AML cases, the indices were as follows: 2.35 (95% CI, 2.08-2.66) for males and 1.27 (95% CI, 1.08-1.5) for females. Prevalence rate was 6.2 per 100 000 persons (95% CI, 5.96-6.45), that is 6.86 (95% CI, 6.49-7.24) for males and 5.58 (95% CI, 5.26-5.92) for females. Both incidence and prevalence increased with increasing age. The most frequently diagnosed MDS subtype was refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), responsible for 30.3% of all newly diagnosed MDSs.

Few retrospective studies have shown the efficacy of various antibiotic prophylactic regimens in children. We retrospectively studied 50 pediatric patients treated on the AML-BFM 2004 protocol between 2005 and 2015 at St. Anna Children's Hospital and assessed the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the frequency of febrile neutropenia and bacterial sepsis. Fifty pediatric patients underwent 199 evaluable chemotherapy cycles. Viridans sepsis occurred after none of 98 cycles with prophylactic administration of teicoplanin/vancomycin in comparison to 12 cases of viridans sepsis among 79 cycles without systemic antibacterial prophylaxis (0 vs. 15 %, p < 0.0001). In addition, there were significantly fewer episodes of febrile neutropenia in the teicoplanin/vancomycin group (44 % vs. no prophylaxis 82 %, p < 0.0001). Severity of infection seemed to be worse when no antibiotic prophylaxis had been administered with a higher rate of intensive care unit treatment (0/98, 0 %, vs. 4/79, 5 %, p = 0.038). So far, no increase of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates in surveillance cultures was noticed. Antibiotic prophylaxis with teicoplanin (or vancomycin) appears safe and feasible and resulted in eradication of viridans sepsis and decreased incidence of febrile neutropenia in pediatric AML patients.

Half of all T-ALL patients exhibit mutations in Notch1, which leads to aberrant Notch1 associated signaling cascades. Notch1 activation is mediated by the gamma-secretase cleavage of the Notch1 receptor into the active intracellular domain of Notch1 (NCID). Clinical trials of gamma-secretase small molecule inhibitors (GSIs) as single agents for the treatment of T-ALL have been unsuccessful. The present study demonstrated, using immunofluorescence and western blotting, that blocking gamma-secretase activity in T-ALL cells with N-[(3,5-difluorophenyl) acetyl]-L-alanyl-2-phenyl] glycine-1,1-dimethylethyl ester (DAPT) downregulated NCID and upregulated the tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) death receptor 5 (DR5). Upregulation of DR5 restored the sensitivity of T-ALL cells to TRAIL. Combination index revealed that the combined treatment of DAPT and TRAIL synergistically enhanced apoptosis compared with treatment with either drug alone. TRAIL combined with the clinically evaluated gamma-secretase inhibitor 3-[(1r, 4s)-4-(4-chlorophenylsulfonyl)-4-(2, 5-difluorophenyl) cyclohexyl] propanoic acid (MK-0752) also significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced cell death compared with either drug alone. DAPT/TRAIL apoptotic synergy was dependent on the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and was associated with a decrease in BH3 interacting-domain death agonist and x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis.

GS may develop simultaneously to AML or as a relapse of leukemia, particularly following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Subperiosteal bone, lymph nodes and skin are commonly involved, whereas rhinopharyngeal involvement is less common, with only 14 cases reported in the literature. Due to its rarity, rhinopharyngeal GS may lead to diagnostic pitfalls, particularly when it is poorly differentiated or is without concomitant marrow involvement. Thus, immunohistochemical findings play a key role in diagnosis. The current report describes a case of a 53-year-old female suffering from rhinopharyngeal GS and with a history of AML treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, focusing on the importance of the immunohistochemical pattern to assess the right diagnosis.

Bone marrow trephines of CML patients in remission under imatinib therapy exhibited significantly higher numbers of CD3 and CD20 infiltrates (partly ordered in aggregates) compared with patients with newly diagnosed CML and control individuals. Similarly, nuclear expression of BACH2 in granulopoietic cells was increased in CML patients treated with imatinib, which may represent the histological correlate of the positive treatment effect. Furthermore, since BACH2 is involved in B cell development, its altered expression patterns by imatinib may be one explanation for high B cell numbers, as revealed by CD20/BACH2 (nuclear)-positive cells.

The aim of the present study was to develop liposomes of AR and to assess their physicochemical characteristics and anti-inflammatory activity in the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. Liposomes containing various ratios of AR to lipid and a phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol molar ratio of 7:3 were prepared by thin-film hydration (TF), reverse-phase evaporation (REV) and polyol dilution (PD). The results showed that AR liposomes prepared by TF had a multilamellar structure and a large size, whereas those prepared by REV and PD were oligolamellar in structure, and of a smaller size. The particle sizes and zeta potentials of the liposomes ranged from 196.5 to 456.6 nm and from -4.34 to -18.94 mV, respectively. The AR to lipid ratio was shown to have no significant influence on particle size, while the zeta potential generally increased with increasing AR to lipid ratio. The highest entrapment efficiency values were detected in liposomes with an AR to lipid ratio of 1:5, and for liposomes prepared by TF, REV and PD methods, the entrapment efficiencies were 55.71+/-2.04, 56.21+/-3.59 and 67.68+/-1.37%, respectively. AR was found to exert no toxicity on THP-1 cells. The maximum anti-inflammatory activities of AR and AR liposomes, evaluated in terms of the percentage inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in THP-1 cells, were ~52% at a concentration of 1 microg/ml.

We investigate patterns, trends and survival of cancers in children and young adults in N. Ireland. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 21 years (1993-2013) of cancer incidence data including non-malignant brain tumours from the N. Ireland Cancer Registry for persons aged 0-24 years was analysed using Joinpoint regresssion for trend and the Kaplan Meier method for survival analysis up to end 2013 with excess mortality calculated at one and five years after first cancer diagnosis using standardised mortality ratios. RESULTS: 2633 children and young people were diagnosed with cancer, 1386 (52.6%) male and 1247 female with 1139 (43.3%) aged 0-14. While trends increased over time they did not reach statistical significance except in the 15-24 age group for males and females combined. The most common cancers for age 0-14 were brain, eye and central nervous system and leukaemia with skin (including non-melanoma skin) the most common in the 15-24 age group. 59 patients (2.2%) had a record of a second cancer. Survival was high at 90.7% after 1 year, better among females and similar for older and younger groups. Although mortality in children is low overall, there was an excess mortality 24.7% (22-27.5) p<0.001 at one year and 7.3% (5.5-9.2) p<0.001 for those who survived 5 years. Excluding the primary cancer there was an excess mortality for one year survivors, with deaths twice that of the background level (SMR= 2.2 (1.3-3.0)p=0.005 and although one and a half times background levels at 5 years, the excess mortality was not significant 1.5 (0.6-2.3 p=0.269). CONCLUSION: Whilst survival from childhood cancers is excellent, this work in common with larger studies, highlights the need for ongoing monitoring of cancer survivors.

Studies of infant and paediatric patients with MLL-AF4+ B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL) have reported mutations in KRAS and NRAS with incidences ranging from 25 to 50%. Whereas previous studies employed Sanger sequencing, here we used next generation amplicon deep sequencing for in depth evaluation of RAS mutations in 36 paediatric patients at diagnosis of MLL-AF4+ leukaemia. RAS mutations including those in small sub-clones were detected in 63.9% of patients. Furthermore, the mutational analysis of 17 paired samples at diagnosis and relapse revealed complex RAS clone dynamics and showed that the mutated clones present at relapse were almost all originated from clones that were already detectable at diagnosis and survived to the initial therapy. Finally, we showed that mutated patients were indeed characterized by a RAS related signature at both transcriptional and protein levels and that the targeting of the RAS pathway could be of beneficial for treatment of MLL-AF4+ BCP-ALL clones carrying somatic RAS mutations.",,"['Trentin, Luca', 'Bresolin, Silvia', 'Giarin, Emanuela', 'Bardini, Michela', 'Serafin, Valentina', 'Accordi, Benedetta', 'Fais, Franco', 'Tenca, Claudya', 'De Lorenzo, Paola', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Kronnie, Geertruy Te', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Trentin L', 'Bresolin S', 'Giarin E', 'Bardini M', 'Serafin V', 'Accordi B', 'Fais F', 'Tenca C', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Kronnie GT', 'Basso G']","['Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padua, Via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padua, Via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padua, Via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Department of Paediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padua, Via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padua, Via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS AOU San Martino - IST Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Department of Paediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Biostatistics Center, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Biostatistics Center, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Department of Paediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padua, Via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padua, Via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161004,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (NRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,,"['Female', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*genetics/metabolism', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', '*Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/10/05 06:00,2018/06/16 06:00,['2016/10/05 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['srep34449 [pii]', '10.1038/srep34449 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Oct 4;6:34449. doi: 10.1038/srep34449.,,,PMC5048141,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike previous research that focused on Cr(VI)-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis, this study placed emphasis on premature senescence that can be induced by low-dose and long-term Cr(VI) exposure. We found Cr(VI) induced premature senescence in L-02 hepatocytes, as confirmed by increase in senescence associated-beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity. Cr(VI) stabilized p53 through phosphorylation at Ser15 and increased expression of p53-transcriptional target p21. Mechanism study revealed Cr(VI) targeted and inhibited mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (MRCC) I and II to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. By applying antioxidant Trolox, we also confirmed that ROS mediated p53 activation. A tetracycline-inducible lentiviral expression system containing shRNA to p53 was used to knockout p53. We found p53 could inhibit pro-survival genes B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), myeloid leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and S phase related cell cycle proteins cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), Cyclin E to induce premature senescence, and the functional role of ROS in Cr(VI)-induced premature senescence is depend on p53.

In this study, we aimed to confirm the long-term outcome of L92-13, and to identify who can or cannot be cured by shorter duration of maintenance therapy. To obtain sentinel cytogenetics information that had been missed before, we performed genetic analysis with genomic microarray and target intron-capture sequencing from diagnostic bone marrow smear. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 10 years from the end of therapy was 66.0+/-2.8%. Females (n=138) had better DFS (74.6+/-3.7%) than males (n=142, 57.5+/-4.2%, P=0.002).

While well-dispersed N-TiO2 NPs (</=100 mug/ml) were inert, their photo-activation with visible light led to ROS-mediated autophagy in leukemia K562 cells and normal peripheral lymphocytes, and this increased in parallel with increasing NP concentrations and light doses. At a constant light energy (12 J/cm(2)), increasing N-TiO2 NP concentrations increased ROS levels to trigger autophagy-dependent megakaryocytic terminal differentiation in K562 cells. By contrast, an ROS challenge induced by high N-TiO2 NP concentrations led to autophagy-associated apoptotic cell death. Using chemical autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine and Bafilomycin A1), we confirmed that autophagy is required for both terminal differentiation and apoptosis induced by photo-activated N-TiO2. Pre-incubation of leukemic cells with ROS scavengers muted the effect of N-TiO2 NP-based PDT on cell fate, highlighting the upstream role of ROS in our system.

Primed enhancers are marked by histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) mono/di-methylation (H3K4me1/2). Active enhancers are further marked by H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Mixed-lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4/KMT2D) is a major enhancer H3K4me1/2 methyltransferase with functional redundancy with MLL3 (KMT2C). However, its role in cell fate maintenance and transition is poorly understood. Here, we show in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that MLL4 associates with, but is surprisingly dispensable for the maintenance of, active enhancers of cell-identity genes. As a result, MLL4 is dispensable for cell-identity gene expression and self-renewal in ESCs. In contrast, MLL4 is required for enhancer-binding of H3K27 acetyltransferase p300, enhancer activation, and induction of cell-identity genes during ESC differentiation. MLL4 protein, rather than MLL4-mediated H3K4 methylation, controls p300 recruitment to enhancers. We also show that, in somatic cells, MLL4 is dispensable for maintaining cell identity but essential for reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells. These results indicate that, although enhancer priming by MLL4 is dispensable for cell-identity maintenance, it controls cell fate transition by orchestrating p300-mediated enhancer activation.",,"['Wang, Chaochen', 'Lee, Ji-Eun', 'Lai, Binbin', 'Macfarlan, Todd S', 'Xu, Shiliyang', 'Zhuang, Lenan', 'Liu, Chengyu', 'Peng, Weiqun', 'Ge, Kai']","['Wang C', 'Lee JE', 'Lai B', 'Macfarlan TS', 'Xu S', 'Zhuang L', 'Liu C', 'Peng W', 'Ge K']","['Laboratory of Endocrinology and Receptor Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Endocrinology and Receptor Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Endocrinology and Receptor Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Division of Developmental Biology, The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Endocrinology and Receptor Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Endocrinology and Receptor Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Transgenic Core, Center for Molecular Medicine, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Department of Physics, The George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052; Department of Anatomy and Regenerative Biology, The George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052.', 'Laboratory of Endocrinology and Receptor Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; kai.ge@nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20161003,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Self Renewal/genetics', 'Cellular Reprogramming', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding']",['NOTNLM'],"['*H3K4 methyltransferase', '*MLL4/KMT2D', '*cell fate transition', '*enhancer', '*p300']",2016/10/30 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2016/10/05 06:00'],"['2016/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['1606857113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1606857113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Oct 18;113(42):11871-11876. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1606857113.

The expression level of PRL-3 is elevated in response to several antiapoptotic cytokines, including IL6, in cancer cells from patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and can promote survival and migration. Here, it is demonstrated that PRL-3 activates Src kinase in the IL6-dependent MM cell line INA-6. Inhibition of PRL-3 by a small-molecule inhibitor of PRL-3 or by shRNA resulted in inactivation of Src. In addition to activation of Src, PRL-3 also activated the Src family kinase (SFK) members LYN and HCK in INA-6 cells. Forced expression of catalytically inactive mutant PRL-3 decreased the activation of these three SFK members while the total level of HCK and FYN remained elevated. Inhibitors of Src increased sensitivity of cells overexpressing PRL-3 to the PRL-3 inhibitor through joint downregulation of both PRL-3 and Mcl-1. In conclusion, PRL-3 protected MM cells against apoptosis by dysregulating both the total levels and the activation levels of specific SFK members that are important for IL6 signal transduction in MM cells. Eventually, this led to increased levels of Mcl-1. IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests PRL-3 and SFKs are key mediators of the IL6-driven signaling events and points to both PRL-3 and SFK members as potential targets for treatment of MM.

The health states progression-free, progression and death and the transitions between them are frequently of interest. With partitioned survival, progression is not modeled directly as a state; instead, time in that state is derived from the difference in area between the overall survival and the progression-free survival curves. With Markov decision-analytic modeling, a priori assumptions are often made with regard to the transitions rather than using the individual patient data directly to model them. This article compares a multi-state modeling survival regression approach to these two common methods. As a case study, we use a trial comparing rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide v. fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We calculated mean Life Years and QALYs that involved extrapolation of survival outcomes in the trial. We adapted an existing multi-state modeling approach to incorporate parametric distributions for transition hazards, to allow extrapolation. The comparison showed that, due to the different assumptions used in the different approaches, a discrepancy in results was evident.

However, these agents are not curative, and resistance is already emerging in a proportion of patients. IL4, expressed in CLL lymph nodes, can augment BCR signaling and reduce the effectiveness of BCR kinase inhibitors. Therefore, simultaneous targeting of the IL4- and BCR signaling pathways by cerdulatinib, a novel dual Syk/JAK inhibitor currently in clinical trials (NCT01994382), may improve treatment responses in patients.Experimental Design: PBMCs from patients with CLL were treated in vitro with cerdulatinib alone or in combination with venetoclax. Cell death, chemokine, and cell signaling assay were performed and analyzed by flow cytometry, immunoblotting, q-PCR, and ELISA as indicated.Results: At concentrations achievable in patients, cerdulatinib inhibited BCR- and IL4-induced downstream signaling in CLL cells using multiple readouts and prevented anti-IgM- and nurse-like cell (NLC)-mediated CCL3/CCL4 production. Cerdulatinib induced apoptosis of CLL cells, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and particularly in IGHV-unmutated samples with greater BCR signaling capacity and response to IL4, or samples expressing higher levels of sIgM, CD49d(+), or ZAP70(+) Cerdulatinib overcame anti-IgM, IL4/CD40L, or NLC-mediated protection by preventing upregulation of MCL-1 and BCL-XL; however, BCL-2 expression was unaffected. Furthermore, in samples treated with IL4/CD40L, cerdulatinib synergized with venetoclax in vitro to induce greater apoptosis than either drug alone.Conclusions: Cerdulatinib is a promising therapeutic for the treatment of CLL either alone or in combination with venetoclax, with the potential to target critical survival pathways in this currently incurable disease.

Since this survey, the JAK2 V617F mutation was discovered, leading to a new era of discovery in the disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and classification and treatment of PV. Our objective was to survey hematologists in the diagnosis and treatment of PV in the modern, post-JAK2 V617F discovery era. An anonymous 17-question survey was emailed to members of the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) Research Foundation database and Aplastic Anemia and MDS International Foundation. A total of 71 surveys were used in the analysis. Diagnostic testing varied according to the respondent's clinical experience and practice type. In addition, there were marked differences in target hematocrit and platelet count among those surveyed.

The HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), which is encoded by the minus strand of the provirus, is constitutively expressed in all ATL patient cells and likely contributes to the development and maintenance of ATL. Furthermore, the overexpression of the myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) protein is frequently observed in hematological cancers as well as several other types of cancers. Here, we found that the expression of HBZ in cells stabilized MCL1 protein expression and suppressed the MCL1-mediated release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. This effect was mediated by inhibition of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of MCL1. In a serial binding assay, HBZ interacted with cullin 1 (CUL1) through a head-to-tail interaction. The association between CUL1 and Skp1, which serves as the molecular scaffold for the components of SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes, was markedly repressed in the presence of HBZ. Mechanistic analysis indicated that HBZ abrogated the CUL1 association with Skp1, which in turn promoted the cellular expression of MCL1. This novel function of HBZ likely plays a role in the viral pathogenesis of HTLV-1 and provides important insights into our understanding of the development of ATL.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

The absence of posttransplant immunosuppression was an opportunity to discover natural killer cell alloreactions that eradicated acute myeloid leukemia and improved survival. Furthermore, it also unveiled the benefits of transplantation from mother donors, a likely consequence of the mother-to-child interaction during pregnancy. More recent transplantation protocols use unmanipulated (without ex vivo T-cell depletion) haploidentical grafts combined with enhanced posttransplant immunosuppression to help prevent GVHD. Unmanipulated grafts substantially extended the use of haploidentical transplantation with results than even rival those of matched hematopoietic transplantation.

The chemotherapeutic resistance of EpCAM-positive leukemic cells is a consequence of increased WNT5B signaling. Furthermore, we generated EpCAM antibodies that enabled phagocytosis or cytotoxicity of AML cells by macrophage or natural killer cells, respectively.

Although the transcriptional reactivation of NR4A3 is considered to have a broad-spectrum anti-leukemic effect, the therapeutic modalities targeting this gene have been hindered by our minimal understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms regulating its expression, particularly in human AML. Here we show the role of intragenic DNA hypermethylation in reducing the expression of NR4A3 in AML. Bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed that CpG sites at the intragenic region encompassing exon 3 of NR4A3, but not the promoter region, are hypermethylated in AML cell lines and primary AML cells. A DNA methyltransferase inhibitor restored the expression of NR4A3 following a reduction in DNA methylation levels at intragenic CpG sites. The in silico data revealed an enrichment of H3K4me1 and H2A.Z at exon 3 of NR4A3 in human non-malignant cells but that was excluded specifically in leukemia cells with CpG hypermethylation. This suggests that exon 3 represents a functional regulatory element involved in the transcriptional regulation of NR4A3.

We found that myeloma cell death induced by the ER stressor Thapsigargin was highly variable, ranging from 2 to 89%. Induction of ATF4 and CHOP was observed in myeloma cells under Thapsigargin independently of cell death. The decrease in Mcl-1 was associated with protein translation inhibition and identified as a crucial factor in Thapsigargin sensitivity, since it was the only Bcl-2 family protein differentially modified between sensitive and resistant myeloma cells. Bak but not Bax was found to contribute to Thapsigargin-induced apoptosis. Appropriately, a basal Mcl-1/Bak interaction was demonstrated in Thapsigargin-sensitive cells. Of note, the only pro-apoptotic protein freed from Mcl-1 under Thapsigargin was Bak, whereas Mcl-1/Noxa or Mcl-1/Bim complexes were simultaneously increased. Thus, the disruption of the basal Mcl-1/Bak complex in Thapsigargin-sensitive cells seemed to be an essential event in cell death induction, probably favored by the induced Noxa and Bim BH3-only proteins.

We retrospectively evaluated 54 adult patients who developed positivity to HHV-6 after alloSCT. The median time from alloSCT to HHV-6 reactivation was 34 days. HHV-6 was present in plasma samples from 31 patients, in bone marrow (BM) of 9 patients, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and liver or gut biopsy specimens from 33 patients, and in cerebrospinal fluid of 7 patients. Twenty-nine patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), mainly grade III-IV, and 15 had concomitant cytomegalovirus reactivation. The median absolute CD3(+) lymphocyte count was 207 cells/microL. We reported the following clinical manifestations: fever in 43 patients, skin rash in 22, hepatitis in 19, diarrhea in 24, encephalitis in 10, BM suppression in 18, and delayed engraftment in 11. Antiviral pharmacologic treatment was administered to 37 patients; nonetheless, the mortality rate was relatively high in this population (overall survival [OS] at 1 year, 38% +/- 7%). A better OS was significantly associated with a CD3(+) cell count >/=200/microL at the time of HHV-6 reactivation (P = .0002). OS was also positively affected by the absence of acute GVHD grade III-IV (P = .03) and by complete disease remission (P = .03), but was not significantly influenced by steroid administration, time after alloSCT, type of antiviral prophylaxis, plasma viral load, or organ involvement. Although HHV-6 detection typically occurred early after alloSCT, better T cell immune reconstitution seems to have the potential to improve clinical outcomes. Our findings provide new insight into the interplay between HHV-6 and the transplanted immune system.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The aims of this study were to a) examine the feasibility, acceptability and satisfaction of a parenting intervention amongst parents of children with ALL and b) explore whether participation in a parenting intervention shows promise for improvements in child behavior. METHODS: 12 parents with a child aged between 2 and 8 years receiving maintenance phase treatment for ALL participated in a phase 2 randomized controlled trial comparing eight weeks of group online participation in Triple P: Positive Parenting Program with no intervention. RESULTS: The number of eligible parents who completed the intervention was low (31.6%). Main reasons for non-consent or dropout were program time commitment too high or content not relevant. For parents who completed the intervention, satisfaction and acceptability was high. Parents reported the intervention as highly relevant and topical, feasible, helpful and a positive experience. Results indicated a non-significant trend towards improved total child behavioral and emotional difficulties following the intervention. Qualitative results indicated that intervention group parents reported improvements in parenting skills and competence, and decreased child behavioral problems. CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data highlight the difficulties of engaging and retaining parents in an 8-week parenting intervention in this context. For parents who completed the intervention, results indicated high feasibility, acceptability and satisfaction. Suggestions for further research and intervention modifications are provided to enhance uptake and strengthen efforts to assist parents in addressing child behavioral and emotional challenges during ALL treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Pathophysiology of MDS comprises the suppression of normal hematopoiesis and reduced myeloid progenitor cells differentiation, with the main consequence of peripheral cytopenias and increased risk to evolution in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHOD: This review summarizes the evolving understanding of the role of genetic and epigenetic alterations involved in pathogenesis and current and future strategies for therapeutic targeting in myelodysplastic syndromes. RESULTS: In addition to molecular characteristics, immune and microenvironmental factors in bone marrow of MDS patients may further modify the MDS manifestations, its clinical presentation, disease course, risk of transformation to AML and prognosis of MDS, as well as response to therapy. Current clinical response to therapy approaches are exerted both by epigenetic alterations and by induction of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Future treatment strategies in preclinical and clinical investigations are directed towards new dosing schedules of existing drugs, new genetic and epigenetic targets and combination of different agents, including hypomethylation agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Stankov, Karmen', 'Stankov, Suncica', 'Katanic, Jasmina']","['Stankov K', 'Stankov S', 'Katanic J']","['Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Faculty of Medicine, University of Novi Sad, Hajduk Veljkova 1, 21000 Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia.', 'Health Center Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia.', 'Institute of Child and Youth Health Care of Vojvodina, Faculty of Medicine, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,,"['Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*epigenetic targets', '*hypomethylating agents', '*leukemia', '*microRNA', '*mutations', '*pathogenesis', '*therapy']",2016/10/05 06:00,2018/01/02 06:00,['2016/10/05 06:00'],"['2016/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.2174/1381612822666161003160033 [doi]', 'CPD-EPUB-78729 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2017;23(1):135-169. doi: 10.2174/1381612822666161003160033.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to determine the optimal course(s) of reinduction therapy for standard-risk (SR, or ""low-risk"" in other groups) patients. Also, we evaluated outcomes using triple intrathecal therapy without cranial radiation (CrRT) for central nervous system (CNS) preventive therapy. PROCEDURE: From 2002 to 2012, all newly diagnosed children with ALL in Taiwan were enrolled in Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group ALL-2002 protocol. SR patients were randomized to receive single or double reinduction courses. The patients enrolled before 2009 received CrRT, while those enrolled later did not. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival rates and the difference between two groups was compared by the two-sided log-rank test. RESULTS: In 1,366 eligible patients, the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 81.6 +/- 1.1% (standard error) and 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 74.3 +/- 1.2%. In SR patients, the 5-year OS for one and two reinduction courses was 91.6 +/- 2.1% and 93.7 +/- 1.8%, respectively, and the 5-year EFS was 85.2 +/- 2.7% and 89.8 +/- 2.3%, respectively. There were no significant differences in survival between these two groups. Patients with MLL or BCR-ABL1 had the worst outcomes: 5-year EFS was 23.4 and 31.8% and 5-year OS was 28.6 and 44.7%, respectively. There was no significant difference in CNS relapse or survival between the era with or without CrRT. CONCLUSIONS: For SR patients, one-course reinduction was adequate. Triple intrathecal therapy alone successfully prevented CNS relapse.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Li, Meng-Ju', 'Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Yen, Hsiu-Ju', 'Jaing, Tang-Her', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn',

Early during infection, NP mediates import of vRNPs into the host cell nucleus where viral replication and transcription take place; also newly synthesized NP molecules are targeted into the nucleus, enabling coreplicational assembly of progeny vRNPs. NP reportedly acts as regulatory factor during infection, and it is known to be involved in numerous interactions with host cell proteins. Yet, the NP-host cell interplay is still poorly understood. Here, we report that NP significantly interacts with the nuclear compartment and displays distinct affinities for different subnuclear structures. NP subnuclear behavior was studied by expression of fluorescent NP fusion proteins - including obligate monomeric NP - and site-specific fluorescence photoactivation measurements. We found that NP constructs accumulate in subnuclear domains frequently found adjacent to or overlapping with promyelocytic leukemia bodies and Cajal bodies. Targeting of NP to Cajal bodies could further be demonstrated in the context of virus infection. We hypothesize that by targeting functional nuclear organization, NP might either link viral replication to specific cellular machinery or interfere with host cell processes.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Hofer, Chris T', 'Jolmes, Fabian', 'Haralampiev, Ivan', 'Veit, Michael', 'Herrmann, Andreas']","['Hofer CT', 'Jolmes F', 'Haralampiev I', 'Veit M', 'Herrmann A']","['IRI Life Sciences, Department of Biology, Molecular Biophysics, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Virology, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'IRI Life Sciences, Department of Biology, Molecular Biophysics, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'IRI Life Sciences, Department of Biology, Molecular Biophysics, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Virology, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'IRI Life Sciences, Department of Biology, Molecular Biophysics, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20161026,England,Cell Microbiol,Cellular microbiology,100883691,"['0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,,"['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/virology', 'Dogs', 'HeLa Cells', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/*metabolism', 'Influenza, Human/*virology', 'Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nucleoproteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",,,2016/10/27 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2016/10/04 06:00'],"['2015/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cmi.12679 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Microbiol. 2017 Apr;19(4). doi: 10.1111/cmi.12679.

Although disseminated nocardiosis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a rare complication, it is associated with high mortality. Moreover, after allo-HSCT, nocardiosis may be mistaken for other bacterial or fungal infections because clinical and radiographic findings of pulmonary, cerebral, and cutaneous nocardiosis lesions are non-specific. Here, we report a case of disseminated nocardiosis (caused by Nocardia abscessus) with skin, pulmonary, liver, lymph node, and multiple brain abscesses in a patient after allo-HSCT. The patient initially responded clinically and radiographically to imipenem/cilastin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy.

Our previous studies found that MSCs protected AML cells from apoptosis through the c-Myc-dependent pathway. However, the mechanism by which MSCs regulate c-Myc in AML cells is still unknown. To elucidate the mechanism, we performed microRNA array analysis of AML cell lines and validated by TaqMan realtime PCR. The results showed that the expression of microRNA-494 (miR-494) in AML cells after coculture with MSCs was downregulated. Reporter gene analysis confirmed miR-494 as one of the regulators of c-Myc. In the coculture system, activation of miR-494 in AML cells suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of AML cells in vitro. After addition of mitoxantrone to the coculture system, the proliferation of AML cells with miR-494 activation was suppressed more than that of control cells. After subcutaneous injection of AML cell lines in combination with MSC, tumor growth was suppressed in mice injected with miR-494-overexpressing AML cells. The rate of tumor formation was even lower after mitoxantrone treatment in the miR-494 overexpressing group. Moreover, miR-494 activation resulted in a decrease of leukemic cell counts in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow, and prolonged survival in mice injected with miR-494-overexpressing AML cellls and MSCs compared to the control mice. Our results indicate that miR-494 suppresses drug resistance in AML cells by downregulating c-Myc through interaction with MSCs and that miR-494 therefore is a potential therapeutic target. J. Cell.

METHODS: This study assessed the impact of baseline cytogenetics on the outcomes of 428 adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL who were receiving frontline chemotherapy. Three hundred thirty patients (77%) were treated with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone-based regimens, and 98 (23%) were treated with the augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster regimen. RESULTS: The median age was 40 years (range, 13-86 years). One hundred eighty-six patients (43%) had diploid cytogenetics, 32 (7%) had complex cytogenetics (defined as >/= 5 chromosomal abnormalities), 27 (6%) had low hypodiploidy/near-triploidy (Ho-Tr), 24 (6%) had high hyperdiploidy, and 24 (6%) had a mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangement. Patients with an MLL rearrangement, Ho-Tr, or a complex karyotype had significantly worse relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than the diploid group. According to a multivariate analysis including all the baseline characteristics and MRD status, Ho-Tr and a complex karyotype were independent predictive factors for worse RFS and OS. Furthermore, survival among all cytogenetic groups was similar, regardless of the treatment received. CONCLUSIONS: A complex karyotype and Ho-Tr are adverse prognostic factors for adults with ALL independently of the MRD status. These findings suggest that pretreatment cytogenetics remain a valuable prognostic tool in this population. Cancer 2017;123:459-467.

Although multiple myeloma (MM) remains as an incurable disease, around half of the patients achieve complete remission (CR), and recent data suggests increasing rates of curability with ""total-therapy-like"" programs. This landscape is likely to be improved with the advent of new antibodies and small molecules. Therefore, conventional serological and morphological techniques have become suboptimal for sensitive evaluation of highly effective treatment strategies. Although, existing data suggests that MRD could be used as a biomarker to evaluate treatment efficacy, help on therapeutic decisions, and act as surrogate for overall survival, the role of MRD in MM is still a matter of extensive debate. Here, we review the different levels of remission used to define depth of response in MM and their clinical significance, as well as the prognostic value and unique characteristics of MRD detection using immunophenotypic, molecular, and imaging techniques. Key facts The higher efficacy of new treatment strategies for MM demand the incorporation of highly sensitive techniques to monitor treatment efficacy MRD could be used as a more potent surrogate biomarker for survival than standard CR We need to understand the pros and cons of the different MRD techniques The time has come to incorporate highly sensitive, cost-effective, readily available, and standardized MRD techniques into clinical trials to assess its role in therapeutic decisions.",,"['Paiva, Bruno', 'Garcia-Sanz, Ramon', 'San Miguel, Jesus F']","['Paiva B', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'San Miguel JF']","['Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Clinica Universidad de Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Centro de Investigacion Del Cancer (IBMCC-USAL, CSIC), Instituto de Investigaion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada (CIMA), Clinica Universidad de Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona, Spain. sanmiguel@unav.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,,IM,,"['Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Flow', '*MRD', '*Myeloma', '*NGS', '*PET/CT', '*Surrogate']",2016/10/04 06:00,2017/06/02 06:00,['2016/10/04 06:00'],"['2016/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-319-40320-5_7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 2016;169:103-122. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-40320-5_7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was done in order to determine if kinase inhibitor-induced myocyte damage was a consequence of inhibiting ABL1 (on-target effects), or due to a lack of kinase selectivity (off-target effects) since previous studies have come up with conflicting conclusions about whether imatinib-induced cardiotoxicity results directly from inhibition of ABL1. The most specific and least potent inhibitors, imatinib and nilotinib, induced the least myocyte damage, while the least specific and most potent inhibitors, ponatinib and dasatinib, induced the most damage. Inhibitor-induced myocyte damage also correlated with clinically observed cardiovascular toxicity. Growth inhibition of the erythroleukemic K562 human cell line with a constitutively active BCR-ABL1 kinase was negatively correlated with inhibitor-induced myocyte damage, which suggests that inhibition of ABL1 causes myocyte damage. Myocyte damage was also negatively correlated with inhibitor dissociation binding constants and with inhibition of enzymatic ABL1 kinase activity. Myocyte damage was also positively correlated with two measures of inhibitor selectivity, which suggests that a lack of inhibitor selectivity is responsible for myocyte damage. In conclusion, myocyte damage, and thus the cardiovascular toxicity of the BCR-ABL1-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, is due to direct inhibition of ABL1 and/or their lack of inhibitor selectivity.",,"['Hasinoff, Brian B', 'Patel, Daywin', 'Wu, Xing']","['Hasinoff BB', 'Patel D', 'Wu X']","['College of Pharmacy, Apotex Centre, University of Manitoba, 750 McDermot Avenue, Winnipeg, MB, R3E 0T5, Canada.

Patients were randomized for intensive chemotherapy with or without open-label ATRA (45 mg/m(2), days 6-8; 15 mg/m(2), days 9-21). Two cycles of induction therapy were followed by risk-adapted consolidation with high-dose cytarabine or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Due to the open label character of the study, analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) and a per-protocol (PP) basis. One thousand one hundred patients were randomized (556, STANDARD; 544, ATRA) with 38 patients treated vice versa. Median follow-up for survival was 5.2 years. ITT analyses revealed no difference between ATRA and STANDARD for the total cohort and for the subset of NPM1-mutated AML with respect to event-free (EFS; p = 0.93, p = 0.17) and overall survival (OS; p = 0.24 and p = 0.32, respectively). Pre-specified PP analyses revealed better EFS in NPM1-mutated AML (p = 0.05) and better OS in the total cohort (p = 0.03). Explorative subgroup analyses on an ITT basis revealed better OS (p = 0.05) in ATRA for genetic low-risk patients according to ELN recommendations.

NK cell activity is tightly regulated by killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and KIR-ligand interactions. Inhibitory KIR-ligands have been identified as HLA molecules, while activating KIR-ligands are largely unknown. Individuals that have not inherited the corresponding KIR-ligand for at least one inhibitory KIR gene are termed the ""KIR-ligand missing"" genotype, and they are thought to have a subset of NK cells that express inhibitory KIRs for which the corresponding KIR-ligand is missing on autologous tissue, and thus will not be inhibited through KIR-ligand recognition. In some settings where an anticancer immunotherapeutic effect is likely mediated by NK cells, individuals with a KIR-ligand missing genotype have shown improved clinical outcome compared to individuals with an ""all KIR-ligands present"" genotype. In addition, patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplants for leukemia may do better if their donor has more activating KIR genes (i.e., KIR haplotype-B). In a recent multi-institution clinical trial of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving high-dose IL2 (HD-IL2), 25 % of patients showed a complete or partial tumor response to this therapy. We genotyped KIR and KIR-ligand genes for these patients (n = 107) and tested whether KIR/KIR-ligand genotypes correlated with patient clinical outcomes. In these analyses, we did not find any significant association of KIR/KIR-ligand genotype (either KIR-ligand missing or the presence of KIR haplotype-B) with patient outcome in response to the HD-IL2 therapy.",,"['Wang, Wei', 'Erbe, Amy K', 'Gallenberger, Mikayla', 'Kim, KyungMann', 'Carmichael, Lakeesha', 'Hess, Dustin', 'Mendonca, Eneida A', 'Song, Yiqiang', 'Hank, Jacquelyn A', 'Cheng, Su-Chun', 'Signoretti, Sabina', 'Atkins, Michael', 'Carlson, Alexander', 'Weiss, Jonathan M', 'Mier, James', 'Panka, David', 'McDermott, David F', 'Sondel, Paul M']","['Wang W', 'Erbe AK', 'Gallenberger M', 'Kim K', 'Carmichael L', 'Hess D', 'Mendonca EA', 'Song Y', 'Hank JA', 'Cheng SC', 'Signoretti S', 'Atkins M', 'Carlson A', 'Weiss JM', 'Mier J', 'Panka D', 'McDermott DF', 'Sondel PM']","['Department of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin, 4159 WIMR Bldg.

The development of antibody treatments (including antibody drug conjugates with toxins) offers a different treatment approach compared with conventional chemotherapy regimens. Moreover, the use of bispecific T-cell-engager antibodies (BiTEs) such as blinatumomab harness the cytotoxic activity of T cells against CD19-positive lymphoblasts. Another strategy involves the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. CAR T cells have demonstrated promising results in the relapsed/refractory setting. However, the use of BiTEs and CAR T cells is also associated with a distinct set of adverse reactions that must be taken into account by the treating physician. Apart from the above strategies, the use of other targeted therapies has attracted interest. Namely, the discovery of the Philadelphia (Ph)-like signature in children and young adults with ALL has led to the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in these patients.

T. Anders. is used as a medicinal plant in Thailand and has several traditional therapeutic properties. In a previous study, we isolated eight compounds from the flower of M. siamensis and demonstrated that kayeassamin A (KA) exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against human leukemia and stomach cancer cell lines. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the effect of KA on cell viability and apoptotic mechanisms in HL-60 human leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Nuclear morphology and DNA fragmentation were observed using Hoechst 33258 staining and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. The sub-G1 phase of cells was analyzed by flow cytometry after the cellular DNA had been stained with propidium iodide. The protein levels of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspases were determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: KA exhibited a significant cytotoxic effect in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and induced chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and sub-G1 phase DNA content, known as molecular events associated with the induction of apoptosis. In addition, KA strongly induced the activation of PARP and caspase-3 and -8, with weak caspase-9 activation. Furthermore, KA-induced DNA fragmentation was abolished by pretreatment with z-VAD-FMK (a broad caspase inhibitor), z-DEVD-FMK (a caspase-3 inhibitor), and z-IETD-FMK (a caspase-8 inhibitor), but not by z-LEHD-FMK (a caspase-9 inhibitor) pretreatment. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that KA triggers apoptotic cell death by activation of caspase-3 and -8 in HL-60 cells. SUMMARY: Kayeassamin A (KA) isolated from the flower of Mammea siamensis exhibited a significant cytotoxic effect in HL-60 human leukemia cells. KA triggers apoptotic cell death by activating caspase-3/-8.
