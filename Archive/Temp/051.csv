In a cohort of patients with aml who underwent ahsct in cr2, we determined the pre-transplant factors that predicted for overall survival (os), relapse, and non-relapse mortality. We also sought to validate the prognostic risk groups derived by Michelis and colleagues in this independent population. METHODS: In a retrospective chart review, we obtained data for 55 consecutive patients who underwent ahsct for aml in cr2. Hazard ratios were used to describe the independent effects of pre-transplant variables on outcome, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess outcomes in the three prognostic groups identified by Michelis and colleagues. RESULTS: At 1, 3, and 5 years post-transplant, os was 60%, 45.5%, and 37.5% respectively. Statistically significant differences in os, relapse mortality, and non-relapse mortality were not identified between the prognostic risk groups identified by Michelis and colleagues. Women were less likely than men to relapse, and a modified European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (mebmt) score of 3 or less was associated with a lower non-relapse mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The 37.5% 5-year os in this cohort suggests that, compared with other options, ahsct offers patients with aml in cr2 a better chance of cure. Our study supports the use of the mebmt score to predict non-relapse mortality in this population.","['Frazer, J', 'Couban, S', 'Doucette, S', 'Shivakumar, S']","['Frazer J', 'Couban S', 'Doucette S', 'Shivakumar S']","['Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, and.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Research Methods Unit, Department of Community Health and Epidemiology, QEII Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, NS.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170427,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,PMC5407875,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myelogenous leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation', 'hematology']","[""We have read and understood Current Oncology's policy on disclosing conflicts of"", 'interest, and we declare that we have none.']",2017/05/12 06:00,2017/05/12 06:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.24.3485 [doi]', 'conc-24-e123 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2017 Apr;24(2):e123-e130. doi: 10.3747/co.24.3485.

The comparative effectiveness of the all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus arsenic trioxide (As2O3) maintenance strategy with classic ATRA plus chemotherapy has not been evaluated. In this study, we compared the efficacy and toxicity of maintenance therapy with ATRA plus As2O3 and classic ATRA plus chemotherapy in low- to intermediate-risk APL patients reaching the first CR after induction and consolidation therapy. METHODS: A retrospective review of 58 adult patients diagnosed with APL was conducted. After receiving consolidation therapy and achieving CR, 30 patients were administered maintenance therapy with an ATRA plus As2O3 regimen (ATRA+As2O3 group), whereas 28 patients were administered 3-monthly cycles of an ATRA plus chemotherapy regimen (ATRA+chemotherapy group). RESULTS: Grade 3-4 neutropenia was significantly more frequent in the ATRA+chemotherapy group (N=9, 32.1%) than in the ATRA+As2O3 group (N=0) (P=0.001). At a median follow-up of 49.1 months (range: 9.7-97.4 months) from the completion of consolidation, no relapses were observed in the ATRA+As2O3 group, whereas seven relapses occurred in the ATRA+chemotherapy group. The risk of relapse in the patients administered ATRA+As2O3 maintenance was significantly lower than that in those administered ATRA+chemotherapy maintenance (P=0.004). Based on log-rank analysis, only maintenance therapy with ATRA and As2O3 was associated with a significantly higher relapse-free survival (P=0.0159). CONCLUSION: Maintenance therapy with ATRA and As2O3 was beneficial in low- to intermediate-risk APL patients who were effectively treated to achieve CR. Further clinical trials with reliable designs are needed to confirm these observations.","['Liang, Bin', 'Zheng, Zhouyi', 'Shi, Yifen', 'Chen, Jingjing', 'Hu, Xudong', 'Qian, Honglan', 'Shen, Zhijian', 'Jiang, Songfu', 'Yu, Kang', 'Feng, Jianhua']","['Liang B', 'Zheng Z', 'Shi Y', 'Chen J', 'Hu X', 'Qian H', 'Shen Z', 'Jiang S', 'Yu K', 'Feng J']","['Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital of Zhuji, Shaoxing.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou.', 'Division of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170426,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC5414635,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'arsenic trioxide', 'maintenance therapy', 'survival']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2017/05/12 06:00,2017/05/12 06:01,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S135013 [doi]', 'ott-10-2305 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Apr 26;10:2305-2313. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S135013. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the role of the adipokine leptin as master regulator of anti-myeloma tumor immunity by modulating the invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell function. A marked increase in serum leptin levels and leptin receptor (LR) expression on iNKT cells in MM patients and the 5T33 murine MM model was observed. MM cells and leptin synergistically counteracted anti-tumor functionality of both murine and human iNKT cells. In vivo blockade of LR signaling combined with iNKT stimulation resulted in superior anti-tumor protection. This was linked to persistent IFN-gamma secretion upon repeated iNKT cell stimulation and a restoration of the dynamic antigen-induced motility arrest as observed by intravital microscopy, thereby showing alleviation of iNKT cell anergy.

Although non-selective HDAC inhibitors show anti-MM activities, unfavorable side effects limit their clinical efficacy. Isoform- and/or class-selective HDAC inhibition offers the possibility to maintain clinical activity while avoiding adverse events attendant to broad non-selective HDAC inhibition. We have previously reported that HDAC3 inhibition, either by genetic knockdown or selective inhibitor BG45, abrogates MM cell proliferation. Here we show that knockdown of HDAC3, but not HDAC1 or HDAC2, as well as BG45, downregulate expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) mediating MM cell proliferation. DNMT1 expression is regulated by c-Myc, and HDAC3 inhibition triggers degradation of c-Myc protein. Moreover, HDAC3 inhibition results in hyperacetylation of DNMT1, thereby reducing the stability of DNMT1 protein. Combined inhibition of HDAC3 and DNMT1 with BG45 and DNMT1 inhibitor 5-azacytidine (AZA), respectively, triggers synergistic downregulation of DNMT1, growth inhibition and apoptosis in both MM cell lines and patient MM cells. Efficacy of this combination treatment is confirmed in a murine xenograft MM model. Our results therefore provide the rationale for combination treatment using HDAC3 inhibitor with DNMT1 inhibitor to improve patient outcome in MM.","['Harada, T', 'Ohguchi, H', 'Grondin, Y', 'Kikuchi, S', 'Sagawa, M', 'Tai, Y-T', 'Mazitschek, R', 'Hideshima, T', 'Anderson, K C']","['Harada T', 'Ohguchi H', 'Grondin Y', 'Kikuchi S', 'Sagawa M', 'Tai YT', 'Mazitschek R', 'Hideshima T', 'Anderson KC']","['Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Molecular and Integrative Physiological Sciences Program, Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.H.

Brd4 binds to acetylated histone tails and activates transcription by recruiting the positive elongation factor P-TEFb. Small molecule inhibitor JQ1 competitively binds the bromodomains of Brd4 and displaces the protein from acetylated histones. However, it remains unclear whether genes targeted by JQ1 are mainly regulated by Brd4 or by other bromodomain proteins such as Brd2 and Brd3. Here, we describe anti-proliferative dominant-negative Brd4 mutants that compete with the function of distinct Brd4 domains. We used these Brd4 mutants to compare the Brd4-specific transcriptome with the transcriptome of JQ1-treated cells. We found that most JQ1-regulated genes are also regulated by dominant-negative Brd4 mutants, including the mutant that competes with the P-TEFb recruitment function of Brd4. Importantly, JQ1 and dominant-negative Brd4 mutants regulated the same set of target genes of c-Myc, a key regulator of the JQ1 response in leukemia cells. Our results suggest that Brd4 mediates most of the anti-cancer effects of JQ1 and that the major function of Brd4 in this process is the recruitment of P-TEFb. In summary, our studies define the molecular targets of JQ1 in more detail.","['Decker, Tim-Michael', 'Kluge, Michael', 'Krebs, Stefan', 'Shah, Nilay', 'Blum, Helmut', 'Friedel, Caroline C', 'Eick, Dirk']","['Decker TM', 'Kluge M', 'Krebs S', 'Shah N', 'Blum H', 'Friedel CC', 'Eick D']","['Department of Molecular Epigenetics, Helmholtz Center Munich and Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Informatics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Amalienstr. 17, Munich, 80333, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Functional Genome Analysis (LAFUGA) at the Gene Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Epigenetics, Helmholtz Center Munich and Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Functional Genome Analysis (LAFUGA) at the Gene Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Informatics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, Amalienstr. 17, Munich, 80333, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Epigenetics, Helmholtz Center Munich and Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377, Munich, Germany. eick@helmholtz-muenchen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170510,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5431861,,,,2017/05/12 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-01943-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-01943-6 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 May 10;7(1):1684. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-01943-6.,,20181211,,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (Triazoles)']",IM,"['Azepines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Library', '*Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Protein Domains', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the majority of cases, genetic changes in RUNX1 are linked to loss of function classifying it broadly as a tumour suppressor. Despite this, several recent studies have reported the need for a certain level of active RUNX1 for the maintenance and propagation of acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells, suggesting an oncosupportive role of RUNX1. Furthermore, in solid cancers, RUNX1 is overexpressed compared with normal tissue, and RUNX factors have recently been discovered to promote growth of skin, oral, breast and ovarian tumour cells, amongst others. RUNX factors have key roles in stem cell fate regulation during homeostasis and regeneration of many tissues. Cancer cells appear to have corrupted these stem cell-associated functions of RUNX factors to promote oncogenesis. Here, we discuss current knowledge on the role of RUNX genes in stem cells and as oncosupportive factors in haematological malignancies and epithelial cancers.","['Deltcheva, Elitza', 'Nimmo, Rachael']","['Deltcheva E', 'Nimmo R']","['UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, U.K.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, U.K. r.nimmo@ucl.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170510,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CBFbeta', '*RUNX', '*cancer', '*leukaemia', '*stem cells']",,2017/05/12 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2016/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['BCJ20160632 [pii]', '10.1042/BCJ20160632 [doi]']",epublish,Biochem J. 2017 May 10;474(11):1755-1768. doi: 10.1042/BCJ20160632.,,20170623,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism/pathology']",,,"['(c) 2017 The Author(s); published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the', 'Biochemical Society.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Using targeted sequencing from single cells and colonies from patient samples, we demonstrate tremendous clonal diversity in the majority of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with activating FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations at the time of acquired resistance to the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib.

Currently, FLT3 inhibitors have shown durable clinical responses but a complete remission of AML with FLT3 inhibitors remains elusive due to mutation-driven resistance mechanisms. The development of FLT3 inhibitors that also target other downstream oncogenic kinases may combat the resistance mechanism. RESULTS: 4-substituted aminoisoquinoline benzamides potently inhibit Src-family kinases and FLT3, including secondary mutations, such as FLT3D835. Modifications of aminoisoquinoline benzamide to aminoquinoline or aminoquinazoline abrogated FLT3 and Src-family kinase binding. CONCLUSION: The lead aminoisoquinolines potently inhibited FLT3-driven AML cell lines, MV4-11 and MOLM-14. These aminoisoquinoline benzamides represent new kinase scaffolds with high potential to be translated into anticancer agents.","['Larocque, Elizabeth', 'Naganna, N', 'Ma, Xiaochu', 'Opoku-Temeng, Clement', 'Carter-Cooper, Brandon', 'Chopra, Gaurav', 'Lapidus, Rena G', 'Sintim, Herman O']","['Larocque E', 'Naganna N', 'Ma X', 'Opoku-Temeng C', 'Carter-Cooper B', 'Chopra G', 'Lapidus RG', 'Sintim HO']","['Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'On the Chemistry & Biochemistry Graduate Program, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA.', 'Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'On the Chemistry & Biochemistry Graduate Program, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA.', 'Translational Core Laboratory, University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, 655 W Baltimore Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Translational Core Laboratory, University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, 655 W Baltimore Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', 'Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170511,England,Future Med Chem,Future medicinal chemistry,101511162,PMC5941727,['NOTNLM'],"['*FLT3', '*MOLM-14', '*MV4-11', '*SRC-family kinase', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*multikinase inhibitor', '*receptor tyrosine kinase']",,2017/05/12 06:00,2018/03/07 06:00,['2017/05/12 06:00'],"['2017/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4155/fmc-2017-0067 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Med Chem. 2017 Jul;9(11):1213-1225. doi: 10.4155/fmc-2017-0067.

Therapeutic drug monitoring is important to achieve treatment efficacy in the case of imatinib and nilotinib, and to control toxicity in the case of dasatinib. New high-sensitivity methods to monitor those drugs are needed, especially for dasatinib. Thus, a simple method to determine plasma levels of imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib for application in clinical practice was developed. METHODS: TKIs were eluted with a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (2.1 x 75 mm, 2.7 mum) at 0.5 mL/min and 60 degrees C, under gradient conditions through a mobile phase consisting of 4 mmol/L ammonium formate, pH 3.2 (65%), and acetonitrile (35%). TKIs were detected and quantified by liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) with positive electrospray ionization and analytes were extracted using solid phase extraction (Versaplate-SCX). Internal standards were isotope-labeled for each analyte. RESULTS: The method was linear in the range of 2.5-5000 ng/mL for imatinib, 0.75-400 ng/mL for dasatinib, and 2-4000 ng/mL for nilotinib. The validation assays for accuracy and precision, matrix effect, extraction recovery, carryover, and stability of the samples for all the TKIs were appropriate according to regulatory agencies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was used for the clinical data of the patient. The modified Hodge test (MHT) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-disk synergy test were used for detecting metallo-beta-lactamase. Antibiotic resistance was determined using the agar dilution method. PCR was used to identify resistance genes. S1-PFGE (S1 nuclease/pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) and Southern blot hybridization were performed to determine the location of blaNDM-1. A conjugation experiment was used to confirm the transferable characteristics of the resistant genes. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was also performed. RESULTS: The patient developed bloodstream infections caused by this NDM-1-producing strain and died due to worsening of the condition. The strain was highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and coharbored blaNDM-1, qnrB, and blaCTX-M-9 genes. Southern blot confirmed that blaNDM-1 was located on a plasmid of approximately 55 kb and could be transferred to Escherichia coli J53. MLST analysis showed that this strain belonged to an uncommon sequence type ST1224. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of various resistant genes is the mechanism for resistance to most antibiotics. Additionally, infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria increase the mortality of patients with immunodeficiency, which alerts clinicians to establish a rational and effective combination drug therapy.","['Zhang, Xiaoxiao', 'Du, Jia', 'Zhou, Cui', 'Cao, Jianming', 'Lu, Hong', 'Liu, Haiyang', 'Bi, Wenzi', 'Zhou, Tieli']","['Zhang X', 'Du J', 'Zhou C', 'Cao J', 'Lu H', 'Liu H', 'Bi W', 'Zhou T']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170511,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bloodstream', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Leukemia', 'NDM-1', 'ST1224']",,2017/05/11 06:00,2017/09/09 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['000469699 [pii]', '10.1159/000469699 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2017;62(4):262-268. doi: 10.1159/000469699.

CMV retinitis is not an uncommon infectious disease in patients with immune regulatory abnormalities, for example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. However, CMV retinitis in a patient with acute lymphosarcoma leukemia (ALL) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) phase is very rare. PATIENT CONCERNS: A case of CMV retinitis in a patient receiving immunosuppressive therapy as a part of ALL allogeneic HSCT is described including the pathogenesis, clinical signs, and therapy. DIAGNOSES: CMV retinitis. INTERVENTIONS: Ganciclovir intravitreal injection at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. OUTCOMES: Patient's vision had improved and the load of CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the aqueous humor declined. The CMV retinitis and perivascular of retina infiltration regressed. LESSONS: We propose that the concentration of CMV DNA load in the aqueous humor could be useful in making the diagnosis and in selecting the optimal treatment in this kind of CMV retinitis.","['Zhao, Ning', 'Liu, Lei', 'Xu, Junjie']","['Zhao N', 'Liu L', 'Xu J']","['Department of Ophthalmology Department of Laboratory Medicine, Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology of National Health and Family Planning Commission, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,PMC5428622,,,,2017/05/11 06:00,2017/06/13 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000006878 [doi]', '00005792-201705120-00055 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2017 May;96(19):e6878. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000006878.,,20170612,,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/administration & dosage', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis/*complications/drug therapy/pathology/virology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Ganciclovir/administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Intravitreal Injections', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, DNA polymerases can effectively replicate the formed DNA lesions to cause drug resistance and create more aggressive cancers. To understand this process at the cellular level, we developed an artificial nucleoside that visualizes the replication of damaged DNA to identify cells that acquire drug resistance through this mechanism. Visualization is achieved using ""click"" chemistry to covalently attach azide-containing fluorophores to the ethynyl group present on the nucleoside analog after its incorporation opposite damaged DNA. Flow cytometry and microscopy techniques demonstrate that the extent of nucleotide incorporation into genomic DNA is enhanced by treatment with DNA damaging agents. In addition, this nucleoside analog inhibits translesion DNA synthesis and synergizes the therapeutic activity of certain anti-cancer agents such as temozolomide. The combined diagnostic and therapeutic activities of this synthetic nucleoside analog represent a new paradigm in personalized medicine.","['Choi, Jung-Suk', 'Kim, Seol', 'Motea, Edward', 'Berdis, Anthony']","['Choi JS', 'Kim S', 'Motea E', 'Berdis A']","['Department of Chemistry, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115, USA.', 'Department of Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115, USA.', 'Departments of Radiation Oncology and Pharmacology, Harold C.

Recently, clinical trials based on BH3-mimetic drugs showed positive outcomes in subjects with poor prognostic features. However, resistance to treatments occurs in a significant number of patients. We previously reported that the multi-kinase inhibitor quercetin, a natural flavonol, restores sensitivity to ABT-737, a BH3-mimetic compound, in both leukemic cell lines and B-cells isolated from patients. To identify the molecular target of quercetin, we employed a new cell line, HG3, obtained by immortalization of B-cells from a chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patient at the later stage of disease. We confirmed that quercetin in association with ABT-737 synergistically enhances apoptosis in HG3 (combination index < 1 for all fractions affected). We also reported that the cellular uptake of quercetin is extremely rapid, with an intracellular concentration of about 38.5 ng/106 cells, after treatment with 25 muM for 5 min. We demonstrated that the activity of protein kinase CK2, which positively triggers PI3K/Akt pathway by inactivating PTEN phosphatase, is inhibited by quercetin immediately after its addition to HG3 cells (0-2 min). PI3K activity was also inhibited by quercetin within 60 min from the treatment. The combined inhibition of CK2 and PI3K kinase activities by quercetin restored ABT-737 sensitivity and increased lethality in human leukemia cells.","['Russo, Maria', 'Milito, Alfonsina', 'Spagnuolo, Carmela', 'Carbone, Virginia', 'Rosen, Anders', 'Minasi, Paola', 'Lauria, Fabio', 'Russo, Gian Luigi']","['Russo M', 'Milito A', 'Spagnuolo C', 'Carbone V', 'Rosen A', 'Minasi P', 'Lauria F', 'Russo GL']","['Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, Avellino, Italy.', 'Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, Avellino, Italy.', 'Current address: Stazione Zoologica ""Anton Dohrn"", Villa Comunale, Napoli, Italy.', 'Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, Avellino, Italy.', 'Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, Avellino, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Cell Biology, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, Avellino, Italy.', 'Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, Avellino, Italy.', 'Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, Avellino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5522089,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'PI3K', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'protein kinase CK2', 'quercetin']",,2017/05/11 06:00,2018/04/28 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['17246 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17246 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 27;8(26):42571-42587. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17246.,,20180427,,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Casein Kinase II/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quercetin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eligible studies were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library. Nine published studies were included in the meta-analysis, enrolling 718 elderly AML patients. The efficacy outcomes were complete remission (CR), overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Safety was evaluated based on treatment related grades 3-4 adverse events (AEs) and early death (ED) rate. Pooled estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI) for CR, ORR and OS were 27% (95% CI 19%-36%), 37% (95% CI 28%-47%) and 8.09 months (95% CI 5.77-10.41), respectively. The estimated treatment related early death (ED) incidences were within 30-days 7% (95% CI 2%-11%) and 60-days 17% (95% CI 11%-22%), respectively. Thrombocytopenia was the most common grades 3-4 AEs.

In Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 30203, we found that the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib in addition to chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with moderate to high COX-2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). CALGB 30801 (Alliance) was designed to prospectively confirm that finding. Patients and Methods Patients with NSCLC (stage IIIB with pleural effusion or stage IV according to American Joint Committee on Cancer [sixth edition] criteria) were preregistered, and biopsy specimens were analyzed for COX-2 by IHC. Patients with COX-2 expression >/= 2, performance status of 0 to 2, and normal organ function were eligible. Chemotherapy was determined by histology: carboplatin plus pemetrexed for nonsquamous NSCLC and carboplatin plus gemcitabine for squamous histology. Patients were randomly assigned to celecoxib (400 mg twice per day; arm A) or placebo (arm B). The primary objective was to demonstrate improvement in progression-free survival in patients with COX-2 index >/= 4 with hazard ratio of 0.645 with approximately 85% power at two-sided significance level of .05. Results The study was halted for futility after 312 of the planned 322 patients with COX-2 index >/= 2 were randomly assigned. There were no significant differences between the groups (hazard ratio, 1.046 for COX-2 >/= 4). Subset analyses evaluating histology, chemotherapy regimen, and incremental COX-2 expression did not demonstrate any advantage for COX-2 inhibition. Elevation of baseline urinary metabolite of prostaglandin E2, indicating activation of the COX-2 pathway, was a negative prognostic factor. Values above the third quartile may have been a predictive factor. Conclusion COX-2 expression by IHC failed to select patients who could benefit from selective COX-2 inhibition. Urinary metabolite of prostaglandin E2 may be able to identify patients who could benefit from COX-2 inhibition.","['Edelman, Martin J', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Hodgson, Lydia', 'Cheney, Richard T', 'Baggstrom, Maria Q', 'Thomas, Sachdev P', 'Gajra, Ajeet', 'Bertino, Erin', 'Reckamp, Karen L', 'Molina, Julian', 'Schiller, Joan H', 'Mitchell-Richards, Kisha', 'Friedman, Paula N', 'Ritter, Jon', 'Milne, Ginger', 'Hahn, Olwen M', 'Stinchcombe, Thomas E', 'Vokes, Everett E']","['Edelman MJ', 'Wang X', 'Hodgson L', 'Cheney RT', 'Baggstrom MQ', 'Thomas SP', 'Gajra A', 'Bertino E', 'Reckamp KL', 'Molina J', 'Schiller JH', 'Mitchell-Richards K', 'Friedman PN', 'Ritter J', 'Milne G', 'Hahn OM', 'Stinchcombe TE', 'Vokes EE']","['Martin J.

The proposed approach makes use of bidirectional penalties to constrain the number of clusters and centroids of clusters to simultaneously determine the unknown number of clusters and handle large amounts of noise in gene expression data. Numeric studies indicate that this algorithm not only performs better in clustering but is also comparable to other approaches in its ability to obtain the correct number of clusters and correct signal features. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to analyze two benchmark gene expression datasets. These analyses again indicate that the proposed algorithm performs well in clustering high-dimensional gene expression data with an unknown number of clusters.","['Yang, Hu', 'Liu, Xiaoqin']","['Yang H', 'Liu X']","['1 School of Information, Central University of Finance and Economics , Beijing, China .', '2 The National Center for Register-Based Research, Aarhus University , Aarhus, Demark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170510,United States,J Comput Biol,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,9433358,,['NOTNLM'],"['bidirectional penalty', 'clustering', 'gene expression data', 'high-dimensional data', 'penalization']",,2017/05/11 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cmb.2017.0051 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Biol. 2017 Jul;24(7):689-698. doi: 10.1089/cmb.2017.0051.

Although curcumin is pharmacologically safe and efficacious to certain cancers, its role against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still remains unclear, and it lacks clinical application due to low water solubility and low in vivo bioavailability. To address these issues, we developed a novel curcumin liposome modified with hyaluronan (HA-Cur-LPs) to specifically deliver curcumin to AML by targeting CD44 on AML cell surface. When compared with free curcumin and nontargeted liposome (Cur-LPs), the HA-Cur-LPs exhibited good stability, high affinity to CD44, increased cellular uptake, and more potent activity on inhibiting AML cell proliferation. The KG-1 cell implanted AML mice had significantly delayed, or even prevented, AML progression following treatment with 50 mg/kg of curcumin dose in the HA-Cur-LPs every 2 days for 2 weeks. Mechanistically, the anti-AML effects of HA-Cur-LPs were achieved by inhibiting Akt/ERK pathways and activating caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, HA-Cur-LPs played a critical role in downregulation of DNMT1 expression in AML, leading to DNA hypomethylation and reactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as miR-223. The development and assessment of the HA-Cur-LPs in this study provide another potential choice for AML therapy, using HA-Cur-LPs as either a single treatment agent or in combination with other treatments.","['Sun, Dan', 'Zhou, Jian-Kang', 'Zhao, Linshu', 'Zheng, Zhe-Yu', 'Li, Jiao', 'Pu, Wenchen', 'Liu, Shaoyang', 'Liu, Xue-Sha', 'Liu, Shu-Jun', 'Zheng, Yu', 'Zhao, Yun', 'Peng, Yong']","['Sun D', 'Zhou JK', 'Zhao L', 'Zheng ZY', 'Li J', 'Pu W', 'Liu S', 'Liu XS', 'Liu SJ', 'Zheng Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Peng Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy , Chengdu 610064, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy , Chengdu 610064, China.', 'Division of Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences, University College London , London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy , Chengdu 610064, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy , Chengdu 610064, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy , Chengdu 610064, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy , Chengdu 610064, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy , Chengdu 610064, China.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota , Austin, Minnesota 55912, United States.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy , Chengdu 610064, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy , Chengdu 610064, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy , Chengdu 610064, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170510,United States,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,ACS applied materials & interfaces,101504991,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD44', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'curcumin', 'hyaluronan', 'liposome']",,2017/05/11 06:00,2019/01/10 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acsami.7b02863 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces. 2017 May 24;9(20):16857-16868. doi: 10.1021/acsami.7b02863.

The aim of this study was to evaluate data about occupational exposure levels to 1,3-butadiene in the Italian working force. Methods Airborne concentrations of 1,3-butadiene were extracted from the Italian database on occupational exposure to carcinogens in the period 1996-2015. Descriptive statistics were calculated for exposure-related variables. An analysis through linear mixed model was performed to determine factors influencing the exposure level. The probability of exceeding the exposure limit was predicted using a mixed-effects logistic model. Concurrent exposures with other occupational carcinogens were investigated using the two-step cluster analysis. Results The total number of exposure measurements selected was 23 885, with an overall arithmetic mean of 0.12 mg/m3. The economic sector with the highest number of measurements was manufacturing of chemicals (18 744). The most predictive variables of the exposure level resulted to be the occupational group and its interaction with the measurement year. The highest likelihood of exceeding the exposure limit was found in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products. Concurrent exposures were frequently detected, mainly with benzene, acrylonitrile and ethylene dichloride, and three main clusters were identified.

This condition carries a potential for transformation to acute leukemia, primarily in cases that are accompanied by high-risk features at diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old man with recently diagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome and Sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) presented to our Emergency Department with shortness of breath. During his hospital course, he developed signs and symptoms, predominantly consisting of respiratory difficulties, that were not typically characteristic of transformation to acute leukemia. Several days into his hospitalization, it was determined that the patient's underlying hematologic process seemed to have rapidly evolved into an acute myeloid leukemia, which accounted for the progression of symptoms. This patient ultimately opted for comfort measures only and died shortly thereafter. DISCUSSION: Two important factors stood out as representing an atypical presentation. First, this patient lacked any of the high-risk features of myelodysplastic syndrome that typically portend transformation. In addition, his progression to acute leukemia in 28 days from the time of diagnosis was far more rapid than the 274-day median previously described in the literature. We theorize that the presence of Sweet syndrome may have served as a predisposing factor to transformation. This finding may offer benefit to physicians to potentially better predict this outcome and pursue more aggressive treatment measures earlier in the course of the disease in such a setting.","['Pourmoussa, Andrew', 'Kwan, Karen']","['Pourmoussa A', 'Kwan K']","['Internist at the Los Angeles Medical Center in CA. andrew.pourmoussa@kp.org.', 'Physician in the Department of Hematology and Oncology at the Los Angeles Medical Center in CA. karen.w.kwan@kp.org.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Perm J,The Permanente journal,9800474,PMC5424583,,,,2017/05/11 06:00,2018/03/22 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['16-091 [pii]', '10.7812/TPP/16-091 [doi]']",ppublish,Perm J. 2017;21:16-091. doi: 10.7812/TPP/16-091.,,20180321,,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', '*Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Palliative Care', 'Time']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we found that a cycloisomerization reaction from functionalized linear substrates to a 1-azaspiro[4.5]decane framework corresponding to the AC ring in lepadiformines is promoted by a catalytic amount of mercury(II) triflate (Hg(OTf)2 ).

Reduced expression of microRNA-192 (miR-192) has been detected in many cancers. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-192 in cell proliferation and cell cycle control in NALM-6 cell line, a model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cell cycle analysis by DNA content using propidium iodide staining and cell apoptosis analysis using Annexin V assay were carried out. Cell proliferation changes were monitored using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. In addition, the relative changes in P53, BAX, CASP3, and BCL-2 gene expression were determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Overexpression of miR-192 resulted in cell proliferation arrest in ALL cells. After 72 and 96 hours of transduction, apoptosis was significantly increased in the cells transduced with miR-192-overexpressing virus compared with control cells. The expression of P53, BAX, and CASP3 increased after 48 hours of transduction in miR-192-overexpressing cells, but no change was observed in BCL-2 expression. The G0/S and G1/S ratio changed to 7.5 and 4.5, respectively, in the cells overexpressing miR-192 compared with controls. The results of our study suggest, for the first time, tumor suppressive effects of miR-192 in ALL cells.","['Sayadi, Mahtab', 'Ajdary, Soheila', 'Nadali, Fatemeh', 'Rostami, Shahrbano', 'Edalati Fahtabad, Mahdi']","['Sayadi M', 'Ajdary S', 'Nadali F', 'Rostami S', 'Edalati Fahtabad M']","['Department of Hematology, Allied Medical School, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. sayadi.mahtab@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170820,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Bosn J Basic Med Sci,Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,101200947,PMC5581974,,,,2017/05/11 06:00,2018/07/13 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17305/bjbms.2017.1921 [doi]'],epublish,Bosn J Basic Med Sci. 2017 Aug 20;17(3):248-254. doi: 10.17305/bjbms.2017.1921.,,20180712,,"['0 (MIRN192 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Transfection']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high affinity of monobody AS25 was designed to target the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Bcr-Abl, leading to allosteric inhibition of Bcr-Abl through formation of protein-protein interactions. An I164E mutation in the SH2 domain disrupts AS25 binding to the SH2 domain of Bcr-Abl. The detailed mechanisms, however, remain to be unresolved. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations were performed to explore the conformational and energetic differences between the wild-type (WT) complexes of Bcr-Abl SH2 domain and AS25 (SH2(WT)-AS25) as well as the mutated complexes (SH2(I164E)-AS25). The results revealed that I164E mutation not only caused an increase in the conformational flexibility of SH2-AS25 complexes, but also weakened the binding affinity of AS25 to SH2. The comparative binding modes of SH2-AS25 complexes between WT and the I164E mutant were comprehensively analyzed to unravel the disruption of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions in the interface of the SH2-AS25 complex triggered by the I164E mutation. The results obtained may help to design the next generation of higher affinity Bcr-Abl SH2-specific peptide inhibitors.","['Ji, Mingfei', 'Zheng, Guodong', 'Li, Xiaolong', 'Zhang, Zhongqin', 'Jv, Guanqun', 'Wang, Xiaowei', 'Wang, Jialin']","['Ji M', 'Zheng G', 'Li X', 'Zhang Z', 'Jv G', 'Wang X', 'Wang J']","['Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200003, China.', 'Department of VIP Clinic, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200003, China.', 'Department of Urology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200003, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, 266003, China. xiaowei8507@163.com.', 'Department of VIP Clinic, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China. jialinwang_1976@yeah.net.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170509,Germany,J Mol Model,Journal of molecular modeling,9806569,,['NOTNLM'],"['Binding free energy calculations', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'MD simulations', 'Peptide inhibitors', 'Protein-protein interactions']",,2017/05/11 06:00,2018/09/01 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00894-017-3353-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00894-017-3353-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Model. 2017 Jun;23(6):183. doi: 10.1007/s00894-017-3353-5.

Little is known, however, about the mechanism behind the elevated LDL uptake. We investigated if AML cells secrete factors that stimulate cellular LDL uptake. Mononuclear blood cells were isolated from peripheral blood from 42 patients with AML at diagnosis. Cellular LDL uptake was determined from the degradation rate of (125)I-labelled LDL. Conditioned media from AML cells stimulated the LDL degradation in the leukemic cell lines KG1 and HL60, and in isolated AML cells. The stimulatory effect correlated with the LDL degradation in the AML cells directly after isolation from blood. Conditioned media also autostimulated LDL degradation in the AML cells themselves. Concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in AML cell conditioned media correlated with the LDL degradation in AML cells directly after isolation from blood. Addition of R-TNF-alpha, but not IL-6 or IL-8, stimulated LDL degradation in HL60, KG1, and AML cells. The LDL degradation in AML cells could be inhibited by a LDL receptor blocking antibody. AML cells secrete factors that stimulate LDL uptake in a paracrine and autocrine pattern which open up therapeutic possibilities to inhibit the uptake of LDL by administration of antibodies to these factors.","['Bhuiyan, Hasanuzzaman', 'Masquelier, Michele', 'Tatidis, Loukas', 'Gruber, Astrid', 'Paul, Christer', 'Vitols, Sigurd']","['Bhuiyan H', 'Masquelier M', 'Tatidis L', 'Gruber A', 'Paul C', 'Vitols S']","['Department of Medicine, Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, 17176, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, 17176, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, 17176, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Haematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, 171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Haematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, 141 86, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, 17176, Stockholm, Sweden. sigurd.vitols@ki.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170509,United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,PMC5486594,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myelogenous leukemia', '*Cholesterol', '*Cytokines', '*Low density lipoprotein receptor']",,2017/05/11 06:00,2018/03/07 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11745-017-4256-z [doi]', '10.1007/s11745-017-4256-z [pii]']",ppublish,Lipids. 2017 Jun;52(6):523-534. doi: 10.1007/s11745-017-4256-z.

The present study examined the cytotoxicities of bortezomib in combination with daunorubicin against human Jurkat and Molt4 TALL cells and primary TALL cells. Compared with treatment alone, coexposure of cells to bortezomib and daunorubicin resulted in a significant increase in cell death in the Jurkat cells, as evidenced by the increased percentage of Annexin Vpositive cells, the formation of apoptotic bodies. In addition, the administration sequence of bortezomib and daunorubicin had an effect on cell viability. Treatment with bortezomib followed by daunorubicin treatment was more effective, compared with treatment with daunorubicin followed by bortezomib. Co-treatment with bortezomib and daunorubicin markedly enhanced the activation of caspase3, 8 and 9, which was reversed by the pancaspase inhibitor, ZVADFMK. In addition, cotreatment with bortezomib and daunorubicin enhanced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and upregulated the proapoptotic protein, Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)interacting mediator of cell death (Bim), but not Bcl2 or Bclextra large. Consistent with this, it was demonstrated that cotreatment of bortezomib and daunorubicin efficiently induced apoptosis in primary TALL cells, and cell death was associated with the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the upregulation of Bim. Taken together, these findings indicated that the combination of bortezomib and daunorubicin significantly enhanced their apoptosisinducing effect in TALL cells, which may warrant further investigation in preclinical and clinical investigations.","['Du, Xin', 'Tong, Jia', 'Lu, Hongying', 'He, Cong', 'Du, Shenghong', 'Jia, Peimin', 'Zhao, Weili', 'Xu, Hanzhang', 'Li, Junmin', 'Shen, Zhixiang', 'Wu, Yingli', 'Tong, Jianhua', 'Zhou, Li']","['Du X', 'Tong J', 'Lu H', 'He C', 'Du S', 'Jia P', 'Zhao W', 'Xu H', 'Li J', 'Shen Z', 'Wu Y', 'Tong J', 'Zhou L']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, P.R.

In addition, rituximab has recently been increasingly used as an off-label treatment in a number of inflammatory and systemic autoimmune diseases. It is advised that rituximab infusion may cause infusion reactions and adverse cardiac effects including arrhythmia and angina, especially in patients with prior history of cardiovascular diseases. However, its detailed cardiotoxicity profile and effects on cardiac function were not well described. We report a 51-year-old man who developed non-ischemic cardiomyopathy after rituximab treatment for membranous nephropathy. The patient experienced reduced cardiac functions within 48 hours after the initial infusion, which remained markedly reduced at 9-month follow-up. As the utility of rituximab expands, physicians must be aware of this serious cardiovascular adverse effect.","['Cheungpasitporn, Wisit', 'Kopecky, Stephen L', 'Specks, Ulrich', 'Bharucha, Kharmen', 'Fervenza, Fernando C']","['Cheungpasitporn W', 'Kopecky SL', 'Specks U', 'Bharucha K', 'Fervenza FC']","['Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20161102,Iran,J Renal Inj Prev,Journal of renal injury prevention,101642540,PMC5414514,['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse effect', 'Cardiomyopathy', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Membranous nephropathy', 'Rituximab']",,2017/05/11 06:00,2017/05/11 06:01,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.15171/jrip.2017.04 [doi]'],epublish,J Renal Inj Prev. 2016 Nov 2;6(1):18-25. doi: 10.15171/jrip.2017.04. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the aim of finding agents that circumvent the MDR phenotype mediated by P-gp, 15 compounds isolated from native and naturalized plants of Argentina were screened. Among these, the non-cytotoxic lignan (+/-) pinoresinol successfully restored sensitivity to doxorubicin from 7 muM in the P-gp overexpressed human myelogenous leukemia cells, Lucena 1. This resistance-reversing effect was confirmed by competitively increasing the intracellular doxorubicin accumulation and by significantly inhibiting the efflux of doxorubicin and, to a lesser extent, that of rhodamine 123. The activity obtained was similar to that observed with verapamil. No such results were observed in the sensitive parental K562 cell line. To gain deeper insight into the mode of action of pinoresinol, its effect on P-gp function and expression was examined. The docking simulations indicated that the lignan bound to P-gp at the apex of the V-shaped transmembrane cavity, involving transmembrane helices 4, 5, and 6, and partially overlapped the binding region of tariquidar, which was used as a positive control. These results would shed some light on the nature of its interaction with P-gp at molecular level and merit further mechanistic and kinetic studies. In addition, it showed a maximum 29% activation of ATP hydrolysis and antagonized verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity with an IC50 of 20.9 muM. On the other hand, pinoresinol decreased the presence of P-gp in the cell surface. Derivatives of pinoresinol with improved activity were identified by docking studies. The most promising one, the non-cytotoxic 1-acetoxypinoresinol, caused a reversion of doxorubicin resistance from 0.11 muM and thus higher activity than the lead compound. It also caused a significant increase in doxorubicin accumulation. Results were similar to those observed with verapamil. The results obtained positioned these compounds as potential candidates for effective agents to overcome P-gp-mediated MDR, leading to better outcomes for leukemia chemotherapy.","['Gonzalez, Maria L', 'Vera, D Mariano A', 'Laiolo, Jeronimo', 'Joray, Mariana B', 'Maccioni, Mariana', 'Palacios, Sara M', 'Molina, Gabriela', 'Lanza, Priscila A', 'Gancedo, Samanta', 'Rumjanek, Vivian', 'Carpinella, Maria C']","['Gonzalez ML', 'Vera DMA', 'Laiolo J', 'Joray MB', 'Maccioni M', 'Palacios SM', 'Molina G', 'Lanza PA', 'Gancedo S', 'Rumjanek V', 'Carpinella MC']","['Fine Chemical and Natural Products Laboratory, School of Chemistry, Catholic University of CordobaCordoba, Argentina.', 'Department of Chemistry, QUIAMM-INBIOTEC-CONICET, College of Exact and Natural Sciences, National University of Mar del PlataMar del Plata, Argentina.', 'Fine Chemical and Natural Products Laboratory, School of Chemistry, Catholic University of CordobaCordoba, Argentina.', 'Fine Chemical and Natural Products Laboratory, School of Chemistry, Catholic University of CordobaCordoba, Argentina.', 'Immunology, Department of Biochemical Chemistry, CIBICI-CONICET, School of Chemical Sciences, National University of CordobaCordoba, Argentina.', 'Fine Chemical and Natural Products Laboratory, School of Chemistry, Catholic University of CordobaCordoba, Argentina.', 'Fine Chemical and Natural Products Laboratory, School of Chemistry, Catholic University of CordobaCordoba, Argentina.', 'Department of Chemistry, QUIAMM-INBIOTEC-CONICET, College of Exact and Natural Sciences, National University of Mar del PlataMar del Plata, Argentina.', 'Immunology, Department of Biochemical Chemistry, CIBICI-CONICET, School of Chemical Sciences, National University of CordobaCordoba, Argentina.', 'Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Federal University of Rio de JaneiroRio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Fine Chemical and Natural Products Laboratory, School of Chemistry, Catholic University of CordobaCordoba, Argentina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170425,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC5403950,['NOTNLM'],"['(+/-) pinoresinol', '1-acetoxy-(+)-pinoresinol', 'P-glycoprotein', 'multidrug resistance reversal', 'plant-derived compounds']",,2017/05/11 06:00,2017/05/11 06:01,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2017.00205 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2017 Apr 25;8:205. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2017.00205. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that KDM6B is expressed in multiple myeloma (MM) cells; and that shRNA-mediated knockdown and CRISPR-mediated knockout of KDM6B abrogate MM cell growth and survival. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha or bone marrow stromal cell culture supernatants induce KDM6B, which is blocked by IKKbeta inhibitor MLN120B, suggesting that KDM6B is regulated by NF-kappaB signaling in MM cells. RNA-seq and subsequent ChIP-qPCR analyses reveal that KDM6B is recruited to the loci of genes encoding components of MAPK signaling pathway including ELK1 and FOS, and upregulates expression of these genes without affecting H3K27 methylation level. Overexpression of catalytically inactive KDM6B activates expression of MAPK pathway-related genes, confirming its function independent of demethylase activity. We further demonstrate that downstream targets of KDM6B, ELK1 and FOS, confer MM cell growth. Our study therefore delineates KDM6B function that links NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathway mediating MM cell growth and survival, and validates KDM6B as a novel therapeutic target in MM.","['Ohguchi, H', 'Harada, T', 'Sagawa, M', 'Kikuchi, S', 'Tai, Y-T', 'Richardson, P G', 'Hideshima, T', 'Anderson, K C']","['Ohguchi H', 'Harada T', 'Sagawa M', 'Kikuchi S', 'Tai YT', 'Richardson PG', 'Hideshima T', 'Anderson KC']","['Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170510,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5681448,,,,2017/05/11 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017141 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.141 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2661-2669. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.141.

These founder cells also exhibit equal capacity to home and engraft to different organs, although stochastic processes may alter the composition in restrictive niches.

As such, many of these patients suffer from co-existing disease states, and the provider must take these comorbidities into account when determining a treatment regimen. The widespread use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has drastically changed the treatment landscape of multiple diseases, ranging from leukemia to autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. CASE REPORT We present the case of a patient who had progression of his CLL and rheumatoid symptoms on rituximab therapy, and was subsequently treated with the second-generation anti-CD20 antibody obinutuzumab. Obinutuzumab therapy was associated with simultaneous sustained remission of both disease states, allowing for discontinuation of all other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and prolonged remission of his CLL. CONCLUSIONS While anti-CD20 antibodies have a clear role in the treatment of leukemia and inflammatory conditions, the success of obinutuzumab in RA has not been fully evaluated.

Here, a more detailed analysis of the regulation of DNA methylation of BMAL1 proceeded in RPMI8402 lymphoma cells. We found that CpG islands in the BMAL1 and the PER2 promoters were hyper- and hypomethylated, respectively and that 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-dC) not only enhanced PER2 gene expression but also PER2 oscillation within 24 h in RPMI8402 cells. That is, such hypermethylation of CpG islands in the BMAL1 promoter restricted PER2 expression which was recovered by aza-dC within 1 day in these cells. These results suggest that the circadian clock system can be recovered through BMAL1 expression induced by aza-dC within a day. The RPIB9 promoter of RPMI8402 cells, which is a methylation hotspot in lymphoblastic leukemia, was also hypermethylated and aza-dC gradually recovered RPIB9 expression in 3 days. In addition, methylation-specific PCR revealed a different degree of aza-dC-induced methylation release between BMAL1 and RPIB9 These results suggest that the aza-dC-induced recovery of gene expression from DNA methylation is dependent on a gene, for example the rapid response to demethylation by the circadian system, and thus, is of importance to clinical strategies for treating cancer.","['Tomita, Tatsunosuke', 'Kurita, Ryoji', 'Onishi, Yoshiaki']","['Tomita T', 'Kurita R', 'Onishi Y']","['Biomedical Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), DBT-AIST International Laboratory for Advanced Biomedicine (DAILAB), Higashi 1-1-1, Tsukuba 305-8566, Japan.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), DBT-AIST International Laboratory for Advanced Biomedicine (DAILAB), Higashi 1-1-1, Tsukuba 305-8566, Japan.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), DBT-AIST International Laboratory for Advanced Biomedicine (DAILAB), Higashi 1-1-1, Tsukuba 305-8566, Japan y-onishi@aist.go.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170519,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,PMC5437938,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'circadian clock', 'gene induction', 'hematological malignancy']",,2017/05/11 06:00,2018/03/14 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20170053 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20170053 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2017 May 19;37(3). pii: BSR20170053. doi: 10.1042/BSR20170053.

Deletions in the receptor Patched (PTCH) or activating mutations in Smoothened (SMO) have been reported in basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, but are largely absent in most tumor types. Therefore, the mechanism of pathway activation in most cancers, including hematological malignancies, remains unknown. In normal tissues, Hh pathway activation via PTCH/SMO causes an increase in the downstream transcriptional activator GLI1 and a decrease in the GLI3 transcriptional repressor (GLI3R). In this article, we confirm that the Hh pathway is active in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, this activity is largely independent of SMO. Epigenetic and gene expression analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas AML data set reveals that GLI3 expression is silenced in most AML patient samples, and the GLI3 locus is abnormally methylated. We show that GLI3R is required for the therapeutic effect of SMO antagonists in AML samples and restoration of GLI3R suppresses the growth of AML. We additionally demonstrate that GLI3R represses AML growth by downregulating AKT expression. In summary, this study provides the first evidence that GLI3R plays an essential role in SMO-independent Hh signaling in AML, and suggests that GLI3R could serve as a potential biomarker for patient selection in SMO antagonist clinical trials. Furthermore, these data support rational combinations of hypomethylating agents with SMO antagonists in clinical trials.","['Chaudhry, Parvesh', 'Singh, Mohan', 'Triche, Timothy J', 'Guzman, Monica', 'Merchant, Akil A']","['Chaudhry P', 'Singh M', 'Triche TJ', 'Guzman M', 'Merchant AA']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; and.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170509,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC5492089,,,,2017/05/11 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2017/05/11 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33260-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-05-718585 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jun 29;129(26):3465-3475. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-05-718585.

More recently, novel oral agents are proving to be both safe and effective in this population, redefining the field of CLL therapy.

An important cause is the intensive use of asparaginase. Prospective cohort studies in which prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was used to prevent VTE showed lower VTE risk than in historic control cohorts, with a negligible bleeding risk. However, the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis with LMWH during ALL treatment has never been investigated in a randomized design. Here, we present the protocol of a randomized controlled trial in which the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis with high prophylactic dose LMWH versus no thromboprophylaxis will be assessed in children treated for primary ALL with asparaginase. METHODS/DESIGN: Thromboprophylaxis in Children treated for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with Low-molecular-weight heparin (TropicALL) is a multicenter, randomized controlled open-label trial conducted in the Netherlands. Patients between 1 and 19 years of age with primary ALL, who are treated within the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) ALL-11 or 12 study will be randomized to thromboprophylaxis with LMWH once daily, (dose of 85 IU/kg (intervention arm A)), or to no thromboprophylaxis (arm B, standard of care) during asparaginase courses of ALL treatment. Primary efficacy endpoint is symptomatic objectified VTE during ALL treatment; secondary efficacy endpoints are overall survival and the composite of symptomatic and asymptomatic objectified VTE. Primary safety endpoints are major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding. A total of 324 patients will be included to obtain a relative risk reduction of 75% with a power of 80%, using a two-sided test with significance level alpha = 0.05. DISCUSSION: This trial will be the first to assess efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis with LMWH during asparaginase treatment for ALL in children in a randomized design.

In this study we used high-resolution single telomere length analysis (STELA) to examine the potential role of telomere dysfunction in 80 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 95 de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. Despite the MDS cohort being older, they had significantly longer telomeres than the AML cohort (P < 0.0001) where telomere length was also significantly shorter in younger AML patients (age <60 years) (P = 0.02) and in FLT3 internal tandem duplication-mutated AML patients (P = 0.03). Using a previously determined telomere length threshold for telomere dysfunction (3.81 kb) did not provide prognostic resolution in AML [Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.68, P = 0.2]. In contrast, the same length threshold was highly prognostic for overall survival in the MDS cohort (HR = 5.0, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, this telomere length threshold was an independent parameter in multivariate analysis when adjusted for age, gender, cytogenetic risk group, number of cytopenias and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score (HR = 2.27, P < 0.0001). Therefore, telomere length should be assessed in a larger prospective study to confirm its prognostic role in MDS with a view to integrating this variable into a revised IPSS.","['Williams, Jenna', 'Heppel, Nicole H', 'Britt-Compton, Bethan', 'Grimstead, Julia W', 'Jones, Rhiannon E', 'Tauro, Sudhir', 'Bowen, David T', 'Knapper, Steven', 'Groves, Michael', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Baird, Duncan M', 'Fegan, Chris']","['Williams J', 'Heppel NH', 'Britt-Compton B', 'Grimstead JW', 'Jones RE', 'Tauro S', 'Bowen DT', 'Knapper S', 'Groves M', 'Hills RK', 'Pepper C', 'Baird DM', 'Fegan C']","['Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, UK.', ""Department of Haematology, St James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds, UK."", 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170509,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['* AML', '*myelodysplasia', '*telomerase', '*telomere']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14666 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Jul;178(2):240-249. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14666.

The combination of a PPM1D inhibitor and all-trans retinoic acid significantly increased their differentiation efficiency. The PPM1D inhibitor also induced G1 arrest in HL-60 cells. Our results suggest that PPM1D may be a potential therapeutic target for blood cell diseases including leukemia.","['Kamada, Rui', 'Kudoh, Fuki', 'Yoshimura, Fumihiko', 'Tanino, Keiji', 'Sakaguchi, Kazuyasu']","['Kamada R', 'Kudoh F', 'Yoshimura F', 'Tanino K', 'Sakaguchi K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, North10, West8, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, North10, West8, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Organic Chemistry II, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, North10, West8, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Organic Chemistry II, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, North10, West8, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, North10, West8, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,,['NOTNLM'],"['HL-60', 'Ser/Thr phosphatase', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'differentiation', 'neutrophil', 'small molecule inhibitor']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['3806723 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvx032 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2017 Oct 1;162(4):303-308. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvx032.,,20171013,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPM1D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2C)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/pathology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2C/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,"['(c) The Authors 2017.

In the present study, the potential effects of 5-AZA on APAP-induced toxic hepatitis were investigated in a mouse model in vivo. The results indicated that treatment with 5-AZA suppressed the elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in plasma, alleviated APAP-induced histological abnormalities in liver, improved the survival rate of the experimental animals. These effects were associated with restored level of GSH and suppressed elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver. In addition, treatment with 5-AZA suppressed APAP-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and nitric oxide (NO), 5-AZA also reversed the upregulation of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the liver of APAP-exposed mice. The above data indicated that 5-AZA could provide beneficial effects in APAP-induce toxic hepatitis, these effects might attribute to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory actions.","['Yang, Changming', 'Yi, Jun', 'Gong, Xianqiong', 'Ge, Pu', 'Dai, Jie', 'Lin, Ling', 'Xing, Yu', 'Zhang, Li']","['Yang C', 'Yi J', 'Gong X', 'Ge P', 'Dai J', 'Lin L', 'Xing Y', 'Zhang L']","[""Department of Anesthesiology, The First People's Hospital of Jingmen, Jingmen, Hubei Province 448000, China; Jingmen Clinical Medical School, Hubei University for Nationalities, Enshi, Hubei Province 445000, China."", ""Jingmen Clinical Medical School, Hubei University for Nationalities, Enshi, Hubei Province 445000, China; Department of Cardiothrocic Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Jingmen, Jingmen, Hubei Province, China."", 'Department of Liver Diseases, Hepatology Center, Xiamen Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xiamen, Fujian Province 361000, China.', 'Departments of Pathophysiology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Hospital of Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Departments of Pathophysiology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Laboratory of Forensic Medicine and Biomedical Information, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Departments of Pathophysiology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.

Combined all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) or chemotherapy dramatically improves the prognosis of APL patients. Here we report that expression of pseudokinase Tribble 3 (TRIB3) associates positively with APL progression and therapeutic resistance. The elevated TRIB3 expression promotes APL by interacting with PML-RARalpha and suppressing its sumoylation, ubiquitylation, and degradation. This represses PML nuclear body assembly, p53-mediated senescence, and cell differentiation, and supports cellular self-renewal. Genetically inhibiting TRIB3 expression or combination of a peptide disturbing TRIB3/PML-RARalpha interaction with ATRA/As2O3 eradicates APL by accelerating PML-RARalpha degradation.

Whether azacitidine-based combinations with lenalidomide or vorinostat produce superior overall response rates (ORRs) to azacitidine is not known. Patients and Methods North American Intergroup Study S1117 is a phase II/III trial that randomly assigned patients with higher-risk MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 1:1:1 to azacitidine (75 mg/m(2)/day on days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle); azacitidine plus lenalidomide (10 mg/day on days 1 to 21); or azacitidine plus vorinostat (300 mg twice daily on days 3 to 9). The primary phase II end point was improved ORR. Results Of 277 patients from 90 centers, 92 received azacitidine, 93 received azacitidine plus lenalidomide, and 92 received azacitidine plus vorinostat. Median age was 70 years (range, 28 to 93 years), 85 patients (31%) were female, and 53 patients (19%) had CMML. Serious adverse events were similar across arms, although combination-arm patients were more likely to undergo nonprotocol-defined dose modifications ( P < .001).With a median follow-up of 23 months (range, 1 to 43 months), the ORR was 38% for patients receiving azacitidine, 49% for azacitidine plus lenalidomide ( P = .14 v azacitidine), and 27% for azacitidine plus vorinostat ( P = .16 v azacitidine). For patients with CMML, ORR was higher for azacitidine plus lenalidomide versus azacitidine (68% v 28%, P = .02) but similar for all arms across cytogenetic subgroups, as was remission duration and overall survival. ORR was higher with mutations in DNMT3A and lower for SRSF2, whereas ORR duration improved with fewer mutations. Lenalidomide dose reduction was associated with worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.30; P = .05). Conclusion Patients with higher-risk MDS treated with azacitidine-based combinations had similar ORR to azacitidine monotherapy, although patients with CMML benefitted from azacitidine plus lenalidomide. The efficacy of combination regimens may have been affected by dose modifications.","['Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Othus, Megan', 'List, Alan F', 'Odenike, Olatoyosi', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Buckstein, Rena', 'Fang, Min', 'Roulston, Diane', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Moseley, Anna', 'Nazha, Aziz', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Velasco, Mario R', 'Gaur, Rakesh', 'Atallah, Ehab', 'Attar, Eyal C', 'Cook, Elina K', 'Cull, Alyssa H', 'Rauh, Michael J', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Erba, Harry P']","['Sekeres MA', 'Othus M', 'List AF', 'Odenike O', 'Stone RM', 'Gore SD', 'Litzow MR', 'Buckstein R', 'Fang M', 'Roulston D', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Moseley A', 'Nazha A', 'Zhang Y', 'Velasco MR', 'Gaur R', 'Atallah E', 'Attar EC', 'Cook EK', 'Cull AH', 'Rauh MJ', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Erba HP']","[""Mikkael A.

Preclinical and clinical examples of cell-based treatment strategies have shown promising results across many disciplines in medicine, with recent advances in immune cell therapies for cancer producing remarkable response rates, even in patients with multiple treatment failures. However, cell-based therapies suffer from inconsistent outcomes, motivating the search for tools that allow monitoring of cell delivery and behavior in vivo. Noninvasive cell imaging techniques, also known as cell tracking, have been developed to address this issue. These tools can allow real-time, quantitative, and long-term monitoring of transplanted cells in the recipient, providing insight on cell migration, distribution, viability, differentiation, and fate, all of which play crucial roles in treatment efficacy. Understanding these parameters allows the optimization of cell choice, delivery route, and dosage for therapy and advances cell-based therapy for specific clinical uses. To date, most cell tracking work has centered on imaging modalities such as MRI, radionuclide imaging, and optical imaging. However, X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an emerging method for cell tracking that has several strengths such as high spatial and temporal resolution, and excellent quantitative capabilities. The advantages of CT for cell tracking are enhanced by its wide availability and cost effectiveness, allowing CT to become one of the most popular clinical imaging modalities and a key asset in disease diagnosis. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in cell tracking methods using X-ray CT in various applications, in addition to predictions on how the field will progress.","['Kim, Johoon', 'Chhour, Peter', 'Hsu, Jessica', 'Litt, Harold I', 'Ferrari, Victor A', 'Popovtzer, Rachela', 'Cormode, David P']","['Kim J', 'Chhour P', 'Hsu J', 'Litt HI', 'Ferrari VA', 'Popovtzer R', 'Cormode DP']","['Department of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University , Ramat Gan, 5290002, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170518,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,PMC5481820,,,,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/08/17 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.7b00194 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2017 Jun 21;28(6):1581-1597. doi: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.7b00194.

PATIENTS & METHODS: Adults newly diagnosed with HCL (1 January 2006 to 30 June 2014) with continuous health plan enrollment >/=180 days pre- and 90 days post-diagnosis were identified from the QuintilesIMS PharMetrics Plus Health Plan Claims Database. Treatment patterns by line of therapy were assessed over the variable follow-up. RESULTS: Among 749 HCL patients (77.4% male; mean age 55.6; mean 32.3 months follow-up), only 37.7% initiated first-line therapy during the available follow-up in a mean of 4.4 months following diagnosis; the majority (75.5%) received cladribine (mean duration 7.3 days). Thirty-eight patients (5.1%) received second-line treatment. CONCLUSION: Over 2.7 years follow-up, more than a third of patients initiated first-line therapy which appeared to provide a long-lasting response.","['Divino, Victoria', 'Karve, Sudeep', 'Gaughan, Andrew', 'DeKoven, Mitch', 'Gao, Guozhi', 'Knopf, Kevin B', 'Lanasa, Mark C']","['Divino V', 'Karve S', 'Gaughan A', 'DeKoven M', 'Gao G', 'Knopf KB', 'Lanasa MC']","['QuintilesIMS, Fairfax, VA 22031, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA.', 'QuintilesIMS, Fairfax, VA 22031, USA.', 'MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA.', 'Sutter Health Care, San Francisco, CA 94118, USA.', 'Clinical Development, Oncology, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20170509,England,J Comp Eff Res,Journal of comparative effectiveness research,101577308,,['NOTNLM'],"['hairy cell leukemia', 'retrospective studies', 'treatment utilization']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2019/06/04 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/cer-2017-0014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comp Eff Res. 2017 Sep;6(6):497-508. doi: 10.2217/cer-2017-0014.

NADPH oxidase is the major endogenous source of ROS and a key mediator of oxidative cardiac damage. The impact of NADPH oxidase polymorphisms (CYBA:rs4673, NCF4:rs1883112, RAC2:rs13058338) was evaluated in 225 adult de novo AML patients. Variant alleles of NCF4 and RAC2 were related to higher complete remission (P=0.035, P=0.016), and CYBA homozygous variant showed lower overall survival with recessive model (P=0.045). Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity was associated to NCF4 homozygous variant (P=0.012) and CYBA heterozygous genotype (P=0.027). Novel associations were found between variant allele of CYBA and lower lung and gastrointestinal toxicities, and a protective effect in nephrotoxicity and RAC2 homozygous variant. Moreover, RAC2 homozygous variant was related to delayed thrombocytopenia recovery. This study supports the interest of NADPH oxidase polymorphisms regarding efficacy and toxicity of AML induction therapy, in a coherent integrated manner.","['Megias-Vericat, J E', 'Montesinos, P', 'Herrero, M J', 'Moscardo, F', 'Boso, V', 'Rojas, L', 'Martinez-Cuadron, D', 'Rodriguez-Veiga, R', 'Sendra, L', 'Cervera, J', 'Poveda, J L', 'Sanz, M A', 'Alino, S F']","['Megias-Vericat JE', 'Montesinos P', 'Herrero MJ', 'Moscardo F', 'Boso V', 'Rojas L', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Rodriguez-Veiga R', 'Sendra L', 'Cervera J', 'Poveda JL', 'Sanz MA', 'Alino SF']","['Unidad de Farmacogenetica, Instituto Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe and Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Farmacia, Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Unidad de Farmacogenetica, Instituto Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe and Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Departamento Farmacologia, Universidad de Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Unidad de Farmacogenetica, Instituto Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe and Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Farmacia, Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Unidad de Farmacogenetica, Instituto Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe and Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Unidad de Farmacogenetica, Instituto Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe and Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Departamento Farmacologia, Universidad de Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Farmacia, Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Unidad de Farmacogenetica, Instituto Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe and Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Departamento Farmacologia, Universidad de Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Unidad de Farmacologia Clinica, Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170509,United States,Pharmacogenomics J,The pharmacogenomics journal,101083949,,,,,2017/05/10 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['tpj201719 [pii]', '10.1038/tpj.2017.19 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenomics J. 2018 Apr;18(2):301-307. doi: 10.1038/tpj.2017.19.

It is the most aggressive among the monoclonal gammopathies. It is diagnosed by the presence of more than 20% plasma cells in the peripheral blood or an absolute plasma cell count of> 2000/mm3. Because of the relatively low incidence, most data come from case reports and retrospective studies. No prospective series have been published, and only seven reports including more than twenty patients have been identified. We report a retrospective series of 18 patients identified as PCL. AIM: To study the clinical features and outcome of patients with PCL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted from the year 2006 to 2015 wherein all the patients diagnosed with PCL were identified. Complete clinical and treatment details and outcome were obtained from the records. RESULTS: There were total 18 cases of PCL (3.7% of cases with multiple myeloma) diagnosed between the year 2006 and 2015. 16 cases (84%) were primary PCL, and two cases were secondary PCL. Twelve patients were males and six were females. The median age was 56.5 years. All patients had aggressive clinical course and median overall survival even with immunomodulatory agents was only 3 months. CONCLUSION: PCL is a very aggressive disease, and no prospective trials have been conducted. Patients with PCL require induction with immunomodulators, proteasome inhibitors, and further trials are needed to evaluate the role of autologous stem cell transplant in this disease.","['Babu, K Govind', 'Jacob, Linu Abraham', 'Agarwal, Ankit', 'Lakshmaiah, K C', 'Lokanatha, D', 'Suresh Babu, M C', 'Rajeev, L K', 'Lokesh, K N', 'Rudresha, A H']","['Babu KG', 'Jacob LA', 'Agarwal A', 'Lakshmaiah KC', 'Lokanatha D', 'Suresh Babu MC', 'Rajeev LK', 'Lokesh KN', 'Rudresha AH']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,,,,,2017/05/10 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2016_53_4_619_204775 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.204775 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2016 Oct-Dec;53(4):619-620. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.204775.,,20180223,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MEN1 gene codes for the canonical tumor suppressor protein, menin. Its protein structure has recently been crystallized, and it has been investigated in a multitude of other tissues. In this review, we summarize recent advancements in understanding the structure of the menin protein and its function as a scaffold protein in histone modification and epigenetic gene regulation. Furthermore, we explore its role in hepatobiliary autoimmune diseases, cancers, and metabolic diseases. In particular, we discuss how menin expression and function are regulated by extracellular signaling factors and nuclear receptor activation in various hepatic cell types. How the many signaling pathways and tissue types affect menin's diverse functions is not fully understood. We show that small-molecule inhibitors affecting menin function can shed light on menin's broad role in pathophysiology and elucidate distinct menin-dependent processes. This review reveals menin's often dichotomous function through analysis of its role in multiple disease processes and could potentially lead to novel small-molecule therapies in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma or biliary autoimmune diseases.","['Ehrlich, Laurent', 'Hall, Chad', 'Meng, Fanyin', 'Lairmore, Terry', 'Alpini, Gianfranco', 'Glaser, Shannon']","['Ehrlich L', 'Hall C', 'Meng F', 'Lairmore T', 'Alpini G', 'Glaser S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170428,United States,Gene Expr,Gene expression,9200651,PMC5765438,,,,2017/05/10 06:00,2018/05/01 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/105221617X695744 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Expr. 2017 Jul 7;17(3):251-263. doi: 10.3727/105221617X695744.

Here we investigated the expression of Mcl-1 in seven lymphoma cell lines and its potential role as a molecular drug target for NK/T-cell lymphoma therapy by using lentivirus-mediated shRNA interference targeting Mcl-1 (lenti-shMcl-1). In our study, the expression of Mcl-1 in different lymphoma cell lines were evaluated firstly, after that lenti-shMcl-1 was constructed and transduced into NK/T-cell lymphoma cell line SNK-6 which had a high level expression of Mcl-1. Methylthiazolete-Trazolium (MTT) assay and flow cytometry (FCA) were employed to detect the status of proliferation and apoptosis after infection. Lastly we investigated the effects of chemotherapy agent vincristine (VCR) combination with lenti-shMcl-1 by MTT and FCA assay. The results showed that Mcl-1 gene expressed in all seven lymphoma cell lines at different levels. Recombinant lentiviruses could infect SNK-6 cells effectively. Mcl-1 expression level was remarkably down-regulated after infection with lenti-shMcl-1. The growth of SNK-6 cells was inhibited significantly through apoptosis pathway. Otherwise, lenti-shMcl-1 also revealed a significant chemosensitizing effect in combination with vincristine.

Following that, the sample dependency network was constructed based on the Pearson connection coefficients of DEGs in the samples. The prognosis-related genes were collected using logistic regression analysis. A classifier for predict the prognosis of ALL patients was established, which was validated in another independent dataset GSE13280 including 173 ALL samples.

Heterogeneity in tumor cell-cycle status (e. g. proliferation, quiescence, apoptosis) increases drug resistance and tumor recurrence. Cell-cycle status is closely linked to cellular metabolism. Thus, this study applies cell-level metabolic imaging to distinguish proliferating, quiescent, and apoptotic populations. Two-photon microscopy and time-correlated single photon counting are used to measure optical redox ratio (NAD(P)H fluorescence intensity divided by FAD intensity), NAD(P)H and FAD fluorescence lifetime parameters. Redox ratio, NAD(P)H and FAD lifetime parameters alone exhibit significant differences (p<0.05) between population means. To improve separation between populations, linear combination models derived from partial least squares - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) are used to exploit all measurements together. Leave-one-out cross validation of the model yielded high classification accuracies (92.4 and 90.1 % for two and three populations, respectively). OMI and PLS-DA also identifies each sub-population within heterogeneous samples. These results establish single-cell analysis with OMI and PLS-DA as a label-free method to distinguish cell-cycle status within intact samples. This approach could be used to incorporate cell-level tumor heterogeneity in cancer drug development.","['Heaster, Tiffany M', 'Walsh, Alex J', 'Zhao, Yue', 'Hiebert, Scott W', 'Skala, Melissa C']","['Heaster TM', 'Walsh AJ', 'Zhao Y', 'Hiebert SW', 'Skala MC']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, 53715, USA.', 'National Research Council, JBSA Fort Sam Houston, Texas, 78234, USA.', '711thHuman Performance Wing, Human Effectiveness Directorate, Bioeffects Division Optical Radiation Branch, Air Force Research Lab, JBSA Fort Sam Houston, Texas, 78234, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, 53715, USA.', 'Morgridge Institute for Research, Madison, Wisconsin, 53715, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20170509,Germany,J Biophotonics,Journal of biophotonics,101318567,PMC5680147,['NOTNLM'],"['*Quiescence', '*cell-cycle status', '*fluorescence lifetime', '*metabolic imaging', '*single-cell analysis', '*tumor dormancy']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2019/01/22 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbio.201600276 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biophotonics. 2018 Jan;11(1). doi: 10.1002/jbio.201600276.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represent the standard of care for CML patients and exert a dual mode of action: direct oncokinase inhibition and restoration of effector-mediated immune surveillance, which is rendered dysfunctional in CML patients at diagnosis, prior to TKI therapy. TKIs such as imatinib, and more potent second-generation nilotinib and dasatinib induce a high rate of deep molecular response (DMR, BCR-ABL1 </= 0.01%) in CML patients. As a result, the more recent goal of therapy in CML treatment is to induce a durable DMR as a prelude to successful treatment-free remission (TFR), which occurs in approximately half of all CML patients who cease TKI therapy. The lack of overt relapse in such patients has been attributed to immunological control of CML. In this review, we discuss an immunological timeline to successful TFR, focusing on the immunology of CML during TKI treatment; an initial period of immune suppression, limiting antitumor immune effector responses in newly diagnosed CML patients, linked to an expansion of immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells and aberrant expression of immune checkpoint signaling pathways, including programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1. Commencement of TKI treatment is associated with immune system re-activation and restoration of effector-mediated [natural killer (NK) cell and T cell] immune surveillance in CML patients, albeit with differing frequencies in concert with differing levels of molecular response achieved on TKI. DMR is associated with maximal restoration of immune recovery in CML patients on TKI. Current data suggest a net balance between both the effector and suppressor arms of the immune system, at a minimum involving mature, cytotoxic CD56(dim) NK cells may be important in mediating TFR success. However, a major goal remains in CML to identify the most effective pathways to target to maximize an advantageous immune response and promote TFR success.","['Hughes, Amy', 'Yong, Agnes S M']","['Hughes A', 'Yong ASM']","['Department of Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australia Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australia Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170424,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC5402174,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'deep molecular response', 'immune surveillance', 'immunology', 'treatment-free remission']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/05/10 06:01,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00469 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Apr 24;8:469. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00469. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we found that a G/C polymorphism within the human microRNA-146a (miR-146a) gene of transplant recipients, which causes reduced miR-146a levels, was strongly associated with the risk of developing severe acute GVHD (n=289). In mice, deficiency of miR-146a in the hematopoietic system or transfer of recipient-type miR-146a(-/-) dendritic cells (DCs) enhanced GVHD, while miR-146a mimic-transfected DCs ameliorated disease. Mechanistically, lack of miR-146a enhanced JAK2-STAT1 pathway activity, which led to higher expression of class II-transactivator (CIITA) and consecutively increased MHCII-levels on DCs. Inhibition of JAK1/2 or CIITA knockdown in DCs prevented miR-146a(-/-) DC-induced GVHD exacerbation. Consistent with our findings in mice, patients with the miR-146a polymorphism rs2910164 in hematopoietic cells displayed higher MHCII levels on monocytes, which could be targeted by JAK1/2 inhibition. Our findings indicate that the miR-146a polymorphism rs2910164 identifies patients at high risk for GVHD before allo-HCT. Functionally we show that miR-146a acts as a central regulator of recipient-type DC activation during GVHD by dampening the pro-inflammatory JAK-STAT/CIITA/MHCII axis, which provides a scientific rationale for early JAK1/2 inhibition in selected patients.","['Stickel, N', 'Hanke, K', 'Marschner, D', 'Prinz, G', 'Kohler, M', 'Melchinger, W', 'Pfeifer, D', 'Schmitt-Graeff, A', 'Brummer, T', 'Heine, A', 'Brossart, P', 'Wolf, D', 'von Bubnoff, N', 'Finke, J', 'Duyster, J', 'Ferrara, J', 'Salzer, U', 'Zeiser, R']","['Stickel N', 'Hanke K', 'Marschner D', 'Prinz G', 'Kohler M', 'Melchinger W', 'Pfeifer D', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Brummer T', 'Heine A', 'Brossart P', 'Wolf D', 'von Bubnoff N', 'Finke J', 'Duyster J', 'Ferrara J', 'Salzer U', 'Zeiser R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, ALU Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, ALU Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, ALU Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, ALU Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, ALU Freiburg, Germany.', 'Signal Transduction in Tumour Development and Drug Resistance Group, Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research (IMMZ), ALU Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Freiburg University Medical Center, ALU Freiburg, Germany.', 'Signal Transduction in Tumour Development and Drug Resistance Group, Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research (IMMZ), ALU Freiburg, Germany.', 'Centre for Biological Signaling Studies BIOSS, ALU Freiburg, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic III, Oncology, Hematology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Bonn (UKB), Bonn, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic III, Oncology, Hematology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Bonn (UKB), Bonn, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic III, Oncology, Hematology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Bonn (UKB), Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center Freiburg and University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Centre for Biological Signaling Studies BIOSS, ALU Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170509,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC6231537,,,,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017137 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.137 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2732-2741. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.137.

However, their specific role in myeloid cell maturation has been poorly investigated. Here we show that ADAR1 is present at basal level in the primary myeloid leukemia cells obtained from patients at diagnosis as well as in myeloid U-937 and THP1 cell lines and its expression correlates with the editing levels. Upon phorbol-myristate acetate or Vitamin D3/granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-driven differentiation, both ADAR1 and ADAR2 enzymes are upregulated, with a concomitant global increase of A-to-I RNA editing. ADAR1 silencing caused an editing decrease at specific ADAR1 target genes, without, however, interfering with cell differentiation or with ADAR2 activity. Remarkably, ADAR2 is absent in the undifferentiated cell stage, due to its elimination through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, being strongly upregulated at the end of the differentiation process. Of note, peripheral blood monocytes display editing events at the selected targets similar to those found in differentiated cell lines. Taken together, the data indicate that ADAR enzymes play important and distinct roles in myeloid cells.","['Rossetti, C', 'Picardi, E', 'Ye, M', 'Camilli, G', ""D'Erchia, A M"", 'Cucina, L', 'Locatelli, F', 'Fianchi, L', 'Teofili, L', 'Pesole, G', 'Gallo, A', 'Sorrentino, R']","['Rossetti C', 'Picardi E', 'Ye M', 'Camilli G', ""D'Erchia AM"", 'Cucina L', 'Locatelli F', 'Fianchi L', 'Teofili L', 'Pesole G', 'Gallo A', 'Sorrentino R']","[""Department of Biology and Biotechnology 'Charles Darwin', University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Biosciences, Biotechnology and Biopharmaceutics, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Institute of Biomembranes, Bioenergetics and Molecular Biotechnologies of the National Research Council, Bari, Italy.', ""Department of Biology and Biotechnology 'Charles Darwin', University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Biology and Biotechnology 'Charles Darwin', University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Biosciences, Biotechnology and Biopharmaceutics, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Institute of Biomembranes, Bioenergetics and Molecular Biotechnologies of the National Research Council, Bari, Italy.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncohaematology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncohaematology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Pediatric Science, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biosciences, Biotechnology and Biopharmaceutics, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Institute of Biomembranes, Bioenergetics and Molecular Biotechnologies of the National Research Council, Bari, Italy.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncohaematology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Biology and Biotechnology 'Charles Darwin', University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170509,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5729351,,,,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017134 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.134 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2824-2832. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.134.

Prior studies indicate that glucocorticoid (GC) resistance is more common than resistance to other chemotherapies at relapse. In addition, failure to clear peripheral blasts during a prednisone prophase correlates with an elevated risk of relapse in newly diagnosed patients. Here we show that intrinsic GC resistance is present at diagnosis in early thymic precursor (ETP) T-ALLs as well as in a subset of non-ETP T-ALLs. GC-resistant non-ETP T-ALLs are characterized by strong induction of JAK/STAT signaling in response to interleukin-7 (IL7) stimulation. Removing IL7 or inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling sensitizes these T-ALLs, and a subset of ETP T-ALLs, to GCs. The combination of the GC dexamethasone and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib altered the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors in samples with IL7-dependent GC resistance, but not in samples with IL7-independent GC resistance. Together, these data suggest that the addition of ruxolitinib or other inhibitors of IL7 receptor/JAK/STAT signaling may enhance the efficacy of GCs in a biologically defined subset of T-ALL.","['Delgado-Martin, C', 'Meyer, L K', 'Huang, B J', 'Shimano, K A', 'Zinter, M S', 'Nguyen, J V', 'Smith, G A', 'Taunton, J', 'Winter, S S', 'Roderick, J R', 'Kelliher, M A', 'Horton, T M', 'Wood, B L', 'Teachey, D T', 'Hermiston, M L']","['Delgado-Martin C', 'Meyer LK', 'Huang BJ', 'Shimano KA', 'Zinter MS', 'Nguyen JV', 'Smith GA', 'Taunton J', 'Winter SS', 'Roderick JR', 'Kelliher MA', 'Horton TM', 'Wood BL', 'Teachey DT', 'Hermiston ML']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA, USA."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170509,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5729333,,,,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2016/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017136 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.136 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2568-2576. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.136.

High-resolution genome analysis using microarray and large-scale sequencing have helped identify several important acquired gene mutations that are responsible for such signaling deregulations across different hematological malignancies. In particular, the genetic landscape of classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) has been in large part completed with the identification of driver mutations (targeting the cytokine receptor/Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) pathway) that determine MPN phenotype, as well as additional mutations mainly affecting the regulation of gene expression (epigenetics or splicing regulators) and signaling. At present, most efforts concentrate in understanding how all these genetic alterations intertwine together to influence disease evolution and/or dictate clinical phenotype in order to use them to personalize diagnostic and clinical care. However, it is now evident that factors other than somatic mutations also play an important role in MPN disease initiation and progression, among which germline predisposition (single-nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes) may strongly influence the occurrence of MPNs. In this context, the LNK inhibitory adaptor protein encoded by the LNK/SH2B adaptor protein 3 (SH2B3) gene is the target of several genetic variations, acquired or inherited in MPNs, lymphoid leukemia and nonmalignant hematological diseases, underlying its importance in these pathological processes. As LNK adaptor is a key regulator of normal hematopoiesis, understanding the consequences of LNK variants on its protein functions and on driver or other mutations could be helpful to correlate genotype and phenotype of patients and to develop therapeutic strategies to target this molecule. In this review we summarize the current knowledge of LNK function in normal hematopoiesis, the different SH2B3 mutations reported to date and discuss how these genetic variations may influence the development of hematological malignancies.","['Maslah, N', 'Cassinat, B', 'Verger, E', 'Kiladjian, J-J', 'Velazquez, L']","['Maslah N', 'Cassinat B', 'Verger E', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Velazquez L']","['APHP, Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMRS 1131, IUH, Universite Paris-Diderot, Paris, France.', 'APHP, Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMRS 1131, IUH, Universite Paris-Diderot, Paris, France.', 'APHP, Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMRS 1131, IUH, Universite Paris-Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMRS 1131, IUH, Universite Paris-Diderot, Paris, France.', ""APHP, Centre d'investigations Cliniques, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", 'INSERM UMRS-MD1197, Institut Andre Lwoff/Universite Paris XI, Hopital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170509,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017139 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.139 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Aug;31(8):1661-1670. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.139.

We have previously described that DDIT4 expression is an independent prognostic factor for tripe negative breast cancer resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We herein report that high DDIT4 expression is related to the outcome (recurrence-free survival, time to progression and overall survival) in several cancer types. We performed in silico analysis in online platforms, in pooled datasets from KM Plotter and meta-analysis of individual datasets from SurvExpress. High levels of DDIT4 were significantly associated with a worse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, colon, skin and lung cancer. Conversely, a high DDIT4 expression was associated with an improved prognostic in gastric cancer. DDIT4 was not associated with the outcome of ovarian cancers. Analysis with data from the Cell Miner Tool in 60 cancer cell lines indicated that although rapamycin activity was correlated with levels of MTOR, it is not influenced by DDIT4 expression. In summary, DDIT4 might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker in several malignancies. DDIT4 activity could be responsible for resistance to mTOR inhibitors and is a potential candidate for the development of targeted therapy.","['Pinto, Joseph A', 'Rolfo, Christian', 'Raez, Luis E', 'Prado, Alexandra', 'Araujo, Jhajaira M', 'Bravo, Leny', 'Fajardo, Williams', 'Morante, Zaida D', 'Aguilar, Alfredo', 'Neciosup, Silvia P', 'Mas, Luis A', 'Bretel, Denisse', 'Balko, Justin M', 'Gomez, Henry L']","['Pinto JA', 'Rolfo C', 'Raez LE', 'Prado A', 'Araujo JM', 'Bravo L', 'Fajardo W', 'Morante ZD', 'Aguilar A', 'Neciosup SP', 'Mas LA', 'Bretel D', 'Balko JM', 'Gomez HL']","['Unidad de Investigacion Basica y Traslacional, Oncosalud-AUNA, Av.

Although most of these aberrations are correlated with prognosis, accurate risk stratification remains a challenge even after incorporating these molecular markers. Currently, some genetic mutations that allow risk stratification have been identified in adult AML, including DNMT3A and IDH1/2. However, these mutations are rare in pediatric AML cases, indicating that a different pathogenesis may exist between adult and pediatric AML. To reveal further details of pediatric AML pathogenesis, the authors performed whole-exome sequencing and whole-transcriptome analysis using massively parallel sequencing technologies in addition to gene expression array. We found that PRDM16 and EVI1-overexpressing patients had significantly worse overall survival and event-free survival, and these overexpressed genes were useful for stratifying patients with FLT3-ITD positive and/or normal karyotype. In order to further this work and establish more appropriate risk classification and molecular target drug development, target validation clinical studies are needed and expected.","['Shiba, Norio']",['Shiba N'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Gene expression', '*Next generation sequencing', '*Risk stratification']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/11/02 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.58.389 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2017;58(4):389-399. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.58.389.,,20171101,,,IM,"['Child', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, approximately half of patients with a sustained deep molecular response experienced treatment free remission (TFR) even after discontinuation of TKI. Although antitumor immunity by natural killer (NK) cells might contribute to the effects of TKI and TFR in CML, the details of their actions have not as yet been elucidated. Recently, several reports have raised the possibility that the killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR), a highly polymorphic NK cell receptor, may play important roles, because polymorphic patterns of KIR were shown to be associated with the intensity of clinical responses and outcomes in TKI-treated CML patients. Herein, we summarize genetic and immunological aspects of KIR, and also discuss the association between KIR and CML. If KIR polymorphism is actually associated with the outcomes of TKI-treated CML patients, we might be able to obtain prognostic information for patients and assess the possibility of TFR, which would not only benefit patients, but also provide a platform for improving the outcomes of other hematologic malignancies utilizing NK cell immunity.","['Ureshino, Hiroshi', 'Shindo, Takero', 'Tanaka, Hidenori', 'Kimura, Shinaya']","['Ureshino H', 'Shindo T', 'Tanaka H', 'Kimura S']","['Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University.', 'HLA Foundation Laboratory.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Killer immunoglobulin-like receptor', '*Natural killer cell', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/11/02 06:00,['2017/05/10 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.58.381 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2017;58(4):381-388. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.58.381.,,20171101,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, KIR/genetics/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much attention has been focused recently on particular members of the intestinal microbiota for their potential roles in promoting carcinogenesis. Here we report the identification and characterization of intestinal bacteria that exhibited potent anti-malignancy activities on a broad range of solid cancers and leukemia. We collected fecal specimens from healthy individuals of different age groups (preschool children and university students), inspected their effects on cancer cells, and obtained bacteria with potent anti-malignancy activities. The bacteria mostly belonged to Actinobacteria but also included lineages of other phyla such as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. In animal cancer models, sterile culture supernatant from the bacteria highly effectively inhibited tumor growth. Remarkably, intra-tumor administration of the bacterial products prevented metastasis and even cleared cancer cells at remote locations from the tumor site. This work demonstrates the prevalent existence of potent malignancy-killers in the human intestinal microbiota, which may routinely clear malignant cells from the body before they form cancers.","['Zhou, Yu-Jie', 'Zhao, Dan-Dan', 'Liu, Huidi', 'Chen, Hao-Ting', 'Li, Jia-Jing', 'Mu, Xiao-Qin', 'Liu, Zheng', 'Li, Xia', 'Tang, Le', 'Zhao, Zhan-Yi', 'Wu, Ji-Heng', 'Cai, Yu-Xuan',

Patients received 28-day treatment cycles; the primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of isatuximab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Fifty-seven patients (median 5 [range 1-12] prior regimens; 83% refractory to previous lenalidomide therapy) were treated. Median duration of dosing was 36.4 weeks; 15 patients remained on treatment at data cutoff. Isatuximab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone was generally well tolerated with only 1 dose-limiting toxicity reported (grade 3 pneumonia at 20 mg/kg QW/Q2W); the MTD was not reached. The most common isatuximab-related adverse events were infusion-associated reactions (IARs) (56%), which were grade 1/2 in 84% of patients who had an IAR and predominantly occurred during the first infusion. In the efficacy-evaluable population, the overall response rate (ORR) was 56% (29/52) and was similar between the 10 mg/kg Q2W and 10 and 20 mg/kg QW/Q2W cohorts. The ORR was 52% in 42 evaluable lenalidomide-refractory patients. Overall median progression-free survival was 8.5 months. Isatuximab exposure increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner; isatuximab and lenalidomide pharmacokinetic parameters appeared independent. These data suggest that isatuximab combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is active and tolerated in heavily pretreated patients with RRMM.

To investigate the impact of prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) followed by minimal residual disease (MRD) test and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-guided multiple DLIs to prevent relapse and improve survival in patients with refractory/relapsed acute leukemia who received allo-HSCT. A multicenter prospective study was designed. In total, 100 patients who achieved complete remission at 30 days post-transplant and had no uncontrolled infection, organ failure, or active GVHD were eligible First, prophylactic DLI was administered at 30 days after HLA-matched related HSCT or 45 to 60 days after HLA-matched unrelated HSCT or haploidentical HSCT. Subsequently, multiple DLIs were administered based on the results of MRD test and whether they developed GVHD. In addition to DLI, chemotherapy was also given to patients who had a positive MRD test. Three-year cumulative incidence of relapse, leukemia-free survival, and survival post-transplant were 32.4% (95% confidence interval, 22.4% to 42.4%), 50.3% (95% confidence interval, 40.3% to 60.3%), and 51.4% (95% confidence interval, 41.2% to 61.6%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, a positive MRD test (HR, 3.840; 95% confidence interval, 1.678 to 5.784; P= .001) and receiving 1 course of DLI (HR, 4.346; 95% confidence interval, 1.223 to 9.450, P= .023) were associated with an increased relapse risks.

PPARalpha is a key regulator of lipid homeostasis and a negative regulator of inflammation. Under conditions of metabolic stress such as fasting or glucose deprivation, PPARalpha is upregulated in order to control gene expression necessary for processing alternate fuel sources (e.g. fatty acid oxidation) and thereby promote maintenance of cell viability. Clinically, PPARalpha expression is upregulated in diseased tissues such as melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ovarian and prostate cancer. This may allow for cellular proliferation and metastasis. Importantly, genetic knockouts of PPARalpha have been shown to be protected against tumor growth in a variety of syngeneic tumors models. We hypothesized that a potent and selective PPARalpha antagonist could represent a novel cancer therapy. Early in our discovery research, we identified NXT629 (Bravo et al., 2014). Herein we describe the pharmacology of NXT629 and demonstrate that it is a potent and selective PPARalpha antagonist. We identify NXT629 as a valuable tool for use in in vivo assessment of PPARalpha due to its good systemic exposure following intraperitoneal injection. We explore the in vivo pharmacology of NXT629 and demonstrate that it is efficacious in pharmacodynamic models that are driven by PPARalpha. Finally, we probe the efficacy of NXT629 in disease models where PPARalpha knockouts have shown to be protected. We believe that PPARalpha antagonists will be beneficial in diseases such as ovarian cancer and melanoma where PPARalpha and fatty acid oxidation may be involved.","['Stebbins, Karin J', 'Broadhead, Alex R', 'Cabrera, Geraldine', 'Correa, Lucia D', 'Messmer, Davorka', 'Bundey, Richard', 'Baccei, Christopher', 'Bravo, Yalda', 'Chen, Austin', 'Stock, Nicholas S', 'Prasit, Peppi', 'Lorrain, Daniel S']","['Stebbins KJ', 'Broadhead AR', 'Cabrera G', 'Correa LD', 'Messmer D', 'Bundey R', 'Baccei C', 'Bravo Y', 'Chen A', 'Stock NS', 'Prasit P', 'Lorrain DS']","['Inception Sciences, 5871 Oberlin Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA 92121, United States.

During erythropoiesis, autophagy plays an important role participating in the clearance of unnecessary organelles such as ribosomes and mitochondria (mitophagy) allowing the correct formation of mature red blood cells. The dysfunction of autophagy proteins hamper the correct erythroid maturation, leading to anemia, the release of immature cells from the bone marrow and other hematological abnormalities. Autophagy plays different roles depending on the type of pathology. In leukemia cells, it has been demonstrated that autophagy could be either detrimental, leading to an increase of the apoptosis rate, or protective, acting as a key process that augments proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Thus, understanding the relationship between autophagy and erythropoiesis opens new avenues for the discovery of biochemical and pharmacological targets and for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.","['Grosso, Ruben', 'Fader, Claudio M', 'Colombo, Maria I']","['Grosso R', 'Fader CM', 'Colombo MI']","['Laboratorio de Biologia Celular y Molecular, Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia, (IHEM), Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET, Mendoza, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Celular y Molecular, Instituto de Histologia y Embriologia, (IHEM), Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET, Mendoza, Argentina; Facultad de Odontologia, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Mendoza, Argentina.

However, many cancers exploit such molecules to escape immune surveillance. Accumulating data support that their functions are dysregulated in lymphoid neoplasms, including plasma cell myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia. In lymphoid neoplasms, aberrations in 9p24.1 (PD-L1, PD-L2, and JAK2 locus), latent Epstein-Barr virus infection, PD-L1 3'-untranslated region disruption, and constitutive JAK-STAT pathway are known mechanisms to induce PD-L1 expression in lymphoma cells. Clinical trials demonstrated that PD-1 blockade is an attractive way to restore host's immune function in hematological malignancies, particularly classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Numerous clinical trials exploring PD-1 blockade as a single therapy or in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with hematologic cancers are under way. Although impressive clinical response is observed with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with certain cancers, not all patients respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, to identify best candidates who would have excellent response to checkpoint inhibitors is of utmost importance.

There is accumulating evidence that the early achievement of molecular targets is a strong predictor of superior long-term outcomes. Early response assessment provides the opportunity to intervene early with the aim of ensuring an optimal response. Failure to achieve milestones or loss of response can have diverse causes.

In this study, we show that loss of CDKN1B increased the prevalence of cell cycle regulator defects in immature T-ALL, usually only ascribed to CDKN2A/B deletions, and that CDKN1B deletions frequently coincide with expression of MEF2C, considered as one of the driving oncogenes in immature early T-cell precursor (ETP) ALL. However, MEF2C-dysregulation was only partially associated with the immunophenotypic characteristics used to define ETP-ALL.

The desulphurization of ferrocenyl thioureas to the corresponding oxo analogues using aqueous sodium hydroxide and mercuric chloride led to the ferrocenyl ureas (F1-F9) in high yields. The DNA binding studies performed by cyclic voltammetry and UV-Vis spectroscopy produced results that are in close agreement with one another for the binding constants (K) and an electrostatic mode of interaction was observed. The nature and the extent of interaction with DNA was further investigated by viscometry. The DFT/B3LYP method was used to determine the charge distribution and HOMO/LUMO energies of the optimized structure. The DFT calculated HOMO and LUMO energies correlate well with the experimentally determined redox potential values. The synthesized ferrocenyl derivatives exhibited good scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH).

However, the variants associated in the diverse studies were different. Recently, new and independent SNPs deregulating the locus function were also identified in association with ALL risk. This diversity in the results may be explained because different variants in each population could alter CDKN2A/B locus function through diverse mechanisms. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the annotated risk variants in the CDKN2A/B locus affect the susceptibility of B cell precursor ALL (B-ALL) in our Spanish population and explore if other SNPs altering additional regulatory mechanisms could be also involved. We analyzed the four SNPs proposed by GWAs and two additional SNPs in miRNA binding sites in 217 pediatric patients with B-ALL and 330 healthy controls. The SNPs rs2811712, rs3731249, rs3217992 and rs2811709 were associated with B-ALL susceptibility in our Spanish population. ALL subtypes analyses showed that rs2811712 was associated with B-hyperdiploid ALL. These results provide evidence for the influence of genetic variants at CDKN2A/B locus with the risk of developing B-ALL.","['Gutierrez-Camino, Angela', 'Martin-Guerrero, Idoia', 'Garcia de Andoin, Nagore', 'Sastre, Ana', 'Carbone Baneres, Ana', 'Astigarraga, Itziar', 'Navajas, Aurora', 'Garcia-Orad, Africa']","['Gutierrez-Camino A', 'Martin-Guerrero I', 'Garcia de Andoin N', 'Sastre A', 'Carbone Baneres A', 'Astigarraga I', 'Navajas A', 'Garcia-Orad A']","['Department of Genetics, Physic Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Leioa, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physic Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Leioa, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain.', 'BioDonostia Health Research Institute, San Sebastian, Spain.', 'Department of Oncohematology, University Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Cruces, Barakaldo, Spain.', 'BioCruces Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.', 'BioCruces Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physic Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Leioa, Spain.', 'BioCruces Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170508,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5421813,,,,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/09/16 06:00,['2017/05/09 06:00'],"['2017/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0177421 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-07020 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 May 8;12(5):e0177421. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0177421. eCollection 2017.,,20170915,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5575-3080'],"['0 (CDKN2A protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Spain']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that human CAP10-like protein 46 kDa (hCLP46) is overexpressed in human acute myelogenous leukemia, T acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and leukemia cell lines. We extend this line of biomarker and diagnostic discovery research by investigating hCLP46 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and examine the possibility of hCLP46 as a candidate biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of CRC. Using a tissue microarray analysis approach, we found that hCLP46 is (1) overexpressed in 90 CRC tissues compared with 90 matched noncancerous tissues and (2) positively correlated with higher tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, lymph node metastasis, and shorter survival time. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated that downregulation of hCLP46 in CRC cells results in proliferation arrest and adhesion enhancement, while apoptosis is unchanged. Further transcriptome profile analysis corroborated that the adhesion pathway is related to hCLP46 downregulation. This report for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, demonstrates that hCLP46 promotes tumor malignancy in CRC cells. We suggest that hCLP46 is warranted for further research as a candidate biomarker for clinical phenotypes related to colon cancer.","['Fang, Honghong', 'Chu, Qiaoyun', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Wang, Hao', 'Yu, Xinwei', 'Ge, Siqi', 'Song, Manshu', 'Wu, Lijuan', 'Lang, Minglin', 'Chang, Naibai', 'Wang, Youxin', 'Wang, Wei']","['Fang H', 'Chu Q', 'Zhang J', 'Wang H', 'Yu X', 'Ge S', 'Song M', 'Wu L', 'Lang M', 'Chang N', 'Wang Y', 'Wang W']","['1 Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, Capital Medical University , Beijing, China .', '2 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Capital Medical University , Beijing, China .', '1 Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, Capital Medical University , Beijing, China .', '1 Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, Capital Medical University , Beijing, China .', '1 Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, Capital Medical University , Beijing, China .', '3 Department of Global Health and Genomics, School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University , Perth, Australia .', '1 Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, Capital Medical University , Beijing, China .', '3 Department of Global Health and Genomics, School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University , Perth, Australia .', '1 Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, Capital Medical University , Beijing, China .', '1 Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, Capital Medical University , Beijing, China .', '4 Laboratory of Molecular Nutrition and Genetics, College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing, China .', '5 Department of Hematology, Beijing Hospital , Beijing, China .', '1 Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, Capital Medical University , Beijing, China .', '3 Department of Global Health and Genomics, School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University , Perth, Australia .', '1 Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, Capital Medical University , Beijing, China .', '3 Department of Global Health and Genomics, School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University , Perth, Australia .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,OMICS,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,,['NOTNLM'],"['*biomarker', '*colorectal cancer', '*diagnostics', '*discovery research', '*human CAP10-like protein 46 kDa']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2017/05/09 06:00'],"['2017/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/omi.2017.0037 [doi]'],ppublish,OMICS. 2017 May;21(5):266-274. doi: 10.1089/omi.2017.0037.,,20180223,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (POGLUT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucosyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precision Medicine', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of major advances in the early identification and treatment of these conditions, survival rates for these children continue to rise, and the majority now lives into adulthood. However, increases in survival have come with costs related to long-term effects of disease processes and treatments. Foremost among these consequences is impairment in brain development and neurocognitive function that may affect a substantial portion of children with chronic health conditions and follow many into adulthood. Impaired cognitive function may contribute to impairment in educational and occupational attainment, mental health, and quality of life for children with chronic conditions. Despite the significance and scope of this problem, advances in the identification and understanding of neurocognitive problems and the delivery of effective clinical care have been hindered in part because research has been ""siloed""-conducted on each chronic condition in isolation. This review examines, for the first time, neurocognitive problems in a selected set of 6 chronic pediatric health conditions-leukemia, brain tumors, sickle cell disease, congenital heart disease, Type 1 diabetes, and traumatic brain injury-to define the magnitude of the problem and identify directions for future research and clinical care. Psychologists from many areas of specialization, including pediatric psychology, educational and school psychology, neuropsychology, behavioral medicine, and adult primary care, are uniquely positioned to contribute to every phase of this work, including research, identification, and intervention.

The NKG2A(+) NK cell subpopulations displayed the highest levels of cytotoxic activation, which appeared to be significantly enhanced in comparison with that in allogeneic graft's donors. LIR-1(-) NK cells were much more frequent after HCT than LIR-1(+) NK cells and LIR-1 expression on NKG2A(+) or NKG2A(-) NK cells was associated with significantly lower cytotoxic activities. Thus NKG2A(-)/LIR-1(-) NK cells expressing only HLA-mismatched KIRs show a partial break in tolerance in the first year following HCT. The failure to exclude LIR-1(+) cells within the NKG2A(-) NK cell subset in previous studies could explain the earlier conflicting results.

Here we have designed a personalized medicine approach called gene expression and mutation analysis (GEMA) to identify BRCA- and DNA-PK-deficient leukemias either directly, using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, microarrays, and flow cytometry, or indirectly, by the presence of oncogenes such as BCR-ABL1. DNA-PK-deficient quiescent leukemia cells and BRCA/DNA-PK-deficient proliferating leukemia cells were sensitive to PARP1 inhibitors that were administered alone or in combination with current antileukemic drugs. In conclusion, GEMA-guided targeting of PARP1 resulted in dual cellular synthetic lethality in quiescent and proliferating immature leukemia cells, and is thus a potential approach to eradicate leukemia stem and progenitor cells that are responsible for initiation and manifestation of the disease. Further, an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database indicated that this personalized medicine approach could also be applied to treat numerous solid tumors from individual patients.","['Nieborowska-Skorska, Margaret', 'Sullivan, Katherine', 'Dasgupta, Yashodhara', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka, Paulina', 'Hoser, Grazyna', 'Maifrede, Silvia', 'Martinez, Esteban', 'Di Marcantonio, Daniela', 'Bolton-Gillespie, Elisabeth', 'Cramer-Morales, Kimberly', 'Lee, Jaewong', 'Li, Min', 'Slupianek, Artur', 'Gritsyuk, Daniel', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Seferynska, Ilona', 'Stoklosa, Tomasz', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Zhao, Huaqing', 'Gorbunova, Vera', 'Piwocka, Katarzyna', 'Valent, Peter', 'Civin, Curt I', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Dick, John E', 'Wang, Jean Cy', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Eppert, Kolja', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Sykes, Stephen M', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Sullivan K', 'Dasgupta Y', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka P', 'Hoser G', 'Maifrede S', 'Martinez E', 'Di Marcantonio D', 'Bolton-Gillespie E', 'Cramer-Morales K', 'Lee J', 'Li M', 'Slupianek A', 'Gritsyuk D', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Seferynska I', 'Stoklosa T', 'Bullinger L', 'Zhao H', 'Gorbunova V', 'Piwocka K', 'Valent P', 'Civin CI', 'Muschen M', 'Dick JE', 'Wang JC', 'Bhatia S', 'Bhatia R', 'Eppert K', 'Minden MD', 'Sykes SM', 'Skorski T']","['Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'The Center of Postgraduate Medical Education, Laboratory of Flow Cytometry, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Research Institute of Fox Chase Cancer Center, Immune Cell Development and Host Defense, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Research Institute of Fox Chase Cancer Center, Immune Cell Development and Host Defense, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, UCSF, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Medical University of Vienna and Ludwig Boltzmann-Cluster Oncology, and Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.', 'Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Medical University of Vienna and Ludwig Boltzmann-Cluster Oncology, and Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Vienna, Austria.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, UCSF, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN), Toronto, Ontario, Canada;

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of all consecutive pediatric patients with parotid tumors that were treated in Pediatric Surgery Service of Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with parotid tumors were included and 72% (n=16) were female patients. The median age was 10 years (range: prenatal to 19 years). Imaging studies: ultrasound, CT and MRI. Diagnostic methods: needle or open biopsy (14), biopsy of lymph nodes (3), imaging (4), blood test (1). Treatment: surgical resection (12), medical treatment (7), sclerotherapy (2). Diverse histological diagnosis were obtained: pleomorphic adenoma (4), infantile hemangioma (4), PNET (2), low flow vascular malformation (2), Castleman's disease (1), schwannoma (1), neuroblastoma (1), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (1), mucoepidermoid carcinoma (1) RICH (Rapidly Involuting Congenital Hemangioma) (1), granulomatous disease (1), reactive adenitis (1), parotid cyst (1), ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) (1). Follow-up (42,5 months): 18 patients are free of disease, 3 are currently under medical treatment and 1 died. CONCLUSIONS: Our series shows the diversity that parotid tumor can present in pediatric population and is consistent with the literature there the incidence of benign lesions are predominant. However, it is difficult to predict risk of malignancy. An exhaustive diagnosis is important, using complementary methods and biopsy whenever that is necessary.","['Oesterreich, R', 'Udaquiola, J', 'Lobos, P', 'Moldes, J', 'Liberto, D']","['Oesterreich R', 'Udaquiola J', 'Lobos P', 'Moldes J', 'Liberto D']","['Servicio de Cirugia Pediatrica.

However, epigenetic regulation mechanism of the PTPN6 gene in advanced chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) remains unclear. This study investigated bone marrow or blood samples from 44 CML patients and 10 healthy volunteers. KCL22 and K562 cells were cultured and treated with demethylation drugs and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite sequencing PCR, Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed. PTPN6 was down-regulated in cell lines and patients with advanced phase CML, whereas DNMT1, DNMT3A, MECP2, MBD2 and HDAC1 were up-regulated. Treatment with 5-azacytidine, decitabine, sodium valproate and LBH589 increased PTPN6 expression, but decreased that of DNMT1, DNMT3A, MECP2, MBD2 and HDAC1. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry showed that HDAC1 combined directly with PTPN6. ChIP-seq showed that HDAC1 did not combine with the promoter region of PTPN6, while MAPK, AKT, STAT5, JAK2 and MYC promoter regions all combined with HDAC1. PTPN6 is associated with progression of CML. Low expression level of PTPN6 was associated with DNA methylation and regulated by histone acetylation. HDAC1 participates in the regulation of PTPN6.","['Zhang, Xiaokun', 'Yang, Lin', 'Liu, Xiaojun', 'Nie, Ziyuan', 'Wang, Xingzhe', 'Pan, Yuxia', 'Luo, Jianmin']","['Zhang X', 'Yang L', 'Liu X', 'Nie Z', 'Wang X', 'Pan Y', 'Luo J']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170508,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*SHP-1', '*chronic myeloid leukaemia', '*epigenetic', '*histone acetylation', '*methylation']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2017/05/09 06:00'],"['2016/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14739 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Sep;178(5):728-738. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14739.

METHOD: Literature search was carried out in several electronic databases. Meta-analyses were performed to achieve weighted effect sizes of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), complete remission (CR) rate, and relapse rate. Metaregression analyses were performed to evaluate the factors affecting CR and relapse rates. RESULTS: Data from 37 studies (7566 patients) were used for meta-analysis. Median follow-up was 49.24 [95% confidence interval (CI): 41.33, 57.16] months. Five-year OS and DFS were 86.41 [83.97, 88.85] % and 75.42 [67.44, 83.40] %, respectively (pooled effect size [95% CI]). Following induction therapy, 89.77 [87.04, 92.50] % patients achieved CR in 38.25[37.84, 38.65] days and 6.34 [5.98, 6.70] % of the patients died during induction. Induction with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), arsenic trioxide (ATO), and daunorubicin (DNR) combination was associated with the highest rate of CR (96.16 [89.92, 92.40] %), followed by ATRA-DNR (94.29 [93.15, 95.43] %), ATRA-DNR-cytarabine (92.04 [88.38, 95.71] %), and ATRA-idarubicin (91.16 [89.92, 92.40] %). Overall relapse rate in the study population was 14.42 [11.97, 16.86] %. Baseline leukocyte count was inversely related to the CR rate. CONCLUSION: Combined chemotherapy for APL is associated with 90% CR, 14.4% relapse rate, 86% 5-year OS, and 75% 5-year DFS. Induction with ATRA-DNR-ATO is found better than other combinations with respect to CR and relapse rates.

Hitch (WT), commonly known as yellow dots or creeping daisy, is a shrub possessing potent biological activities, and is traditionally used a medicinal plant in Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani systems of medicines, and it has also been tried against leukemia cell line MEG- 01. In the present study, purification and screening of the plant was done for bioactive compounds in methanolic extract of WT for apoptotic and anti-leukemia activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The methanolic extract of WT was initially purified through thin layer chromatography (TLC) and screened for the apoptotic and anti-leukemia activities. The positive band of TLC was subjected to silica gel column chromatography for further purification and the fractions obtained from it were screened again for anti-leukemia activity through thymidine uptake assay and apoptotic activity by DNA fragmentation, nuclear staining and flow cytometry assays. The fraction with positive result was subjected to HPLC for analysis of bioactive components. RESULTS: Out of many combinations of solvents, the methanol and dichloromethane combination in the ratio 6:4 has revealed two bands in TLC, among which the second band showed positive results for apoptotic and anti-leukemic activities. Further purification of second band through silica gel chromatography gave five fractions in which the 3(rd) fraction gave positive results and it shows single peak during compositional analysis through HPLC. CONCLUSION: The single peak revealed through HPLC indicates the presence of pure compound with apoptotic and anti-leukemia activities encouraging for further structural analysis.","['Venkatesh, Uday', 'Javarasetty, Chethan', 'Murari, Satish Kumar']","['Venkatesh U', 'Javarasetty C', 'Murari SK']","['Department of Biochemistry, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore-641 046, Tamilnadu, India.', 'Central Coffee Research Institute, Balehonoor, Chikkamagalur-577 117, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, P.E.S.

METHODS: We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases (up to May 26, 2016) to identify studies that reported data on VRE gastrointestinal colonization among patients with solid or hematologic malignancy. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies, reporting data on 8391 patients with malignancy, were included in our analysis. The pooled prevalence of VRE colonization in this population was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14%-26%). Among patients with hematologic malignancy, 24% (95% CI, 16%-34%) were colonized with VRE, whereas no studies reported data solely on patients with solid malignancy. Patients with acute leukemia were at higher risk for VRE colonization (risk ratio [RR] = 1.95; 95% CI, 1.17-3.26). Vancomycin use or hospitalization within 3 months were associated with increased colonization risk (RR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.06-3.45 and RR = 4.68, 95% CI = 1.66-13.21, respectively). Among the different geographic regions, VRE colonization rate was 21% in North America (95% CI, 13%-31%), 20% in Europe (95% CI, 9%-34%), 23% in Asia (95% CI, 13%-38%), and 4% in Oceania (95% CI, 2%-6%). More importantly, colonized patients were 24.15 (95% CI, 10.27-56.79) times more likely to develop a bloodstream infection due to VRE than noncolonized patients. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial VRE colonization burden exists among patients with malignancy, and colonization greatly increases the risk for subsequent VRE bloodstream infection. Adherence to antimicrobial stewardship is needed, and a re-evaluation of the use of vancomycin as empiric therapy in this patient population may be warranted.","['Alevizakos, Michail', 'Gaitanidis, Apostolos', 'Nasioudis, Dimitrios', 'Tori, Katerina', 'Flokas, Myrto Eleni', 'Mylonakis, Eleftherios']","['Alevizakos M', 'Gaitanidis A', 'Nasioudis D', 'Tori K', 'Flokas ME', 'Mylonakis E']","['Infectious Diseases Division, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence.', 'Infectious Diseases Division, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York.', 'Infectious Diseases Division, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence.', 'Infectious Diseases Division, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence.', 'Infectious Diseases Division, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161207,United States,Open Forum Infect Dis,Open forum infectious diseases,101637045,PMC5414102,['NOTNLM'],"['VRE.', 'bloodstream infection', 'cancer', 'colonization', 'malignancy']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/05/10 06:01,['2017/05/09 06:00'],"['2016/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/ofid/ofw246 [doi]', 'ofw246 [pii]']",epublish,Open Forum Infect Dis. 2016 Dec 7;4(1):ofw246. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofw246. eCollection 2017 Winter.,,,,,,,,,"['(c) The Author 2016.

Our studies showed increased numbers of tumor-promoting, immunosuppressive and drug-resistant plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in the MM BM microenvironment. pDC-MM cell interactions upregulate interleukin-3 (IL-3), which stimulates both pDC survival and MM cell growth. Since IL-3 R is highly expressed on pDCs in the MM BM milieu, we here targeted pDCs using a novel IL-3 R-targeted therapeutic SL-401. In both in vitro and in vivo models of MM in its BM milieu, SL-401 decreases viability of pDCs, blocks pDC-induced MM cell growth, and synergistically enhances anti-MM activity of bortezomib and pomalidomide. Besides promoting pDC survival and MM cell growth, IL-3 also mediates progression of osteolytic bone disease in MM. Osteoclast (OCL) progenitor cells express IL-3 R, and we show that SL-401 abrogates monocyte-derived OCL formation and bone resorption. Finally, we show that SL-401 also decreases the viability of IL-3 R-expressing cancer stem-like cells in MM. Overall, our study provides the preclinical basis for clinical trials of SL-401 to block pDC-induced MM cell growth, inhibit osteoclastogenesis and target MM stem-like cell subpopulations to improve patient outcome in MM.","['Ray, A', 'Das, D S', 'Song, Y', 'Macri, V', 'Richardson, P', 'Brooks, C L', 'Chauhan, D', 'Anderson, K C']","['Ray A', 'Das DS', 'Song Y', 'Macri V', 'Richardson P', 'Brooks CL', 'Chauhan D', 'Anderson KC']","['Department of Medical Oncology, The LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, The LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, The LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Stemline Therapeutics, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, The LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Stemline Therapeutics, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, The LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, The LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170508,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5737925,,,,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/09 06:00'],"['2016/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017135 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.135 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2652-2660. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.135.

The initial isolation of CSCs/LSCs was in adult myelogenous leukemia, although more recently, the existence of CSCs in a wide variety of other cancers has been reported. CSCs, in general, and LSCs, specifically with respect to this review, are responsible for initiation of disease, therapeutic resistance and ultimately disease relapse. One key focus in cancer research over the past decade has been the development of therapies that safely eliminate the LSC/CSC population. One major obstacle to this goal is the identification of key mechanisms that distinguish LSCs from normal endogenous hematopoietic stem cells. An additional daunting feature that has recently come to light with advances in next-generation sequencing and single-cell sequencing is the heterogeneity within leukemias/tumors, with multiple combinations of mutations, gain and loss of function of genes, and so on being capable of driving disease, even within the CSC/LSC population. The focus of this review/perspective is on our work in identifying and validating, in both chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a safe and efficacious mechanism to target an evolutionarily conserved signaling nexus, which constitutes a common ""Achilles heel"" for LSCs/CSCs, using small molecule-specific CBP/catenin antagonists.","['Kim, Yong-Mi', 'Gang, Eun-Ji', 'Kahn, Michael']","['Kim YM', 'Gang EJ', 'Kahn M']","[""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA."", ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; Center for Molecular Pathways and Drug Discovery, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA; Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.

Despite advances in the treatment of this disease, many children with T-cell ALL (T-ALL) die from disease relapse due to low responses to standard chemotherapy and the lack of a targeted therapy that selectively eradicates the chemoresistant leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) responsible for disease recurrence. We reported recently that the reprogramming factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) has a tumor-suppressive function in children with T-ALL. KLF4 silencing by promoter deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation in patients with T-ALL leads to aberrant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MAP2K7 and the downstream c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway that controls the expansion of leukemia cells via c-Jun and activating transcription factor 2. This pathway can be inhibited with small molecules and therefore has the potential to eliminate LICs and eradicate disease in combination with standard therapy for patients with refractory and relapsed disease. The present review summarizes the role of the KLF4-MAP2K7 pathway in T-ALL pathogenesis and the function of JNK and MAP2K7 in carcinogenesis and therapy.","['Shen, Ye', 'Chen, Taylor J', 'Lacorazza, H Daniel']","['Shen Y', 'Chen TJ', 'Lacorazza HD']","[""Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX.

Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are exposed to various types of drugs, and understanding how these drugs interact is of the utmost importance. The pharmacokinetics of busulfan, melphalan, and cyclophosphamide, drugs commonly used for HSCT, are known to be affected by a variety of other drugs with differing molecular structures. We hypothesized that these structurally unrelated drugs affect the transport of DNA-alkylating agents. To test this hypothesis, we developed a flow cytometry assay that used 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester, which is cleaved by nonspecific intracellular esterases to 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF), a fluorescent ligand for the drug transporter MRP1. A decreased 5-CF efflux in the presence of a test compound suggests competitive inhibition. We demonstrated that chlorambucil, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, ketoconazole, ethacrynic acid, everolimus, and sirolimus strongly inhibited 5-CF efflux in lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. The efflux of these drugs partially depends on the glutathione (GSH) level, and their cytotoxicity is synergistic with inhibited GSH synthesis. This is consistent with the hypothesis that their GSH-conjugated products are ligands of a common cellular drug transporter. Our results may explain clinical observations on the effects of various drugs on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alkylating agents, and the assay may be used to deduce interaction mechanisms of drugs transported by a common system.","['Valdez, Benigno C', 'Hassan, Moustapha', 'Andersson, Borje S']","['Valdez BC', 'Hassan M', 'Andersson BS']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

We developed a CAR against CD123, overexpressed on AML blasts and leukemic stem cells. However, potential recognition of low CD123-positive healthy tissues, through the on-target, off-tumor effect, limits safe clinical employment of CAR-redirected T cells. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of context-dependent variables capable of modulating CAR T cell functional profiles, such as CAR binding affinity, CAR expression, and target antigen density. Computational structural biology tools allowed for the design of rational mutations in the anti-CD123 CAR antigen binding domain that altered CAR expression and CAR binding affinity without affecting the overall CAR design. We defined both lytic and activation antigen thresholds, with early cytotoxic activity unaffected by either CAR expression or CAR affinity tuning but later effector functions impaired by low CAR expression. Moreover, the anti-CD123 CAR safety profile was confirmed by lowering CAR binding affinity, corroborating CD123 is a good therapeutic target antigen. Overall, full dissection of these variables offers suitable anti-CD123 CAR design optimization for the treatment of AML.","['Arcangeli, Silvia', 'Rotiroti, Maria Caterina', 'Bardelli, Marco', 'Simonelli, Luca', 'Magnani, Chiara Francesca', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Biagi, Ettore', 'Tettamanti, Sarah', 'Varani, Luca']","['Arcangeli S', 'Rotiroti MC', 'Bardelli M', 'Simonelli L', 'Magnani CF', 'Biondi A', 'Biagi E', 'Tettamanti S', 'Varani L']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, 20900 Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, 20900 Monza, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ricerca in Biomedicina, Universita degli Studi della Svizzera Italiana, 6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Istituto di Ricerca in Biomedicina, Universita degli Studi della Svizzera Italiana, 6500 Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, 20900 Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, 20900 Monza, Italy.

METHOD: Research was conducted in the haematology-oncology clinic of a university hospital, using a quasi-experimental design (pre-and-post intervention evaluations of a single group). The sample comprised 30 hospitalised children aged 9-16 years. Data were collected with Socio-demographic form, clinical data form, and the State Anxiety Inventory. The institution gave written approval for the study and parents provided written consent. Drawing, writing and mutual story-telling techniques were used as part of a five-day programme. Children were asked to draw a picture of a hospitalised child and write a story about this drawing. After drawing and writing, mutual storytelling were used to more constructive story with positive feelings. The drawing, writing techniques was implemented on the first and third days of the programme and mutual storytelling was implemented on the second and fourth days. Data were reported as percentages and frequencies and the intervention effect analysed with the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The average age of children was 12.56 years +/- 2.67 and 76.7% were girls. The mean age diagnosis and mean treatment duration were 11.26 years +/- 3.17 and 16.56 months +/- 20.75 respectively. Most of the children (50%) had leukaemia and were receiving chemotherapy (66.7%). In most cases (76.7%) the mother was the primary caregiver. Scores on the State Anxiety Inventory were lower-indicating lower anxiety-after the intervention (36.86 +/- 4.12 than before it (40.46 +/- 4.51) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The therapeutic intervention reduced children's state anxiety.","['Altay, Naime', 'Kilicarslan-Toruner, Ebru', 'Sari, Cigdem']","['Altay N', 'Kilicarslan-Toruner E', 'Sari C']","['Gazi University Health Sciences Faculty Nursing Department, Ankara, Turkey.

Mathematically its description is supposed to be similar to the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations for simplified processes of heat flow in fluids. The hypothetical model provides a description of remission and relapse in leukaemia as two hierarchical and qualitatively different states of normal haematopoiesis with their own phase spaces. Phase space transition is possible through pitchfork bifurcation, which is considered the common symmetrical scenario for relapse, induced remission and the spontaneous remission of leukaemia. Cytopenia is regarded as an adaptive reaction of haematopoiesis to an increase in entropy caused by leukaemia clones. The following predictions are formulated: a) the percentage of leukaemia cells in marrow as a criterion of remission or relapse is not necessarily constant but is a variable value; b) the probability of remission depends upon normal haematopoiesis reaching bifurcation; c) the duration of remission depends upon the eradication of leukaemia cells through induction or consolidation therapies; d) excessively high doses of chemotherapy in consolidation may induce relapse.","['Alexeev, Igor']",['Alexeev I'],"['Valitalontie 83C, Helsinki 00660, Finland.

However, the regulatory mechanism of miR-34a in AML is unclear. METHODS: The expression of miR-34a and HMGB1 in HL-60, THP-1 and HS-5 cells were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. Lipofectamine 2000 was used to transfect with miR-34a mimics, miR-34a inhibitor, si-HMGB1, pcDNA 3.1-HMGB1, and corresponding controls. The apoptosis and autophagy of transfected AML cells were assessed by flow cytometry and western blot, respectively. Bioinformatics software and dual luciferase reporter assay were applied to predict and verify the target of miR-34a. The effects of miR-34a mimics or si-HMGB1 on chemotherapy-induced autophagy were further explored in HL-60 cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) along with lysosomal protease inhibitors E64d and pepstatin A. RESULTS: MiR-34a was lower expressed and HMGB1 mRNA and proteins were both higher expressed in HL-60 and THP-1 cells compared with that in HS-5 cells. Higher expression levels of MiR-34 and lower expression levels of HMGB1 both significantly promoted apoptosis and inhibited autophagy in HL-60 and THP-1 cells. Dual luciferase reporter system confirmed that HMGB1 was a potential target of miR-34a. Moreover, overexpression of HMGB1 dramatically reversed the promotion of apoptosis and inhibition of autophagy mediated by higher expression level of miR-34a. Higher expression level of miR-34a and lower expression level of HMGB1 both inhibited chemotherapy-induced autophagy by stimulating the LC3 conversion. CONCLUSION: MiR-34a promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited autophagy by targeting HMGB1. Therefore, miR-34a may be a potential promising molecular target for AML therapy.","['Liu, Liru', 'Ren, Weihua', 'Chen, Kuisheng']","['Liu L', 'Ren W', 'Chen K']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Luoyang Central Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Luoyang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Luoyang Central Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Luoyang, China.', 'Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170413,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'HMGB1', 'miR-34a']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2017/05/08 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['000475277 [pii]', '10.1159/000475277 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2017;41(5):1981-1992. doi: 10.1159/000475277.

He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), defervesced and was discharged home. Two weeks later, he presented with anaemia initially attributed to haemolytic anaemia secondary to IVIG and received a red blood cell transfusion. However, his anaemia recurred 2 weeks later with leucocytosis, prompting a bone marrow aspirate 4 weeks after his diagnosis of KD. This demonstrated acute myelogenous leukaemia most consistent with acute megakaryocytic leukaemia.

Analysis of HTLV-1 RNA and protein species following PMA treatment of the latently HTLV-1-infected, FS and SP T cell lines demonstrated rapid induction of tax/rex mRNA. This rapid increase in tax/rex mRNA was associated with markedly enhanced tax/rex mRNA stability while the stability of unspliced or singly spliced HTLV-1 RNAs did not increase. Tax/rex mRNA in the HTLV-1 constitutively expressing cell lines exhibited high basal stability even without PMA treatment.

However, the detail role of miR-125b in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the biological role of miR-125b in AML and the potential molecular mechanism involved in this process. Our results showed that overexpression of miR-125b suppressed AML cells proliferation, invasion and promotes cells apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, while the miR-NC did not show the same effect. In addition, miR-125b induced AML cells G2/M cell cycle arrest in vitro. Overexpression of miR-125b resulted in a significant decrease of the expression of p-IkappaB-alpha and inhibition of IkappaB-alpha degradation, and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB subunit p65 was abrogated by miR-125b simutaneously. To further verify that miR-125b targeted NF-kappaB signaling pathway, the NF-kappaB-regulated downstream genes that were associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was also determined. The results showed that, miR-125b also affect NF-kappaB-regulated genes expression involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In conclusion, the present work certificates that miR-125b can significantly inhibit human AML cells invasion, proliferation and promotes cells apoptosis by targeting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, and thus it can be viewed as an promising therapeutic target for AML.","['Wang, Yan', 'Tang, Ping', 'Chen, Yanli', 'Chen, Jingyu', 'Ma, Ruojin', 'Sun, Ling']","['Wang Y', 'Tang P', 'Chen Y', 'Chen J', 'Ma R', 'Sun L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Building East Road No. 1, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Building East Road No. 1, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Building East Road No. 1, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Building East Road No. 1, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Building East Road No. 1, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Building East Road No. 1, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000, China.

Although therapeutic advances have notably improved the outcome for many patients, B-CLL remains an incurable disease. The purpose of this study was to search for therapeutic drugs based on altered pathways in individual patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Genes from microarray data were mapped to 300 Homo sapiens-related pathways. Individual pathway aberrance analysis was used to identify altered pathways. Drug data, obtained from connectivity map (cMAP), were subjected to drug-set enrichment analysis. To analyze the relations between drug-induced pathways and disease-induced altered pathways in individuals, Pearson correlation analysis was applied. RESULTS The disease-induced pathways with P-values <0.05 in individual samples were recorded and presented in a heatmap. Drug-induced pathways were analyzed in the 104 samples. After Pearson correlation analysis between altered pathways and drug, the 20 top-ranked drugs that were most relevant to disease were obtained. There were 9 drugs with positive scores and 11 with negative scores. CONCLUSIONS With this method, we identified the 20 top-ranked drugs that were most relevant to disease.

Its best-known role is apical activation of the DNA damage response following generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). When DSBs appear, sensor and mediator proteins are recruited, activating transducers such as ATM, which in turn relay a widespread signal to a multitude of downstream effectors. ATM mutation causes Ataxia telangiectasia (AT), whereby the disease phenotype shows differing characteristics depending on the underlying ATM mutation. However, all phenotypes share progressive neurodegeneration and marked predisposition to malignancies at the organismal level and sensitivity to ionizing radiation and chromosome aberrations at the cellular level. Expression and localization of the ATM protein can be determined via western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy; however, detection of subtle alterations such as resulting from amino acid exchanges rather than truncating mutations requires functional testing. Previous studies on the role of ATM in DSB repair, which connects with radiosensitivity and chromosomal stability, gave at first sight contradictory results. To systematically explore the effects of clinically relevant ATM mutations on DSB repair, we engaged a series of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from AT patients and controls. To examine DSB repair both in a quantitative and qualitative manners, we used an EGFP-based assay comprising different substrates for distinct DSB repair mechanisms. In this way, we demonstrated that particular signaling defects caused by individual ATM mutations led to specific DSB repair phenotypes. To explore the impact of ATM on carcinogenic chromosomal aberrations, we monitored chromosomal breakage at a breakpoint cluster region hotspot within the MLL gene that has been associated with therapy-related leukemia. PCR-based MLL-breakage analysis of HeLa cells treated with and without pharmacological kinase inhibitors revealed ATM-dependent chromatin remodeling at the MLL break site giving access to DNA repair proteins but also nucleases triggering MLL rearrangements. This chapter summarizes these methods for functional characterization of ATM in patient LCLs and human cell lines.","['Mian, Elisabeth', 'Wiesmuller, Lisa']","['Mian E', 'Wiesmuller L']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The University of Ulm, Prittwitzstrasse 43, 89075, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The University of Ulm, Prittwitzstrasse 43, 89075, Ulm, Germany. lisa.wiesmueller@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Ataxia telangiectasia', '*Breast cancer risk', '*Chromatin decondensation', '*DSB repair assay', '*Endonuclease G', '*Genomic PCR', '*MLL breakpoint cluster region', '*Replication stress']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2018/02/21 06:00,['2017/05/07 06:00'],"['2017/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-6955-5_23 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2017;1599:317-334. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-6955-5_23.,,20180220,,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Humans']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to investigate the incidence of autoimmune complications (AIC) and serological autoantibodies, and to assess the relationship of these to patient characteristics. METHODS: We prospectively collected screenings of AIC and serological markers from a total of 192 patients. RESULTS: AIC was observed in 18 (9.4%) patients. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) was observed in 8 patients. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia (AITP) was observed in 3 patients. Other various types of AIC were observed in the remaining 7 patients. Serological autoantibodies were positive in 17.2% of patients with CLL. The mean age of patients with AIC was higher than the control group (p = 0.036). Patients with AIC were mostly in advanced disease stage (p = 0.004), and they had received more first-line treatments than the control group (p = 0.003). Patients with AIC had a higher mean age and more advanced disease stage than patients with positive serological autoantibodies (p = 0.020 and p = 0.009; respectively). In addition, patients with AIC had also received more first-line treatment than the patients with positive serological autoantibodies (p = 0.015). Hematologic AIC was associated with older age, advanced disease stage, and treatment. Conversely, non-hematological AIC and serological autoantibodies are generally observed in early stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has established a coexistence of CLL and autoimmune complications. Hematologists are usually familiar with AIHA and AITP, but less so with non-hematologic AIC. The latter complications should be carefully searched for, particularly in patients with early CLL.","['Demir, Cengiz', 'Ekinci, Omer']","['Demir C', 'Ekinci O']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, YuzuncuYil University, 65080, Van, Turkey. drcengizdemir@hotmail.com.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, YuzuncuYil University, 65080, Van, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170505,Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Hemolytic anemia', 'Non-hematological autoimmunity', 'Thrombocytopenia']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2019/05/31 06:00,['2017/05/07 06:00'],"['2016/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00508-017-1208-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00508-017-1208-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2017 Aug;129(15-16):552-557. doi: 10.1007/s00508-017-1208-9.

In chromosomes 11 and 22 of the miR-130 family, paralogous miRNA sequences, miR-130a and miR-130b are situated, respectively. MiR-130a has participated in different pathogenesis, including hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, prostate carcinoma, leukemia, etc. Most important of all, more and more evidences indicate that miR-130a is associated with drug resistance and acts as an intermediate in PI3 K/Akt/PTEN/mTOR, Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kB/PTEN drug resistance signaling pathways. Drug resistance has emerged as a major obstacle to successful treatment of cancer nowadays and in this review, we will reveal the function of miR-130a in cancer, especially in drug resistance. Therefore, it will provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer, especially in chemotherapy.","['Zhang, He-da', 'Jiang, Lin-Hong', 'Sun, Da-Wei', 'Li, Jian', 'Ji, Zhen-Ling']","['Zhang HD', 'Jiang LH', 'Sun DW', 'Li J', 'Ji ZL']","['Department of General Surgery, Southeast University Medical School, 87 Ding Jia Qiao, Nanjing, 210009, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Institute for Minimally Invasive Surgery, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Xuzhou Infectious Disease Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Nanjing Medical University Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Cancer Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Nanjing Medical University Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Cancer Institute of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Southeast University Medical School, 87 Ding Jia Qiao, Nanjing, 210009, Jiangsu, China. zhenlingji11@hotmail.com.', 'Department of General Surgery, Institute for Minimally Invasive Surgery, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. zhenlingji11@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170505,Japan,Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)",100888201,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Drug resistance', 'MiR-130a', 'MicroRNA']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2018/03/31 06:00,['2017/05/07 06:00'],"['2017/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12282-017-0776-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12282-017-0776-x [pii]']",ppublish,Breast Cancer. 2017 Jul;24(4):521-527. doi: 10.1007/s12282-017-0776-x.

Multi-tumor antigen-specific T cells were generated to overcome antigenic variation and may be sufficient to maximize antitumoral effects. To generate triple antigen-specific (Tri)-T cells that recognize three LAAs, dendritic cells (DCs) were transfected with three tumor antigen-encoding RNAs. These DCs were used to stimulate both CD8 and CD4 T cells and to overcome the limitation of known human leukocyte antigen-restricted epitopes. The sum of the antigen-specific T cell frequencies was higher in the Tri-T cells than in the T cells that recognized a single antigen. Furthermore, the Tri-T cells were more effective against leukemic blasts that expressed all three LAAs compared with blasts that expressed one or two LAAs, suggesting a proportional correlation between IFN-gamma secretion and LAA expression.

Both adaptive and innate immunity are affected. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has an innate immune system, including cells of the myeloid lineage (hemocytes). To study Drosophila immunity and physiology during leukemia, we established three models by driving expression of a dominant-active version of the Ras oncogene (Ras(V12) ) alone or combined with knockdowns of tumor suppressors in Drosophila hemocytes. Our results show that phagocytosis, hemocyte migration to wound sites, wound sealing, and survival upon bacterial infection of leukemic lines are similar to wild type. We find that in all leukemic models the two major immune pathways (Toll and Imd) are dysregulated. Toll-dependent signaling is activated to comparable extents as after wounding wild-type larvae, leading to a proinflammatory status. In contrast, Imd signaling is suppressed. Finally, we notice that adult tissue formation is blocked and degradation of cell masses during metamorphosis of leukemic lines, which is akin to the state of cancer-dependent cachexia. To further analyze the immune competence of leukemic lines, we used a natural infection model that involves insect-pathogenic nematodes. We identified two leukemic lines that were sensitive to nematode infections. Further characterization demonstrates that despite the absence of behavioral abnormalities at the larval stage, leukemic larvae show reduced locomotion in the presence of nematodes. Taken together, this work establishes new Drosophila models to study the physiological, immunological, and behavioral consequences of various forms of leukemia.","['Arefin, Badrul', 'Kunc, Martin', 'Krautz, Robert', 'Theopold, Ulrich']","['Arefin B', 'Kunc M', 'Krautz R', 'Theopold U']","['Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, SE-106 91, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, SE-106 91, Sweden.', 'Department of Animal Physiology and Immunology, Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, 611 37 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, SE-106 91, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University, SE-106 91, Sweden uli.theopold@su.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170705,England,G3 (Bethesda),"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,PMC5499123,['NOTNLM'],"['*Genetics of Immunity', '*Ras', '*hemocyte', '*insect immunity', '*nematodes', '*oncogene']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2018/03/22 06:00,['2017/05/07 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['g3.117.039487 [pii]', '10.1534/g3.117.039487 [doi]']",epublish,G3 (Bethesda). 2017 Jul 5;7(7):2139-2149. doi: 10.1534/g3.117.039487.,,20180321,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1117-9125'],"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cachexia/genetics/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drosophila', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Hemocytes/*immunology', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Larva/genetics/immunology', '*Leukemia/genetics/immunology', '*Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/immunology']",,,['Copyright (c) 2017 Arefin et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of a New Mutation.,2387-2391,,"BACKGROUND: The tumor protein p53 (TP53) gene may be inactivated through 17p13 deletion, somatic mutations, or both. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) although 17p13 deletion is correlated with poor prognosis, the role of sole TP53 mutations remains controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a mutation analysis of TP53 gene in 72 patients with CLL. RESULTS: Seventy-one (98.6%) patients carried the polymorphic site c.215C>G, p.Pro72Arg, but its presence was not correlated with overall survival (OS). Moreover, 19 (26.4%) patients carried a mutation of TP53. Among the eight detected mutations, to our knowledge, one (c.587G>A) has never been reported in the past. There was a correlation of the mutation burden with the stage of the disease (p=0.022), but not with OS. None of the detected mutations was individually correlated with OS. CONCLUSION: The clinical significance of TP53 mutations is still a matter of debate and larger studies and meta-analyses are required to reach an unequivocal conclusion.","['Diamantopoulos, Panagiotis T', 'Samara, Stavroula', 'Kollia, Panagoula', 'Giannakopoulou, Nefeli', 'Sofotasiou, Maria', 'Kalala, Fani', 'Kodandreopoulou, Elina', 'Zervakis, Panagiotis', 'Vassilakopoulos, Theodoros', 'Siakantaris, Marina', 'Mantzourani, Marina', 'Angelopoulou, Maria', 'Kyrtshonis, Marie-Christine', 'Korkolopoulou, Penelope', 'Patsouris, Efstathios', 'Viniou, Nora-Athina']","['Diamantopoulos PT', 'Samara S', 'Kollia P', 'Giannakopoulou N', 'Sofotasiou M', 'Kalala F', 'Kodandreopoulou E', 'Zervakis P', 'Vassilakopoulos T', 'Siakantaris M', 'Mantzourani M', 'Angelopoulou M', 'Kyrtshonis MC', 'Korkolopoulou P', 'Patsouris E', 'Viniou NA']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece pandiamantopoulos@gmail.com.', 'Department of Genetics & Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, School of Physical Sciences, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Genetics & Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, School of Physical Sciences, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon General Hospital, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Tumor protein 53', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*mutation analysis', '*prognosis']",,2017/05/10 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/05/07 06:00'],"['2017/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['37/5/2387 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11577 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2017 May;37(5):2387-2391. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11577.,,20170814,,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,,"['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

By employing a myeloid Myb-reporter cell line we have identified Withaferin A (WFA), a natural compound that exhibits anti-tumor activities, as an inhibitor of Myb-dependent transcription. Analysis of the inhibitory mechanism of WFA showed that WFA is a significantly more potent inhibitor of C/EBPbeta, a transcription factor cooperating with Myb in myeloid cells, than of Myb itself. We show that WFA covalently modifies specific cysteine residues of C/EBPbeta, resulting in the disruption of the interaction of C/EBPbeta with the co-activator p300. Our work identifies C/EBPbeta as a novel direct target of WFA and highlights the role of p300 as a crucial co-activator of C/EBPbeta. The finding that WFA is a potent inhibitor of C/EBPbeta suggests that inhibition of C/EBPbeta might contribute to the biological activities of WFA.","['Falkenberg, Kim D', 'Jakobs, Anke', 'Matern, Julian C', 'Dorner, Wolfgang', 'Uttarkar, Sagar', 'Trentmann, Amke', 'Steinmann, Simone', 'Coulibaly, Anna', 'Schomburg, Caroline', 'Mootz, Henning D', 'Schmidt, Thomas J', 'Klempnauer, Karl-Heinz']","['Falkenberg KD', 'Jakobs A', 'Matern JC', 'Dorner W', 'Uttarkar S', 'Trentmann A', 'Steinmann S', 'Coulibaly A', 'Schomburg C', 'Mootz HD', 'Schmidt TJ', 'Klempnauer KH']","['Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.

The process is regulated by Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) and germline Differentially Methylated Regions (gDMRs). Previously, ZFP57 was shown to recognize a methylated hexanucleotide in ICRs to maintain allele-specific gene repression. In Bioinformatics analyses, I found that the hexamer occurred frequently in mouse chromosomal DNA, suggesting that beside the ZFP57 binding site (ZFBS), ICRs contained sequence features with unknown characteristics. To identify such features, I examined chromosomal abundance of motifs in which the length of the hexamer was extended by one or several nucleotides. Results led to the discovery of a group of functionally significant composite DNA elements (ZFBS-Morph overlaps) that may play dual roles in the regulation of allele-specific gene expression. Importantly, results of genome-wide evaluations revealed that nearly 90% of the gDMRs included closely-spaced ZFBS-Morph overlaps.","['Bina, Minou']",['Bina M'],"['Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.

The results of this preliminary report showed a broad genomic heterogeneity among the studied samples; 58% of the patients were hyperdiploid and 33% displayed a chromosome 9p deletion of variable length affecting genes CDKN2A/B, two patients displayed genomic instability with a high number of focal CNAs, three patients presented unique duplications affecting 2q, 12p and 1q, respectively, and one patient displayed no copy number imbalances. The copy-number profile of 44 genes previously related to B-ALL was heterogeneous as well.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We used the data of the Italian SETIL case-control on childhood leukemia to explore the risk by leukemia subtypes associated to exposure to vehicular traffic. METHODS: We included in the analyses 648 cases of childhood leukemia (565 Acute lymphoblastic-ALL and 80 Acute non lymphoblastic-AnLL) and 980 controls. Information on traffic exposure was collected from questionnaire interviews and from the geocoding of house addresses, for all periods of life of the children. RESULTS: We observed an increase in risk for AnLL, and at a lower extent for ALL, with indicators of exposure to traffic pollutants. In particular, the risk was associated to the report of closeness of the house to traffic lights and to the passage of trucks (OR: 1.76; 95% CI 1.03-3.01 for ALL and 6.35; 95% CI 2.59-15.6 for AnLL). The association was shown also in the analyses limited to AML and in the stratified analyses and in respect to the house in different period of life. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the SETIL study provide some support to the association of traffic related exposure and risk for AnLL, but at a lesser extent for ALL. Our conclusion highlights the need for leukemia type specific analyses in future studies. Results support the need of controlling exposure from traffic pollution, even if knowledge is not complete.","['Magnani, Corrado', 'Ranucci, Alessandra', 'Badaloni, Chiara', 'Cesaroni, Giulia', 'Ferrante, Daniela', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Mattioli, Stefano', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Bisanti, Luigi', 'Zambon, Paola', 'Cannizzaro, Santina', 'Michelozzi, Paola', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Celentano, Egidio', 'Assennato, Giorgio', 'Merlo, Domenico Franco', 'Mosciatti, Paola', 'Minelli, Liliana', 'Cuttini, Marina', 'Torregrossa, Maria Valeria', 'Lagorio, Susanna', 'Haupt, Riccardo', 'Forastiere, Francesco']","['Magnani C', 'Ranucci A', 'Badaloni C', 'Cesaroni G', 'Ferrante D', 'Miligi L', 'Mattioli S', 'Rondelli R', 'Bisanti L', 'Zambon P', 'Cannizzaro S', 'Michelozzi P', 'Cocco P', 'Celentano E', 'Assennato G', 'Merlo DF', 'Mosciatti P', 'Minelli L', 'Cuttini M', 'Torregrossa MV', 'Lagorio S', 'Haupt R', 'Forastiere F']","['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Department of Translational Medicine, CPO Piedmont and University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.

Case-Control Study.,684-693,S0188-4409(16)30223-5 [pii] 10.1016/j.arcmed.2016.12.006 [doi],"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Occupational exposure of parents to carcinogens is of great interest in the etiology of leukemias. Evidence of the impact of such exposure on infants or small children is scarce. Here we estimated whether occupational exposure of parents to carcinogens could be a risk factor for leukemias in their children. METHODS: Cases of acute leukemia (AL) in infants </=24 months old diagnosed in Mexico City (1998-2013) were included in a population-based, case-control study. Each of the 195 cases was matched with at least one healthy child (n = 369). For each of four exposure windows studied, the degree of exposure to carcinogens was determined for both parents by using a validated occupational exposure index. An unconditional logistic regression was carried out. RESULTS: Odds ratios (OR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the overall occupational exposure for parents during the four exposure windows indicated no association with risk of AL in their children. Pre-conception, the OR by the father 0.77 (0.49-1.21), by the mother 1.03 (0.50-2.11); during pregnancy, father 0.66 (0.38-1.15), mother 1.79 (0.46-6.90); during breastfeeding, father 0.75 (0.43-1.30), mother 0.96 (0.21-4.30); and after birth, father 0.74 (0.45-1.22), mother 0.90 (0.24-3.32). The statistical power of the sample size to identify an OR >/=2 and an exposure of >/=10% among controls was 78%. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the idea that parents' occupational exposure during any of the periods studied was not a risk factor contributing to the etiology of AL in infants </=24 months of age.","['Perez-Saldivar, Maria Luisa', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez, Arturo', 'Sierra-Ramirez, Jose Alfredo', 'Nunez-Villegas, Nancy', 'Perez-Lorenzana, Hector', 'Dorantes-Acosta, Elisa Maria', 'Roman-Zepeda, Pedro Francisco', 'Rodriguez-Zepeda, Maria Del Carmen', 'Gonzalez-Ulivarri, Juana Esther', 'Lopez-Santiago, Norma', 'Martinez-Silva, Sofia Irene', 'Paredes-Aguilera, Rogelio', 'Velazquez-Avina, Martha Margarita', 'Flores-Lujano, Janet', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Nunez-Enriquez, Juan Carlos', 'Bekker-Mendez, Vilma Carolina', 'Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel']","['Perez-Saldivar ML', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez A', 'Sierra-Ramirez JA', 'Nunez-Villegas N', 'Perez-Lorenzana H', 'Dorantes-Acosta EM', 'Roman-Zepeda PF', 'Rodriguez-Zepeda MDC', 'Gonzalez-Ulivarri JE', 'Lopez-Santiago N', 'Martinez-Silva SI', 'Paredes-Aguilera R', 'Velazquez-Avina MM', 'Flores-Lujano J', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Nunez-Enriquez JC', 'Bekker-Mendez VC', 'Mejia-Arangure JM']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad (UMAE) Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional (CMN) ""Siglo XXI"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS); Seccion de Estudios de Posgrado, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politecnico Nacional.

Ras mutations were previously associated with environmental exposures in leukemias as well as in many other cancer types. This study examined whether Ras mutation could define a unique etiologic group of childhood ALL associated with tobacco smoke, a well-established mutagen and carcinogen. METHODS: We included 670 children with ALL enrolled in a case-control study in California (1995-2013), including 50.6% Latinos. Parental and child exposure to tobacco smoke was obtained from interviews. Sanger sequencing was used to detect the common KRAS and NRAS hotspot mutations in diagnostic bone marrow DNA. ALL cases were also characterized for common chromosome abnormalities. In case-case analyses, logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios to describe the association between tobacco smoke exposure and childhood ALL with Ras mutations. RESULTS: KRAS or NRAS mutations were detected in approximately 18% of children diagnosed with ALL. Ras mutations were more common among Latino cases compared with non-Latino whites and in high-hyperdiploid ALL. No associations were observed between parental smoking or child's passive exposure to smoke and Ras positive ALL. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent lack of association between tobacco smoke and Ras mutation in childhood ALL suggests that Ras mutations do not specifically define a tobacco-related etiologic pathway. Reasons for racial and ethnic differences in ALL are not well understood and could reflect differences in etiology that warrant further examination.","['Kaur, Maneet', 'de Smith, Adam J', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Cunningham, Marc', 'Kang, Michelle W', 'Hansen, Helen M', 'Cooper, Robert M', 'McKean-Cowdin, Roberta', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Metayer, Catherine']","['Kaur M', 'de Smith AJ', 'Selvin S', 'Zhang L', 'Cunningham M', 'Kang MW', 'Hansen HM', 'Cooper RM', 'McKean-Cowdin R', 'Wiemels JL', 'Metayer C']","['Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Divison of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California; Department of Neurological Surgery, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California.

There is scarce information on protocols and results of therapy from low-middle income countries (LMIC). We documented the results of treating children with ALL with two protocols in consecutive 5-year periods at a reference center in northeast Mexico. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children </=16 years of age diagnosed with ALL treated with two protocols were studied. Each protocol was used for 5 years; 246 children, 112 in protocol 1 and 134 in protocol 2, were included. Protocols were BFM-inspired and adapted from several regimens; protocol 2 was intended to decrease toxicity and need for hospitalization. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: In protocol 1, 103 patients (91.96%) achieved complete remission compared to 106 (79.10%) in protocol 2 (p = 0.001). The 5-year OS was 67.1% for protocol 1 vs. 55.5% for protocol 2, whereas EFS was 58.2% vs. 36.9%, respectively. Relapse occurred in 45 patients (40.17%) in protocol 1 vs. 42 (31.34%) in protocol 2 (p = 0.181). OS 1 year after relapse was 52.4% vs. 57.1%, respectively. No difference in relapse rate was documented. CONCLUSIONS: No improvement in survival rates of children with ALL from a low-income group living in a LMIC was achieved over a decade. Implementation of contemporary protocols with a high success rate is mandatory.","['Jaime-Perez, Jose C', 'Lopez-Razo, Olga Nidia', 'Garcia-Arellano, Gisela', 'Pinzon-Uresti, Monica Andrea', 'Jimenez-Castillo, Raul A', 'Gonzalez-Llano, Oscar', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Lopez-Razo ON', 'Garcia-Arellano G', 'Pinzon-Uresti MA', 'Jimenez-Castillo RA', 'Gonzalez-Llano O', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']","['Departamento de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez, Facultad de Medicina, de la, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.

In Brazil, very little is known about the frequency of AML subgroups, although c-AML accounts for about 18% of leukemias. We carried out this study to investigate the contribution of type I and II gene mutations in the probability of overall survival (pOS) of c-AML in Brazil. METHODS: Seven hundred and three de novo pediatric AML cases (2000-2015) were assessed throughout a multicentric network study. Mutations in hotspot regions of FLT3, NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, and c-KIT genes were analyzed as well as fusion genes (RUNX1-RUNX1T1, MLL/KMT2A-r, CBFbeta-MYH11, and PML-RARalpha) associated with AML. Patients were treated out of the clinical trial although following the BFM-AML2004 protocol. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was treated differently. AML with Down syndrome was excluded. RESULTS: There were significant differences in gene mutations among age ranges (</=2 years-old; >2-10 years old and >/=11 years old) and the nonrandom association between type I/II mutations. Lower white blood cell count (</=50 x 10(9)/L) was associated with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, whereas higher WBC with CBFbeta-MYH11 (p <0.05). Cumulative pOS in 5 years was 37.7 +/- 2.8% for total AMLs and 59.8 +/- 6.2% for APL (p = 0.03). pOS differences were observed between Brazilian regions. The South-Southeast regions had a better 5-year pOS, whereas the Midwest region presented the poorest pOS (23.7 +/- 4.9%). PTPN11 mutations conferred an adverse prognosis as an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of genetic subgroups contributes to the molecular epidemiology and biology of AML worldwide, reflecting the profile of pediatric AML cases in Brazil.","['Andrade, Francianne Gomes', 'Noronha, Elda Pereira', 'Brisson, Gisele Dallapicola', 'Dos Santos Vicente Bueno, Filipe', 'Cezar, Ingrid Sardou', 'Terra-Granado, Eugenia', 'Thuler, Luiz Claudio Santos', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['Andrade FG', 'Noronha EP', 'Brisson GD', 'Dos Santos Vicente Bueno F', 'Cezar IS', 'Terra-Granado E', 'Thuler LCS', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Clinical Research Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Mexican patients have high mortality rates, low frequency of good prognosis biomarkers (i.e., ETV6-RUNX1) and a high proportion is classified at the time of diagnosis with a high risk to relapse according to clinical features. In addition, very early relapses are more frequently observed than in other populations. The aim of the study was to identify new potential biomarkers associated with very early relapse in Mexican ALL children through transcriptome analysis. METHODS: Microarray gene expression profiling on bone marrow samples of 54 pediatric ALL patients, collected at time of diagnosis and/or at relapse, was performed. Eleven patients presented relapse within the first 18 months after diagnosis. Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (HTA 2.0) was used to perform gene expression analysis. Annotation and functional enrichment analyses were carried out using Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tools. RESULTS: BLVRB, ZCCHC7, PAX5, EBF1, TMOD1 and BLNK were differentially expressed (fold-change >2.0 and p value <0.01) between relapsed and non-relapsed patients. Functional analysis of abnormally expressed genes revealed their important role in cellular processes related to the development of hematological diseases, cancer, cell death and survival and in cell-to-cell signaling interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support previous findings showing the relevance of PAX5, EBF1 and ZCCHC7 as potential biomarkers to identify a subgroup of ALL children in high risk to relapse.","['Nunez-Enriquez, Juan Carlos', 'Barcenas-Lopez, Diego Alberto', 'Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Bekker-Mendez, Vilma Carolina', 'Flores-Lujano, Janet', 'Solis-Labastida, Karina Anastacia', 'Martinez-Morales, Gabriela Bibiana', 'Sanchez-Munoz, Fausto', 'Espinoza-Hernandez, Laura Eugenia', 'Velazquez-Avina, Martha Margarita', 'Merino-Pasaye, Laura Elizabeth', 'Garcia Velazquez, Alejandra Jimena', 'Perez-Saldivar, Maria Luisa', 'Mojica-Espinoza, Raul', 'Ramirez-Bello, Julian', 'Jimenez-Morales, Silvia', 'Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel']","['Nunez-Enriquez JC', 'Barcenas-Lopez DA', 'Hidalgo-Miranda A', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Bekker-Mendez VC', 'Flores-Lujano J', 'Solis-Labastida KA', 'Martinez-Morales GB', 'Sanchez-Munoz F', 'Espinoza-Hernandez LE', 'Velazquez-Avina MM', 'Merino-Pasaye LE', 'Garcia Velazquez AJ', 'Perez-Saldivar ML', 'Mojica-Espinoza R', 'Ramirez-Bello J', 'Jimenez-Morales S', 'Mejia-Arangure JM']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, UMAE Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional (CMN) ""Siglo XXI"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genomica del Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica (INMEGEN), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genomica del Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica (INMEGEN), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia Pediatrica, Hospital General ""Gaudencio Gonzalez Garza"", Centro Medico Nacional (CMN) ""La Raza"", IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunologia e Infectologia, Hospital de Infectologia ""Dr. Daniel Mendez Hernandez"", ""La Raza"", IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, UMAE Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional (CMN) ""Siglo XXI"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia Pediatrica, UMAE Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional (CMN) ""Siglo XXI"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, UMAE Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional (CMN) ""Siglo XXI"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Inmunologia, Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia ""Ignacio Chavez"" (INCICh), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia Pediatrica, Hospital General ""Gaudencio Gonzalez Garza"", Centro Medico Nacional (CMN) ""La Raza"", IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Onco-Pediatria, Hospital Juarez de Mexico, Secretaria de Salud (SSa), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia Pediatrica, Centro Medico Nacional (CMN) ""20 de Noviembre"", Instituto de Seguridad Social al Servicio de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Oncologia, Hospital Pediatrico de Moctezuma, Secretaria de Salud del D.F., Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, UMAE Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional (CMN) ""Siglo XXI"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Genotipificacion y Analisis de Expresion, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion de Enfermedades Metabolicas y Endocrinas, Hospital Juarez de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Genomica del Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica (INMEGEN), Mexico City, Mexico.

The dominance of leukemic cells over normal progenitors may result in either direct suppression of functional hematopoiesis or remodeling of microenvironmental niches, contributing to BM failure and AL-associated mortality. We undertook this study to investigate the contents and functional activity of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) and their relationship to immune cell production and risk status in AL pediatric patients. METHODS: Multiparametric flow cytometry of BM aspirates was performed to classify AL on the basis of lineage and differentiation stages and to analyze HSPC and immune cell frequencies. Controlled co-culture systems were conducted to evaluate functional lineage potentials of primitive cells. Statistical correlations and inter-group significant differences were established. RESULTS: Among 113 AL BM aspirates, 26.5% corresponded to ProB, 19.5% to PreB and 32% contain ProB and PreB differentiation stages, whereas nearly 9% of the cases were T- and 13% myeloid-lineage leukemias. We identified ProB-ALL as the subtype endowed with the highest relative contents of HSPC, whereas T-ALL and PreB-ALL showed a critically reduced size of both HSC and MLP compartments. Notably, lower cell frequencies of HSPC in ProB-ALL correlated to high-risk prognosis at disease debut. CONCLUSIONS: HSPC abundance at initial diagnosis may aid to predict the clinical course of ALL and to identify high-risk patients. A clearer understanding of their population dynamics and functional properties in the leukemia setting will potentially pave the way for targeted therapies.","['Balandran, Juan Carlos', 'Vadillo, Eduardo', 'Dozal, David', 'Reyes-Lopez, Alfonso', 'Sandoval-Cabrera, Antonio', 'Laffont-Ortiz, Merle Denisse', 'Prieto-Chavez, Jessica L', 'Vilchis-Ordonez, Armando', 'Quintela-Nunez Del Prado, Henry', 'Mayani, Hector', 'Nunez-Enriquez, Juan Carlos', 'Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel', 'Lopez-Martinez, Briceida', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Pelayo, Rosana']","['Balandran JC', 'Vadillo E', 'Dozal D', 'Reyes-Lopez A', 'Sandoval-Cabrera A', 'Laffont-Ortiz MD', 'Prieto-Chavez JL', 'Vilchis-Ordonez A', 'Quintela-Nunez Del Prado H', 'Mayani H', 'Nunez-Enriquez JC', 'Mejia-Arangure JM', 'Lopez-Martinez B', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Pelayo R']","['Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico; Departamento de Biomedicina Molecular, CINVESTAV, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico; Departamento de Biomedicina Molecular, CINVESTAV, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Hospital para el Nino, Instituto Materno Infantil del Estado de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Hospital Infantil de Mexico ""Federico Gomez"", Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Hospital para el Nino, Instituto Materno Infantil del Estado de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Hospital para el Nino, Instituto Materno Infantil del Estado de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en, Hospital de Especialidades, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Hospital Infantil de Mexico ""Federico Gomez"", Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, ""Dr. Victorio de la Fuente Narvaez"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Epidemiologia de Investigacion Clinica Hospital de Pediatria, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Epidemiologia de Investigacion Clinica Hospital de Pediatria, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Hospital Infantil de Mexico ""Federico Gomez"", Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Hospital Pediatrico Moctezuma, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.

Multiples studies have shown that ALL seems to be originated by an interaction between environmental and genetic susceptibility factors. The ARID5B polymorphisms are among the most reproducible ALL associated-risk alleles in different populations. The aim of the present study was to examine the contribution of ARID5B, CEBPE, and PIP4K2 risk alleles for the development of ALL in children from Mexico City and Yucatan, Mexico. METHODS: A study was conducted with a total of 761 unrelated subjects. Two hundred eighty five ALL cases (111 from Yucatan and 174 from Mexico City) and 476 healthy subjects. Genotyping included the rs7088318 (PIP4K2A), rs10821936 (ARID5B), rs7089424 (ARID5B) and rs2239633 (CEBPE) polymorphisms. RESULTS: Associations between ALL and rs10821936 and rs7089424 ARID5B SNPs were found (OR = 1.9, 95% CI (1.5-2.4) and OR = 2.0, 95% CI (1.6-2.5), respectively). Moreover, a higher risk was observed in the homozygous risk genotypes of carriers from Mexico City (OR = 3.1, 95% CI (2.0-4.9) and OR 3.1, CI 95% (2.0-4.8), respectively). Otherwise, the rs7088318 (PIP4K2A) and rs2239633 (CEBPE) polymorphisms were not associated with ALL risk.

Genotyping of the rs1800462, rs1800460 and rs1142345 SNPs was performed by 5'exonuclease technique using TaqMan probes (Life Technologies Foster City, CA). RESULTS: The mutant TPMT alleles were present in 4.8% (81/1698 chromosomes) and only 0.2% were homozygote TPMT*3A/TPMT*3A. We did not find statistically significant differences in the distribution of the mutant alleles between patients from Mexico City and Yucatan in either ALL cases or non-ALL. Nonetheless, the TPMT*3C frequency in ALL patients was higher than non-ALL subjects (p = 0.03). To note, the null homozygous TPMT*3A/TPMT*3A genotype was found in 2.5% of the non-ALL subjects. CONCLUSIONS: TPMT mutant alleles did not exhibit differential distribution between both evaluated populations; however, TPMT*3C is overrepresented in ALL cases in comparison with non-ALL group. Assessing the TPMT mutant alleles could benefit the ALL children and those undergoing 6-MP and MX treatment.","['Jimenez-Morales, Silvia', 'Ramirez-Florencio, Mireya', 'Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel', 'Nunez-Enriquez, Juan Carlos', 'Bekker-Mendez, Carolina', 'Torres-Escalante, Jose Luis', 'Flores-Lujano, Janet', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Del Carmen Rodriguez-Zepeda, Maria', 'Leal, Yelda A', 'Gonzalez-Montalvo, Pablo Miguel', 'Pantoja-Guillen, Francisco', 'Penaloza-Gonzalez, Jose Gabriel', 'Gutierrez-Juarez, Erick Israel', 'Nunez-Villegas, Nora Nancy', 'Perez-Saldivar, Maria Luisa', 'Guerra-Castillo, Francisco Xavier', 'Flores-Villegas, Luz Victoria', 'Ramos-Cervantes, Maria Teresa', 'Fragoso, Jose Manuel', 'Garcia-Escalante, Maria Guadalupe', 'Del Carmen Pinto-Escalante, Doris', 'Ramirez-Bello, Julian', 'Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo']","['Jimenez-Morales S', 'Ramirez-Florencio M', 'Mejia-Arangure JM', 'Nunez-Enriquez JC', 'Bekker-Mendez C', 'Torres-Escalante JL', 'Flores-Lujano J', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Del Carmen Rodriguez-Zepeda M', 'Leal YA', 'Gonzalez-Montalvo PM', 'Pantoja-Guillen F', 'Penaloza-Gonzalez JG', 'Gutierrez-Juarez EI', 'Nunez-Villegas NN', 'Perez-Saldivar ML', 'Guerra-Castillo FX', 'Flores-Villegas LV', 'Ramos-Cervantes MT', 'Fragoso JM', 'Garcia-Escalante MG', 'Del Carmen Pinto-Escalante D', 'Ramirez-Bello J', 'Hidalgo-Miranda A']","['Laboratorio de Genomica del Cancer, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica, Mexico City, Mexico.

However, only a few causes have been established so far, mainly some genetic syndromes and high doses of ionizing radiation. Major efforts have been undertaken to study the relationship between environmental factors and the risk of childhood leukemia, inspired by geographical variation in incidence rates. Some evidence has emerged for parental occupational exposures to pesticides, whereas there is less evidence for an association with postnatal pesticide exposure. Diagnostic radiation and radon exposure have been suggested but there remains a lack of convincing studies. Extremely low-frequency magnetic fields consistently showed a small increase in risk in numerous studies, but bias and confounding cannot be ruled out as possible explanations. From among factors other than environmental and radiation-related, the most promising candidate is abnormal patterns to common infections, but which children are most at risk and the pathways are not fully understood. In conclusion, although childhood leukemia shows some distinct incidence patterns by sex, age, and geography suggesting a role of the environment in its etiology, no major environmental risk factors including radiation have been established as major contributors to the global childhood leukemia burden. Due to the young age at diagnosis and evidence of chromosomal damage before birth in many of the affected children, parental exposures remain of high interest. Although cure rates of childhood leukemia are high in economically developed countries, because of the adverse late effects of the disease and its treatment, identification of modifiable risk factors for implementing primary prevention remains the ultimate goal.","['Schuz, Joachim', 'Erdmann, Friederike']","['Schuz J', 'Erdmann F']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Section of Environment and Radiation, Lyon, France.

Initiating somatic mutations detected in dried neonatal blood spots (DNBS) and in cord blood samples of affected children with leukemia have been proven to be acquired prenatally. However, to date, few epidemiological studies have been carried out exploring EAL that include infants and children 13-24 months of age at the diagnosis. Maternal exposure to transplacental DNA-damaging substances during pregnancy has been suggested to be a risk factor for EAL. Most cases of infants with acute lymphoblastic (i-ALL) or myeloid leukemia (i-AML) have KMT2A gene rearrangements (KMT2A-r), which disturb its essential role as an epigenetic regulator of hematopoiesis. Due to the short latency period for EAL and the fact that KMT2A-r resembles those found in secondary AML, exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors has been associated with transplacental risk as proxi for causality. EAL studies have been conducted in Brazil for over two decades, combining observational epidemiology, leukemia biology, and clinical data. EAL was investigated considering (i) age strata (infants vs. 13-24 months-old); (ii) somatic mutations associated with i-ALL and i-AML; (iii) ethnic-geographic variations; (iv) contribution of maternal genotypes; and (v) time latency of exposures and mutations in DNBS. Interactions of acquired and constitutive gene mutations are challenging tools to test risk factor associations for EAL. In this review we summarize the EAL scenario (including B-cell precursor-ALL, T-ALL, and AML) results combining environmental and genetic susceptibility risk factors and we raise questions that should be considered for further action.","['Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Andrade, Francianne Gomes']","['Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Andrade FG']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Research Program, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

In this study, the histology thoracic scars caused by the placement of an implantable central venous access device in children who underwent treatment for cancer was assessed. METHOD: The amount and type of collagen, the collagen orientation, the type of elastic fibres, the vascularsation, and the count of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes were analysed. The severity of scarring was assessed using the Vancouver scar scale (VSS). To evaluate the role of the immune system on scar severity and histology, the scars of children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were compared with the scars of children suffering from other types of childhood cancer. RESULTS: Our results showed an extremely random orientation of the collagen fibres of the paediatric scars with a mean collagen orientation index of 0.22 (standard deviation (SD) 0.10, zero indicating a perfectly random orientation and a perfectly parallel orientation). A lower collagen orientation index was seen in scars with a lower VSS score (VSS score <3: 0.19 versus VSS score >/=3 0.29, p=0.037). A higher total VSS score, resembling a worse scar, was assessed to the scars in the non-ALL group compared with the children with ALL (mean ALL: 0.91 (0-3) versus mean non-ALL: 2.50 (0-6), p=0.037). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating a wide array of histological aspects in paediatric scars. Compared with adult scars, an extremely random collagen orientation was found (0.22 in children versus 0.41 and 0.46 adult normotrophic and hypertrophic scars, respectively). A lower collagen orientation index was found in scars with a lower VSS score. In addition, less severe scarring was measured in children suffering from ALL compared with children suffering from other types of childhood cancer. This suggests that the immune system could play a role in the development of aberrant scarring and should be a target for future research.","['Westra, I', 'Verhaegen, P D H M', 'Ibrahim Korkmaz, H', 'Braam, K I', 'Kaspers, G J L', 'Niessen, H W M', 'Niessen, F B']","['Westra I', 'Verhaegen PDHM', 'Ibrahim Korkmaz H', 'Braam KI', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Niessen HWM', 'Niessen FB']","['Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Hand Surgery, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Hand Surgery, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Institute for Cardiovascular Research of the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam (ICaR-VU), VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Institute for Cardiovascular Research of the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam (ICaR-VU), VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Hand Surgery, VU Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Wound Care,Journal of wound care,9417080,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'histology', 'hypertrophic', 'immune system', 'paediatric', 'scar']",,2017/05/06 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.12968/jowc.2017.26.5.256 [doi]'],ppublish,J Wound Care. 2017 May 2;26(5):256-265. doi: 10.12968/jowc.2017.26.5.256.,,20170711,,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Collagen Type II)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cicatrix/complications/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Collagen/*metabolism', 'Collagen Type I/metabolism', 'Collagen Type II/metabolism', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Elastic Tissue/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/immunology', '*Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Neutrophils/immunology/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A growing experience is being developed to enhance the detection of small amounts of AML, or minimal residual disease (MRD). Areas covered: Available techniques include multi-color flow cytometry (MFC) of leukemia associated immunophenotypes (LAIP), quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) for detecting fusion and mutated genes (RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, and NPM1), overexpression of genes such as WT1, and next generation sequencing (NGS) for MRD. Expert commentary: While MRD monitoring is standard of care in some leukemia subsets such as acute promyelocytic leukemia, this approach for the broader AML population does not universally predict outcomes as some patients may experience relapse in the setting of undetectable leukemia while others show no obvious disease progression despite MRD positivity. However, there are instances where MRD can identify patients at increased risk for relapse that may change recommended therapy. Currently, prospective investigations to define clinically relevant MRD thresholds are ongoing. Risk-adapted trials are needed to best define the use of MRD in the follow up of AML patients after initial induction therapy.","['Tomlinson, Benjamin', 'Lazarus, Hillard M']","['Tomlinson B', 'Lazarus HM']","['a Department of Medicine , University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center , Cleveland , OH , USA.', 'a Department of Medicine , University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center , Cleveland , OH , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170512,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*NPM1', '*WT1', '*core binding factor leukemia', '*minimal residual disease', '*multi-color flow cytometry', '*quantitative PCR']",,2017/05/06 06:00,2017/06/10 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2017.1326811 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2017 Jun;10(6):563-574. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2017.1326811.

MRD in B-ALL has been standardized by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) in North America, but not routine clinical labs. The Foundation for National Institutes of Health sought to harmonize MRD measurement among COG, oncology groups, academic, community and government, laboratories. METHODS: Listmode data from post-induction marrows were distributed from a reference lab to seven different clinical FCM labs with variable experience in B-ALL MRD. Labs were provided with the COG protocol. Files from 15 cases were distributed to the seven labs. Educational sessions were implemented, and 10 more listmode file cases analyzed. RESULTS: Among 105 initial challenges, the overall discordance rate was 26%. In the final round, performance improved considerably; out of 70 challenges, there were five false positives and one false negative (9% discordance), and no quantitative discordance. Four of six deviations occurred in a single lab. Three samples with hematogones were still misclassified as MRD. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the provision of the COG standardized analysis protocol, even experienced laboratories require an educational component for B-ALL MRD analysis by FCM. Recognition of hematogones remains challenging for some labs when using the COG protocol. The results from this study suggest that dissemination of MRD testing to other North American laboratories as part of routine clinical management of B-ALL is possible but requires additional educational components to complement standardized methodology.

METHOD: In a multi-centre prospective study, parents reported their child's generic and disease-specific HRQoL and their own care-giving burden at five time points. From 1,428 eligible patients, 874 parents completed questionnaires at least once during treatment. RESULTS: At each time point, generic HRQoL was significantly lower than equivalent norm scores for healthy children. HRQoL decreased significantly at the start of treatment, before recovering gradually (but remained below pre-treatment levels). Parents reported that older children worried more about side effects and their appearance, but showed less procedural anxiety than younger children. Concern for appearance was greater among girls than boys. Compared to Regimen B (i.e. additional doxorubicin during induction and additional cyclophosphamide and cytarabine during consolidation chemotherapy), patients receiving Regimen A had fewer problems with pain and nausea. There were no statistically significant differences in HRQoL by number of DI blocks received. INTERPRETATION: HRQoL is compromised at all stages of treatment, and is partly dependent on age. The findings increase understanding of the impact of therapy on children's HRQoL and parental care-giving burden, and will contribute to the design of future trials.","['Eiser, C', 'Stride, C B', 'Vora, A', 'Goulden, N', 'Mitchell, C', 'Buck, G', 'Adams, M', 'Jenney, M E M']","['Eiser C', 'Stride CB', 'Vora A', 'Goulden N', 'Mitchell C', 'Buck G', 'Adams M', 'Jenney MEM']","['Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'Department of statistics, Management School, Conduit Road, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Paediatric Haematology, Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Western Bank, Sheffield, United Kingdom."", 'Department of paediatric haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Clinical Trial Service Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Children's Hospital for Wales, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Children's Hospital for Wales, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20170505,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukaemia', 'paediatric oncology', 'quality of life']",,2017/05/06 06:00,2017/11/01 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26615 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Nov;64(11). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26615.

It has been confirmed that SOX6 is a tumor suppressor and downregulated in various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and chronic myeloid leukemia. Netrin-1 is highly expressed in various human cancers and acts as an anti-apoptotic and proangiogenic factor to drive tumorigenesis. The role of SOX6 and netrin-1 in regulating the growth of ovarian tumor cells still remains unclear. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to determine the SOX6 messenger RNA and protein levels, respectively, in ovarian cancer cells and tumor tissues. Stable transfection of SOX6 was conducted to overexpress SOX6 in PA-1 and SW626 cells. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Invasion of ovarian cancer cells and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were confirmed by Transwell assays. To overexpress netrin-1, ovarian cancer cells with SOX6 restoration was transduced with netrin-1 lentiviral particles. PA-1 xenografts in a nude mice model were used to conduct in vivo evaluation of the role of SOX6 and its relationship with netrin-1 in tumor growth and angiogenesis. In this study, we found significantly reduced SOX6 levels in PA-1, SW626, SK-OV-3, and CaoV-3 ovarian cancer cell lines and human tumor tissues in comparison with normal human ovarian epithelial cells or matched non-tumor tissues. SOX6 overexpression by stable transfection dramatically inhibited proliferation and invasion of PA-1 and SW626 cells. Also, conditioned medium from PA-1 and SW626 cells with SOX6 restoration exhibited reduced ability to induce human umbilical vein endothelial cells migration and tube formation compared with conditioned medium from the cells with transfection control. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between SOX6 and netrin-1 expression was observed in PA-1 and SW626 cells. Overexpression of netrin-1 in ovarian cancer cells with forced SOX6 expression remarkably abrogated the inhibitory effect of SOX6 on proliferation, invasion of the cells, and tumor xenograft growth and vascularity in vivo. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration and tube formation were enhanced in the conditioned medium from the ovarian cancer cells transduced with netrin-1 lentivirus particles. Our observations revealed that SOX6 is a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer cells, and SOX6 exerts an inhibitory effect on the proliferation, invasion, and tumor cell-induced angiogenesis of ovarian cancer cells, whereas nerin-1 plays an opposite role and its expression is inversely correlated with SOX6. Moreover, our findings suggest a new role of SOX6 and netrin-1 for understanding the progression of ovarian cancer and have the potential for the development of new diagnosis and treatment strategies for ovarian cancer.","['Li, Yi', 'Xiao, Ming', 'Guo, Fangchun']","['Li Y', 'Xiao M', 'Guo F']","[""1 Department of Gynecology, The Second People's Hospital of Liaocheng City, Linqing, P.R.

However, a significant proportion of imatinib-treated patients relapse due to occurrence of mutations in the ABL kinase domain. Although inhibitor sensitivity for a set of mutations was reported, the role of less frequent ABL kinase mutations in drug sensitivity/resistance is not known. Moreover, recent reports indicate distinct resistance profiles for second-generation ABL inhibitors. We thus employed a computational approach to predict drug sensitivity of 234 point mutations that were reported in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Initial validation analysis of our approach using a panel of previously studied frequent mutations indicated that the computational data generated in this study correlated well with the published experimental/clinical data. In addition, we present drug sensitivity profiles for remaining point mutations by computational docking analysis using imatinib as well as next generation ABL inhibitors nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, axitinib, and ponatinib.

Pediatric meningiomas behave very differently from their adult counterparts, tending to have more malignant histological subtypes and recur more frequently. The authors of this paper investigate the risk factors, pathological subtypes, and recurrence rates of pediatric meningiomas. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted at the University of Iowa to identify patients 20 years old and younger with meningiomas in the period from 1948 to 2015. RESULTS Sixty-seven meningiomas in 39 patients were identified. Eight patients had neurofibromatosis, 2 had a family history of meningioma, and 3 had prior radiation exposure. Twelve (31%) of the 39 patients had WHO Grade II or III lesions, and 15 (38%) had recurrent lesions after resection.

Unfortunately, the extensive application of this chemotherapeutic agent has been limited due to its adverse effects such as cardiotoxicity. Ellagic acid, as a phenolic compound, has shown to exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and antiatherogenic properties. It is also capable of protecting against drug toxicity. In this study, we evaluated whether ellagic acid can protect against As2O3-induced heart injury in rats. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four treatment groups, that is, control (0.2 mL of normal saline, intraperitoneally (ip)), As2O3 (5 mg/kg, ip), As2O3 plus ellagic acid, and ellagic acid (30 mg/kg, orally) groups. The drugs were administered daily for 10 days and pretreatment with ellagic acid was performed 1 h prior to As2O3 injection. Cardiotoxicity was characterized by electrocardiological, biochemical, and histopathological evaluations. Our results showed that ellagic acid pretreatment significantly ameliorated As2O3-induced increase in glutathione peroxidase activity and malondialdehyde concentration ( p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively) and also diminished QTc prolongation ( p < 0.0001) and cardiac tissue damages. Pretreatment with ellagic acid also lowered the increased troponin I ( p < 0.0001) and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB ( p < 0.01) levels in response to As2O3. In conclusion, results of this study demonstrated that ellagic acid has beneficial cardioprotective effects against As2O3 toxicity. It is suggested that the protective effects were mediated by antioxidant properties of ellagic acid.","['Hemmati, A A', 'Olapour, S', 'Varzi, H Najafzadeh', 'Khodayar, M J', 'Dianat, M', 'Mohammadian, B', 'Yaghooti, H']","['Hemmati AA', 'Olapour S', 'Varzi HN', 'Khodayar MJ', 'Dianat M', 'Mohammadian B', 'Yaghooti H']","['1 Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', '2 Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Health Research Institute, Diabetes Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', '3 Department of Pharmacology, School of Veterinary Medicine, Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran.', '4 Department of Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', '5 Physiology Research Center and Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', '6 Department of Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, Shahid Chamram University, Ahvaz, Iran.', '7 Hyperlipidemia Research Center, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170505,England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ellagic acid', 'arsenic trioxide', 'cardiotoxicity', 'rat']",,2017/05/06 06:00,2018/09/18 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0960327117701986 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2018 Apr;37(4):412-419. doi: 10.1177/0960327117701986.

Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) can be effective in these patients but responses are usually short-lived. The majority of patients will either have stable disease or progress through therapy. We hereby describe the outcome of these patients at our institution after they fail HMAs. The data on 56 AML patients at Mayo Clinic, Rochester were reviewed. Patients were considered for our study if they received HMA as frontline therapy for their AML. Out of 56 patients, 15 (27%) patients received azacitidine (AZA) and 41 (73%) received decitabine. Complete remission was found in 10 (18%), with overall response of 28% and median response duration of 10 months. Thirteen (81%) out of 16 responders relapsed. Therefore 53 patients were included in the primary or secondary failure analysis with a median overall survival (OS) of 2 months after the date of failure. Out of 53 patients, 12 (23%) received subsequent treatments. None of the 12 patients who got first salvage therapy achieved remission. Five out of the 12 patients received second salvage therapy, 2 (40%) of which achieved CR. Median OS for patients who received subsequent salvage therapies was better than those who did not receive any subsequent therapy after failing HMA (9.5 vs. 2 months, P = .0009). Outcome for patients who have primary or secondary failure is very poor. Our study provides important historical data for future novel therapies, which are sorely needed for these patients.","['Nanah, Rama', 'McCullough, Kristen', 'Hogan, William', 'Begna, Kebede', 'Patnaik, Mrinal', 'Elliott, Michelle', 'Litzow, Mark', 'Al-Kali, Aref']","['Nanah R', 'McCullough K', 'Hogan W', 'Begna K', 'Patnaik M', 'Elliott M', 'Litzow M', 'Al-Kali A']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Mayo Clinic, Hospital Pharmacy Services, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170605,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,,2017/05/06 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2017/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24780 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Sep;92(9):866-871. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24780.

We previously described an innate lymphocyte population in the intestinal epithelium (referred to as innate CD8alphaalpha(+) , or iCD8alpha cells) that can protect against gastrointestinal infections such as those mediated by Citrobacter rodentium. METHODS: Here, we have evaluated the potential contribution of these cells to intestinal inflammation by analyzing inflammation development in mice with decreased numbers of iCD8alpha cells. We also determined the potential of iCD8alpha cells to secrete granzymes and their potential role during inflammatory processes. RESULTS: We found that iCD8alpha cells play a pro-inflammatory role in the development of disease in a colitis model induced by anti-CD40 antibodies. We further found that the effects of iCD8alpha cells correlated with their capacity to secrete granzymes. We also observed that the pro-inflammatory properties of iCD8alpha cells were controlled by interactions of CD8alphaalpha homodimers on these cells with the thymus leukemia antigen expressed by intestinal epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that iCD8alpha cells modulate inflammatory responses in the intestinal epithelium, and that dysregulation of iCD8alpha cells effector functions may enhance disease. We propose that one of the mechanism by which iCD8alpha cells enhance inflammation is by the secretion of granzymes, which may promote recruitment of infiltrating cells into the epithelium.","['Kumar, Aaram A', 'Delgado, Alberto G', 'Piazuelo, M Blanca', 'Van Kaer, Luc', 'Olivares-Villagomez, Danyvid']","['Kumar AA', 'Delgado AG', 'Piazuelo MB', 'Van Kaer L', 'Olivares-Villagomez D']","['Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170220,England,Immun Inflamm Dis,"Immunity, inflammation and disease",101635460,PMC5418141,['NOTNLM'],"['*Granzyme', '*innate CD8aa cells', '*intestinal inflammation', '*intraepithelial lymphocytes']",,2017/05/06 06:00,2018/11/15 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/iid3.146 [doi]'],ppublish,Immun Inflamm Dis. 2017 Jun;5(2):109-123. doi: 10.1002/iid3.146.

Therapy with exogenous TPO is limited by the formation of antibodies cross-reacting with endogenous TPO. Mimetics of TPO are compounds with no antigenic similarity to TPO. Eltrombopag is an orally-active nonpeptide small molecule that binds to the transmembrane portion of the TPO receptor MPL. Initial trials of eltrombopag have centered on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), which is due to both increased destruction and decreased production of platelets. Eltrombopag at 25-75 mg/day has been shown to be highly effective in raising the platelet count in ITP with suboptimal response to immunosuppression and splenectomy. These successful results led to the exploration of eltrombopag in other thrombocytopenic disorders. In hepatitis C viral infection, eltrombopag raises the platelet count sufficiently enough to allow treatment with ribavirin and pegylated interferon. Because MPL is expressed on hematopoietic cells, eltrombopag use in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) might enhance leukemic proliferation. Clinical trials of eltrombopag in MDS and AML, however, have shown amelioration of thrombocytopenia without promoting disease progression. In severe aplastic anemia (SAA) not responding to immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine, eltrombopag as a single agent at 150-300 mg/day results in an overall response rate of 40-70%. At high doses, adverse effects including pigmentation, gastrointestinal upset and hepatic derangement have become evident. Current studies have examined the first-line use of eltrombopag in combination with ATG in SAA. In a recent study, eltrombopag used at 150 mg/day with horse ATG resulted in an overall response rate of 90% in newly diagnosed SAA patients, with a complete response rate of about 50%. Clonal karyotypic aberrations are, however, found in 10-20% of SAA patients treated with eltrombopag. The safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in SAA require further evaluation, particularly when it is used with less intensive immunosuppression.","['Gill, Harinder', 'Wong, Raymond S M', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam']","['Gill H', 'Wong RSM', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Sir Y.K.

However, 7-20% of patients are CD5 negative. We report here a series of 19 CD5-negative B-CLL cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS We reviewed 19 consecutive CD5-negative B-CLL cases seen in our medical center from 2009 to 2015 and compared them with 105 CD5-positive B-CLL cases. The two groups were compared in terms of clinical parameters, laboratory parameters, and survival characteristics. RESULTS Lymphadenopathy was present in 31.5% of the CD5-negative group and 51.4% of the CD5-positive group (p=0.029). Splenomegaly was present in 42.1% of the CD5-negative group and 16.1% of the CD5-positive group (p=0.029). There was no difference between the groups in terms of Binet A, B, and C stages (p=0.118, p=0.051, and p=0.882, respectively). The median thrombocyte count was 144x109/L and 160x109/L in the CD5-negative and CD5-positive groups, respectively (p=0.044). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of median neutrophil count (p=0.169). The mean lymphocyte count was 43.2+/-4.0x10^9/L and 36.7+/-3.2x10^9/L in the CD5-negative and CD5-positive groups, respectively (p=0.001). There was no difference between the groups in terms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia. In five-year follow-up, 84.2% of CD5-negative patients and 90.5% of CD5-positive patients were alive (p=0.393). CONCLUSIONS We found more isolated splenomegaly, less lymphadenopathy, a higher lymphocyte count, and a lower thrombocyte count in the CD5-negative group. There was no difference between the groups in terms of clinical stage, autoimmune phenomena, hemoglobin and neutrophil count, and survival.","['Demir, Cengiz', 'Kara, Erdal', 'Ekinci, Omer', 'Ebinc, Senar']","['Demir C', 'Kara E', 'Ekinci O', 'Ebinc S']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170505,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,PMC5427937,,,,2017/05/06 06:00,2018/03/23 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['901781 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.901781 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2017 May 5;23:2137-2142. doi: 10.12659/msm.901781.,,20180322,,['0 (CD5 Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphadenopathy/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenomegaly/metabolism', 'Survival', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Turkey']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several small molecule drugs are clinically used, single drug administration is not sufficient to cure AML, which has a high molecular diversity. Metabolic homeostasis plays a key role in determining cellular fate. Appropriate levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) maintain the redox system balance, and excessive amounts of ROS cause oxidative damage, thus providing a strategy to eliminate cancer cells. CPPTL is a novel analogue of parthenolide that exhibited significant cytotoxicity to AML cells in vitro and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, CPPTL's prodrug DMA-CPPTL decreased the burden of AML engraftment and prolonged survival in a mouse model administered human primary AML cells in vivo. CPPTL induced apoptosis of AML cells by stimulating ROS production, and accumulation of ROS then activated the JNK pathway, thereby promoting mitochondrial damage. These results demonstrated that CPPTL effectively eradicated AML cells in vitro and in vivo and suggested that CPPTL may be a novel candidate for auxiliary AML therapy.","['Gao, Hui-Er', 'Sun, Yue', 'Ding, Ya-Hui', 'Long, Jing', 'Liu, Xiao-Lei', 'Yang, Ming', 'Ji, Qing', 'Li, Ying-Hui', 'Chen, Yue', 'Zhang, Quan', 'Gao, Ying-Dai']","['Gao HE', 'Sun Y', 'Ding YH', 'Long J', 'Liu XL', 'Yang M', 'Ji Q', 'Li YH', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Gao YD']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, P.

MicroRNAs have important biological functions and play critical roles in pathogenesis and prognosis in a variety of cancers including acute myeloid leukemia. Some reports have constructed risk stratification systems for adult acute myeloid leukemia patients using microRNAs to predict an optimal outcome of patients. However, little has been done in pediatric and adolescent patients. The purpose of this study is to identify a panel of microRNA signature that could predict prognosis in younger cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia patients by analyzing the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. A total of 59 cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia patients under 21 years with corresponding clinical data were enrolled in our study. Using univariate Cox's model, we found 17 miRNAs were significantly related with overall survival in pediatric and adolescent cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia patients but no clinical parameter was found significant related with overall survival. The multivariate Cox regression identified high expression of hsa-miR-146b was independent poor prognostic factor and high expression of hsa-miR-181c and hsa-miR-4786 appeared to be favorable factors. A model was proposed based on these three miRNAs. Leave-one-out Cross Validation method and Permutation Test was further used to evaluate this model. The function role of has-mir-181c was further studied by carrying out flow cytometry and cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) in U937 cell line.

Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 139 (33%) patients, ranging from 20% in those in the polycythemic phase to 90% among patients in accelerated/blast phase. Different phases harbored different abnormalities: isolated del(20q), +8 and +9 were the most common abnormalities in the polycythemic phase; del(20q) and +1q were the most common abnormalities in post-polycythemic myelofibrosis; and complex karyotypes were the most common karyotypes in accelerated and blast phases. Patients with an abnormal karyotype showed a higher frequency of disease progression, a shorter transformation-free survival and an inferior overall survival compared with patients with a normal karyotype in the same disease phase. Cytogenetics could be effectively stratified into three risk groups, low- (normal karyotype, sole +8, +9 and other single abnormality), intermediate- (sole del20q, +1q and other two abnormalities), and high-risk (complex karyotype) groups. We conclude that cytogenetic changes in polycythemia vera vary in different phases of disease, and carry different prognostic impacts.","['Tang, Guilin', 'Hidalgo Lopez, Juliana E', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Ma, Junsheng', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Zuo, Wenli', 'Carballo-Zarate, Adrian Alejandro', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Tang, Zhenya', 'Li, Shaoying', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Tang G', 'Hidalgo Lopez JE', 'Wang SA', 'Hu S', 'Ma J', 'Pierce S', 'Zuo W', 'Carballo-Zarate AA', 'Yin CC', 'Tang Z', 'Li S', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Verstovsek S', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA gtang@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170504,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC5685217,,,,2017/05/06 06:00,2018/05/08 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2017/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.165795 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.165795 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Sep;102(9):1511-1518. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.165795.

Herein we investigated whether long non-coding RNA expression is associated with clinical and molecular features, as well as outcome of younger adults (aged <60 years) with de novo cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia. Whole transcriptome profiling was performed in a training (n=263) and a validation set (n=114). Using the training set, we identified 24 long non-coding RNAs associated with event-free survival. Linear combination of the weighted expression values of these transcripts yielded a prognostic score. In the validation set, patients with high scores had shorter disease-free (P<0.001), overall (P=0.002) and event-free survival (P<0.001) than patients with low scores. In multivariable analyses, long non-coding RNA score status was an independent prognostic marker for disease-free (P=0.01) and event-free survival (P=0.002), and showed a trend for overall survival (P=0.06). Among multiple molecular alterations tested, which are prognostic in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia, only double CEBPA mutations, NPM1 mutations and FLT3-ITD associated with distinct long non-coding RNA signatures. Correlation of the long non-coding RNA scores with messenger RNA and microRNA expression identified enrichment of genes involved in lymphocyte/leukocyte activation, inflammation and apoptosis in patients with high scores. We conclude that long non-coding RNA profiling provides meaningful prognostic information in younger adults with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, expression of prognostic long non-coding RNAs associates with oncogenic molecular pathways in this disease. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: 00048958 (CALGB-8461), 00899223 (CALGB-9665), and 00900224 (CALGB-20202).","['Papaioannou, Dimitrios', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Yan, Pearlly', 'Bundschuh, Ralf', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Blum, William', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Orwick, Shelley J', 'Lucas, David M', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Papaioannou D', 'Nicolet D', 'Volinia S', 'Mrozek K', 'Yan P', 'Bundschuh R', 'Carroll AJ', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Blum W', 'Powell BL', 'Uy GL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Wang ES', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Orwick SJ', 'Lucas DM', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Stone RM', 'Byrd JC', 'Garzon R', 'Bloomfield CD']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Physics, Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Center for RNA Biology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Hofstra North Shore-Long Island Jewish School of Medicine, Lake Success, NY, USA.', 'Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA ramiro.garzon@osumc.edu clara.bloomfield@osumc.edu.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA ramiro.garzon@osumc.edu clara.bloomfield@osumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170504,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC5541873,,,,2017/05/06 06:00,2018/06/26 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2017/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2017.166215 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2017.166215 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Aug;102(8):1391-1400. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2017.166215.

A limitation of this targeted therapy is progressive disease (PD) in some patients. To define the risk factors for progression, the clinicopathological features of PD, and the outcomes for patients after venetoclax failure, we analyzed 67 heavily pretreated patients on 3 early phase clinical trials. Investigations at progression included positron emission tomography scan and biopsy. Twenty-five (37%) patients manifested PD on therapy: 17 with Richter transformation (RT) and 8 with progressive CLL/SLL. RT occurred significantly earlier (median 7.9 months) than progressive CLL (median 23.4 months) (P = .003).

This is a new exploration to analyze the reliability of the HRQOL measurement using multivariate generalizability theory (MGT). This study aimed to develop a Chinese version of the FACT-Leu scale and evaluate its reliability using MGT to provide evidence to support the revision and improvement of this scale. METHODS: The Chinese version of the FACT-Leu scale was developed by four steps: forward translation, backward translation, cultural adaptation and pilot-testing. The HRQOL was measured for eligible inpatients with leukemia using this scale to provide data. A single-facet multivariate Generalizability Study (G-study) design was demonstrated to estimate the variance-covariance components and then several Decision Studies (D-studies) with varying numbers of items were analyzed to obtain reliability coefficients and to understand how much the measurement reliability could be vary as the number of items in MGT changes. RESULTS: One-hundred and one eligible inpatients diagnosed with leukemia were recruited and completed the HRQOL measurement at the time of admission to the hospital. In the G-study, the variation component of the patient-item interaction was largest while the variation component of the item was the smallest for the four of five domains, except for the leukemia-specific (LEUS) domain. In the D-study, at the level of domain, the generalizability coefficients (G) and the indexes of dependability (capital EF, Cyrillic) for four of the five domains were approximately equal to or greater than 0.80 except for the Emotional Well-being (EWB) domain (>0.70 but <0.80). For the overall scale, the composite G and composite capital EF, Cyrillic coefficients were greater than 0.90. Based on the G coefficient and capital EF, Cyrillic coefficient, two decision options for revising this scale considering the number of items were obtained: one is a 37-item version while the other is a 45-item version. CONCLUSION: The Chinese version of the FACT-Leu scale has good reliability as a whole based on the results of MGT and the implementation of MGT could lead to more informed decisions in complex questionnaire design and improvement.","['Meng, Qiong', 'Yang, Zheng', 'Wu, Yang', 'Xiao, Yuanyuan', 'Gu, Xuezhong', 'Zhang, Meixia', 'Wan, Chonghua', 'Li, Xiaosong']","['Meng Q', 'Yang Z', 'Wu Y', 'Xiao Y', 'Gu X', 'Zhang M', 'Wan C', 'Li X']","['West China School of Public Health, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, China.', 'School of Public Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, 650500, Yunnan Province, China.', 'School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Health Education and Basic Public Health, Kunming Health Education Institute, Kunming, 650034, Yunnan Province, China.', 'School of Public Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, 650500, Yunnan Province, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, 650032, Yunnan Province, China."", 'West China School of Public Health, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, China.', 'School of Humanities and Management, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, Guangdong Province, China. wanchh@hotmail.com.', 'West China School of Public Health, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, China. sculixiaosong@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20170504,England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,PMC5418704,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Chronic leukemia', 'Evaluation studies', 'Multivariate generalizability theory', 'Quality of life', 'Reliability']",,2017/05/06 06:00,2017/08/26 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2017/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12955-017-0664-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12955-017-0664-2 [pii]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2017 May 4;15(1):93. doi: 10.1186/s12955-017-0664-2.,,20170825,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Language', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychometrics', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards', 'Translations', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of symptomatic thromboembolism is as high as 14% and case fatality rate of ~15%. Further, development of thromboembolism interferes with the scheduled chemotherapy with potential impact on cure rates. The exact pathogenesis of ALL-associated thromboembolism is unknown. Concomitant administration of asparaginase and steroids, two important anti-leukemic agents, is shown to increase the risk of ALL-associated TE. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL studies reported ~10% incidence of thrombosis with significantly increased risk in older children (>/=10 yrs.) and those with high-risk ALL. The majority (90%) of thromboembolic events occurred in the Consolidation phase of therapy with concomitant asparaginase and steroids when high-risk patients (including all older patients) receive higher dose steroids. Certain inherited and acquired prothrombotic defects are known to contribute to the development of TE. German investigators documented ~50% incidence of TE during therapy with concomitant asparaginase and steroids, in children with at least one prothrombotic defect. However, current evidence regarding the role of prothrombotic defects in the development of ALL-associated TE is contradictory. Although thromboprophylaxis can prevent thromboembolism, ALL and it's therapy can increase the risk of bleeding. For judicious use of thromboprophylaxis, identifying a population at high risk for TE is important. The risk factors, including prothrombotic defects, predisposing to thrombosis in children with ALL have not been defined. METHODS: This prospective, observational cohort study aims to evaluate the prevalence of inherited prothrombotic defects in children with ALL treated on DFCI 05-01 protocol and the causal relationship of prothrombotic defects in combination with patient and disease-related factors to the development of TE. We hypothesize that the combination of prothrombotic defects and the intensive therapy with concomitant high dose steroids and asparaginase increases the risk of TE in older patients and patients with high-risk ALL. DISCUSSION: The results of the proposed study will help design studies of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy. Thromboprophylaxis given to a targeted population will likely reduce the incidence of TE in children with ALL and ultimately improve their quality of life and prospects for cure.","['Athale, Uma H', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Nayiager, Trishana', 'Delva, Yves-Line', 'Foster, Gary', 'Thabane, Lehana', 'Chan, Anthony Kc']","['Athale UH', 'Laverdiere C', 'Nayiager T', 'Delva YL', 'Foster G', 'Thabane L', 'Chan AK']","[""Division of Hematology/ Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, 1280 Main Street West, Room HSC 3N27, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4K1, Canada. athaleu@mcmaster.ca."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4K1, Canada. athaleu@mcmaster.ca.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology Oncology Service, CHU Ste-Justine, University of Montreal, 3175, Cotes-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4K1, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology Oncology Service, CHU Ste-Justine, University of Montreal, 3175, Cotes-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, 50 Charlton Ave. E, Hamilton, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, 50 Charlton Ave. E, Hamilton, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology/ Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, 1280 Main Street West, Room HSC 3N27, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4K1, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4K1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170504,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC5418710,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chemotherapy', '*Children', '*Leukemia', '*Prothrombotic defects', '*Thromboembolism']",,2017/05/06 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2017/05/06 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3306-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3306-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 May 4;17(1):313. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3306-5.,,20180213,,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Steroids)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anticoagulants/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Steroids/adverse effects', 'Thrombosis/chemically induced/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Venous Thromboembolism/chemically induced/drug therapy/*pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in genes responsible for CoQ10 biosynthesis (COQ genes) cause primary CoQ10 deficiency, a rare and heterogeneous mitochondrial disorder with no clear genotype-phenotype association, mainly affecting tissues with high-energy demand including brain and skeletal muscle (SkM). Here, we report a four-year-old girl diagnosed with minor mental retardation and lethal rhabdomyolysis harboring a heterozygous mutation (c.483G > C (E161D)) in COQ4. The patient's fibroblasts showed a decrease in [CoQ10 ], CoQ10 biosynthesis, MRC activity affecting complexes I/II + III, and respiration defects. Bona fide induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) lines carrying the COQ4 mutation (CQ4-iPSCs) were generated, characterized and genetically edited using the CRISPR-Cas9 system (CQ4(ed) -iPSCs). Extensive differentiation and metabolic assays of control-iPSCs, CQ4-iPSCs and CQ4(ed) -iPSCs demonstrated a genotype association, reproducing the disease phenotype. The COQ4 mutation in iPSC was associated with CoQ10 deficiency, metabolic dysfunction, and respiration defects. iPSC differentiation into SkM was compromised, and the resulting SkM also displayed respiration defects. Remarkably, iPSC differentiation in dopaminergic or motor neurons was unaffected. This study offers an unprecedented iPSC model recapitulating CoQ10 deficiency-associated functional and metabolic phenotypes caused by COQ4 mutation.

However, toxicity at high concentrations, short circulating half-lives and lack of specificity restrict their successful application in a wider scale. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of neutral liposomes containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) to encapsulate siRNA in their aqueous core. This formulation will reduce drastically the toxicity associated to cationic liposomes by bringing surface charge to almost zero, increasing stealth degree and therefore circulation time. In this study, we evaluate the efficiency of folate-targeted liposomes for specific delivery of siRNA to activated macrophages, key effector cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathology which specifically express folate receptor beta (FRbeta). Myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) is a protein essential for synovial macrophage survival, since Mcl-1 suppression results in the induction of apoptosis. The effect of MCL1 siRNA incorporated in liposomal formulation was assessed in primary human macrophages and successful inhibition of Mcl-1 expression was achieved. Here we show that the neutral liposomal derived from DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) formulation developed is efficient to encapsulate MCL1 siRNA and silencing gene expression in activated human macrophages.","['Nogueira, Eugenia', 'Freitas, Jaime', 'Loureiro, Ana', 'Nogueira, Patricia', 'Gomes, Andreia C', 'Preto, Ana', 'Carmo, Alexandre M', 'Moreira, Alexandra', 'Cavaco-Paulo, Artur']","['Nogueira E', 'Freitas J', 'Loureiro A', 'Nogueira P', 'Gomes AC', 'Preto A', 'Carmo AM', 'Moreira A', 'Cavaco-Paulo A']","['CEB - Centre of Biological Engineering, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal; CBMA - Centre of Molecular and Environmental Biology, Department of Biology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'I3S - Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, Portugal; IBMC - Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular, Rua do Campo Alegre 823, 4150-180 Porto, Portugal.', 'CEB - Centre of Biological Engineering, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal; CBMA - Centre of Molecular and Environmental Biology, Department of Biology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'I3S - Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, Portugal; IBMC - Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular, Rua do Campo Alegre 823, 4150-180 Porto, Portugal.', 'CBMA - Centre of Molecular and Environmental Biology, Department of Biology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'CBMA - Centre of Molecular and Environmental Biology, Department of Biology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'I3S - Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, Portugal; IBMC - Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular, Rua do Campo Alegre 823, 4150-180 Porto, Portugal; ICBAS - Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas Abel Salazar, Universidade do Porto, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira, 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.', 'I3S - Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, Portugal; IBMC - Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular, Rua do Campo Alegre 823, 4150-180 Porto, Portugal.', 'CEB - Centre of Biological Engineering, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.

Mutated (Mt)-NPM1 protein, which has aberrant cytoplasmic dislocation of nucleophosmin, occurs in approximately one-third of acute myeloid leukemia cases. Deguelin, a rotenoid isolated from several plant species, is a strong antitumor agent. NOD/SCID mice xenografted with human Mt-NPM1 OCI/AML3 cell lines served as in-vivo models. Wright-Giemsa staining and flow cytometry analysis were used for differentiation assays. Associated molecular events were assessed by western blot and histological analyses. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to calculate survival. Deguelin toxicity in mice was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining and serum markers. Clinical samples were differentiated by flow cytometry analysis. Deguelin induced differentiation by downregulating the Mt-NPM1 protein levels, which was accompanied by a decrease in SIRT1, p21, and HDAC1 and an increase in CEBPbeta and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor protein expression levels. A low-deguelin dose prolonged survival compared with the control group, and there were no apparent lesions to the brain, liver, heart, and kidney in vivo. In clinical samples, deguelin induced the differentiation of fresh blasts with Mt-NPM1 protein, but not with the wild-type NPM1 protein. Taken together, these findings further provide new evidence that the Mt-NPM1 protein plays an important role in inducing differentiation in vivo and in vitro. Mutated NPM1 protein may be a therapeutic target of deguelin in acute myeloid leukemia with the NPM1 mutation.","['Zhang, Xia', 'Zhao, Zichu', 'Yi, Sha', 'Wen, Lu', 'He, Jing', 'Hu, Jingyu', 'Ruan, Jun', 'Fang, Jun', 'Chen, Yan']","['Zhang X', 'Zhao Z', 'Yi S', 'Wen L', 'He J', 'Hu J', 'Ruan J', 'Fang J', 'Chen Y']","[""Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,,,,,2017/05/05 06:00,2017/12/05 06:00,['2017/05/05 06:00'],"['2017/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000494 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2017 Aug;28(7):723-738. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000494.,,20171204,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'K5Z93K66IE (deguelin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Random Allocation', 'Rotenone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that diptoindonesin G (Dip G), a natural resveratrol aneuploid, exerts antiproliferative activity by inducing G2/M phase arrest and cell differentiation in AML cell lines and primary AML cells. Gene-profiling experiments showed that treating human leukemia HL-60 cells with Dip G was associated with a remarkable upregulation of STAT1 target gene expression, including IFIT3 and CXCL10. Mechanistically, Dip G activated ERK, which caused phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser727 and selectively enhanced the interaction of p-STAT1 (Ser727) and p-ERK, further promoting their nuclear translocation. The nuclear translocation of p-STAT1 and p-ERK enhanced the transactivation of STAT1-targeted genes in AML cells. Furthermore, in vivo treatment of HL-60 xenografts demonstrated that Dip G significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced tumor weight by inducing cell differentiation. Taken together, these results shed light on an essential role for ERK-mediated nuclear translocation of p-STAT1 (Ser727) and its full transcriptional activity in Dip G-induced differentiation of AML cells. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that Dip G could be used as a differentiation-inducing agent for AML therapy, particularly for non-acute promyelocytic leukemia therapy.","['Gao, Jian', 'Fan, Minmin', 'Xiang, Gang', 'Wang, Jujuan', 'Zhang, Xiong', 'Guo, Wenjie', 'Wu, Xuefeng', 'Sun, Yang', 'Gu, Yanhong', 'Ge, Huiming', 'Tan, Renxiang', 'Qiu, Hongxia', 'Shen, Yan', 'Xu, Qiang']","['Gao J', 'Fan M', 'Xiang G', 'Wang J', 'Zhang X', 'Guo W', 'Wu X', 'Sun Y', 'Gu Y', 'Ge H', 'Tan R', 'Qiu H', 'Shen Y', 'Xu Q']","['State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170504,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC5520695,,,,2017/05/05 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2017/05/05 06:00'],"['2016/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017159 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.159 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 May 4;8(5):e2765. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.159.,,20180129,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL10)', '0 (IFIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (diptoindonesin G)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Benzofurans/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Caspase 3/chemistry/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL10/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To ensure the integrity of their DNA, cells have evolved maintenance programs collectively known as the DNA damage response. Particularly challenging for genome integrity are DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and defects in their repair are often associated with human disease, including leukemia. Defective DSB repair may not only be disease-causing, but further contribute to poor treatment outcome and poor prognosis in leukemia. Here, we review current insight into altered DSB repair mechanisms identified in leukemia. While DSB repair is somewhat compromised in all leukemic subtypes, certain key players of DSB repair are particularly targeted: DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and Ku70/80 in the non-homologous end-joining pathway, as well as Rad51 and breast cancer 1/2 (BRCA1/2), key players in homologous recombination. Defects in leukemia-related DSB repair may not only arise from dysfunctional repair components, but also indirectly from mutations in key regulators of gene expression and/or chromatin structure, such as p53, the Kirsten ras oncogene (K-RAS), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2). A detailed understanding of the basis for defective DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms for each leukemia subtype may allow to further develop new treatment methods to improve treatment outcome and prognosis for patients.","['Nilles, Nadine', 'Fahrenkrog, Birthe']","['Nilles N', 'Fahrenkrog B']","['Institute for Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 6041 Charleroi, Belgium. nnilles@ulb.ac.be.', 'Institute for Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 6041 Charleroi, Belgium. bfahrenk@ulb.ac.be.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170504,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,PMC5492015,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage response', 'double-strand break repair', 'homologous recombination', 'leukemia', 'non-homologous end joining']",,2017/05/05 06:00,2017/05/05 06:01,['2017/05/05 06:00'],"['2017/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/05 06:01 [medline]']","['cells6020011 [pii]', '10.3390/cells6020011 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2017 May 4;6(2). pii: cells6020011. doi: 10.3390/cells6020011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For research purposes of the behavior of CLL cells we created 3D in vitro model in which we simulated appropriate microenvironment for CLL cells to allow study the mechanism of survival of these cells in long-term cultivation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our aim was the scaffold structure to be geometrically similar to the 3D morphology of supporting bone marrow tissue in a trabecular bone; the 3D scaffold was also designed to conform to biocompatibility, sufficiently large surface area for cell attachment, high porosity for cell migration, proliferation and transport of nutrients. Another requirement was a partial transparency for inspection of cell model with optical techniques. We prepared 3D scaffolds from porous hydrogel poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA), poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-2-aminoethyl methacrylate) p (HEMA-co-AEMA) and p (HEMA-co-AEMA) modified with frequently used cell adhesion peptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). All hydrogel scaffolds were manufactured in four pore diameters (125, 200, 300 and 350-450 mum). Scaffolds were tested with human bone marrow stromal cell line HS-5 and human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293. RESULTS: Hydrogel scaffold p (HEMA-co-AEMA) modified with adhesion peptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) with pore diameter of 350-450 mum demonstrated that it is a convenient system for 3D cell cultivation, since it promotes interaction between the cells and also between the cells and the material. This scaffold was used for seeding of co-cultivation system of HS-5 cells with CLL-cells, which were stimulated through the CD40L signaling pathway as well as via the IL-4 pathway. Viability of B-CLL cells was higher in the presence of both stimulators than with each alone. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that 3D scaffold technology is very useful for modeling of microsystems where the cancer cells behave like in their natural microenvironment.Key words: hematooncology - leukemia - hydrogel - stromal cells This work was supported by grant COST CZ LD15144 ""Cellular and acellular grounds for regeneration of bones and teeth"" awarded by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic.

In recent years, FLT3 has been an important marker in different haematological malignancies, highlighting in acute myeloid leukaemia, where FLT3 mutations have been associated with the clinical prognosis, treatment and survival of patients. The most common form of FLT3 mutation is an internal tandem duplication (ITD) that promotes ligand-independent auto-phosphorylation and constitutive activation of the receptor. FLT3-ITD has been strongly associated with a bad prognosis, leukocytosis, high blast counts, increased risk of relapse and shorter overall survival. In order to improve the clinical condition of FLT3-ITD-positive patients, several FLT3 inhibitors have been developed showing variable results. Currently, the main challenges to be overcome are the different forms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. Thus, the purpose of this review is to present, in a general way, the current role that FLT3-ITD mutation plays in patients with AML, with a particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms associated with clinical prognosis, treatment, and survival of patients.","['Lagunas-Rangel, Francisco Alejandro', 'Chavez-Valencia, Venice']","['Lagunas-Rangel FA', 'Chavez-Valencia V']","['Graduate Studies Division, Faculty of Biological and Medical Sciences ""Dr Ignacio Chavez"", Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo, Av.

METHODS: Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were established as the primary endpoints for directly assessing the efficacy, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) for safety. The eligible patients were at or above 50 years of age, and the outcomes of the typical elderly patients (>/=60 years) were analyzed individually. RESULTS: The pooled estimates (95% confidence interval (CI)) for 1-year OS, EFS and NRM were 65 (55-74) %, 50 (44-55) % and 26 (21-30) %, respectively; as for the patients >/=60 years of age, these were 63 (53-72) %, 46 (41-50) % and 28 (23-32) %, respectively. No significantly statistical difference achieved between MDS and AML patients in 1-year EFS and NRM [relative risk (RR) 0.91, 95% CI 0.80-1.04; P = 0.172 and RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.82-1.69; P = 0.365]. The patients with lower diseases risk had the possibility of higher OS rate at >/= 3 years than those with higher diseases risk (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.95-1.97; P = 0.088). The patients had significantly higher 2-year OS and EFS rates in complete remission (CR, CR1 and CR2) at transplantation compared to those with advanced diseases (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: RIC-alloHSCT is a feasible treatment option for the patients older than 50 year of age with MDS and AML.

C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is a chemokine and chemokine receptor pair playing critical roles in tumorigenesis. A highly potent competitive antagonist of CCR5, maraviroc, recently has been identified with suppression of cancer cells aggressive in a variety of cancers. However, the effects of maraviroc on ALL cells have not yet been defined. Here we report that CCR5 selective inhibitor significantly inhibited ALL cells SUP-B15 growth and induced SUP-B15 cells to undergo cell apoptosis. This cell apoptosis was associated with increased levels of cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Moreover, we demonstrated that maraviroc strongly inhibited SUP-B15 cells migration to C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) and CXCL13, and adhesion to fibronectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) in vitro.

Vitamin D supplementation could increase serum phosphate through increased intestinal absorption of phosphate and suppression of parathyroid hormone, which would lead to decreased renal phosphate excretion. Because of the potential for renal injury during induction chemotherapy for ALL, Vitamin D supplementation's potential for increasing hyperphosphatemia could outweigh its suggested but unproven benefits. METHODS: To measure the interaction between vitamin D supplementation and phosphate during chemotherapy induction, a retrospective study was done. Demographic data; clinical information about the diagnosis; laboratory data regarding calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D concentrations; and medication histories were reviewed. RESULTS: A retrospective study of 41 children with ALL showed no statistically significant difference in the final phosphate concentrations that were obtained (4.41 mg/dL vs. 4.53 mg/dL, p = 0.635) with regard to their vitamin D supplementation status. Longitudinal effects with vitamin D and phosphate showed a trend toward increasing phosphate concentrations in patients who received supplemental vitamin D (0.035 vs. 0.010 mg/dL per day; p = 0.102).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective observational study, which collected data of patients who require ""PORT"" catheter insertion for any cancer, at a tertiary care oncology hospital in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India, during a 2-year period. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to study the various complications and outcomes related to ""PORT"" catheters. RESULTS: ""PORT"" catheter was inserted in 100 patients and was most commonly used in solid malignancies (n = 86, 86%), followed by hematologic malignancies (n = 14, 14%). Among the solid malignancies, breast cancer (38, 38%) was the most common underlying disease, whereas among the hematologic malignancies, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (6, 6%) was the most common underlying disease for ""PORT"" catheter insertion. Chemotherapy was started on the first day of ""PORT"" catheter in 74% of patients in the ""PORT"" study group. The various complications developed in the ""PORT"" study group in the descending order are as follows: 4 patients (4%) developed early infection (30 days after ""PORT"" placement), 4 (4%) late infection (30 days after ""PORT"" placement), 4 (4%) bloodstream infection, 2 (2%) local skin infection at the ""PORT"" insertion site, 2 (2%) dislodgment of the ""PORT"" catheter, 2 (2%) fracture of the ""PORT"" catheter, and 1 recurrent pleural effusion. One patient (1%) developed thrombosis as the complication of ""PORT"" catheter insertion. CONCLUSIONS: The most disturbing aspect of treatment for a patient with cancer is multiple painful venipunctures made for administration of cytotoxic agents, antibiotics, blood products, and nutritional supplements. The focus of this prospective observational research is to study the various underlying diseases for which ""PORT"" catheter is needed in different solid and hematologic malignancies and the various complications and outcomes in pediatric and adult patients with cancer.","['Madabhavi, Irappa', 'Patel, Apurva', 'Sarkar, Malay', 'Anand, Asha', 'Panchal, Harsha', 'Parikh, Sonia']","['Madabhavi I', 'Patel A', 'Sarkar M', 'Anand A', 'Panchal H', 'Parikh S']","['Department of Medical & Pediatric Oncology, The Gujarat Cancer & Research Institute, Ahmedabad, India.', 'Department of Medical & Pediatric Oncology, The Gujarat Cancer & Research Institute, Ahmedabad, India.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla, India.', 'Department of Medical & Pediatric Oncology, The Gujarat Cancer & Research Institute, Ahmedabad, India.', 'Department of Medical & Pediatric Oncology, The Gujarat Cancer & Research Institute, Ahmedabad, India.', 'Department of Medical & Pediatric Oncology, The Gujarat Cancer & Research Institute, Ahmedabad, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170223,United States,Clin Med Insights Oncol,Clinical Medicine Insights.

In this study, we report the first recorded human-infecting C. haemolyticum strain collected from an 18-year-old woman diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After failure of traditional techniques, only next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology in combination with bioinformatics, phylogenetic, and pathogenomics analyses revealed that our King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSHRC) bacterial isolate belongs to C. haemolyticum species. KFSHRC isolate is composed of 1 chromosome and 4 plasmids. The total genome size is estimated to be 2.7 Mbp with a low GC content of 28.02%. Comparative pathogenomics analysis showed that C. haemolyticum KFSHRC isolate is a potential virulent pathogenic bacterium as it possesses the virulence factors necessary to establish an infection, acquire essential nutrients, resist antimicrobial agents, and tolerate hostile conditions both in the human host and in its surrounding environment.

Financial costs for treating childhood cancer care are traditionally assessed based on the amount spent for diagnostic tests, hospitalization, and chemotherapy. The financial costs for travel, accommodation, out-of-pocket expenses for food, phone bills, and loss of income due to reduction or termination of parental employment are hidden nonmedical expenses that are rarely accounted for. Studies on the financial implications of pediatric cancer treatment are based on the Western model of healthcare with good government/state insurance coverage and hence literature on lifestyle implications for families in developing nations with limited resources is still scarce. AIMS: The aim of this study is to find out the details of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the families during their treatment of cancer children and its implications on their quality of life. Settings and Design: This study was conducted in a tertiary care center for pediatric malignancies for over 1-year period. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: About seventy families whose children were diagnosed with acute leukemia and undergoing treatment at our center were asked to fill a questionnaire detailing their out-of-pocket expenses. RESULTS: Nonmedical expenses accounts for about 46% of their monthly household income of parents from rural areas and 22% of their household income from urban areas. On an average, a family from rural area spends four times the normal amount spent on home for their daily food expenditure. Thirty-eight percent of families have borrowed money from money lenders with an average interest rate of about 12.5% which pushes them to a state of debt for the next few years. CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-pocket expenses contribute a significant proportion to the financial burden of the families with childhood malignancies and these invisible expenses should be recognized and provide adequate support to lessen the burden of this economic impact.","['Sneha, Latha M', 'Sai, Jeyanth', 'Ashwini, S', 'Ramaswamy, Sunitha', 'Rajan, Mahalakshmi', 'Scott, Julius X']","['Sneha LM', 'Sai J', 'Ashwini S', 'Ramaswamy S', 'Rajan M', 'Scott JX']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hemato Oncology, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hemato Oncology, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hemato Oncology, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hemato Oncology, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hemato Oncology, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hemato Oncology, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,PMC5398105,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood cancer treatment', 'developing country', 'out-of-pocket expenses']",['There are no conflicts of interest.'],2017/05/05 06:00,2017/05/05 06:01,['2017/05/05 06:00'],"['2017/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-5851.203493 [doi]', 'IJMPO-38-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2017 Jan-Mar;38(1):4-9. doi: 10.4103/0971-5851.203493.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated selinexor, an orally bioavailable, first-in-class inhibitor of the nuclear export protein XPO1, in this phase 1 trial to assess safety and determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Seventy-nine patients with various NHL histologies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Richter's transformation, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, were enrolled. In the dose-escalation phase, patients received 3 to 80 mg/m(2) of selinexor in 3- or 4-week cycles and were assessed for toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity. In the dose-expansion phase, patients were treated with selinexor at 35 or 60 mg/m(2) The most common grade 3 to 4 drug-related adverse events were thrombocytopenia (47%), neutropenia (32%), anemia (27%), leukopenia (16%), fatigue (11%), and hyponatremia (10%). Tumor biopsies showed decreases in cell-signaling pathways (Bcl-2, Bcl-6, c-Myc), reduced proliferation (Ki67), nuclear localization of XPO1 cargos (p53, PTEN), and increased apoptosis after treatment. Twenty-two (31%) of the 70 evaluable patients had an objective responses, including 4 complete responses and 18 partial responses, which were observed across a spectrum of NHL subtypes. A dose of 35 mg/m(2) (60 mg) was identified as the RP2D. These findings suggest that inhibition of XPO1 with oral selinexor at 35 mg/m(2) is a safe therapy with encouraging and durable anticancer activity in patients with R/R NHL.

LSCs are therapy-resistant, cause relapse, and represent a major obstacle for the cure of AML. Resistance to therapy is often mediated by aberrant tyrosine kinase (TK) activation. These TKs primarily activate downstream signaling via STAT3/STAT5. In this study, we analyzed the potential to therapeutically target aberrant TK signaling and to eliminate LSCs via the multi-TK inhibitor Debio 0617B. Debio 0617B has a unique profile targeting key kinases upstream of STAT3/STAT5 signaling such as JAK, SRC, ABL, and class III/V receptor TKs. We demonstrate that expression of phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3) in AML blasts is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Furthermore, phospho-STAT5 (pSTAT5) signaling is increased in primary CD34(+) AML stem/progenitors. STAT3/STAT5 activation depends on tyrosine phosphorylation, mediated by several upstream TKs. Inhibition of single upstream TKs did not eliminate LSCs. In contrast, the multi-TK inhibitor Debio 0617B reduced maintenance and self-renewal of primary human AML CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells in vitro and in xenotransplantation experiments resulting in long-term elimination of human LSCs and leukemia. Therefore, inhibition of multiple TKs upstream of STAT3/5 may result in sustained therapeutic efficacy of targeted therapy in AML and prevent relapses. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(8); 1497-510.

However, the role of Wnt signaling antagonists in therapy resistance and disease progression has not been fully investigated. We aimed to study the effects of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway antagonists-secreted frizzled-related protein 1 and Wnt inhibitory factor 1-on resistance toward tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia. Response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors was analyzed in secreted frizzled-related protein 1 and Wnt inhibitory factor 1 stably transfected K562 cells. Experiments were repeated using a tetracycline-inducible expression system, confirming previous results. In addition, response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment was also analyzed using the secreted frizzled-related protein 1 expressing, BCR-ABL positive MEG01 cell line, in the presence and absence of a secreted frizzled-related protein 1 inhibitor. Our data suggests that total cellular beta-catenin levels decrease in the presence of secreted frizzled-related protein 1 and Wnt inhibitory factor 1, and a significant increase in cell death after tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment is observed. On the contrary, when secreted frizzled-related protein 1 is suppressed, total beta-catenin levels increase in the cell and the cells become resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We suggest that Wnt antagonists carry the potential to be exploited in designing new agents and strategies for the advanced and resistant forms of chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Pehlivan, Melek', 'Caliskan, Ceyda', 'Yuce, Zeynep', 'Sercan, Hakki Ogun']","['Pehlivan M', 'Caliskan C', 'Yuce Z', 'Sercan HO']","['1 Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.', '2 Health Services Vocational School, Izmir Katip Celebi University, Izmir, Turkey.', '1 Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.', '1 Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.', '1 Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Wnt inhibitory factor 1', 'Wnt signaling pathway', 'secreted frizzled-related protein 1', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,2017/05/05 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/05/05 06:00'],"['2017/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428317701654 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2017 May;39(5):1010428317701654. doi: 10.1177/1010428317701654.,,20170612,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (WIF1 protein, human)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/drug effects', 'beta Catenin/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous ALL pharmacogenomic studies have been conducted to elucidate the predisposing genetic factors for their development. Plausible pharmacogenomic data are available for the osteonecrosis associated with glucocorticoids, the neurotoxicity associated with vincristine and the cardiotoxicity related to anthracyclines. However, these data have not been fully translated into the clinic due to several limitations, most importantly the lack of reliable evidence.

Methods: The clinical data of the 116 inpatients preliminarily diagnosed ALL in the Leukemia Ward of Beijing Children's Hospital with PICC from 1(st) March 2014 to 31(st) December 2014 were collected prospectively. Results: 1 in circleRefer to the B-ultrasound on the 15(th) day after catheterization, the incidence of CRT was 28.4% (33/116 cases) , all cases were symptom-free. 2 in circleThere were no statistical differences in terms of gender, age distribution, degree, immunotype between CRT and CRT-free groups. This study revealed no statistical differences of blood routine test items, coagulation function items, co-infection and catheterization vein between the two groups. While there was significant statistical difference of catheterization side, the frequency of right catheterization was higher in CRT group[75.8% (25/33) vs 55.4% (46/83) , P=0.043]. 3 in circleOn the 15(th) day after catheterization, significant statistical difference of D-Dimer between the two groups was revealed[0.18 (0.05-2.45) mg/L vs 0.11 (0.01-5.34) mg/L, P=0.001], while no statistical differences of blood routine test items and other coagulation function items. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis verified catheterization on right was a risk factor of CRT. 4 in circleDuring the observation, there were 3 cases of catheter-related complications other than CRT, all of which were CRI, 2 of them had CRT meanwhile. The B-ultrasound on the 33(rd) day after catheterization showed that 73.1% of the cases had reduced thrombosis, 3.8% had growth thrombosis, 23.1% had no obvious change respectively. Conclusion: CRT was a common catheter related complication among ALL children during induction chemotherapy, and CRT cases with symptoms were rare. Catheterization on right was a risk factor for CRT, and regular test of D-Dimer and B ultrasound contributed to detect CRT. Most of the CRT cases had reduced thrombosis without specific management.","['Wei, Y Y', 'Zhang, Y Y', 'Zhen, Y Z', 'Zhang, L Q', 'Jia, C G', 'Zhang, R D', 'Zheng, H Y', 'Wu, X Y', 'Wu, R H']","['Wei YY', 'Zhang YY', 'Zhen YZ', 'Zhang LQ', 'Jia CG', 'Zhang RD', 'Zheng HY', 'Wu XY', 'Wu RH']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education; Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC7342727,['NOTNLM'],"['Catheter-related infection', 'Catheterization, peripheral', 'Child', 'Leukemia, lymphocytic, acute', 'Thrombosis']",,2017/05/05 06:00,2018/11/08 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2017.04.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2017 Apr 14;38(4):313-317. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2017.04.010.,,20181107,,"['0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (fibrin fragment D)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Induction Chemotherapy', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Risk Factors', '*Thrombosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of EE treatment on neuronal apoptosis in the periinfarct cortex after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. METHODS: The cerebral I/R injury was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). A set of behavioral tests including the modified neurological severity score (mNSS), limb-placing test and foot-fault test were conducted. The infarct volume and the neuronal survival rate were evaluated by Nissl staining. The morphology and ultrastructure of ischemic neurons was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Neuronal apoptosis was assessed by double labeling of TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) with NeuN. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins were tested by western blotting and immunohistochemical labeling. RESULTS: EE treatment improved neurological function, reduced infarct volume, increased neuronal survival rate and alleviated the morphological and ultrastructural damage of neurons (especially mitochondria) after I/R injury. EE treatment reduced the neuronal apoptosis, increased B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) protein levels while decreased Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), cytochrome c, caspase-3 expressions and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the periinfarct cortex after cerebral I/R injury. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that EE treatment inhibits neuronal apoptosis in the periinfarct cortex after focal cerebral I/R injury, which may be one of the possible mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of EE.","['Chen, Xiuping', 'Zhang, Xin', 'Xue, Li', 'Hao, Chizi', 'Liao, Weijing', 'Wan, Qi']","['Chen X', 'Zhang X', 'Xue L', 'Hao C', 'Liao W', 'Wan Q']","['Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Puai Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Physiology, Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science, School of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170317,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cerebral ischemia', 'Enriched environment', 'Middle cerebral artery occlusion', 'Mitochondria', 'Neuronal apoptosis']",,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['000468368 [pii]', '10.1159/000468368 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2017;41(4):1445-1456. doi: 10.1159/000468368.

The profiling of Ig sequences (at both DNA and peptide levels) are of great relevance to developing targeted vaccines or treatments for specific diseases or infections. Thus, genomics and proteomics techniques (such as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry (MS)) have notably increased the knowledge in Ig sequencing and serum Ig peptide profiling in a high-throughput manner. However, the peptide characterization of membrane-bound Ig (e.g., B-cell receptors, BCR) is still a challenge mainly due to the poor recovery of mentioned Ig.Herein, we have evaluated three different sample processing methods for peptide sequencing of BCR belonging to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells identifying up to 426 different peptide sequences (MS/MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD004466). Moreover, as a consequence of the results here obtained, recommended guidelines have been described for BCR-sequencing of B-CLL samples by MS approaches.For this purpose, an in-house algorithm has been designed and developed to compare the MS/MS results with those obtained by molecular biology in order to integrate both proteomics and genomics results and establish the steps to follow when sequencing membrane-bound Ig by MS/MS.","['Diez, Paula', 'Ibarrola, Nieves', 'Degano, Rosa M', 'Lecrevisse, Quentin', 'Rodriguez-Caballero, Arancha', 'Criado, Ignacio', 'Nieto, Wendy G', 'Gongora, Rafael', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Almeida, Julia', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Fuentes, Manuel']","['Diez P', 'Ibarrola N', 'Degano RM', 'Lecrevisse Q', 'Rodriguez-Caballero A', 'Criado I', 'Nieto WG', 'Gongora R', 'Gonzalez M', 'Almeida J', 'Orfao A', 'Fuentes M']","['Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Proteomics Unit, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Proteomics Unit, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Proteomics Unit, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, University Hospital of Salamanca, Cancer Research and Institute of Molecular Biology and Cellular Oncology, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Proteomics Unit, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5522109,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'immunoglobulin', 'mass spectrometry', 'peptide sequencing']",,2017/05/04 06:00,2018/04/07 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['17076 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.17076 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 27;8(26):42836-42846. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.17076.,,20180406,,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Female', 'Genomics/methods', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/chemistry/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptide Fragments/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Workflow']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the so-called Warburg effect, 18flurodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has successfully developed as clinical modality for the diagnosis and staging of many cancers. To leverage this glucose transporter mediated metabolic disparity between normal and malignant cells, in the current report, we focus on the fluorine substituted series of glucose, mannose and galactose-conjugated (trans-R,R-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine)-2-flouromalonato-platinum(II) complexes for a comprehensive evaluation on their selective tumor targeting. Besides highly improved water solubility, these sugar-conjugates presented improved cytotoxicity than oxaliplatin in glucose tranporters (GLUTs) overexpressing cancer cell lines and exhibited no cross-resistance to cisplatin. For the highly water soluble glucose-conjugated complex (5a), two novel in vivo assessments were conducted and the results revealed that 5a was more efficacious at a lower equitoxic dose (70% MTD) than oxaliplatin (100% MTD) in HT29 xenograft model, and it was significantly more potent than oxaliplatin in leukemia-bearing DBA/2 mice as well even at equimolar dose levels (18% vs 90% MTD). GLUT inhibitor mediated cell viability analysis, GLUT1 knockdown cell line-based cytotoxicity evaluation, and platinum accumulation study demonstrated that the cellular uptake of the sugar-conjugates was regulated by GLUT1. The higher intrinsic DNA reactivity of the sugar-conjugates was confirmed by kinetic study of platinum(II)-guanosine adduct formation. The mechanistic origin of the antitumor effect of the fluorine complexes was found to be forming the bifunctional Pt-guanine-guanine (Pt-GG) intrastrand cross-links with DNA. The results provide a rationale for Warburg effect targeted anticancer drug design.","['Liu, Ran', 'Fu, Zheng', 'Zhao, Meng', 'Gao, Xiangqian', 'Li, Hong', 'Mi, Qian', 'Liu, Pengxing', 'Yang, Jinna', 'Yao, Zhi', 'Gao, Qingzhi']","['Liu R', 'Fu Z', 'Zhao M', 'Gao X', 'Li H', 'Mi Q', 'Liu P', 'Yang J', 'Yao Z', 'Gao Q']","['Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery & High-Efficiency, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, P.

However, diverse mechanisms are associated with insensitivity to TRAIL in various cancers. TRAIL efficacy may be enhanced by combining TRAIL with a sensitizer. In this study, vernodalol, a sesquiterpene lactone, sensitized diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Vernodalol increased the expression of death receptor (DR) 5, and silencing of DR5 with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the effect of vernodalol on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, vernodalol up-regulated the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP), a transcription factor. Inhibition of CHOP with a siRNA diminished DR5 expression and vernodalol-induced sensitization to the TRAIL treatment. In addition, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor blocked the vernodalol-induced up-regulation of DR5, indicating that the effect depended on JNK activation. Furthermore, the down-regulation of induced myeloid leukaemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1) played an important role in vernodalol/TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as Mcl-1 overexpression prevented this apoptotic effect. Moreover, the vernodalol/TRAIL combination inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft model. Based on our results, vernodalol enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis by down-regulating Mcl-1 and up-regulating DR5, and the effects of DR5 depended on JNK activation and CHOP induction. Therefore, combining TRAIL with vernodalol, a naturally occurring agent, may represent a promising therapeutic approach for DLBCL.","['Wu, Wenjun', 'Yang, Yang', 'Deng, Gang', 'Ma, Liang', 'Wei, Guoqing', 'Zheng, Gaofeng', 'Han, Xiaoyan', 'He, Donghua', 'Zhao, Yi', 'He, Jinsong', 'Cai, Zhen', 'Yu, Rui']","['Wu W', 'Yang Y', 'Deng G', 'Ma L', 'Wei G', 'Zheng G', 'Han X', 'He D', 'Zhao Y', 'He J', 'Cai Z', 'Yu R']","['The Bone Marrow Transplantation Center and Multiple Myeloma Treatment Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'The Bone Marrow Transplantation Center and Multiple Myeloma Treatment Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'The Ningbo Central Blood Station, Ningbo, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China.', 'The Bone Marrow Transplantation Center and Multiple Myeloma Treatment Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'The Bone Marrow Transplantation Center and Multiple Myeloma Treatment Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'The Bone Marrow Transplantation Center and Multiple Myeloma Treatment Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'The Bone Marrow Transplantation Center and Multiple Myeloma Treatment Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'The Bone Marrow Transplantation Center and Multiple Myeloma Treatment Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'The Bone Marrow Transplantation Center and Multiple Myeloma Treatment Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'The Bone Marrow Transplantation Center and Multiple Myeloma Treatment Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170515,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CHOP', '*DLBCL', '*DR5', '*Mcl-1']",,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/10/05 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.22672 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2017 Oct;56(10):2190-2199. doi: 10.1002/mc.22672.

METHODS: Non-interventional, prospective study (average follow-up 20.5 months). RESULTS: Of the 307 SID patients (mean age 63.7+/-14.4 years, 52% males, in 31% IG newly initiated), 95.4% received IV IG (mean dosing interval 4.6 weeks, average dose 199 mg/kg per 4 weeks) and 4.6% were treated with SC IG (2.6 weeks, 343 mg/kg per 4 weeks). Median IG through level at first documentation was 5.8 g/L and did not differ between IV and SC treatment or between underlying malignancies. In 24.1% of patients, treatment was interrupted temporarily, over a mean of 11.6+/-6.3 months. In patients with newly initiated IG treatment the 82% overall infection rate prior to treatment dropped to 21% at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Under clinical practice conditions, IG replacement therapy in SID patients was feasible, diminished infection rates and improved quality of life. Average IG doses were relatively low. Tolerability of IV IG treatment was excellent.","['Reiser, Marcel', 'Borte, Michael', 'Huscher, Dorte', 'Baumann, Ulrich', 'Pittrow, David', 'Sommer, Claudia', 'Stangel, Martin', 'Fasshauer, Maria', 'Gold, Ralf', 'Hensel, Manfred']","['Reiser M', 'Borte M', 'Huscher D', 'Baumann U', 'Pittrow D', 'Sommer C', 'Stangel M', 'Fasshauer M', 'Gold R', 'Hensel M']","['PIOH - Praxis internistischer Onkologie und Hamatologie, Koln, Germany.', 'Paediatric Rheumatology, Immunology and Infectiology, Hospital St. Georg, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Epidemiology unit, German Rheumatism Research Centre, A Leibniz institute, Berlin, Germany.', 'Paediatric Pulmonology, Allergy and Neonatology, Hanover Medical School, Hanover, Germany.', 'Medical Faculty, Institute for Clinical Pharmacology, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology, Hanover Medical School, Hanover, Germany.', 'Paediatric Rheumatology, Immunology and Infectiology, Hospital St. Georg, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department for Neurology, St. Josef-Hospital, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Mannheimer Onkologie Praxis, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170621,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphatic leukaemia', 'drug utilisation', 'immune globulin', 'infections', 'intravenous', 'multiple myeloma', 'observational', 'outcomes research', 'patient-related outcomes', 'quality of life', 'routine care', 'secondary immunodeficiency', 'subcutaneous']",,2017/05/04 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.12900 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2017 Aug;99(2):169-177. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12900.

Herein we describe historical, clinicopathologic, and postmortem findings in 6 horses with acute leukemia. Medical records of horses with >20% bone marrow blasts and cytochemical or immunophenotyping results were reviewed. Affected horses were 2-8 y of age and of different breeds and sex. Horses were presented acutely with nonspecific signs (e.g., fever, lethargy). Characteristic hemogram findings were bi- or pancytopenia with low blast numbers. Histologic examination revealed extramedullary infiltrates, especially in lymph nodes, spleen, kidney, liver, and lungs. Leukemias were classified as B-cell ( n = 3) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ( n = 3). Tumors in 4 cases expressed multiple lineage markers, which complicated classification. Acute leukemia should be suspected in horses with moderate-to-severe bi- or pancytopenia. Blood smears should be reviewed for neoplastic cells, and bone marrow examination is required for diagnosis. Leukemia classification is best achieved using combined morphologic, cytochemical, and immunophenotyping results.","['Barrell, Emily A', 'Asakawa, Midori Goto', 'Felippe, M Julia B', 'Divers, Thomas J', 'Stokol, Tracy']","['Barrell EA', 'Asakawa MG', 'Felippe MJB', 'Divers TJ', 'Stokol T']","['Departments of Clinical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (Barrell, Felippe, Divers), College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.', 'Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (Asakawa, Stokol), College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.', 'Departments of Clinical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (Barrell, Felippe, Divers), College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.', 'Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (Asakawa, Stokol), College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.', 'Departments of Clinical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (Barrell, Felippe, Divers), College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.', 'Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (Asakawa, Stokol), College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.', 'Departments of Clinical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (Barrell, Felippe, Divers), College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.', 'Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (Asakawa, Stokol), College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.', 'Departments of Clinical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (Barrell, Felippe, Divers), College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.', 'Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (Asakawa, Stokol), College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170503,United States,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",9011490,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia', 'equine']",,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1040638717707724 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Diagn Invest. 2017 Jul;29(4):529-535. doi: 10.1177/1040638717707724.

LIF is a secreted glycoprotein with a variety of biological functions including stimulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival that are all essential for blastocyete development and implantation. The LIF receptor activates several signaling pathways in diverse cell types, including Jak/STAT, MAPK and PI3-kinase pathways in the endometrium of fertile woman. It has been suggested that the initial lower expression of LIF in proliferative phase may be one of the causes for multiple failure of implantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between maternal genotype of SNP 3951C/T LIF and in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) outcome in infertile women. This case-control study was comprised of infertile patients (n=70) and women having one healthy child as controls (n=73). Genotyping for SNP-3951C/T was performed by PCR/RFLP. Allele and genotype distribution did not differ significantly between patients and controls (P>0.05). The LIF genotype frequencies amongst the 70 cases were C/C=40%, C/T=52.8% and T/T=7.2%; the C and T allele frequencies were 66% and 34%, respectively.

Mass spectrometric identification indicated that there were 102 differential proteins before and after intervention. Among them, expression of CH60, AT1A1, ANXA6, and EF2 increased and expression of ATPA, MYO1G, RS3 decreased. Those genes played roles in promoting HL-60 cell apoptosis induced by As2O3.

In the imatinib era few studies addressing the prognostic significance of the BCR-ABL1 transcript type in early chronic phase CML have been published. Overall, these studies suggest that in e14a2 patients the response to imatinib is faster and deeper. To evaluate if the BCR-ABL1 transcript type (e13a2 compared to e14a2) affect the response to imatinib and the clinical outcome in newly diagnosed adult CML patients, 559 patients enrolled in 3 prospective studies (NCT00514488, NCT00510926, observational study CML/023) were analyzed. A qualitative PCR was performed at baseline: 52% patients had a e14a2 transcript, 37% a e13a2 transcript, 11% co-expressed both transcripts and 1% had other rare transcripts. The median follow-up was 76 months (95% of the patients had at least a 5-year observation). The complete cytogenetic response rates were comparable in e14a2 and e13a2 patients. The median time to MR(3.0) (6 and 12 months) and MR(4.0) (41 and 61 months) was significantly shorter for e14a2 patients compared to e13a2 patients, with a higher cumulative probability of MR(3.0) (88% and 83%, P < .001) and MR(4.0) (67% and 52%, P = .001). The 7-year overall survival (90% and 83%, P = .017), progression-free survival (89% and 81%, P = .005) and failure-free survival (71% and 54%, P < .001) were significantly better in patients with e14a2 transcript.

These findings have suggested that donor-recipient KIR ligand matching might promote the NK cell licensing process, thereby increasing NK cell-mediated protection against CMV reactivation.","['Zhao, Xiang-Yu', 'Luo, Xue-Yi', 'Yu, Xing-Xing', 'Zhao, Xiao-Su', 'Han, Ting-Ting', 'Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Huo, Ming-Rui', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Li, Dan', 'Jiang, Zheng-Fan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Zhao XY', 'Luo XY', 'Yu XX', 'Zhao XS', 'Han TT', 'Chang YJ', 'Huo MR', 'Xu LP', 'Zhang XH', 'Liu KY', 'Li D', 'Jiang ZF', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Centre for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Centre for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation of the Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Haematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Centre for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170503,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CMV', '*HSCT', '*KIR', '*haploidentical']",,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14622 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Jun;177(5):766-781. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14622.

Mutations in Dnm2, a GTPase, are highly disease-specific and have been implicated in four forms of human diseases: centronuclear myopathy, Charcot-Marie Tooth neuropathy and, more recently, T-cell leukaemia and Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia, but red cell abnormalities have not been reported to date. The V235G mutation lies within a crucial GTP nucleotide-binding pocket of Dnm2, and resulted in defective GTPase activity and incompatibility with life in the homozygous state. Dnm2 is an essential mediator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is required for the uptake of transferrin (Tf) into red cells for incorporation of haem. Accordingly, we observed significantly reduced Tf uptake by Dnm2(+/V235G) cells, which led to impaired endosome formation. Despite these deficiencies, surprisingly all iron studies were unchanged, suggesting an unexplained alternative mechanism underlies microcytic anaemia in Dnm2(+/V235G) mice. This study provides the first in vivo evidence for the requirements of Dnm2 in normal erythropoiesis.","['Brown, Fiona C', 'Collett, Michael', 'Tremblay, Cedric S', 'Rank, Gerhard', 'De Camilli, Pietro', 'Booth, Carmen J', 'Bitoun, Marc', 'Robinson, Phillip J', 'Kile, Benjamin T', 'Jane, Stephen M', 'Curtis, David J']","['Brown FC', 'Collett M', 'Tremblay CS', 'Rank G', 'De Camilli P', 'Booth CJ', 'Bitoun M', 'Robinson PJ', 'Kile BT', 'Jane SM', 'Curtis DJ']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University and Alfred Health, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.', ""Cell Signalling Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University and Alfred Health, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.', 'Rotary Bone Marrow Research Laboratory, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.', 'Departments of Neuroscience and Cell Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Kavli Institute for Neuroscience, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Section of Comparative Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Research Centre for Myology, UPMC Univ Paris 06 and INSERM UMRS 974, CNRS FRE 3617, Institute of Myology, Paris, France.', ""Cell Signalling Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University and Alfred Health, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University and Alfred Health, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170503,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Dynamin 2 mutation', '*clathrin-mediated endocytosis', '*ethylnitrosurea mutagenesis', '*microcytic anaemia', '*mouse model of anaemia']",,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14709 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Aug;178(4):616-628. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14709.

In the present study host-virus interactions were investigated by assessment of HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) and host gene expression. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 18 ATLL, 10 HAM/TSP patients and 18 HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (ACs). DNA and mRNA of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted for PVL and LAT, BIM, c-FOS and RAD51 gene expression measurement using qRT-PCR. The mean PVL in ATLL patients was 11,430 +/- 3770 copies/10(4) which was statistically higher than ACs, 530 +/- 119 copies/10(4), (p < 0.001). The expression of BIM, and c-FOS in ATLL patients were higher than HTLV-1 ACs; however, there were no statistically significant differences. The expression of RAD51 as an essential player on DNA repair showed around 160 times increase in ATLL group (166 +/- 95) compared to ACs (1.04 +/- 0.34) which is statistically significant (p < 0.001). Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between RAD51 expression and HTLV-PVL. The expression of LAT as a central adaptor in TCR signaling interestingly was around 36 times higher in ATLL group than ACs (ATLL; 41.33 +/- 19.91 vs. ACs; 1.15 +/- 0.22, p < 0.001). This finding showed that TCR signaling pathway mainly provides the growth factors for transformed cells. Furthermore, the overexpression of RAD51 which has been induced in HTLV-1 infected cells as a consequence of virus replication is not able to overcome the DNA damage toward cell transformation.","['Ramezani, Samaneh', 'Shirdel, Abbas', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang', 'Akbarin, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Tarokhian, Hanieh', 'Rahimi, Hossein', 'Bari, Alireza', 'Jahantigh, Hamid Reza', 'Rezaee, Seyed Abdolrahim']","['Ramezani S', 'Shirdel A', 'Rafatpanah H', 'Akbarin MM', 'Tarokhian H', 'Rahimi H', 'Bari A', 'Jahantigh HR', 'Rezaee SA']","['Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, 9177948564, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, 9177948564, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Department, Ghaem Hospital, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, 9177948564, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, 9177948564, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, 9177948564, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, 9177948564, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Department, Ghaem Hospital, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, 9177948564, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Department, Ghaem Hospital, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, 9177948564, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Medical School, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, 9177948564, Mashhad, Iran.

We found that ROR1 associates with hematopoietic-lineage-cell-specific protein 1 (HS1) in freshly isolated CLL cells or in CLL cells cultured with exogenous Wnt5a. Wnt5a also induced HS1 tyrosine phosphorylation, recruitment of ARHGEF1, activation of RhoA and enhanced chemokine-directed migration; such effects could be inhibited by cirmtuzumab, a humanized anti-ROR1 mAb. We generated truncated forms of ROR1 and found its extracellular cysteine-rich domain or kringle domain was necessary for Wnt5a-induced HS1 phosphorylation. Moreover, the cytoplamic, and more specifically the proline-rich domain (PRD), of ROR1 was required for it to associate with HS1 and allow for F-actin polymerization in response to Wnt5a. Accordingly, we introduced single amino acid substitutions of proline (P) to alanine (A) in the ROR1 PRD at positions 784, 808, 826, 841 or 850 in potential SH3-binding motifs. In contrast to wild-type ROR1, or other ROR1(P-->A) mutants, ROR1(P(841)A) had impaired capacity to recruit HS1 and ARHGEF1 to ROR1 in response to Wnt5a. Moreover, Wnt5a could not induce cells expressing ROR1(P(841)A) to phosphorylate HS1 or activate ARHGEF1, and was unable to enhance CLL-cell motility. Collectively, these studies indicate HS1 plays an important role in ROR1-dependent Wnt5a-enhanced chemokine-directed leukemia-cell migration.","['Hasan, M K', 'Yu, J', 'Chen, L', 'Cui, Bing', 'Widhopf Ii, G F', 'Rassenti, L', 'Shen, Z', 'Briggs, S P', 'Kipps, T J']","['Hasan MK', 'Yu J', 'Chen L', 'Cui B', 'Widhopf Ii GF', 'Rassenti L', 'Shen Z', 'Briggs SP', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170503,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5670028,,,,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017133 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.133 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2615-2622. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.133.

Mass spectrometry on immune precipitates of Wnt5a-activated ROR1 identified 14-3-3zeta, which was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. The capacity of Wnt5a to induce ROR1 to complex with 14-3-3zeta could be blocked in CLL cells by treatment with cirmtuzumab, a humanized mAb targeting ROR1. Silencing 14-3-3zeta via small interfering RNA impaired the capacity of Wnt5a to: (1) induce recruitment of ARHGEF2 to ROR1, (2) enhance in vitro exchange activity of ARHGEF2 and (3) induce activation of RhoA and Rac1 in CLL cells. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of 14-3-3zeta in ROR1-negative CLL cell-line MEC1, and in MEC1 cells transfected to express ROR1 (MEC1-ROR1), demonstrated that 14-3-3zeta was necessary for the growth/engraftment advantage of MEC1-ROR1 over MEC1 cells. We identified a binding motif (RSPS(857)SAS) in ROR1 for 14-3-3zeta. Site-directed mutagenesis of ROR1 demonstrated that serine-857 was required for the recruitment of 14-3-3zeta and ARHGEF2 to ROR1, and activation of RhoA and Rac1. Collectively, this study reveals that 14-3-3zeta plays a critical role in Wnt5a/ROR1 signaling, leading to enhanced CLL migration and proliferation.","['Yu, J', 'Chen, L', 'Chen, Y', 'Hasan, M K', 'Ghia, E M', 'Zhang, L', 'Wu, R', 'Rassenti, L Z', 'Widhopf, G F', 'Shen, Z', 'Briggs, S P', 'Kipps, T J']","['Yu J', 'Chen L', 'Chen Y', 'Hasan MK', 'Ghia EM', 'Zhang L', 'Wu R', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Widhopf GF', 'Shen Z', 'Briggs SP', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Section of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170503,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5670032,,,,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017132 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.132 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2608-2614. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.132.

We previously demonstrated involvement of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor entinostat in regulating apoptosis in IBC and TNBC cells; here, we aimed to identify novel combination therapy candidates.Experimental Design: Potential therapeutic targets were identified by mRNA expression profiling of TNBC and IBC cells treated with entinostat. Drug action and synergism were assessed by in vitro proliferation assays, tumor growth in vivo, and proteomic analyses. Gain/loss-of-expression studies were utilized to functionally validate the role of identified targets in sensitivity of TNBC and IBC cells to combination therapy.Results: Entinostat induced activity of the oncogenic ERK pathway and expression of proapoptotic NOXA. These are known to stabilize and degrade, respectively, MCL1, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. In breast cancer patients, high-MCL1/low-NOXA tumor expression correlated significantly with poor survival outcomes. Combination treatment of entinostat with MEK inhibitor pimasertib reduced the growth of TNBC and IBC cells in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo The synergistic action of combination therapy was observed in TNBC and IBC cell lines in which NOXA expression was induced following entinostat treatment. The therapeutic activity depended on induction of mitochondrial cell death pathways initiated by NOXA-mediated MCL1 degradation.Conclusions: Our preclinical findings provide a rationale for the clinical testing of combination HDAC and MEK pathway inhibition for TNBC and IBC that exhibit elevated baseline tumor MCL1 expression.

CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are innate-like T lymphocytes strongly implicated in tumor surveillance. We investigated the impact of iNKT cells in the natural history of the disease in the Emu-Tcl1 (Tcl1) CLL mouse model and 68 CLL patients. We found that Tcl1-CLL cells express CD1d and that iNKT cells critically delay disease onset but become functionally impaired upon disease progression. In patients, disease progression correlates with high CD1d expression on CLL cells and impaired iNKT cells. Conversely, disease stability correlates with negative or low CD1d expression on CLL cells and normal iNKT cells, suggesting indirect leukemia control. iNKT cells indeed hinder CLL survival in vitro by restraining CD1d-expressing nurse-like cells, a relevant proleukemia macrophage population. Multivariable analysis identified iNKT cell frequency as an independent predictor of disease progression. Together, these results support the contribution of iNKT cells to CLL immune surveillance and highlight iNKT cell frequency as a prognostic marker for disease progression.","['Gorini, Francesca', 'Azzimonti, Laura', 'Delfanti, Gloria', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Scielzo, Cristina', 'Bertilaccio, Maria Teresa', 'Ranghetti, Pamela', 'Gulino, Alessandro', 'Doglioni, Claudio', 'Di Napoli, Arianna', 'Capri, Miriam', 'Franceschi, Claudio', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Bellone, Matteo', 'Dellabona, Paolo', 'Casorati, Giulia', 'de Lalla, Claudia']","['Gorini F', 'Azzimonti L', 'Delfanti G', 'Scarfo L', 'Scielzo C', 'Bertilaccio MT', 'Ranghetti P', 'Gulino A', 'Doglioni C', 'Di Napoli A', 'Capri M', 'Franceschi C', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Ghia P', 'Bellone M', 'Dellabona P', 'Casorati G', 'de Lalla C']","['Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', ""Istituto Dalle Molle di Studi sull'Intelligenza Artificiale, Universita della Svizzera Italiana/Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland."", 'Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Tumor Immunology Unit, Human Pathology Section, Department of Health Science, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Pathology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', ""Pathology Unit, Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine and Psychology, Roma Sapienza University, Sant'Andrea Hospital, Rome, Italy; and."", 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170502,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33258-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-11-751065 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jun 29;129(26):3440-3451. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-11-751065.

The inactivation after agonist withdrawal occurred in the same range (t1/2 = 25.3 +/- 2.2 s; mean +/- sem; n = 22) as described for other Galpha proteins. The interaction of Galpha13 and LARG and the thereby-induced LARG translocation to the plasma membrane were at least 1 order of magnitude more stable after agonist withdrawal, exceeding Galpha13 deactivation in the absence of LARG several fold.

We hypothesized that the actual prevalence of KSHV/HHV8 infection in humans is underestimated by the currently available serological tests. We analyzed four independent patient cohorts with post-surgical or post-chemotherapy sepsis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and post-surgical patients with abdominal surgical interventions. Levels of specific KSHV-encoded miRNAs were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and KSHV/HHV-8 IgG were measured by immunoassay. We also measured specific miRNAs from Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), a virus closely related to KSHV/HHV-8, and determined the EBV serological status by ELISA for Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) IgG. Finally, we identified the viral miRNAs by in situ hybridization (ISH) in bone marrow cells. In training/validation settings using independent multi-institutional cohorts of 300 plasma samples, we identified in 78.50% of the samples detectable expression of at least one of the three tested KSHV-miRNAs by RT-qPCR, while only 27.57% of samples were found to be seropositive for KSHV/HHV-8 IgG (P<0.001). The prevalence of KSHV infection based on miRNAs qPCR is significantly higher than the prevalence determined by seropositivity, and this is more obvious for immuno-depressed patients. Plasma viral miRNAs quantification proved that EBV infection is ubiquitous. Measurement of viral miRNAs by qPCR has the potential to become the ""gold"" standard method to detect certain viral infections in clinical practice.","['Fuentes-Mattei, Enrique', 'Giza, Dana Elena', 'Shimizu, Masayoshi', 'Ivan, Cristina', 'Manning, John T', 'Tudor, Stefan', 'Ciccone, Maria', 'Kargin, Osman Aykan', 'Zhang, Xinna', 'Mur, Pilar', 'do Amaral, Nayra Soares', 'Chen, Meng', 'Tarrand, Jeffrey J', 'Lupu, Florea', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Vasilescu, Catalin', 'Yeung, Sai-Ching Jim', 'Calin, George A']","['Fuentes-Mattei E', 'Giza DE', 'Shimizu M', 'Ivan C', 'Manning JT', 'Tudor S', 'Ciccone M', 'Kargin OA', 'Zhang X', 'Mur P', 'do Amaral NS', 'Chen M', 'Tarrand JJ', 'Lupu F', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Keating MJ', 'Vasilescu C', 'Yeung SJ', 'Calin GA']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; The RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNA Center, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, US.', 'UMF Carol Davila Bucharest, Romania and Fundeni Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Leukemia Department, Santa Anna Hospital, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'The RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNA Center, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Hereditary Cancer Program, Catalan Institute of Oncology, IDIBELL, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Molecular Morphology Laboratory, AC Camargo Cancer Center, Sao Paulo 01508-010, Brazil.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Cardiovascular Biology Research Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'UMF Carol Davila Bucharest, Romania and Fundeni Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; The RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNA Center, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

Pegylated arginase (BCT-100) has recently shown anti-tumor effects in hepatocellular carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia and melanoma. This study aims to investigate the effects of PEG-BCT-100 in MPM. METHODS: A panel of 5 mesothelioma cell lines (H28, 211H, H226, H2052 and H2452) was used to study the in vitro effects of BCT-100 by crystal violet staining. The in vivo effects of BCT-100 were studied using 211H and H226 nude mice xenografts. Protein expression (argininosuccinate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3, cyclins (A2, D3, E1 and H), CDK4 and Ki67) and arginine concentration were evaluated by Western blot and ELISA respectively. Cellular localization of BCT-100 was detected by immunohistochemistry and immunoflorescence. TUNEL assay was used to identify cellular apoptotic events. RESULTS: Argininosuccinate synthetase was expressed in H28, H226, and H2452 cells as well as 211H and H266 xenografts. Ornithine transcarbamylase was undetectable in all cell lines and xenograft models. BCT-100 reduced in vitro cell viability (IC50 values at 13-24 mU/ml, 72 h) across different cell lines and suppressed tumor growth in both 211H and H226 xenograft models. BCT-100 (60 mg/kg) significantly suppressed tumor growth (p < 0.01) with prolonged median survival (p < 0.01) in both xenograft models. Combining BCT-100 with pemetrexed or cisplatin conferred no additional benefits over single agents. Serum and intratumoral arginine levels were effectively decreased by BCT-100, associated with cytosolic accumulation of BCT-100 within tumor cells. Apoptosis (PARP cleavage in 211H xenografts; Bcl-2 downregulation, and cleavage of PARP and caspase 3 in H226 xenografts; positive TUNEL staining in both) and G1 arrest (downregulation of cyclin A2, D3, E1 and CDK4 in 211H xenografts; suppression of cyclin A2, E1, H and CDK4 in H226 xenografts) were evident with BCT-100 treatment. Furthermore, proliferative factor Ki67 was downregulated in BCT-100 treatments arms. CONCLUSIONS: BCT-100 suppressed tumor growth with prolonged median survival partially mediated by intratumoral arginine depletion resulting in apoptosis and G1 arrest in mesothelioma xenograft models.

We have already reported that epithelial-mesenchymal transition is involved in airway remodeling induced by eosinophils. Procaterol is a selective and full beta2 adrenergic agonist that is used as a rescue of asthmatic attack inhaler form and orally as a controller. In this study, we evaluated whether procaterol can suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition of airway epithelial cells induced by eosinophils. METHODS: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition was assessed using a co-culture system of human bronchial epithelial cells and primary human eosinophils or an eosinophilic leukemia cell line. RESULTS: Procaterol significantly inhibited co-culture associated morphological changes of bronchial epithelial cells, decreased the expression of vimentin, and increased the expression of E-cadherin compared to control. Butoxamine, a specific beta2-adrenergic antagonist, significantly blocked changes induced by procaterol. In addition, procaterol inhibited the expression of adhesion molecules induced during the interaction between eosinophils and bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting the involvement of adhesion molecules in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Forskolin, a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-promoting agent, exhibits similar inhibitory activity of procaterol. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these observations support the beneficial effect of procaterol on airway remodeling frequently associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.","['Kainuma, Keigo', 'Kobayashi, Tetsu', ""D'Alessandro-Gabazza, Corina N"", 'Toda, Masaaki', 'Yasuma, Taro', 'Nishihama, Kota', 'Fujimoto, Hajime', 'Kuwabara, Yu', 'Hosoki, Koa', 'Nagao, Mizuho', 'Fujisawa, Takao', 'Gabazza, Esteban C']","['Kainuma K', 'Kobayashi T', ""D'Alessandro-Gabazza CN"", 'Toda M', 'Yasuma T', 'Nishihama K', 'Fujimoto H', 'Kuwabara Y', 'Hosoki K', 'Nagao M', 'Fujisawa T', 'Gabazza EC']","['Allergy Center, Mie National Hospital, 357 Osato-kubota, Tsu, Mie, 514-0125, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie, 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie, 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie, 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie, 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie, 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie, 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie, 514-8507, Japan.', 'Allergy Center, Mie National Hospital, 357 Osato-kubota, Tsu, Mie, 514-0125, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie, 514-8507, Japan.', 'Allergy Center, Mie National Hospital, 357 Osato-kubota, Tsu, Mie, 514-0125, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie, 514-8507, Japan.', 'Allergy Center, Mie National Hospital, 357 Osato-kubota, Tsu, Mie, 514-0125, Japan.', 'Allergy Center, Mie National Hospital, 357 Osato-kubota, Tsu, Mie, 514-0125, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Edobashi 2-174, Tsu, Mie, 514-8507, Japan. gabazza@doc.medic.mie-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170502,England,Respir Res,Respiratory research,101090633,PMC5414161,['NOTNLM'],"['*Asthma', '*Eosinophils', '*Epithelial cells', '*Integrins']",,2017/05/04 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2017/05/04 06:00'],"['2017/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12931-017-0563-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12931-017-0563-4 [pii]']",epublish,Respir Res. 2017 May 2;18(1):79. doi: 10.1186/s12931-017-0563-4.,,20180226,,"['0 (Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists)', 'X7I3EMM5K0 (Procaterol)']",IM,"['Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists/administration & dosage', 'Bronchi/cytology/diagnostic imaging/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eosinophils/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Epithelial Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Procaterol/*administration & dosage', 'Respiratory Mucosa/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, later it was considered an amazing metal for its strength and flexibility, together with its diamond like hardness and its melting point which is the highest of any metal. It was first believed to be relatively inert and an only slightly toxic metal. Since early 2000, the risk exerted by tungsten alloys, its dusts and particulates to induce cancer and several other adverse effects in animals as well as humans has been highlighted from in vitro and in vivo experiments. Thus, it becomes necessary to take a careful look at all the most recent data reported in the scientific literature, covering the years 2001-2016. In fact, the findings indicate that much more attention should be devoted to thoroughly investigate the toxic effects of tungsten and the involved mechanisms of tungsten metal or tungsten metal ions.","['Zoroddu, Maria A', 'Medici, Serenella', 'Peana, Massimiliano', 'Nurchi, Valeria M', 'Lachowicz, Joanna I', 'Laulicht-Glickc, Freda', 'Costa, Max']","['Zoroddu MA', 'Medici S', 'Peana M', 'Nurchi VM', 'Lachowicz JI', 'Laulicht-Glickc F', 'Costa M']","['Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Sassari, Sassari.

This study was designed to determine whether the insurance status at diagnosis influences CML patient outcomes. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify 5784 patients, aged 15 years or older, who were diagnosed with CML between 2007 and 2012 and whose insurance status was documented at diagnosis. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival (OS). Covariates of interest included the age at diagnosis, race, ethnicity, sex, county-level socioeconomic status, and marital status. OS was evaluated with a log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier estimates. RESULTS: Among patients aged 15 to 64 years, insurance status was associated with OS (P < .001): being uninsured or having Medicaid was associated with worse 5-year OS in comparison with being insured (uninsured patients, 72.7%; Medicaid patients, 73.1%; insured patients, 86.6%). For patients who were 65 years old or older, insurance had less of an impact on OS (P = .07), with similar 5-year OS rates for patients with Medicaid and those with other insurance (40.2% vs 43.4%). In a multivariate analysis of patients aged 15 to 64 years, both uninsured patients (hazard ratio [HR], 1.93; P < .001) and Medicaid patients (HR, 1.83; P < .001) had an increased hazard of death in comparison with insured patients; patients younger than 40 years, female patients, and married patients also had a lower hazard of death. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CML patients under the age of 65 years who are uninsured or have Medicaid have significantly worse survival than patients with other insurance coverage.

METHODS: Lymphoid leukemia incidence rates for various countries from the International Agency for Research on Cancer were regressed on anemia prevalence rates from the World Health Organization in a cross-sectional analysis. Four decades of acute lymphoblastic leukemia incidence (from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program cancer registries) and anemia prevalence (from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) also were examined in a time-series analysis. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between leukemia incidence and anemia prevalence in 53 countries, with leukemia incidence being highest in those countries where anemia prevalence was lowest. Examination of US leukemia incidence and anemia prevalence trends from 1973 through 2012 revealed similarly contrasting trends, with leukemia incidence increasing while anemia prevalence was decreasing. White children had half as much anemia but twice as much leukemia as black children. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that the iron-depleted state may be unfavorable to leukemogenesis, perhaps because lymphopoiesis is suppressed when erythropoiesis is stimulated. Conversely, the iron-replete state may be more favorable to leukemogenesis.","['Groves, Frank D']",['Groves FD'],"['From the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, School of Public Health and Information Sciences, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,,,,,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/07/06 06:00,['2017/05/03 06:00'],"['2017/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000647 [doi]', 'SMJ50376 [pii]']",ppublish,South Med J. 2017 May;110(5):337-342. doi: 10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000647.,,20170705,,,IM,"['Anemia/complications/*epidemiology', 'Blacks', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistics as Topic', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After TPA-treatment, the levels of LAPTM5 mRNA and protein increased and reached a maximum at 18-36 h. In healthy human tissues, LAPTM5 mRNA was expressed at high levels in hematopoietic cells and tissues, at low levels in the lung and fetal liver, and was not detected in other non-hematopoietic tissues. LAPTM5 mRNA was detected in immature malignant cells of myeloid lineage, such as K562, HL-60, U937, and THP-1 cells, and in unstimulated peripheral T cells, but was absent or barely detectable in lymphoid malignant or non-hematopoietic malignant cells. The LAPTM5 level in HL-60 cells increased more significantly during TPA-induced monocyte/macrophage differentiation than during DMSO-induced granulocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of GFP-LAPTM5 or LAPTM5 in HeLa cells exhibited the localization of LAPTM5 to the lysosome. In HeLa cells overexpressing LAPTM5, the Mcl-1 and Bid levels declined markedly and apoptosis was induced via Bak activation, Deltapsim loss, activation of caspase-9, -8 and -3, and PARP degradation without accompanying necrosis. However, these LAPTM5-induced apoptotic events except for the decline of Bid level were completely abrogated by concomitant overexpression of Mcl-1. The pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) could suppress the LAPTM5-induced apoptotic sub-G1 peak by ~40% but failed to block the induced Deltapsim loss, whereas the broad-range inhibitor of cathepsins (Cathepsin Inhibitor I) could suppress the LAPTM5-induced apoptotic sub-G1 peak and Deltapsim loss, by ~22% and ~23%, respectively, suggesting that the LAPTM5-mediated Deltapsim loss was exerted at least in part in a cathepsin-dependent manner. Together, these results demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of LAPTM5 in HeLa cells induced apoptosis via cleavage of Mcl-1 and Bid by a LAPTM5-associated lysosomal pathway, and subsequent activation of the mitochondria-dependent caspase cascade.","['Jun, Do Youn', 'Kim, Hyejin', 'Jang, Won Young', 'Lee, Ji Young', 'Fukui, Kiyoshi', 'Kim, Young Ho']","['Jun DY', 'Kim H', 'Jang WY', 'Lee JY', 'Fukui K', 'Kim YH']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.', 'Institute of Life Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.', 'Institute for Enzyme Research, Division of Gene Regulatorics, University of Tokushima, Kuramoto-cho, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170502,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5413007,,,,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0176544 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-24030 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 May 2;12(5):e0176544. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0176544. eCollection 2017.,,20170905,,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '179801-28-6 (LAPTM5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Ectopic Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism/physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An age-, sex-, calendar time-, and practice-matched case-control study, nested in the broadly UK representative Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) primary care database, was analysed using conditional logistic regression to estimate the association between 21 of the most common specific malignancies and subsequent zoster risk. We adjusted for comorbid conditions and other potential confounders, and investigated effect modification by age and time since malignancy diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 192 081 adult zoster patients and 732 035 controls were included. Malignancy overall was positively associated with zoster risk (adjusted OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.27-1.32), and the association was especially strong for haematological malignancies (OR 2.46, 2.33-2.60). Among specific malignancies, there was evidence that oral, oesophageal, stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, ovarian, prostate, kidney, bladder, and CNS cancers, as well as lymphoma, myeloma, and leukaemia were associated with increased zoster odds (P0.05 in each case), but the magnitude of associations varied widely. The association was typically strongest within 2 years of malignancy diagnosis and decreased with older age for both haematological and solid malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Several cancers were associated with an increased risk of zoster, particularly within the first 2 years after diagnosis and among younger individuals. Knowledge that patients with a recent diagnosis of cancer are at high risk of zoster may encourage initiation of antiviral therapy earlier in the course of zoster when the benefits are greater. Evaluation of whether patients diagnosed with cancer would benefit from early zoster vaccination is warranted.","['Hansson, Erik', 'Forbes, Harriet J', 'Langan, Sinead M', 'Smeeth, Liam', 'Bhaskaran, Krishnan']","['Hansson E', 'Forbes HJ', 'Langan SM', 'Smeeth L', 'Bhaskaran K']","['Department of Non-Communicable Diseases Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.', 'Department of Non-Communicable Diseases Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.', 'Department of Non-Communicable Diseases Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.', 'Department of Non-Communicable Diseases Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.', 'Department of Non-Communicable Diseases Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170502,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,PMC5518853,,,,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/08/23 06:00,['2017/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['bjc2017124 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2017.124 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2017 Jun 6;116(12):1643-1651. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2017.124.

Bortezomib (BTZ), a reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, is very effective against MM but unable to eradicate the MM cells in bone marrow niche eventually causing the disease relapse. Homoharringtonine (HHT) is a known anti-leukemia drug that inhibits MM both in vitro and in vivo. This study aimed to investigate whether HHT could potentiate the anti-tumor activity of BTZ in MM cells cocultured with bone marrow stromal cells and in vivo xenograft models. We found that coculture of myeloma cells with a human stroma cell line significantly decreased the sensitivity of myeloma cells to BTZ treatment. HHT inhibited the proliferation of MM cells and potentiated the anti-myeloma effects of BTZ by inhibition of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways. HHT also enhanced the anti-myeloma effect of BTZ in vivo xenograft models. Taken together, our data suggest that HHT can enhance the anti-myeloma activity of BTZ both in vitro and in vivo, which may represent a new clinical treatment in MM.","['Chen, Ping', 'Yuan, Qin', 'Yang, Hui', 'Wen, Xiaofang', 'You, Peidong', 'Hou, Diyu', 'Xie, Jieqiong', 'Cheng, Yu', 'Huang, Huifang']","['Chen P', 'Yuan Q', 'Yang H', 'Wen X', 'You P', 'Hou D', 'Xie J', 'Cheng Y', 'Huang H']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital,29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, Fujian, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital,29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, Fujian, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital,29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, Fujian, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital,29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, Fujian, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital,29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, Fujian, PR China.', 'The Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital,29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, Fujian, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital,29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, Fujian, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital,29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, Fujian, PR China.', 'The Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital,29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, Fujian, PR China.

Patients and Methods Within the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial that compared a busulfan-based RIC with MAC in patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia. A total of 129 patients were enrolled from 18 centers. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and were stratified according to donor, age, and blast count. Results Engraftment was comparable between both groups. The CI of acute graft-versus-host disease II to IV was 32.3% after RIC and 37.5% after MAC ( P = .35). The CI of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 61.6% after RIC and 64.7% after MAC ( P = .76). The CI of nonrelapse mortality after 1 year was 17% (95% CI, 8% to 26%) after RIC and 25% (95% CI, 15% to 36%) after MAC ( P = .29). The CI of relapse at 2 years was 17% (95% CI, 8% to 26%) after RIC and 15% (95% CI, 6% to 24%) after MAC ( P = .6), which resulted in a 2-year relapse-free survival and overall survival of 62% (95% CI, 50% to 74%) and 76% (95% CI, 66% to 87%), respectively, after RIC, and 58% (95% CI, 46% to 71%) and 63% (95% CI, 51% to 75%), respectively, after MAC ( P = .58 and P = .08, respectively). Conclusion This prospective, randomized trial of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation provides evidence that RIC resulted in at least a 2-year relapse-free survival and overall survival similar to MAC in patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia.","['Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Iacobelli, Simona', 'Franke, Georg-Nikolaus', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Uddin, Ruzena', 'Hubel, Kai', 'Scheid, Christof', 'Weber, Thomas', 'Robin, Marie', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Heim, Dominik', 'Deliliers, Giorgio Lambertenghi', 'Onida, Francesco', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Pini, Massimo', 'Guidi, Stefano', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Gunther, Andreas', 'Bethge, Wolfgang', 'Poire, Xavier', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'van Os, Marleen', 'Brand, Ronald', 'de Witte, Theo']","['Kroger N', 'Iacobelli S', 'Franke GN', 'Platzbecker U', 'Uddin R', 'Hubel K', 'Scheid C', 'Weber T', 'Robin M', 'Stelljes M', 'Afanasyev B', 'Heim D', 'Deliliers GL', 'Onida F', 'Dreger P', 'Pini M', 'Guidi S', 'Volin L', 'Gunther A', 'Bethge W', 'Poire X', 'Kobbe G', 'van Os M', 'Brand R', 'de Witte T']","[""Nicolaus Kroger, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg; Georg-Nikolaus Franke, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig; Uwe Platzbecker, University Hospital Dresden, Dresden; Kai Hubel and Christof Scheid, University of Cologne, Cologne; Thomas Weber, University Hospital Halle (Saale), Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle; Matthias Stelljes, University of Munster, Munster; Peter Dreger, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg; Andreas Gunther, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel; Wolfgang Bethge, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen; Guido Kobbe, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany; Simona Iacobelli, Universita Tor Vergata, Rome; Giorgio Lambertenghi Deliliers and Francesco Onida, Fondazione IRCC Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milano, Milan; Massimo Pini, Azienda Ospedaliera SS.

Here we designed bisubstrate analogues-based inhibitors, by mimicking each substrate, the S-adenosyl-l-methionine and the deoxycytidine, and linking them together. This approach resulted in quinazoline-quinoline derivatives as potent inhibitors of DNMT3A and DNMT1, some showing certain isoform selectivity. We highlighted the importance of (i) the nature and rigidity of the linker between the two moieties for inhibition, as (ii) the presence of the nitrogen on the quinoline group, and (iii) of a hydrophobic group on the quinazoline. The most potent inhibitors induced demethylation of CDKN2A promoter in colon carcinoma HCT116 cells and its reactivation after 7 days of treatment. Furthermore, in a leukemia cell model system, we found a correlation between demethylation of the promoter induced by the treatment, chromatin opening at the promoter, and the reactivation of a reporter gene.","['Halby, Ludovic', 'Menon, Yoann', 'Rilova, Elodie', 'Pechalrieu, Dany', 'Masson, Veronique', 'Faux, Celine', 'Bouhlel, Mohamed Amine', 'David-Cordonnier, Marie-Helene', 'Novosad, Natacha', 'Aussagues, Yannick', 'Samson, Arnaud', 'Lacroix, Laurent', 'Ausseil, Frederic', 'Fleury, Laurence', ""Guianvarc'h, Dominique"", 'Ferroud, Clotilde', 'Arimondo, Paola B']","['Halby L', 'Menon Y', 'Rilova E', 'Pechalrieu D', 'Masson V', 'Faux C', 'Bouhlel MA', 'David-Cordonnier MH', 'Novosad N', 'Aussagues Y', 'Samson A', 'Lacroix L', 'Ausseil F', 'Fleury L', ""Guianvarc'h D"", 'Ferroud C', 'Arimondo PB']","['ETaC, Epigenetic Targeting of Cancer, CRDPF, CNRS-Pierre Fabre USR3388 , 3 Avenue H.

By incorporation of an indole or a quinoline moiety to the 9H-pyrimido[4,5-b]indole core, we identified a series of small molecules showing high binding affinities to BET proteins and low nanomolar potencies in inhibition of cell growth in acute leukemia cell lines. One such compound, 4-(6-methoxy-2-methyl-4-(quinolin-4-yl)-9H-pyrimido[4,5-b]indol-7-yl)-3,5-dimethy lisoxazole (31) has excellent microsomal stability and good oral pharmacokinetics in rats and mice. Orally administered, 31 achieves significant antitumor activity in the MV4;11 leukemia and MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer xenograft models in mice. Determination of the cocrystal structure of 31 with BRD4 BD2 provides a structural basis for its high binding affinity to BET proteins. Testing its binding affinities against other bromodomain-containing proteins shows that 31 is a highly selective inhibitor of BET proteins.

This is mostly due to the biocompatibility, biodegradability, and functional versatility of peptide chains. Such a potential for adaptability is particularly high in the case of recombinant proteins, which are produced in living cells and are suitable for genetic engineering. However, how the cell factory itself and the particular protein folding machinery influence the architecture and function of the final material is still poorly explored. In this study we have used diverse analytical approaches, including small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) to determine the fine architecture and geometry of recombinant, tumor-targeted protein nanoparticles of interest as drug carriers, constructed on a GFP-based modular scheme. A set of related oligomers were produced in alternative Escherichia coli strains with variant protein folding networks. This resulted in highly regular populations of morphometric types, ranging from 2.4 to 28 nm and from spherical- to rod-shaped materials. These differential geometric species, whose relative proportions were determined by the features of the producing strain, were found associated with particular fluorescence emission, cell penetrability and receptor specificity profiles. Then, nanoparticles with optimal properties could be analytically identified and further isolated from producing cells for use. The cell's protein folding machinery greatly modulates the final geometry reached by the constructs, which in turn defines the key parameters and biological performance of the material.","['Pesarrodona, Mireia', 'Crosas, Eva', 'Cubarsi, Rafael', 'Sanchez-Chardi, Alejandro', 'Saccardo, Paolo', 'Unzueta, Ugutz', 'Rueda, Fabian', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Laura', 'Serna, Naroa', 'Mangues, Ramon', 'Ferrer-Miralles, Neus', 'Vazquez, Esther', 'Villaverde, Antonio']","['Pesarrodona M', 'Crosas E', 'Cubarsi R', 'Sanchez-Chardi A', 'Saccardo P', 'Unzueta U', 'Rueda F', 'Sanchez-Garcia L', 'Serna N', 'Mangues R', 'Ferrer-Miralles N', 'Vazquez E', 'Villaverde A']","['Institut de Biotecnologia i de Biomedicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193 Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.

Proliferation of CLL cells is restricted to this protective niche, but the underlying mechanism(s) is/are not known. Treatment with BCR pathway inhibitors results in rapid reductions of total clone size, while CLL cell survival is not affected, which points towards inhibition of proliferation. In vitro, BCR stimulation does not induce proliferation of CLL, but triggering via Toll-like receptor, tumor necrosis factor or cytokine receptors does. Here, we investigated the effects of clinically applied inhibitors that target BCR signaling, in the context of proliferation triggered either via CD40L/IL-21 or after CpG stimulation. CD40L/IL-21-induced proliferation could be inhibited by idelalisib and ibrutinib. We demonstrate this was due to blockade of CD40L-induced ERK-signaling. Targeting JAKs, but not SYK, blocked CD40L/IL-21-induced proliferation. In contrast, PI3K, BTK as well as SYK inhibition prevented CpG-induced proliferation. Knockdown experiments showed that CD40L/IL-21 did not co-opt upstream BCR components such as CD79A, in contrast to CpG-induced proliferation. Our data indicate that currently applied BTK/PI3K inhibitors target antigen-independent proliferation in CLL, and suggest that targeting of JAK and/or SYK might be clinically useful.","['Slinger, E', 'Thijssen, R', 'Kater, A P', 'Eldering, E']","['Slinger E', 'Thijssen R', 'Kater AP', 'Eldering E']","['Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170502,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017129 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.129 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2601-2607. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.129.

Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are important regulators to maintain chromatin structure and control DNA damage; nevertheless, how each HDAC regulates genome stability remains unclear, especially under genome stress conditions. Here, we identified a mechanism by which HDAC3 regulates DNA damage repair and mediates resistance to chemotherapy drugs. In addition to inducing DNA damage, chemotherapy drugs trigger upregulation of HDAC3 expression in leukemia cells. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that HDAC3 contributes to chemotherapy resistance by regulating the activation of AKT, a well-documented factor in drug resistance development. HDAC3 binds to AKT and deacetylates it at the site Lys20, thereby promoting the phosphorylation of AKT. Chemotherapy drug exposure enhances the interaction between HDAC3 and AKT, resulting in decrease in AKT acetylation and increase in AKT phosphorylation. Whereas HDAC3 depletion or inhibition abrogates these responses and meanwhile sensitizes leukemia cells to chemotoxicity-induced apoptosis. Importantly, in vivo HDAC3 suppression reduces leukemia progression and sensitizes MLL-AF9(+) leukemia to chemotherapy. Our findings suggest that combination therapy with HDAC3 inhibitor and genotoxic agents may constitute a successful strategy for overcoming chemotherapy resistance.","['Long, J', 'Fang, W Y', 'Chang, L', 'Gao, W H', 'Shen, Y', 'Jia, M Y', 'Zhang, Y X', 'Wang, Y', 'Dou, H B', 'Zhang, W J', 'Zhu, J', 'Liang, A B', 'Li, J M', 'Hu, Jiong']","['Long J', 'Fang WY', 'Chang L', 'Gao WH', 'Shen Y', 'Jia MY', 'Zhang YX', 'Wang Y', 'Dou HB', 'Zhang WJ', 'Zhu J', 'Liang AB', 'Li JM', 'Hu J']","['Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Tissue Bank Biotechnology, Shanghai International Medical Zone, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Xuhui District Central Hospital, Zhongshan-Xuhui Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Research Center for Experimental Medicine, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170502,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017130 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.130 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2761-2770. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.130.

Our objective was to evaluate hematological parameters and aneuploidy in relation to quantitative exposure measures of formaldehyde. We obtained the study data for the original study (Zhang et al. 2010 ) and performed linear regression analyses. Results showed that differences in white blood cell, granulocyte, platelet, and red blood cell counts are not exposure dependent. Among formaldehyde-exposed workers, no association was observed between individual average formaldehyde exposure estimates and frequency of aneuploidy, suggested by the original study authors to be indicators of myeloid leukemia risk.","['Mundt, Kenneth A', 'Gallagher, Alexa E', 'Dell, Linda D', 'Natelson, Ethan A', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Gentry, P Robinan']","['Mundt KA', 'Gallagher AE', 'Dell LD', 'Natelson EA', 'Boffetta P', 'Gentry PR']","['a Ramboll Environ , Amherst , MA , USA.', 'a Ramboll Environ , Amherst , MA , USA.', 'a Ramboll Environ , Amherst , MA , USA.', 'b Houston Methodist Hospital - Texas Medical Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'c Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , New York , NY , USA.', 'd Ramboll Environ , Monroe , LA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170502,England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,,['NOTNLM'],"['Formaldehyde', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'hematopoietic cells', 'leukemia', 'myeloid leukemia']",,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/09/22 06:00,['2017/05/03 06:00'],"['2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10408444.2017.1301878 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2017 Aug;47(7):592-602. doi: 10.1080/10408444.2017.1301878.

We previously described the accumulation of extracellular ATP /AMP during chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in Jurkat human leukemia cells. In this study, we compared how different signaling pathways determine extracellular nucleotide pools in control Jurkat cells versus Jurkat lines that lack the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) or receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) cell death regulatory proteins. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced extrinsic apoptosis in control Jurkat cells and necroptosis in FADD-deficient cells; treatment of both lines with chemotherapeutic drugs elicited similar intrinsic apoptosis. Robust extracellular ATP/AMP accumulation was observed in the FADD-deficient cells during necroptosis, but not during apoptotic activation of Panx1 channels. Accumulation of extracellular ATP/AMP was similarly absent in RIP1-deficient Jurkat cells during apoptotic responses to chemotherapeutic agents. Apoptotic activation triggered equivalent proteolytic gating of Panx1 channels in all three Jurkat cell lines. The differences in extracellular ATP/AMP accumulation correlated with cell-line-specific expression of ectonucleotidases that metabolized the released ATP/AMP. CD73 mRNA, and alphabeta-methylene-ADP-inhibitable ecto-AMPase activity were elevated in the FADD-deficient cells. In contrast, the RIP1-deficient cells were defined by increased expression of tartrate-sensitive prostatic acid phosphatase as a broadly acting ectonucleotidase. Thus, extracellular nucleotide accumulation during regulated tumor cell death involves interplay between ATP/AMP efflux pathways and different cell-autonomous ectonucleotidases. Differential expression of particular ectonucleotidases in tumor cell variants will determine whether chemotherapy-induced activation of Panx1 channels drives accumulation of immunostimulatory ATP versus immunosuppressive adenosine within the tumor microenvironment.","['Boyd-Tressler, Andrea M', 'Lane, Graham S', 'Dubyak, George R']","['Boyd-Tressler AM', 'Lane GS', 'Dubyak GR']","['Department of Physiology & Biophysics (G.S.L., G.R.D.), Department of Pharmacology (A.M.B.-T., G.R.D.), and Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (G.R.D.), School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Physiology & Biophysics (G.S.L., G.R.D.), Department of Pharmacology (A.M.B.-T., G.R.D.), and Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (G.R.D.), School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Physiology & Biophysics (G.S.L., G.R.D.), Department of Pharmacology (A.M.B.-T., G.R.D.), and Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (G.R.D.), School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio george.dubyak@case.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170501,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,PMC5452061,,,,2017/05/04 06:00,2017/06/15 06:00,['2017/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/05/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['mol.116.104000 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.116.104000 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2017 Jul;92(1):30-47. doi: 10.1124/mol.116.104000.

To explore the features of human AML with the hotspot DNMT3A R882H mutation, we generated Dnmt3a R878H conditional knockin mice, which developed AML with enlarged Lin(-)Sca1(+)cKit(+) cell compartments. The transcriptome and DNA methylation profiling of bulk leukemic cells and the single-cell RNA sequencing of leukemic stem/progenitor cells revealed significant changes in gene expression and epigenetic regulatory patterns that cause differentiation arrest and growth advantage. Consistent with leukemic cell accumulation in G2/M phase, CDK1 was up-regulated due to mTOR activation associated with DNA hypomethylation. Overexpressed CDK1-mediated EZH2 phosphorylation resulted in an abnormal trimethylation of H3K27 profile.

Increased expression of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2), the receptor to thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), characterizes about half of DS-ALLs and also a subgroup of sporadic ""Philadelphia-like"" ALLs. To understand the pathogenesis of relapsed DS-ALL, we performed integrative genomic analysis of 25 matched diagnosis-remission and -relapse DS-ALLs. We found that the CRLF2 rearrangements are early events during DS-ALL evolution and generally stable between diagnoses and relapse. Secondary activating signaling events in the JAK-STAT/RAS pathway were ubiquitous but highly redundant between diagnosis and relapse, suggesting that signaling is essential but that no specific mutations are ""relapse driving."" We further found that activated JAK2 may be naturally suppressed in 25% of CRLF2(pos) DS-ALLs by loss-of-function aberrations in USP9X, a deubiquitinase previously shown to stabilize the activated phosphorylated JAK2. Interrogation of large ALL genomic databases extended our findings up to 25% of CRLF2(pos), Philadelphia-like ALLs. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of USP9X, as well as treatment with low-dose ruxolitinib, enhanced the survival of pre-B ALL cells overexpressing mutated JAK2. Thus, somehow counterintuitive, we found that suppression of JAK-STAT ""hypersignaling"" may be beneficial to leukemic B-cell precursors. This finding and the reduction of JAK mutated clones at relapse suggest that the therapeutic effect of JAK specific inhibitors may be limited. Rather, combined signaling inhibitors or direct targeting of the TSLP receptor may be a useful therapeutic strategy for DS-ALL.","['Schwartzman, Omer', 'Savino, Angela Maria', 'Gombert, Michael', 'Palmi, Chiara', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Huang, Jin-Yan', 'Hameiri-Grossman, Michal', 'Avigad, Smadar', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Geron, Ifat', 'Birger, Yehudit', 'Rein, Avigail', 'Zarfati, Giulia', 'Fischer, Ute', 'Mukamel, Zohar', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Vetere, Amedeo', 'Wagner, Bridget K', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Tanay, Amos', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Schwartzman O', 'Savino AM', 'Gombert M', 'Palmi C', 'Cario G', 'Schrappe M', 'Eckert C', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Huang JY', 'Hameiri-Grossman M', 'Avigad S', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Geron I', 'Birger Y', 'Rein A', 'Zarfati G', 'Fischer U', 'Mukamel Z', 'Stanulla M', 'Biondi A', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Vetere A', 'Wagner BK', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ', 'Tanay A', 'Borkhardt A', 'Izraeli S']","[""The Gene Development and Environment Pediatric Research Institute, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan 52621, Israel."", 'Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Medical School, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.', 'Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Department of Biological Regulation, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', ""The Gene Development and Environment Pediatric Research Institute, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan 52621, Israel."", 'Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Medical School, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology and Immunology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf 40225, Germany.', 'Centro Ricerca M.

Furthermore, we identified that miR-19b targeted A20 (TNFAIP3). A20 overexpression results in inactivation of NF-kappaB activity including decrease of phosphorylation of P65 and IkappaBalpha, leads to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation and cycle in CML CD34 (+) cells. Thus we proved that miR-17-92 is a critical contributor to CML leukemogenesis via targeting A20 and activation of NF-kappaB signaling.

Here we used miR-29a-deficient mice and the TAg model of pancreatic acinar carcinoma to functionally test the role of miR-29a in vivo. We found no impact of miR-29a loss on the development or growth of pancreatic tumours, nor on the survival of tumour-bearing mice. These results suggest that, despite differential expression, miR-29a is oncogenically neutral in the pancreatic acinar carcinoma context.

Interference with FLT3ITD signaling is therefore pursued as a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study we show that abrogation of FLT3ITD glycoprotein maturation using low doses of the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin has anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on FLT3ITD-expressing human and murine cell lines. This effect is mediated in part by arresting FLT3ITD in an underglycosylated state and thereby attenuating FLT3ITD-driven AKT and ERK signaling. In addition, tunicamycin caused pronounced endoplasmatic reticulum stress and apoptosis through activation of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and activation of the gene encoding CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). PERK inhibition with a small molecule attenuated CHOP induction and partially rescued cells from apoptosis. Combination of tunicamycin with potent FLT3ITD kinase inhibitors caused synergistic cell killing, which was highly selective for cell lines and primary AML cells expressing FLT3ITD. Although tunicamycin is currently not a clinically applicable drug, we propose that mild inhibition of N-glycosylation may have therapeutic potential in combination with FLT3 kinase inhibitors for FLT3ITD-positive AML.","['Tsitsipatis, Dimitrios', 'Jayavelu, Ashok Kumar', 'Muller, Jorg P', 'Bauer, Reinhard', 'Schmidt-Arras, Dirk', 'Mahboobi, Siavosh', 'Schnoder, Tina M', 'Heidel, Florian', 'Bohmer, Frank-D']","['Tsitsipatis D', 'Jayavelu AK', 'Muller JP', 'Bauer R', 'Schmidt-Arras D', 'Mahboobi S', 'Schnoder TM', 'Heidel F', 'Bohmer FD']","['Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Current address: Institute of Nutrition, Department of Nutrigenomics, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Current address: Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Martinsried, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Innere Medizin II, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz-Lipmann-Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'Innere Medizin II, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz-Lipmann-Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5432283,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3ITD', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'selective cytotoxicity', 'tunicamycin']",,2017/05/04 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['15772 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15772 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 18;8(16):26613-26624. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15772.,,20180305,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to mutation of the p53 gene itself, overexpression of major negative regulators of p53, MDM2 and MDM4, also act as drivers for tumor development. Recent studies suggest that expression of splice variants of Mdm2 and Mdm4 may be similarly involved in tumor development. In particular, multiple studies show that expression of a splice variant of MDM4, MDM4-S correlates with tumor aggressiveness and can be used as a prognostic marker in different tumor types. However, in the absence of prospective studies, it is not clear whether expression of MDM4-S in itself is oncogenic or is simply an outcome of tumorigenesis. Here we have examined the role of Mdm4-S in tumor development in a transgenic mouse model. Our results suggest that splicing of Mdm4 does not promote tumor development and does not cooperate with other oncogenic insults to alter tumor latency or aggressiveness. We conclude that Mdm4-S overexpression is a consequence of splicing defects in tumor cells rather than a cause of tumor evolution.","['Pant, Vinod', 'Larsson, Connie A', 'Aryal, Neeraj', 'Xiong, Shunbin', 'You, M James', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Lozano, Guillermina']","['Pant V', 'Larsson CA', 'Aryal N', 'Xiong S', 'You MJ', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Lozano G']","['Department of Genetics, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5432220,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Mdm4-S/Mdm4', 'Mdmx', 'splicing', 'transgenic mouse']",,2017/05/04 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/05/03 06:00'],"['2016/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['15552 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15552 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 18;8(16):25837-25847. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15552.,,20180305,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MDM4 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing']","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA047296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MPAL with a complex karyotype (three or more chromosomal abnormalities) is a cytogenetic subtype of MPAL associated with a poor prognosis, but limited data is available about the cytogenetic abnormalities present in this context. FINDINGS: Herein, we present the case of a 67-year-old female whose bone marrow biopsy revealed an extensive blast population showing dual morphologic differentiation, including lymphoblasts and larger myeloblasts with monocytic differentiation. Multiparametric immunophenotyping by flow cytometry revealed a blast population that was positive for CD45, CD19, CD22, CD34, CD38, and HLA-DR. The blast populations were also immunereactive for both myeloperoxidase and TdT; thus, a diagnosis of mixed phenotype acute leukemia was rendered. Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed a hyperdiploid composite karyotype with numerical abnormalities involving chromosomes 2, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 19, 20, 21, and 22, as well as structural abnormalities involving 1p, 1q, 9p, 16p, 17p, 19q, 20q, and a marker chromosome. Concurrent interphase and metaphase FISH studies were able to detect a deletion of CDKN2A/p16 at 9p21 and corroborated the presence of extra copies of chromosomes 8, 11, 20, and 22. CONCLUSIONS: This case provides further insight into the plethora of cytogenetic abnormalities not involving BCR-ABL1 and/or MLL present in MPAL with a complex karyotype and adds to the pool of cytogenetic information about this rare subset of hematological malignancies.","['Shabsovich, David', 'Schiller, Gary', 'Naeini, Yalda', 'Collins, Robert', 'Tirado, Carlos A']","['Shabsovich D', 'Schiller G', 'Naeini Y', 'Collins R', 'Tirado CA']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics, Allina Health, Minneapolis, MN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,,2017/05/02 06:00,2017/05/02 06:01,['2017/05/02 06:00'],"['2017/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/02 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2017;43(1):20-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two bone marrow samples received in the OHSU Knight Diagnostic Laboratories (KDL) Cytogenetics Laboratory for chromosomes and FISH for a question of progression of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to AML showed complex abnormalities including a deletion of chromosome 3q, one with del(3)(q13q25) and the other with del(3)(q22q25). In light of the prognostic importance of the activation of the MECOM oncogene and the concurrent inactivation of the GATA2 tumor suppressor that occurs with the classic inversion of chromosome 3q, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using two different probe designs to better define the 3q deletions in the two cases. Using the Abbott Molecular Laboratories dual fusion MECOM/RPN1 probe, interphase and metaphase cells in both patients showed a variant single fusion (orange/green/fusion) signal pattern consistent with fusion and deletion. Using the three-color (red/green/aqua) Cytocell EVI1 probe, interphase cells in both cases showed a split red/green signal with the aqua signal remaining with the green signal. The distance between the split signals was generally less than is usually seen in the commonly described inverted chromosome 3. These findings are therefore consistent with a complex inversion and concurrent deletion/deletions of chromosome 3q. Thus, the deletion 3q seen in G-banded chromosomes from bone marrow from these two patients is most consistent with the activation of MECOM and the inactivation of GATA2.","['Lawce, Helen', 'Szabo, Elina', 'Torimaru, Yumi', 'Davis, Craig', 'Osterberg, Karin', 'Olson, Susan', 'Moore, Steve']","['Lawce H', 'Szabo E', 'Torimaru Y', 'Davis C', 'Osterberg K', 'Olson S', 'Moore S']","['Knight Diagnostics Laboratories, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Diagnostics Laboratories, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Diagnostics Laboratories, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Diagnostics Laboratories, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Diagnostics Laboratories, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Diagnostics Laboratories, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Diagnostics Laboratories, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,,2017/05/02 06:00,2017/05/02 06:01,['2017/05/02 06:00'],"['2017/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/02 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2017;43(1):9-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the sixth most lethal cancer and accounts for 4% of all cancers. The main form of treatment for leukemia is chemotherapy. While some cancer types with a higher incidence than leukemia, such as lung and gastric cancer, have shown a sharp decline in mortality rates in recent years, leukemia has not followed this trend. Drug resistance is often regarded as the main clinical obstacle to effective chemotherapy in patients diagnosed with leukemia. Many resistance mechanisms have now been identified, and multidrug resistance (MDR) is considered the most important and prevalent mechanism involved in the failure of chemotherapy in leukemia. In order to reverse MDR and improve leukemia prognosis, effective detection methods are needed to identify drug resistance genes at initial diagnosis. This article provides a comprehensive overview of published approaches for the detection of MDR in leukemia. Identification of relevant MDR genes and methods for early detection of these genes will be needed in order to treat leukemia more effectively.","['Du, Ying', 'Chen, Baoan']","['Du Y', 'Chen B']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology (Key Department of Jiangsu Medicine), School of Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology (Key Department of Jiangsu Medicine), School of Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170418,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,PMC5402920,['NOTNLM'],"['MDR', 'detection approaches', 'leukemia', 'multidrug resistance']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2017/05/02 06:00,2017/12/23 06:00,['2017/05/02 06:00'],"['2017/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S134529 [doi]', 'dddt-11-1255 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2017 Apr 18;11:1255-1261. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S134529. eCollection 2017.,,20171222,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other malignancies, however, are often less sensitive. Searching for compounds sensitizing arsenic resistant tumours for ATO the plant polyphenols, chrysin and silibinin, and the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter inhibitor MK-571, respectively, were investigated in human glioblastoma A-172 cells. The sensitivity of A-172 cells to ATO was characterized by a median cytotoxic concentration of 6 muM ATO. Subcytotoxic concentrations of chrysin, silibinin and MK-571, respectively, remarkably increased the sensitivity of the cells to ATO by factors of 4-6. Isobolographic analysis revealed synergistic interaction of the polyphenols and MK-571, respectively, with ATO. Sensitization by chrysin was associated with depletion of cellular glutathione and increased accumulation of arsenic. In contrast, silibinin and also MK-571 increased the accumulation of arsenic more strongly but without affecting the glutathione level. The increase of arsenic accumulation could be attributed to a decreased rate of arsenic export and, additionally, in the case of silibinin and MK-571, to an increasing amount of irreversibly accumulated arsenic. Direct interaction with ABC transporters stimulating export of glutathione and inhibiting export of arsenic, respectively, are discussed as likely mechanisms of the sensitizing activity of chrysin and silibinin.","['Gulden, Michael', 'Appel, Daniel', 'Syska, Malin', 'Uecker, Stephanie', 'Wages, Franziska', 'Seibert, Hasso']","['Gulden M', 'Appel D', 'Syska M', 'Uecker S', 'Wages F', 'Seibert H']","['Institute of Toxicology and Pharmacology for Natural Scientists, University Medical School Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Brunswiker Str. 10, 24105 Kiel, Germany.

MRD-positive status was defined as positivity for leukemia-associated aberrant immune phenotypes or positivity for Wilms' tumor gene 1 in a single bone marrow sample. Recombinant human IFN-alpha-2b injections were administered subcutaneously 2 to 3 times per week for 6 months. The 2-year cumulative incidence of severe acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease after IFN-alpha treatment was 5.7% and 6.6%, respectively. Eighty-one patients (75.7%) turned MRD-negative after IFN-alpha treatment 1 month (42; 39.3%), 2 months (6; 5.6%), 3 months (7; 6.5%), and >3 months (26; 24.3%) after MRD-directed IFN-alpha treatment. Twelve patients showed relapse after IFN-alpha treatment, and 7 died of relapse. Four patients died of nonrelapse mortality (NRM).

Persistent MRD after IFN-alpha treatment was significantly associated with higher relapse risk and poorer survival.

Recently, a 2i culture method was reported using a combination of MEK inhibition (MEKi) and GSK3 inhibition (GSK3i) with LIF to maintain ESCs in a naive ground state. How 2i maintains a ground state of ESCs remains elusive. Here we show that MEKi and GSK3i maintain the ESC ground state by downregulating global DNA methylation through two distinct mechanisms. MEK1 phosphorylates JMJD2C for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Therefore, MEKi increased JMJD2C protein levels but decreased DNMT3 expression. JMJD2C promotes TET1 activity to increase 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels. GSK3i suppressed DNMT3 expression, thereby decreasing DNA methylation without affecting 5hmC levels. Furthermore, 2i increased PRDM14 expression to inhibit DNMT3A/B protein expression by promoting G9a-mediated DNMT3A/B protein degradation. Collectively, 2i allows ESCs to maintain a naive ground state through JMJD2C-dependent TET1 activation and PRDM14/G9a-mediated DNMT3A/B protein degradation.","['Sim, Ye-Ji', 'Kim, Min-Seong', 'Nayfeh, Abeer', 'Yun, Ye-Jin', 'Kim, Su-Jin', 'Park, Kyung-Tae', 'Kim, Chang-Hoon', 'Kim, Kye-Seong']","['Sim YJ', 'Kim MS', 'Nayfeh A', 'Yun YJ', 'Kim SJ', 'Park KT', 'Kim CH', 'Kim KS']","['Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Cancer Research, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38103, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul 02841, Republic of Korea.

The disease is characterized by an accumulation of myeloid precursor cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM). A small fraction of neoplastic cells in the CML clone supposedly exhibits self-renewal and thus long-term disease-propagating ability. However, so far, little is known about the phenotype, function, and target expression profiles of these leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Recent data suggest that CML LSCs aberrantly express the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain CD25. Whereas normal CD34(+)/CD38(-) BM stem cells display only low amounts of CD25 or lack CD25 altogether, CD34(+)/CD38(-) LSCs express CD25 strongly in more than 90% of all patients with untreated CML. As a result, CD25 can be used to identify and quantify CML LSCs. In addition, it has been shown that CD25 serves as a negative growth regulator of CML LSCs. Here, we review the value of CD25 as a novel marker and potential drug target in CML LSCs.","['Sadovnik, Irina', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Eisenwort, Gregor', 'Blatt, Katharina', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Mueller, Niklas', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Valent, Peter']","['Sadovnik I', 'Herrmann H', 'Eisenwort G', 'Blatt K', 'Hoermann G', 'Mueller N', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

Recently, several studies showed that ATRA may drive leukemic cells efficiently into differentiation and/or apoptosis in a subset of AML patients with an NPM1 mutation, a FLT3-ITD, an IDH1 mutation, and patients overexpressing EVI-1. Because not all patients within these molecular subgroups respond to ATRA and clinical trials that tested ATRA response in non-APL AML patients have had disappointing results, the identification of additional biomarkers may help to identify patients who strongly respond to ATRA-based therapy. Searching for response biomarkers might also reveal novel RA-based combination therapies with an efficient differentiation/apoptosis-inducing effect in non-APL AML patients. Preliminary studies suggest that the epigenetic or transcriptional state of leukemia cells determines their susceptibility to ATRA. We hypothesize that reprogramming by inhibitors of epigenetic-modifying enzymes or by modulation of microRNA expression might sensitize non-APL AML cells for RA-based therapy. AML relapse is caused by a subpopulation of leukemia cells, named leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which are in a different epigenetic state than the total bulk of the AML. The survival of LSCs after therapy is the main cause of the poor prognosis of AML patients, and novel differentiation therapies should drive these LSCs into maturity. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the epigenetic aspects of susceptibility to RA-induced differentiation in APL and non-APL AML.","['van Gils, Noortje', 'Verhagen, Han J M P', 'Smit, Linda']","['van Gils N', 'Verhagen HJMP', 'Smit L']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

This approach allowed the engraftment of leukemic samples that failed to engraft in NSG mice without humanized niches and resulted in a better preservation of leukemic stem cell self-renewal properties. To further improve our humanized niche scaffold model, we genetically engineered human MSCs to secrete human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and thrombopoietin (TPO). In vitro, these IL-3- and TPO-producing MSCs were superior in expanding human cord blood (CB) CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. MLL-AF9-transduced CB CD34(+) cells could be transformed efficiently along myeloid or lymphoid lineages on IL-3- and TPO-producing MSCs. In vivo, these genetically engineered MSCs maintained their ability to differentiate into bone, adipocytes, and other stromal components. Upon transplantation of MLL-AF9-transduced CB CD34(+) cells, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed in engineered scaffolds, in which a significantly higher percentage of myeloid clones was observed in the mouse compartments compared with previous models. Engraftment of primary AML, B-cell ALL, and biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL) patient samples was also evaluated, and all patient samples could engraft efficiently; the myeloid compartment of the BAL samples was better preserved in the human cytokine scaffold model. In conclusion, we show that we can genetically engineer the ectopic human BM microenvironment in a humanized scaffold xenograft model. This approach will be useful for functional study of the importance of niche factors in normal and malignant human hematopoiesis.","['Carretta, Marco', 'de Boer, Bauke', 'Jaques, Jenny', 'Antonelli, Antonella', 'Horton, Sarah J', 'Yuan, Huipin', 'de Bruijn, Joost D', 'Groen, Richard W J', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Carretta M', 'de Boer B', 'Jaques J', 'Antonelli A', 'Horton SJ', 'Yuan H', 'de Bruijn JD', 'Groen RWJ', 'Vellenga E', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Xpand Biotechnology BV, Bilthoven, The Netherlands.', 'Queen Mary University of London, School of Engineering and Materials Science, E1 4NS, London, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Centre Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.

Among the various subtypes, AML with the monosomal karyotype (AML-MK) has an extremely unfavorable prognosis. We performed screening to identify antitumor compounds that are capable of inducing apoptosis in primary leukemia cells harboring the AML-MK karyotype and identified a naturally occurring stilbene, Gnetin-C, with potent anti-tumor activities against AML cells from patients with various cytogenetic abnormalities, including patients with the AML-MK karyotype. Gnetin-C simultaneously inhibits the ERK1/2 and the AKT/mTOR pathways, two signals that are essential for the survival of leukemia cells. A combination of Gnetin-C with low doses of chemotherapeutic drugs led to synergistic anti-tumor effects against AML cells. In an immunodeficient mouse model of human leukemia, Gnetin-C attenuated the formation of leukemia, depleted leukemia cells and improved survival. These findings suggest that Gnetin-C has antitumor activities in AML and supports the therapeutic potential of blocking two different pathways in AML.","['Espinoza, J Luis', 'Elbadry, Mahmoud I', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi', 'Harada, Kenichi', 'Trung, Ly Quoc', 'Nakagawa, Noriharu', 'Takami, Akiyoshi', 'Ishiyama, Ken', 'Yamauchi, Takuji', 'Takenaka, Katsuto', 'Nakao, Shinji']","['Espinoza JL', 'Elbadry MI', 'Taniwaki M', 'Harada K', 'Trung LQ', 'Nakagawa N', 'Takami A', 'Ishiyama K', 'Yamauchi T', 'Takenaka K', 'Nakao S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa, Japan.

Embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency, defined as the ability to differentiate into all cell types in the adult body, is no exception. Maintenance and dissolution of pluripotency are tightly controlled by phosphorylation. As a result, key signalling pathways that regulate pluripotency have been identified and their functions well characterised. Amongst the best studied are the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-ERK1/2 pathway, PI3K-AKT, the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-JAK-STAT3 axis, Wnt-GSK3 signalling, and the transforming growth factor (TGF)beta family. However, these kinase pathways constitute only a small proportion of the protein kinase complement of pluripotent cells, and there is accumulating evidence that diverse phosphorylation systems modulate ESC pluripotency. Here, we review recent progress in understanding the overarching role of phosphorylation in mediating communication from the cellular environment, metabolism, and cell cycle to the core pluripotency machinery.","['Fernandez-Alonso, Rosalia', 'Bustos, Francisco', 'Williams, Charles A C', 'Findlay, Greg M']","['Fernandez-Alonso R', 'Bustos F', 'Williams CAC', 'Findlay GM']","['The MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit, School of Life Sciences, The University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 5EH, UK.', 'The MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit, School of Life Sciences, The University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 5EH, UK.', 'The MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit, School of Life Sciences, The University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 5EH, UK.', 'The MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit, School of Life Sciences, The University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 5EH, UK.

By treatment with dasatinib, he achieved complete hematological remission, but his difficulty in walking was not improved. His neurological symptom worsened together with an increase in body temperature and then disappeared together with a normalized body temperature, which may be attributed to the Uhthoff's phenomenon often observed in multiple sclerosis. He later developed acute fever, vomiting and a high adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, which was diagnosed as adrenal insufficiency. Eventually, he was diagnosed with a milder form of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) by increased levels of Very Long Chain Fatty Acids (VLCFAs) and genetic testing of the ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) gene. A missense mutation (c.521A>C, p.Tyr174Ser), previously reported to induce severe cerebral ALD, was detected in exon1.

A fusion protein Fn14.TRAIL, that combines soluble TRAIL molecule with a specific TWEAK receptor Fn14, is a better apoptosis-inducer for hepatocellular carcinomas than soluble TRAIL. However, Fn14.TRAIL does not effectively induce apoptosis in tumors of the lymphoid origin. As malignant cell apoptosis is strongly enhanced by secondary oligomerization of TRAIL, we tested the hypothesis that soluble Fn14.TRAIL can be oligomerized and become more active by adding TWEAK, a cytokine secreted in the tumor environment. We revealed that TWEAK and Fn14.TRAIL spontaneously formed a stable complex that induced apoptosis of malignant lymphoblasts earlier and more efficiently than TRAIL. The TWEAK-modified Fn14.TRAIL oligomer bound to target cells and delivered apoptotic signaling via TRAIL receptors. The oligomer induced faster and stronger cleavage of procaspase-8, -9, and -3; BID; poly-ADP ribose polymerase; and RIP compared to TRAIL. The oligomer also reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins c-FLIP short and cIAP-1. Our data indicate that Fn14.TRAIL can be converted into a highly effective TRAIL oligomer upon binding to TWEAK.","['Prigozhina, Tatyana B', 'Szafer, Fanny', 'Aronin, Alexandra', 'Tzdaka, Kobi', 'Amsili, Shira', 'Makdasi, Efi', 'Shani, Noam', 'Dranitzki Elhalel, Michal']","['Prigozhina TB', 'Szafer F', 'Aronin A', 'Tzdaka K', 'Amsili S', 'Makdasi E', 'Shani N', 'Dranitzki Elhalel M']","['Nephrology and Hypertension Department, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'KAHR Medical Ltd, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Nephrology and Hypertension Department, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'KAHR Medical Ltd, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'KAHR Medical Ltd, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'KAHR Medical Ltd, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'KAHR Medical Ltd, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Nephrology and Hypertension Department, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.

Of 10,923 patients, 262 (2.4%) had abnl(17p), 235 of whom were classified into the poor cytogenetic risk group according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. The median follow-up period was 1425 days. In abnl(17p) versus non-abnl(17p) patients of poor cytogenetic risk group, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival, cumulative incidence of disease relapse, and nonrelapse mortality rates at 5 years after allo-HSCT were 9.2% versus 27.4%, 7.8% versus 25.0%, 66.6% versus 49.4%, and 25.6% versus 25.6%, respectively. In contrast to the other types of abnl(17p), isochromosome 17q rarely encompassed the poor cytogenetic risk traits and did not adversely affect OS. Among the abnl(17p) patients, male sex, nonremission disease status at transplantation, and poor cytogenetic risk group were significantly associated with shorter OS. In conclusion, the presence of an abnl(17p) negatively affects allo-HSCT outcomes, which are influenced by the type of abnormality. Prompt initiation of allo-HSCT during complete remission may improve outcomes.","['Mori, Jinichi', 'Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Watakabe-Inamoto, Kyoko', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Ogawa, Hiroyasu', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Yano, Shingo']","['Mori J', 'Yanada M', 'Uchida N', 'Fukuda T', 'Sakura T', 'Hidaka M', 'Watakabe-Inamoto K', 'Kanamori H', 'Ogawa H', 'Ichinohe T', 'Tanaka J', 'Atsuta Y', 'Yano S']","['Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Hematology, Jyoban Hospital, Tokiwakai group, Fukushima, Japan.

Regular screening of these symptoms by the use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) could increase timely recognition and adequate symptom management. Moreover, self-management interventions intend to enhance knowledge and skills and empower patients to better manage their disease and related problems. The objective of the Lymphoma InterVEntion (LIVE) trial is to examine whether feedback to patients on their PROs and access to a web-based, self-management intervention named Living with lymphoma will increase self-management skills and satisfaction with information, and reduce psychological distress. METHODS/DESIGN: The LIVE randomised controlled trial consists of three arms: (1) standard care, (2) PRO feedback, and (3) PRO feedback and the Living with lymphoma intervention. Patients who have been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, as registered in the Netherlands Cancer Registry in various hospitals will be selected for participation. Patients are invited via their haemato-oncologist 6 to 15 months after diagnosis. The PRO feedback includes a graphical overview of patients' own symptom and functioning scores and an option to compare their scores with those of other patients with lymphoma and a normative population of the same age and sex. The Living with lymphoma intervention is based on cognitive behavioural therapy components and includes information, assignments, assessments, and videos. Changes in outcomes from baseline to 16 weeks, 12, and 24 months post intervention will be measured. Primary outcomes are self-management skills, satisfaction with information, and psychological distress. Secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life, illness perceptions, fatigue, and health care use. DISCUSSION/DESIGN: The results of the LIVE trial will provide novel insights into whether access to PRO feedback and the Living with lymphoma intervention will be effective in increasing self-management skills and satisfaction with information, and reducing distress. The LIVE trial is embedded in a population-based registry, which provides a unique setting to ascertain information on response, uptake, and characteristics of patients with lymphoma in web-based intervention(s). When effective, PRO feedback and Living with lymphoma could serve as easily and widely accessible interventions for coping with lymphoma.

The majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 1-eight-twenty one (ETO)(+) AML and a certain number of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have an abnormally high increase in PRAME expression level. The landscape of PRAME methylation requires evaluation in order to determine the most relevant sites and the exact association of its methylation with expression level and type of disease. In the present study, bone marrow samples collected from 8 AML1-ETO(+) AML, 4 MDS, 3 AML1-ETO(-) AML and 2 normal volunteers underwent bisulfate sequencing to analyze the methylation status of all four 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) regions within the entire PRAME gene. The median PRAME transcript level of 15 patients was 204.5% (range, 0.02-710.3%). PRAME transcript levels were inversely associated with the degree of methylation of the -389 to -146 CpG sites (r=-0.69; P=0.002) in the 3' part of the promoter region and the +132 to +363 CpG sites (r=-0.69; P=0.006) in the exon 1b region. However, not every sample strictly followed this correlation: Certain samples with high degrees of methylation demonstrated abnormally high expression levels, and vice versa. The methylation ratios of CpG sites in exon 1a were low for all samples (range, 0.0-13.8%), and those in exon 2 were similar in 16 samples (range, 72.4-93.4%), with the exception of one patient with high expression (425.2%) and significantly low degree of methylation in the PRAME gene (22.2%). MDS patients revealed similar methylation ratios in the 3' section of the promoter region, but tended to have lower methylation ratios in the exon 1b region (P=0.62 and P=0.09, respectively) compared with those observed in AML1-ETO(+) patients with AML and similar degree of PRAME overexpression. Therefore, the hypomethylation of CpG sites in the 3' part of the promoter region and in exon 1b was typically found with PRAME overexpression in AML and MDS. Methylation of other CpG islands, epigenetic and genetic mechanisms, and type of disease may also be involved.","['Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Zhang, Yan-Huan', 'Qin, Xiao-Ying', 'Zhu, Hong-Hu']","['Qin YZ', 'Zhang YH', 'Qin XY', 'Zhu HH']","[""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, P.R.

However, their usage may be limited due to the resistance of cancer cells to TNF-alpha- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Currently, there is interest in screening for natural products that can sensitize cancer cells to TNF-alpha- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis for their use in combination with TNF-alpha or TRAIL. It was previously reported that the bark extract of Thevetia peruviana showed a reversal effect on TRAIL-resistance in human gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines. In the present study, the effects of the ethanolic extract of T. peruviana flowers on TNF-alpha- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis of human cervical cancer HeLa cells were investigated in vitro by determining cell viability and apoptosis using a WST-1 cell proliferation assay and immunoblot analysis, respectively. The ethanolic extract of T. peruviana flowers promoted TNF-alpha and TRAIL-mediated cell death through the activation of the caspase cascade, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and BH3-interacting domain death agonist cleavage. Combined treatment using the extract plus TNF-alpha resulted in downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein, including myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1, B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and survivin, while the combined treatment with TRAIL downregulated Bcl-XL. Thus, the ethanolic extract of T. peruviana flowers has potential in sensitizing the TNF-alpha- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells via the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.","['Managit, Chittima', 'Sakurai, Hiroaki', 'Saiki, Ikuo']","['Managit C', 'Sakurai H', 'Saiki I']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Srinakharinwirot University, Nakhonnayok 26120, Thailand.', 'Department of Cancer Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Division of Pathogenic Biochemistry, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170217,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,PMC5403174,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma-extra large', 'HeLa cells', 'anti-apoptotic protein', 'cardiac glycosides', 'cervical cancer', 'death receptor', 'plant extract']",,2017/04/30 06:00,2017/04/30 06:01,['2017/04/30 06:00'],"['2015/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2017.5748 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-5748 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2017 Apr;13(4):2791-2798. doi: 10.3892/ol.2017.5748.

A microarray dataset (GSE32569) was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The R software package was used for data normalization and screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery was used to perform Gene Ontology analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to obtain the up- and downregulated pathways in ASPS. The Distant Regulatory Elements of co-regulated genes database was used to identify the transcription factors (TFs) that were enriched in the signaling pathways. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database and was visualized using Cytoscape software. A total of 71 DEGs, including 59 upregulated genes and 12 downregulated genes, were identified. Gene sets associated with ASPS were enriched primarily in four signaling pathways: The phenylalanine metabolism pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, the taste transduction pathway and the intestinal immune network for the production of immunoglobulin A. Furthermore, 107 TFs were identified to be enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway. Certain genes, including those coding for Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, kinase insert domain receptor, E-selectin and platelet-derived growth factor receptor D, that were associated with other genes in the PPI network, were identified. The present study identified certain potential target genes and the associated signaling pathways of cediranib action in ASPS, which may be helpful in understanding the efficacy of cediranib and the development of new targets for cediranib.","['Jiang, Wenhua', 'Liu, Pengfei', 'Li, Xiaodong', 'Wang, Ping']","['Jiang W', 'Liu P', 'Li X', 'Wang P']","[""Department of Radiotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sino-US Center of Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin 300060, P.R.

However, the clinical impact of WTAP on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is still unknown. A total of 145 patients who underwent surgical treatment from 2004 to 2008 were enrolled in the present study. The cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of WTAP in tumor and adjacent normal tissues was examined by immunohistochemical analysis in order to investigate the relationship between WTAP and the clinicopathological factors and prognosis of patients with PDAC. The nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of WTAP in tumor tissues was significantly higher compared with non-tumor tissues (P<0.001). High expression of WTAP in the nucleus was significantly associated with gender (P=0.010) and tumor stage (P=0.020), while high expression of WTAP in the cytoplasm was significantly associated with gender (P=0.018), histological grade (P=0.047) and perineural invasion (P=0.028). In addition, a univariate analysis revealed that high nuclear expression of WTAP in tumor tissues was significantly associated with poor overall survival (P<0.001), as well as several clinicopathological variables, including gender and N stage. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, nuclear WTAP expression was identified as an independent prognostic indicator for PDAC (relative risk, 1.855; 95% confidence interval, 1.033-3.333; P=0.039). The results of the present study indicated that high nuclear expression of WTAP is a valuable molecular biomarker of a poor prognosis among patients with PDAC.","['Li, Bing-Qi', 'Huang, Shuai', 'Shao, Qian-Qian', 'Sun, Jian', 'Zhou, Li', 'You, Lei', 'Zhang, Tai-Ping', 'Liao, Quan', 'Guo, Jun-Chao', 'Zhao, Yu-Pei']","['Li BQ', 'Huang S', 'Shao QQ', 'Sun J', 'Zhou L', 'You L', 'Zhang TP', 'Liao Q', 'Guo JC', 'Zhao YP']","['Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences/Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, P.R.

However, G-CSF has rarely been studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) immunotherapy. The present study performed a Transwell migration assay in vitro to determine the contribution of SDF-1alpha to the migration of leukemia cells, and the effects of G-CSF were evaluated. The effects of G-CSF on SDF-1alpha and Tregs in the AML microenvironment were examined, by employing a WEHI-3-grafted BALB/c mouse AML model (AML-M4). It is evident that G-CSF reversed immunosuppression of the AML microenvironment by reducing SDF-1alpha in bone marrow and elevating Tregs in the peripheral blood in in vivo studies. Furthermore, AML mice treated with vaccines combined with G-CSF achieved a longer survival time than those treated with vaccines without G-CSF, showing the efficiency of the regimen. The present study demonstrates the effects of G-CSF on the mobilization of leukemia cells and Tregs into the peripheral blood. In addition, immunotherapy with G-CSF priming represents a promising therapeutic strategy of targeting the immunosuppression.","['Chen, Jinqiu', 'Zhang, Miling', 'Zhou, Fuling', 'Wang, Jin', 'Niu, Ben', 'Zhang, Wanggang']","['Chen J', 'Zhang M', 'Zhou F', 'Wang J', 'Niu B', 'Zhang W']","[""Department of Clinical Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi 710004, P.R.

Novel treatment options for CLL include a new generation of purine analogs, antibodies and inhibitors of specific cell signaling pathways, which typically induce apoptosis or necrosis. A prospective analysis of patient blood samples revealed that a combination of four tests allowed the most appropriate and effective type of treatment to be selected prior to drug administration, and for the analysis of leukemic cell sensitivity to anticancer drug(s) during disease development. The comparative analysis of blood from the stable and progressive form of CLL in an individual patient revealed diversity in the response to anticancer agents. CLL peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with cladribine + mafosfamide (CM), fludarabine + mafosfamide, CM + rituximab, rituximab alone (Rit) or kinetin riboside (RK). A combination of cell viability, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profiles of nuclear preparations and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) protein expression analysis of the leukemic cells was performed to evaluate the anticancer effects of the tested agents during CLL development.

However, there are certain differences in biology between CML and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL). Little is known about the role and mechanism of hBMSCs on the growth of TKI-resistant Ph(+) ALL. The current study co-cultured hBMSCs with the TKI-resistant SUP-B15. Next, the proliferation of SUP-B15 was detected using a Cell Counting Kit-8. Additionally, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry were used to detect the expression of the associated genes and proteins. The present study explores the role and mechanism of hBMSCs on the growth of TKI-resistant Ph(+) ALL. The current study showed that hBMSCs promoted the proliferation of TKI-resistant Ph(+) ALL. This was shown by the increase in cells in the S+G2-M phase of the cell cycle. It was also found that the expression of cyclins A, C, D1 and E was increased. Apoptosis was inhibited through upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes [B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) and BCL-extra large] and downregulation of apoptotic genes (BCL-XS, BCL-2-associated X protein, and caspases 3, 7 and 9). Expression of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL) gene, Wnt5a, and Wnt signaling pathway-associated genes (glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, beta-catenin, E-cadherin and phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and transcription factors (c-myc, ephrin type-B2, fibroblast growth factor 20 and matrix metalloproteinase 7) was also increased. Furthermore, the expression of drug resistance genes (low-density lipoprotein receptor, multidrug resistance-associated protein and multi-drug resistance gene) was increased and the expression of anti-oncogenes (death-associated protein kinase and interferon regulatory factor-1) was decreased. It was concluded that hBMSCs promote the growth of TKI-resistant Ph(+) ALL by these aforementioned mechanisms. Therefore, targeting hBMSCs may be a promising approach for preventing the growth of TKI-resistant Ph(+) ALL.","['Zhang, Cheng', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Yang, Shi-Jie', 'Chen, Xing-Hua']","['Zhang C', 'Zhang X', 'Yang SJ', 'Chen XH']","['Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, P.R.

Studies have reported that neutrophil elastase (NE) cleaves bcr-1-derived PML-RAalpha in early myeloid cells, leaving only the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of PML attached to RARalpha. NLS-RARalpha promotes cell growth and inhibits differentiation in response to ATRA. However, the mechanisms by which NLS-RARalpha affects cell biological characteristics are yet to be fully elucidated. The present study found that the location of RARalphawas altered after it was cleaved by NE. Firstly, NE was overexpressed during the preparation of recombinant plasmid NB-4/pCMV6-NE-Myc to cleave PML-RARalpha. The total protein expression levels of myc and NE and expression levels of NLS-RARalpha in nucleoprotein were detected by western blotting. Location of NLS-RARalpha protein was detected by immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning. Secondly, a nude mice model was constructed and NE protein, NLS-RARalpha and RARalpha protein assays, and the location of NLS-RARalpha and RARalpha proteins were assessed as described. The present results showed that, compared with the control groups, the location of NLS-RARalpha protein was predominantly detected in the nucleus, whereas RARalpha was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. These findings were consistent with those of the nude mice model, and these may be used as a foundation to explain the occurrence mechanism of APL.","['Wang, Hui', 'Yang, Rong', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Zhu, Xin-Yu', 'Ma, Peng-Peng', 'Yang, Xiao-Qun', 'Jiang, Kai-Ling', 'Liu, Bei-Zhong']","['Wang H', 'Yang R', 'Zhong L', 'Zhu XY', 'Ma PP', 'Yang XQ', 'Jiang KL', 'Liu BZ']","['Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, P.R.

The present study observed that RSK1 was overexpressed in primary untreated leukemia patient bone marrow samples compared with the expression at the complete remission stage, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In addition, a high RSK1 expression (relative expression >/=10) was associated with a significantly shorter overall survival (P=0.038) compared with that in patients with low RSK1 expression (relative expression <10). The current study also investigated the effect of luteolin, a novel p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) inhibitor extracted from Reseda odorata L., which shows strong biochemical functions including anti-allergy, anti-inflammation and anti-cancer functions, in MOLM-13 and Kasumi-1 leukemic cells. The cell viability, apoptosis and migration ability analysis were assessed by performing a cell counting kit-8 assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and migration filter assay, respectively. The results indicated that luteolin inhibited the growth of the leukemic cell lines through induction of apoptosis, while the migration ability was also suppressed. Overexpression of RSK1 by plasmid transfection was found to decrease the luteolin-induced apoptosis and migration capabilities. By contrast, knockdown of the RSK1 expression by small interfering RNA appeared to induce the same effect as luteolin on MOLM-13 and Kasumi-1 leukemic cells. In conclusion, these results suggest that luteolin inhibits leukemic cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by inhibition of the RSK1 pathways.","['Deng, Lan', 'Jiang, Ling', 'Lin, Xianghua', 'Tseng, Kuo-Fu', 'Lu, Zhigang', 'Wang, Xiuju']","['Deng L', 'Jiang L', 'Lin X', 'Tseng KF', 'Lu Z', 'Wang X']","['Department of Hematology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510120, P.R.

We defined hub CM pairs and alternative CM groups based on the analysis result and finally proposed a formula to form an effective anti-AML prescription which combined the hub CM pairs with alternative CMs according to patients' molecular features.

The purpose of this study is to screen the possible target for HHT with virtual screening and verify the findings by cell experiments. Software including Autodock, Python, and MGL tools were used, with HHT being the ligand and proteins from PI3K-Akt pathway, Jak-stat pathway, TGF-beta pathway and NK-kappaB pathway as the receptors. Human AML cell lines including U937, KG-1, THP-1 were cultured and used as the experiment cell lines. MTT assay was used for proliferation detection, flowcytometry was used to detect apoptosis and cell cycle arrest upon HHT functioning, western blotting was used to detect the protein level changes, viral shRNA transfection was used to suppress the expression level of the target protein candidate, and viral mRNA transfection was used for over-expression. Virtual screening revealed that smad3 from TGF-beta pathway might be the candidate for HHT binding. In AML cell line U937 and KG-1, HHT can induce the Ser423/425 phosphorylation of smad3, and this phosphorylation can subsequently activate the TGF-beta pathway, causing cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in U937 cells and apoptosis in KG-1 cells, knockdown of smad3 can impair the sensitivity of U937 cell to HHT, and over-expression of smad3 can re-establish the sensitivity in both cell lines. We conclude that smad3 is the probable target protein of HHT and plays an important role in the functioning mechanism of HHT.","['Chen, Jian', 'Mu, Qitian', 'Li, Xia', 'Yin, Xiufeng', 'Yu, Mengxia', 'Jin, Jing', 'Li, Chenying', 'Zhou, Yile', 'Zhou, Jiani', 'Suo, Shanshan', 'Lu, Demin', 'Jin, Jie']","['Chen J', 'Mu Q', 'Li X', 'Yin X', 'Yu M', 'Jin J', 'Li C', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhou J', 'Suo S', 'Lu D', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Transplantation, Ningbo First Hospital, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Hematology Department of Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Estern Hospital, Ningbo, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5522237,['NOTNLM'],"['TGF-beta', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'homoharringtonine', 'smad3']",,2017/04/30 06:00,2018/04/03 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['16956 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16956 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 20;8(25):40318-40326. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16956.,,20180402,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SMAD3 protein, human)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Smad3 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is suggested that the initiation in utero by relevant exposures and/or inherited genetic variants and, other promotional postnatal exposures are probably required to develop leukaemia. This study aimed to map the incidence and analyse possible clusters in the geographical distribution of childhood acute leukaemia during the critical periods and to evaluate the factors that may be involved in the aetiology by conducting community and individual risk assessments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed all incident cases of acute childhood leukaemia (<15 years) diagnosed in a Spanish region during the period 1998-2013. At diagnosis, the addresses during pregnancy, early childhood and diagnosis were collected and codified to analyse the spatial distribution of acute leukaemia. Scan statistical test methodology was used for the identification of high-incidence spatial clusters. Once identified, individual and community risk assessments were conducted using the Paediatric Environmental History. RESULTS: A total of 158 cases of acute leukaemia were analysed. The crude rate for the period was 42.7 cases per million children. Among subtypes, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia had the highest incidence (31.9 per million children). A spatial cluster of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was detected using the pregnancy address (p<0.05). The most common environmental risk factors related with the aetiology of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, identified by the Paediatric Environmental History were: prenatal exposure to tobacco (75%) and alcohol (50%); residential and community exposure to pesticides (62.5%); prenatal or neonatal ionizing radiation (42.8%); and parental workplace exposure (37.5%) CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that environmental exposures in utero may be important in the development of childhood leukaemia. Due to the presence of high-incidence clusters using pregnancy address, it is necessary to introduce this address into the childhood cancer registers. The Paediatric Environmental History which includes pregnancy address and a careful and comprehensive evaluation of the environmental exposures will allow us to build the knowledge of the causes of childhood leukaemia.","['Carceles-Alvarez, Alberto', 'Ortega-Garcia, Juan A', 'Lopez-Hernandez, Fernando A', 'Orozco-Llamas, Mayra', 'Espinosa-Lopez, Blanca', 'Tobarra-Sanchez, Esther', 'Alvarez, Lizbeth']","['Carceles-Alvarez A', 'Ortega-Garcia JA', 'Lopez-Hernandez FA', 'Orozco-Llamas M', 'Espinosa-Lopez B', 'Tobarra-Sanchez E', 'Alvarez L']","['Pediatric Environmental Health Speciality Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Laboratory of Environment and Human Health (A5) Institute of Biomedical Research, IMIB-Arrixaca, Clinical University Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Pediatric Environmental Health Speciality Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Laboratory of Environment and Human Health (A5) Institute of Biomedical Research, IMIB-Arrixaca, Clinical University Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, University of Murcia, Murcia, Spain.

Two recent Children's Oncology Group protocols, AAML03P1 and AAML0531, directed additional intrathecal (IT) therapy to patients with CNS2 (</=5 white blood cell [WBC] with blasts) or CNS3 (>5 WBC with blasts or CNS symptoms) disease at diagnosis. METHODS: We examined disease characteristics and outcomes of the 1,344 patients on these protocols, 949 with CNS1 (no blasts), 217 with CNS2, and 178 with CNS3, with the latter two receiving additional IT therapy. RESULTS: Young age (P = 0.003), hyperleukocytosis (P < 0.001), and the presence of inversion 16 (P < 0.001) were the only factors more prevalent in patients with CNS2 or CNS3 disease. Complete remission at the end of induction (EOI) 2 was achieved less often in patients with CNS involvement (P < 0.001). From diagnosis, event-free survival (EFS) for patients with CNS involvement was significantly worse (P < 0.001), whereas overall survival (OS) was not (P = 0.16). From the EOI1, there was a higher relapse rate (RR) and worse disease-free survival (DFS), but less impact on OS (CNS1:DFS 58.9%, RR 34.1%, OS 69.3%; CNS2:DFS 53.2%, RR 40.9%, OS 74.7%; CNS3:DFS 45.2%, RR 48.8%, OS 60.8%; P = 0.006, P < 0.001, P = 0.045, respectively). Multivariable analysis showed that independently CNS2 and CNS3 status adversely affected RR and DFS. Traumatic diagnostic lumbar puncture was not associated with worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: CNS leukemia confers greater relapse risk despite more aggressive locally directed therapy. Novel approaches need to be investigated in this group of patients.","['Johnston, Donna L', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Woods, William G', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Gamis, Alan S']","['Johnston DL', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Aplenc R', 'Woods WG', 'Meshinchi S', 'Gamis AS']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Aflac Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Service, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia."", ""Division of Hematology Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinic, Kansas City, Missouri.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170428,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,PMC5647219,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CNS', 'therapy']",,2017/04/30 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2017/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26612 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Dec;64(12). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26612.

However, less is known about the role of central nervous system (CNS) TNF-alpha in CM. We assessed plasma (n=249) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n=167) TNF-alpha levels in Ugandan children with CM, plasma TNF-alpha in Ugandan community control children (n=198) and CSF TNF-alpha in North American control children who had recovered from leukaemia (n=13). Plasma and CSF TNF-alpha were measured by magnetic bead assay. We compared plasma and CSF TNF-alpha levels in children with CM to mortality, acute and chronic neurologic deficits and long-term neurocognitive impairment. Plasma and CSF TNF-alpha levels were higher in CM than control children (P<.0001 for both). CSF TNF-alpha levels were higher in children who had neurologic deficits at discharge or 6-month follow-up (P</=.05 for both). Elevated CSF but not plasma TNF-alpha was associated with longer coma duration (Spearman's rho .18, P=.02) and deficits in overall cognition in children 5 years and older (beta coefficient -.74, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.13, P=.02).

Because recent evidence indicates that GA-hMSCs drive tumor cell proliferation and stemness, we hypothesized that a higher percentage of GA-hMSCs in tumors predicts poor patient prognosis. Method: We determined the percentage of cells coexpressing GA-hMSC markers CD105+/CD73+/CD90+ from patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma and analyzed the association between this percentage and overall survival (OS) in 3 independent cohorts: fresh surgical glioblastoma specimens (cohort 1, N = 9), cultured tumor specimens at passage 3 (cohort 2, N = 28), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Results: In all cohorts, patient OS correlated with the percentages of GA-hMSCs in tumors. For cohort 1, the median OS of patients with tumors with a low percentage of triple-positive cells was 46 months, and for tumors with a high percentage of triple-positive cells, it was 12 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.02-0.5, P = .02). For cohort 2, the median OS of patients with tumors with a low percentage of GA-hMSCs was 66 months, and for tumors with a high percentage, it was 11 months (HR = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.13-0.9, P = .04). In the database of TCGA, the median OS times in patients with high and low coexpression levels of CD105/CD73/CD90 were 8.4 months and 13.1 months (HR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1-0.88; P = .04), respectively. Conclusions: The percentage of GA-MSCs inversely correlates with OS, suggesting a role for GA-MSCs in promoting aggressive behavior of gliomas.","['Shahar, Tal', 'Rozovski, Uri', 'Hess, Kenneth R', 'Hossain, Anwar', 'Gumin, Joy', 'Gao, Feng', 'Fuller, Gregory N', 'Goodman, Lindsey', 'Sulman, Erik P', 'Lang, Frederick F']","['Shahar T', 'Rozovski U', 'Hess KR', 'Hossain A', 'Gumin J', 'Gao F', 'Fuller GN', 'Goodman L', 'Sulman EP', 'Lang FF']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Unit 442, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Brain Tumor Center, Unit 442, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Unit 442, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Brain Tumor Center, Unit 442, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Unit 442, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Brain Tumor Center, Unit 442, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Unit 442, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Brain Tumor Center, Unit 442, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Unit 97, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Unit 97, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Unit 442, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Brain Tumor Center, Unit 442, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,PMC5464439,['NOTNLM'],"['*glioblastoma', '*mesenchymal stem cells', '*microenvironment', '*prognosis']",,2017/04/30 06:00,2018/03/15 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['now239 [pii]', '10.1093/neuonc/now239 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 2017 May 1;19(5):660-668. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/now239.,,20180314,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brain Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glioma/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2016.

Previous findings showed that mTORC1 activation depleted the population of leukemia stem cells in leukemia, while maintaining the stemness in pancreatic CSCs. The purpose of this study was to examine the currently unknown role and significance of mTORC1 activity in brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs). Methods: Basal mTORC1 activity and its kinetics were investigated in BTSC clones isolated from patients with glioblastoma and their differentiated progenies (DIFFs). The effects of nutrient deprivation and the mTORC1 inhibitors on cell proliferation were compared between the BTSCs and DIFFs. Tissue sections from patients with brain gliomas were examined for expression of BTSC markers and mTORC1 activity by immunohistochemistry. Results: BTSCs presented lower basal mTORC1 activity under each culture condition tested and a more rapid decline of mTORC1 activity after nutrient deprivation than observed in DIFFs. The self-renewal capacity of BTSCs was unaffected by mTORC1 inhibition, whereas it effectively suppressed DIFF proliferation. In agreement, immunohistochemical staining of glioma tissues revealed low mTORC1 activity in tumor cells positive for BTSC markers. In in vitro culture, BTSCs exhibited resistance to the antitumor agent temozolomide. Conclusions: Our findings indicated the importance of low mTORC1 activity in maintaining the undifferentiated state of BTSCs, implicating the relevance of manipulating mTORC1 activity when developing future strategies that target BTSCs.","['Han, Yi-Peng', 'Enomoto, Atsushi', 'Shiraki, Yukihiro', 'Wang, Shen-Qi', 'Wang, Xiaoze', 'Toyokuni, Shinya', 'Asai, Naoya', 'Ushida, Kaori', 'Ara, Hosne', 'Ohka, Fumiharu', 'Wakabayashi, Toshihiko', 'Ma, Jie', 'Natsume, Atsushi', 'Takahashi, Masahide']","['Han YP', 'Enomoto A', 'Shiraki Y', 'Wang SQ', 'Wang X', 'Toyokuni S', 'Asai N', 'Ushida K', 'Ara H', 'Ohka F', 'Wakabayashi T', 'Ma J', 'Natsume A', 'Takahashi M']","['Department of Pathology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Biological Responses, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Biological Responses, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,PMC5464440,['NOTNLM'],"['*brain tumor stem cell', '*cancer stem cell', '*glioma', '*mTORC1']",,2017/04/30 06:00,2018/03/15 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['now237 [pii]', '10.1093/neuonc/now237 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 2017 May 1;19(5):636-647. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/now237.,,20180314,,['EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)'],IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Glioblastoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2016.

However, there is no guidance as to their optimal sequence. Patients and methods: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of CLL patients treated with kinase inhibitors (KIs) or venetoclax. We examined demographics, discontinuation reasons, overall response rates (ORR), survival, and post-KI salvage strategies. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Results: A total of 683 patients were identified. Baseline characteristics were similar in the ibrutinib and idelalisib groups. ORR to ibrutinib and idelalisib as first KI was 69% and 81%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 17 months (range 1-60), median PFS and OS for the entire cohort were 35 months and not reached. Patients treated with ibrutinib (versus idelalisib) as first KI had a significantly better PFS in all settings; front-line [hazard ratios (HR) 2.8, CI 1.3-6.3, P = 0.01], relapsed-refractory (HR 2.8, CI 1.9-4.1, P < 0.001), del17p (HR 2.0, CI 1.2-3.4, P = 0.008), and complex karyotype (HR 2.5, CI 1.2-5.2, P = 0.02). At the time of initial KI failure, use of an alternate KI or venetoclax had a superior PFS when compared with chemoimmunotherapy. Furthermore, patients who discontinued ibrutinib due to progression or toxicity had marginally improved outcomes if they received venetoclax (ORR 79%) versus idelalisib (ORR 46%) (PFS HR .6, CI.3-1.0, P = 0.06). Conclusions: In the largest real-world experience of novel agents in CLL, ibrutinib appears superior to idelalisib as first KI.

The use of venetoclax upon ibrutinib failure might be superior to idelalisib.

Factors present at the time of childhood cancer diagnosis may identify patients who are vulnerable to poor adherence to follow-up. METHODS: This cohort of survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed from 1996 to 1999 at seven Consortium for New England Childhood Cancer Survivors institutions was evaluated for attendance at oncology clinics at 5 and 10 years from diagnosis. Demographic, socioeconomic, disease, and treatment characteristics were analyzed as risk factors for nonadherence to follow-up. RESULTS: Of 317 patients, 90% were alive 5 years from diagnosis and 88% of those remained in active follow-up. At 10 years from diagnosis, 88% were alive, 73% of whom continued in active follow-up. Insurance status at diagnosis was significantly associated with adherence at both 5 and 10 years. At 10 years, initial enrollment on therapeutic study was associated with increased attendance and central nervous system (CNS) leukemia with decreased attendance. In multivariable modeling of follow-up at 5 years, patients who were adults were less likely to participate and those with private insurance at diagnosis more likely to participate. At 10 years, insurance status at diagnosis remained a predictor of adherence to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this regional cohort, many patients who are survivors of ALL continue to participate in oncology care at 5 and 10 years from diagnosis. Factors known at diagnosis including insurance status, CNS leukemia, older age, and enrollment on therapeutic study were associated with differential attendance to follow-up visits.","['Welch, Jennifer J G', 'Kenney, Lisa B', 'Hirway, Priya', 'Usmani, G Naheed', 'Kadan-Lottick, Nina', 'Grewal, Satkiran S', 'Huang, Mary', 'Bradeen, Heather', 'Ader, Jeremy', 'Diller, Lisa', 'Schwartz, Cindy L']","['Welch JJG', 'Kenney LB', 'Hirway P', 'Usmani GN', 'Kadan-Lottick N', 'Grewal SS', 'Huang M', 'Bradeen H', 'Ader J', 'Diller L', 'Schwartz CL']","[""Hasbro Children's Hospital, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI."", ""Dana-Farber Boston Children's Hospital Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", ""Hasbro Children's Hospital, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI."", 'University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA.', 'Yale University School of Medicine and Smilow Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Bay State Medical Center, Springfield, MA.', 'Massachusettes General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'University of Vermont Medical Center, Burlington, VT.', ""Hasbro Children's Hospital, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI."", ""Dana-Farber Boston Children's Hospital Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", ""Hasbro Children's Hospital, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20170428,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cancer survivorship', 'pediatric cancer']",,2017/04/30 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26564 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Oct;64(10). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26564.

In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations in 24 patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML who were registered in the JALSG CML212 study. We identified 191 somatic mutations other than the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (median 8, range 1-17). Age, hemoglobin concentration and white blood cell counts were correlated with the number of mutations. Patients with mutations 6 showed higher rate of achieving major molecular response than those<6 (P=0.0381). Mutations in epigenetic regulator, ASXL1, TET2, TET3, KDM1A and MSH6 were found in 25% of patients. TET2 or TET3, AKT1 and RUNX1 were mutated in one patient each. ASXL1 was mutated within exon 12 in three cases. Mutated genes were significantly enriched with cell signaling and cell division pathways. Furthermore, DNA copy number analysis showed that 2 of 24 patients had uniparental disomy of chromosome 1p or 3q, which disappeared major molecular response was achieved. These mutations may play significant roles in CML pathogenesis in addition to the strong driver mutation BCR-ABL1.","['Togasaki, E', 'Takeda, J', 'Yoshida, K', 'Shiozawa, Y', 'Takeuchi, M', 'Oshima,

Thus, we investigated the severity and functional impairment of shoulder osteonecrosis in a well-characterized population of pediatric patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed orthopaedic clinic and physical therapy evaluations to determine range of motion (ROM), pain, and impact of magnetic resonance-defined osteonecrosis (ON) on activities of daily living. Adverse events were classified according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. RESULTS: We identified 35 patients (22 female), median age at cancer diagnosis 14.2 (range, 4.3 to 19) years; median age at ON diagnosis 16.7 (range, 5.5 to 28) years. Median time to last follow-up from diagnosis of primary malignancy was 6.4 (range, 0 to 12.7) years and from diagnosis of ON was 4.0 (range, 0 to 8.9) years. Twenty-two patients had magnetic resonance evidence of ON; 43 shoulders involved at least 30% of the articular surface of the capital humeral epiphyses.Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events mean scores for initial assessments of 55 shoulders (29 patients) showed moderate negative impact of ON on activity of daily living (1.94), decreased ROM limiting athletic activity (0.98), and mild to moderate levels of pain (1.38). Analysis of this group's most recent assessment showed improvement in pain and ON over time, with an average pain grade of 0.58 indicating no pain to mild pain, and 1.37 for ON grade, indicating asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic impact on activities of daily living. We also found minimal worsening average ROM grades (1.11). CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder ON is an underappreciated adverse late effect of therapy in children treated for leukemia/lymphoma which can limit quality of life and functionality. In most cases, pain and disability can be improved with treatment.

The cardioprotectant dexrazoxane can be used as prophylaxis to diminish risk for cardiomyopathy but whether it affects risk of relapse in pediatric AML is unclear. Our institution adopted the use of dexrazoxane before anthracyclines administration for all oncology patients in 2011. We compared patients with AML (ages, 0 to 21 y) who received or did not receive dexrazoxane during the years 2008 to 2013. In total, 44 patients with AML (ages, 4.5 mo to 21.7 y) were included. We identified no statistical difference in 2-year event rate (62% vs. 50%, P=0.41) or 2-year overall survival (69% vs. 69%, P=0.53) between patients receiving (n=28) or not receiving (n=16) dexrazoxane. Ejection fraction (P=0.0262) and shortening fraction (P=0.0381) trended significantly higher in patients that received dexrazoxane compared with those that did not receive dexrazoxane. Utilization of the cardioprotectant dexrazoxane before anthracycline chemotherapy in pediatric patients with AML demonstrated no significant difference in either event rate or overall survival relative to institutional controls and seems to improve cardiac function indices. Further studies in this patient population are needed to confirm these findings.","['Schloemer, Nathan J', 'Brickler, Molly', 'Hoffmann, Raymond', 'Pan, Amy', 'Simpson, Pippa', 'McFadden, Vanessa', 'Block, Joseph', 'Tower, Richard L 2nd', 'Burke, Michael J']","['Schloemer NJ', 'Brickler M', 'Hoffmann R', 'Pan A', 'Simpson P', 'McFadden V', 'Block J', 'Tower RL 2nd', 'Burke MJ']","[""*Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology-Blood and Marrow Transplantation daggerDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Quantitative Health Sciences section signDivision of Pediatric Cardiology, Medical College of Wisconsin double daggerDepartment of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,PMC5591641,,,,2017/04/30 06:00,2017/09/25 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000838 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2017 Jul;39(5):e254-e258. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000838.,,20170922,,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '048L81261F (Dexrazoxane)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/therapeutic use', 'Cardiomyopathies/drug therapy/etiology', 'Cardiotonic Agents', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexrazoxane/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Heart Function Tests/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",['T32 HL007209/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS896717'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, CREBBP expression and its clinical relevance in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia have not been elucidated. METHODS: We studied CREBBP mRNA expression in 349 patients treated with either the BCH-2003 or CCLG-2008 protocol. Using a receiver operating characteristic curve, patients were divided into low- or high-CREBBP. The association among clinicobiological characteristics, outcomes and CREBBP level was analysed. RESULTS: Low expression of CREBBP (<1.0) at diagnosis was found in 97.7% of patients and increased significantly after complete remission. Low-CREBBP patients were associated with unfavourable clinical presentations, poor prednisone response and high minimal residual disease (>10(-2) ) after induction. We found significantly poorer event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in low-CREBBP group whether administered BCH-2003 or CCLG-2008. Low-CREBBP was an inferior independent prognostic factor in BCH-2003; patients with low-CREBBP had better outcomes on an intermediate-risk regimen than a standard-risk regimen involving the CCLG-2008 protocol. Patients stratified to high-risk with low-CREBBP had the worst EFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that low-CREBBP is predictive of unfavourable outcomes; thus, a more intensive treatment protocol is necessitated for standard-risk patients with insufficient CREBBP and that a specific target therapy is necessitated for high-risk patients.","['Gao, Chao', 'Zhang, Rui-Dong', 'Liu, Shu-Guang', 'Zhao, Xiao-Xi', 'Cui, Lei', 'Yue, Zhi-Xia', 'Li, Wei-Jing',

However, the prognostic impact of HIP1 expression on AML remains unclear. In this study, quantification of HIP1 transcript by real-time quantitative PCR in bone marrow blasts was performed in 270 AML patients. As a result, high HIP1 expression was seen more frequently in older patients, M4/M5 morphology and genes of NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations, and underrepresented in favorable karyotype subgroups and CEBPA double allele mutations in our AML patients. We also found high HIP1 expressers showed lower levels of hemoglobin. In addition, overexpression of HIP1 was associated with an inferior overall survival. The prognostic value of HIP1 expression was validated in patients from an independent TCGA cohort. Notably, up-regulation of miR-16, miR-15a, miR-28 and miR-660 were seen in high HIP1 expressers from the two independent cohorts. In vitro, interfereing of HIP1 expression by siRNA suppressed the proliferation of leukemic cells, and downregulation of these miRNAs were seen in THP-1 and Kasumi cell lines after silencing HIP1 expression. In conclusion, the HIP1 gene expression might serve as a reliable predictor for overall survival in AML patients.","['Wang, Jinghan', 'Yu, Mengxia', 'Guo, Qi', 'Ma, Qiuling', 'Hu, Chao', 'Ma, Zhixin', 'Yin, Xiufeng', 'Li, Xia', 'Wang, Yungui', 'Pan, Hanzhang', 'Wang, Dongmei', 'Huang, Jiansong', 'Meng, Haitao', 'Tong, Hongyan', 'Qian, Wenbin', 'Jin, Jie']","['Wang J', 'Yu M', 'Guo Q', 'Ma Q', 'Hu C', 'Ma Z', 'Yin X', 'Li X', 'Wang Y', 'Pan H', 'Wang D', 'Huang J', 'Meng H', 'Tong H', 'Qian W', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170428,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5408226,,,,2017/04/30 06:00,2018/11/18 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['srep45960 [pii]', '10.1038/srep45960 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Apr 28;7:45960. doi: 10.1038/srep45960.,,20181116,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HIP1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these concepts are steadily finding their way into translation in various aspects of clinical practice, and provide prospects to improve AA management and inform therapeutic strategy development. In this review, we intend to discuss the pathophysiology and treatments with an emphasis on most recent developments to provide an update on our understanding of disease mechanisms. Areas covered: A literature search was undertaken addressing various aspects of pathophysiology with a focus on the role of immune system repertoire, telomeres and mutational events surrounding AA. We also reviewed upon the temporal evolution of treatment strategies in AA to the contemporary management of today and commented briefly upon the more recently investigated novel therapies and their expanding niche especially in the transplant and salvage setting. Expert commentary: Immune-mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, leading to a marrow devoid of hematopoietic elements, and peripheral pancytopenia are the hallmarks of AA. Recent studies have shed light on another facet of the disease - as a clonal disorder characterized by karyotypic abnormalities, genomic instability, telomere attrition, and recurrent somatic mutations reminiscent of myeloid malignancies. Further understanding of this underlying pathophysiology can help in improving prognostication and treatment of this disease.","['Boddu, Prajwal Chaitanya', 'Kadia, Tapan Mahendra']","['Boddu PC', 'Kadia TM']","['a Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170428,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Aplastic', '*alemtuzumab', '*antithymocyte globulin', '*clonal evolution', '*eltrombopag', '*immunosuppressive', '*telomere', '*transplant']",,2017/04/30 06:00,2017/06/10 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2017.1313700 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2017 May;10(5):433-448. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2017.1313700.

We examined these associations among survivors of childhood ALL treated with chemotherapy only. METHODS: Survivors of childhood ALL (male, n = 35 and female, n = 35; mean age, 14.3 years [standard deviation, 4.7 years] and mean years from diagnosis, 7.4 years [standard deviation, 1.9 years]) completed neurocognitive testing, behavioral ratings, and reported sleep quality and fatigue symptoms 5 years after diagnosis. Serum was collected concurrently and assayed for interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein. General linear modeling was used to assess associations among biomarkers and functional outcomes, adjusting for age and stratified by sex. RESULTS: Survivors performed worse than population norms on executive function and processing speed and reported more behavioral problems (P < .05 adjusted for multiple comparison). In female survivors, fatigue was associated with poor executive function (r = 0.41; P = .02), processing speed (r = 0.56; P < .001), and attention (r = 0.36-0.55; P < .05). Female survivors with frequent nighttime awakening displayed more inattention (P = .01), hyperactivity (P = .03), and aggression (P = .01). Worse executive function, processing speed, and behavioral symptoms were observed in female survivors with higher levels of IL-6, IL-1beta, and hsCRP (P < .05). Male survivors with high levels of TNF-alpha demonstrated worse organization (P = .03), but no significant associations between neurocognitive outcomes and sleep/fatigue measures were observed. CONCLUSION: Neurocognitive function in female survivors of childhood ALL appears more susceptible to the effects of sleep disturbance and fatigue. Systemic inflammation may play a role in neurocognitive impairment and behavioral symptoms. Cancer 2017;123:3410-9.

This study aimed to investigate ID4 methylation and its clinical relevance in myeloid malignancies. ID4 hypermethylation was associated with higher IPSS scores, but was not an independent prognostic biomarker affecting overall survival (OS) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, ID4 hypermethylation correlated with shorter OS and leukaemia-free survival (LFS) time and acted as an independent risk factor affecting OS in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Moreover, ID4 methylation was significantly decreased in the follow-up paired AML patients who achieved complete remission (CR) after induction therapy. Importantly, ID4 methylation was increased during MDS progression to AML and chronic phase (CP) progression to blast crisis (BC) in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Epigenetic studies showed that ID4 methylation might be one of the mechanisms silencing ID4 expression in myeloid leukaemia. Functional studies in vitro showed that restoration of ID4 expression could inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis in both K562 and HL60 cells. These findings indicate that ID4 acts as a tumour suppressor in myeloid malignancies, and ID4 methylation is a potential biomarker in predicting disease progression and treatment outcome.","['Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Li, Xi-Xi', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Guo, Hong', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Yang, Lei', 'Yan, Yang', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhou JD', 'Zhang TJ', 'Li XX', 'Ma JC', 'Guo H', 'Wen XM', 'Zhang W', 'Yang L', 'Yan Y', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170427,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,PMC5542913,['NOTNLM'],"['* ID4', '*methylation', '*myeloid malignancies', '*prognosis', '*progression']",,2017/04/30 06:00,2018/04/18 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2016/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13073 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2017 Aug;21(8):1468-1481. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13073.

METHODS: Post-HCT outcomes for 1458 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients from 2000 to 2011 were analyzed, and RD and URD transplants were compared. RESULTS: The median age was 37 years (range, 18-69 years). In the multivariate analysis, HLA 8/8 allele-matched URD recipients had similar transplant-related mortality (TRM) and all-cause mortality in comparison with RD recipients (hazard ratios [HRs], 1.16 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.91-1.48] and 1.01 [95% CI, 0.85-1.19], respectively); 7/8 URD recipients had a greater risk of TRM and all-cause mortality in comparison with RD recipients (HRs, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.47-2.52] and 1.29 [95% CI, 1.05-1.58], respectively). The risk of TRM and all-cause mortality was also greater for 7/8 URD recipients versus 8/8 URD recipients. Compared with RD recipients, both 8/8 and 7/8 URD recipients had a lower risk of relapse (HRs, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.62-0.97] and 0.75 [95% CI, 0.56-1.00], respectively). Both 8/8 and 7/8 URD recipients had a greater risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; HRs, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.76-2.70] and 2.65 [95% CI, 2.06-3.42], respectively) and chronic GVHD (HRs, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.06-1.55] and 1.46 [95% CI, 1.14-1.88], respectively) in comparison with RD recipients. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of RD transplantation, 8/8 URD transplantation is a viable alternative with similar survival outcomes, whereas 7/8 URD transplantation is associated with poorer overall survival.

Since it has been implemented into in treatment stratification strategies, cure rates have improved significantly for all age groups. Real time quantitative (RQ)-PCR of clonal immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements using allele-specific primers is currently regarded as the gold standard for MRD analysis in ALL, as it is not only highly sensitive and specific but also provides accurate MRD quantification. Following recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS), much attention has been devoted to the development of NGS-based MRD assays. This new technique can enhance sensitivity provided that sufficient numbers of cells are analyzed. Recent reports have shown that NGS-MRD also tends to be more specific for relapse prediction than RQ-PCR. In addition, NGS provides information on the physiological B- and T-cell repertoire during and after treatment, which has been shown to be prognostically relevant. However, before implementation of NGS-MRD detection in clinical practice, several issues must be addressed and the whole workflow needs to be standardized, including not only the analytical phase (spike-in calibrators, quality controls) but also the pre-analytical (e.g. sample preparation) and the post-analytical phases (e.g. bioinformatics pipeline, guidelines for correct data interpretation). These topics are currently addressed by a European network, the EuroClonality-NGS Consortium. In conclusion, NGS is a promising tool for MRD detection with the potential to overcome most of the limitations of RQ-PCR and to become the new gold standard for MRD detection in ALL.","['Kotrova, Michaela', 'Trka, Jan', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Bruggemann, Monika']","['Kotrova M', 'Trka J', 'Kneba M', 'Bruggemann M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Langer Segen 8-10, 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Langer Segen 8-10, 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Langer Segen 8-10, 24105, Kiel, Germany. m.brueggemann@med2.uni-kiel.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Marker Identification', 'Minimal Residual Disease', 'Minimal Residual Disease Detection', 'Multicolor Flow Cytometry']",,2017/04/30 06:00,2018/07/12 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40291-017-0277-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s40291-017-0277-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2017 Oct;21(5):481-492. doi: 10.1007/s40291-017-0277-9.,,20180711,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5514-5010'],"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",['AZV 16-32568A/Ministerstvo Zdravotnictvi Ceske Republiky'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assess by MRI the incidence and severity of clinical and subclinical long-term CMP in a cohort of adult APL patients in first complete remission with PETHEMA trials. Adult patients diagnosed with APL in first complete remission lasting >/=2 years underwent anamnesis and physical examination and were asked to perform a cardiac MRI. Clinical CMP was defined as radiographic and physical signs of heart failure accompanied by symptoms or by left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% by MRI with or without symptoms. Subclinical CMP was defined as the following MRI abnormalities: LVEF 45-50% or late gadolinium enhancement or two or more of LVEF </=55%, left ventricle end-diastolic volume index >/=98 ml/m(2), left ventricle end-systolic volume index >/=38 ml/m(2), right ventricle end-diastolic volume index >/=106 ml/m(2) and regional wall motion abnormalities. Of the 82 patients enrolled in the study, median cumulative dose of anthracyclines (doxorubicin equivalence) was 650 mg/m(2), and median time from APL diagnosis to the study was 87 months (range, 24-195). Seven out of 57 patients with available MRI (12%) had subclinical CMP (all of them showed late gadolinium enhancement in MRI), and none had clinical CMP. Among the 25 patients without MRI, none had CMP by chest X-ray and physical assessment. In summary, we found 12% of subclinical and no clinical late CMP assessed by MRI in APL patients treated with PETHEMA protocols. Due to the low number of patients, we must interpret our results cautiously.","['Rodriguez-Veiga, Rebeca', 'Igual, Begona', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Sayas, M feminine Jose', 'Linares, Mariano', 'Fernandez, Jose Maria', 'Salvador, Antonio', 'Maceira-Gonzalez, Alicia', 'Estornell, Jordi', 'Calabuig, Marisa', 'Pedreno, Maria', 'Roig, Monica', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Carretero, Carlos', 'Boluda, Blanca', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel']","['Rodriguez-Veiga R', 'Igual B', 'Montesinos P', 'Tormo M', 'Sayas MJ', 'Linares M', 'Fernandez JM', 'Salvador A', 'Maceira-Gonzalez A', 'Estornell J', 'Calabuig M', 'Pedreno M', 'Roig M', 'Sanz J', 'Sanz G', 'Carretero C', 'Boluda B', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Sanz MA']","['Hematology Department of the Hospital Universitario La Fe, Avda.

Of these, 30 (23%) experienced a relapse after achieving complete remission, and 13 (10%) had an isolated CNS relapse or combined CNS and BM relapses. We compared the characteristics of patients with and without CNS relapse and further analyzed CSF and BM samples from two of the 13 patients with CNS relapse. In both patients, classical sequencing analysis of the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 from the cDNA of CSF blasts revealed the pathogenic variant p.L387M. We also performed ultra-deep next-generation sequencing (NGS) in three samples from one of the relapsed patients.

With this study, the authors' intent was to characterize AML patients and to evaluate the clinical outcome associated with Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) coding pretreatment risk criteria/cytogenetic score. Between 2002 and 2010, 225 patients were diagnosed with AML at the Portuguese Institute of Oncology (Porto, Portugal). From this patient group, 128 patients aged <65 years were selected. The patients were treated using a combination of cytarabine and anthracycline, with the addition of cyclosporine when bone marrow dysplasia was observed. A median survival of 24 months was observed in this group. The patients were divided in subgroups according to the SWOG pretreatment risk criteria. We observed a statistically significant association of non-favorable SWOG coding with female gender [P=0.025; risk ratio (RR)=3.632, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.113-11.852], indication for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (P=0.023, RR=1.317, 95% CI: 1.184-1.465), complete response achievement (P=0.013, RR=1.385, 95% CI: 11.232-1.556) and relapse (P=0.048, RR=3.181, 95% CI: 10.966-10.478). Furthermore, SWOG pretreatment risk criteria also significantly affected global overall survival (OS; P=0.003) and OS at 5 years (P=0.001). A multivariate Cox regression analysis supported response to induction therapy (3-year OS: P=0.011, RR=0.385, 95% CI: 10.184-0.806; 5-year OS: P=0.012, RR=0.388, 95% CI: 10.597-1.994), consolidation (3-year OS: P=0.005, RR=0.328, 95% CI: 0.150-0.720; 5-year OS: P=0.002, RR=0.308, 95% CI: 0.144-0.657) and the diagnosis of therapy-related aml (3-year OS: P=0.016, RR=2.756, 95% CI: 0.486-1.281; 5-year OS: P=0.031, RR=2.369, 95% CI: 1.081-5.189) as prognostic factors, but this was not confirmed for SWOG pretreatment risk criteria. Therefore, we concluded that the reproducibility of the application of the SWOG pretreatment risk criteria may not be available as a prognostic factor in every acute leukemia population.

To provide further insights into the anti-tumor functions of GPS, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of GPS on apoptosis and the cell cycle of human leukemia cell line K562 cells, and its underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrated that GPS could inhibit K562 cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The transcription of P38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) mRNA were significantly augmented, while the transcription of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mRNA were significantly reduced following treatment with GPS compared with the control group (all P<0.05). In addition, GPS treatment markedly suppressed the expression of phosphorylated (p)-ERK, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65 and cyclin D1, and increased the synthesis of p-P38 and p-JNK protein expression, as evidenced by immunofluorescence and western blotting analyses. In conclusion, the results indicate that the GPS-mediated MAPK/NF-kappaB/cyclin D1 signaling pathway serves a crucial role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of K562 cells.","['Xiong, Wei', 'Li, Jing', 'Jiang, Rong', 'Li, Danyang', 'Liu, Zehong', 'Chen, Dilong']","['Xiong W', 'Li J', 'Jiang R', 'Li D', 'Liu Z', 'Chen D']","['Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, P.R.

From the eastern to western border of a time zone, social time is equal, whereas solar time is progressively delayed, producing increased discrepancies between individuals' social and biological circadian time. Accordingly, western time zone residents experience greater circadian disruption and may be at an increased risk of cancer.Methods: We examined associations between the position in a time zone and age-standardized county-level incidence rates for total cancers combined and 23 specific cancers by gender using the data of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (2000-2012), including four million cancer diagnoses in white residents of 607 counties in 11 U.S. states. Log-linear regression was conducted, adjusting for latitude, poverty, cigarette smoking, and state. Bonferroni-corrected P values were used as the significance criteria.Results: Risk increased from east to west within a time zone for total and for many specific cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (both genders) and cancers of the stomach, liver, prostate, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in men and cancers of the esophagus, colorectum, lung, breast, and corpus uteri in women.Conclusions: Risk increased from the east to the west in a time zone for total and many specific cancers, in accord with the circadian disruption hypothesis. Replications in analytic epidemiologic studies are warranted.Impact: Our findings suggest that circadian disruption may not be a rare phenomenon affecting only shift workers, but is widespread in the general population with broader implications for public health than generally appreciated.

So far, applications of FLT3 small molecule inhibitors have been investigated primarily in FLT3-ITD(+) patients. Only recently, a prolonged event-free survival has been observed in AML patients who were treated with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in addition to standard therapy. Here, we studied the sorafenib effect on proliferation in a panel of 13 FLT3-ITD(-) and FLT3-ITD(+) AML cell lines. Sorafenib IC50 values ranged from 0.001 to 5.6 mum, whereas FLT3-ITD(+) cells (MOLM-13, MV4-11) were found to be more sensitive to sorafenib than FLT3-ITD(-) cells. However, we identified two FLT3-ITD(-) cell lines (MONO-MAC-1 and OCI-AML-2) which were also sorafenib sensitive. Phosphoproteome analyses revealed that the affected pathways differed in sorafenib sensitive FLT3-ITD(-) and FLT3-ITD(+) cells. In MV4-11 cells sorafenib suppressed mTOR signaling by direct inhibition of FLT3. In MONO-MAC-1 cells sorafenib inhibited the MEK/ERK pathway. These data suggest that the FLT3 status in AML patients might not be the only factor predicting response to treatment with sorafenib.","['Roolf, Catrin', 'Dybowski, Nikolaj', 'Sekora, Anett', 'Mueller, Stefan', 'Knuebel, Gudrun', 'Tebbe, Andreas', 'Murua Escobar, Hugo', 'Godl, Klaus', 'Junghanss, Christian', 'Schaab, Christoph']","['Roolf C', 'Dybowski N', 'Sekora A', 'Mueller S', 'Knuebel G', 'Tebbe A', 'Murua Escobar H', 'Godl K', 'Junghanss C', 'Schaab C']","['From the double daggerDepartment of Medicine, Clinic III-Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, University of Rostock, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'section signEvotec (Munchen) GmbH, 82152 Martinsried, Germany.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Medicine, Clinic III-Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, University of Rostock, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Medicine, Clinic III-Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, University of Rostock, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Medicine, Clinic III-Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, University of Rostock, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'section signEvotec (Munchen) GmbH, 82152 Martinsried, Germany.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Medicine, Clinic III-Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, University of Rostock, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'section signEvotec (Munchen) GmbH, 82152 Martinsried, Germany.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Medicine, Clinic III-Hematology/Oncology/Palliative Care, Rostock University Medical Center, University of Rostock, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'section signEvotec (Munchen) GmbH, 82152 Martinsried, Germany; christoph.schaab@evotec.com.', 'paragraph signDepartment of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max-Planck Institute for Biochemistry, 82152 Martinsried, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170427,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,PMC5500767,,,,2017/04/30 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2017/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-9476(20)34196-7 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M117.067462 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2017 Jul;16(7):1365-1376. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M117.067462.

A t(5;11) chromosome translocation involving bands 5q32 and 11q13.4 was identified by metaphase chromosome analysis, and rearrangement of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) gene on 5q32 was demonstrated by FISH using a PDGFRB break-apart probe set. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) FISH mapping of the PDGFRB fusion partner gene narrowed the breakpoint at 11q13.4 to a 150 kb genomic region containing three genes, including NUMA1. Mate pair sequencing analysis demonstrated NUMA1-PDGFRB fusion. The fusion protein includes coiled-coil domains of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1 (NuMA1, involved in protein homodimerization and heteroassociation) and tyrosine kinase domains of PDGFRB. Diverse rearrangements involving the PDGFRB gene have been identified in myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia, but rearrangement of the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1 (NUMA1) gene has previously been reported in a human malignancy in only one instance, a NUMA1-RARA fusion caused by a t(11;17) translocation in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia. The NUMA1-PDGFRB fusion is the second instance of rearrangement of NUMA1, encoding an element of the mitotic apparatus, in human cancer.","['Zou, Ying S', 'Hoppman, Nicole L', 'Singh, Zeba N', 'Sawhney, Sameer', 'Kotiah, Sandy D', 'Baer, Maria R']","['Zou YS', 'Hoppman NL', 'Singh ZN', 'Sawhney S', 'Kotiah SD', 'Baer MR']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD; Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Mercy Medical Center, Baltimore, MD.', 'University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD; Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

RESULTS: In the Friend retrovirus mouse model, immunization with a plasmid encoding the Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) Leader-Gag protein resulted in induction of a strong GagL85-93-specific CD8(+) T cell response, while the response was completely abrogated by co-immunization with an F-MuLV Env-encoding plasmid. In order to overcome this interference of retroviral envelope, we employed plasmids encoding the cytokines interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL2, IL12, IL15, IL21, IL28A or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as genetic adjuvants. Co-application of plasmids encoding IL2, IL12, IL21, IL28A and especially GM-CSF rescued the induction of GagL85-93-specific CD8(+) T cells in mice vaccinated with FV Leader-Gag and Env. Mice that were immunized with plasmids encoding Leader-Gag and Env and the cytokines IL1beta, IL12, IL15, IL28A or GM-CSF, but not Leader-Gag and Env without any cytokine, showed significantly reduced viral loads upon a high-dose Friend virus challenge infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the potency of cytokine-encoding vectors as adjuvants and immune modulators in composite vaccines for anti-retroviral immunization.","['Bongard, Nadine', 'Lapuente, Dennis', 'Windmann, Sonja', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Tenbusch, Matthias', 'Bayer, Wibke']","['Bongard N', 'Lapuente D', 'Windmann S', 'Dittmer U', 'Tenbusch M', 'Bayer W']","['Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstr. 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, Institute of Hygiene and Microbiology, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstr. 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstr. 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, Institute of Hygiene and Microbiology, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstr. 179, 45147, Essen, Germany. wibke.bayer@uni-due.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170427,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC5408827,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adjuvant', '*Envelope', '*Friend retrovirus', '*Friend virus', '*Immune modulation', '*Immunosuppression', '*Retrovirus', '*Vaccine']",,2017/04/30 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2017/04/29 06:00'],"['2017/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-017-0352-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-017-0352-7 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2017 Apr 27;14(1):28. doi: 10.1186/s12977-017-0352-7.,,20180226,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5885-5592'],"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytokines/*genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immunization', 'Immunomodulation', 'Interleukin-15/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plasmids', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology', 'Vaccines, DNA/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified the relationship between malnutrition and treatment-related morbidity (TRM), abandonment of therapy, and survival of children with cancer in Nicaragua to better inform targeted nutritional interventions. PROCEDURE: We conducted a retrospective review of patients aged 6 months to 18 years with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Wilms tumor, Hodgkin lymphoma, or Burkitt lymphoma (BL) who were treated between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2007 at Children's Hospital Manuel de Jesus Rivera in Managua, Nicaragua. Statistical analysis examined the relations among nutritional status and cancer type, risk category, TRM, and event-free survival (EFS). RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of patients (189/282) were malnourished at diagnosis. Malnutrition was highest among patients with Wilms tumor (85.7%), BL (75%), and AML (74.3%). A total of 92.2% of patients (225/244) experienced morbidity during the first 90 days. Malnutrition was associated with severe infection (P = 0.033). Severely malnourished patients had >/=grade 3 TRM on more days (P = 0.023) and were more likely to experience severe TRM on >50% of days (P = 0.032; OR, 3.27 [95% CI, 1.05-10.16]). Malnourished patients had inferior median EFS (2.25 vs. 5.58 years; P = 0.049), and abandoned therapy more frequently (P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: In Nicaragua, pediatric oncology patients with malnutrition at diagnosis experienced increased TRM, abandoned therapy more frequently, and had inferior EFS. Standardized nutritional evaluation of patients with newly diagnosed cancer and targeted provision of nutritional support are essential to decrease TRM and improve outcomes.","['Pribnow, Allison K', 'Ortiz, Roberta', 'Baez, Luis Fulgencio', 'Mendieta, Luvy', 'Luna-Fineman, Sandra']","['Pribnow AK', 'Ortiz R', 'Baez LF', 'Mendieta L', 'Luna-Fineman S']","[""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Fellowship Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Manuel de Jesus Rivera, Managua, Nicaragua."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Manuel de Jesus Rivera, Managua, Nicaragua."", ""Department of Nutrition, Children's Hospital Manuel de Jesus Rivera, Managua, Nicaragua."", 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, and Cancer Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, California.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170427,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['low- and middle-income countries (LMIC)', 'malnutrition', 'morbidity', 'pediatric oncology']",,2017/04/28 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2017/04/28 06:00'],"['2016/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26590 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Nov;64(11). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26590.

This autosomal dominant condition is characterized by overgrowth, dysmorphic facial features and moderate intellectual disability. Missense and truncating point mutations, a small in-frame deletion, as well as microdeletion 2p23 have been reported. Moreover, DNMT3A is commonly somatically mutated in acute myeloid leukemia. We herein report a family with two siblings and their father affected by the syndrome. The proband is a 12 year-old boy with tall stature, macrocephaly, facial dysmorphism, and intellectual disability. His 10-year-old sister also has learning difficulties, overgrowth and mild facial dysmorphism. Their father is a 49 year-old man with tall stature, macrocephaly, learning difficulties, and minor facial dysmorphism. He had a right occipital osteoma removed at 20 years of age. A heterozygous splice site mutation NM_022552.4 (DNMT3A): c.2323-2A > T was found in the proband by whole exome sequencing analysis and by targeted Sanger Sequencing for the proband's sister and father. This mutation has not been previously reported and is believed to be pathogenic. Indeed, this substitution involves a highly conserved canonical splice site and is predicted to cause exon skipping. This is the first report of a familial transmission of DNMT3A-Overgrowth Syndrome, supporting the autosomal dominant inheritance. The proband's phenotype is more severe than that of his two other affected family members, which illustrates variable expressivity in the syndrome.","['Lemire, Gabrielle', 'Gauthier, Julie', 'Soucy, Jean-Francois', 'Delrue, Marie-Ange']","['Lemire G', 'Gauthier J', 'Soucy JF', 'Delrue MA']","['Departement de pediatrie, Service de genetique medicale, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Ste-Justine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de pediatrie, Service de genetique medicale, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Ste-Justine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de pediatrie, Service de genetique medicale, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Ste-Justine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de pediatrie, Service de genetique medicale, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Ste-Justine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170427,United States,Am J Med Genet A,American journal of medical genetics.

Targeting of BCL2 proteins can be directly toxic to tumour cells or render them more sensitive to chemotherapy. Inhibition of the anti-apoptotic functions of BCL2 proteins using structure-based design to produce specific inhibitors of protein-protein interactions has been achieved for BCL2, MCL1 and BCL-XL (also termed BCL2L1), providing an armamentarium of new targeted therapies called BH3-mimetics. The first BCL2-specific inhibitor, venetoclax, has shown extraordinary single agent activity in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), with surprisingly little toxicity given the expression of BCL2 in normal tissues. Despite success in CLL, where sensitivity to BCL2 inhibition is seen in nearly all cases, key questions have not yet been addressed. For example, responses to venetoclax in other B-cell and myeloid malignancies are heterogeneous, highlighting the need to identify biomarkers that correlate with response and, secondly, to identify/develop other specific compounds that synergise with BCL2 inhibition. In this review, we summarise the biology of BCL2 proteins, the mechanism of action of BH3-mimetics and the status of their clinical development in haematological malignancies.","['Vogler, Meike', 'Walter, Harriet S', 'Dyer, Martin J S']","['Vogler M', 'Walter HS', 'Dyer MJS']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Paediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170427,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell lymphoma 2', '*BH3-mimetics', '*apoptosis', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*venetoclax']",,2017/04/28 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2017/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14684 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Aug;178(3):364-379. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14684.

We assessed 826 consecutive patients at our institution with over 12 years of follow-up for the occurrence of LGL lymphocytosis after allo-HCT. The 3-year cumulative incidence of LGL lymphocytosis was 14.5% with a median duration of over 3.5 years. The development of LGL lymphocytosis was strongly correlated with CMV viremia and GVHD. The clinical course of patients with LGL lymphocytosis after allo-HCT was indolent, with the majority of these patients not displaying any clinical signs or symptoms related to the LGL proliferation. LGL lymphocytosis was associated with better outcomes, including higher overall survival (OS 86.6% vs 44.7% at 3 years), lower non-relapse mortality (NRM 5.5% vs 30.4% at 3 years), and lower risk of relapse (8.9% vs 22.9% at 3 years). A time-dependent multivariable analysis confirmed the favorable impact of LGL lymphocytosis on OS and NRM, but not on the risk of relapse. In multivariable analysis, a longer duration of LGL lymphocytosis was associated with better OS and NRM. Improved immunomodulatory properties of these cells, regulating GVHD and infections, may explain the observed favorable outcomes of patients who developed LGL lymphocytosis following allo-HCT.","['Poch Martell, Marc', 'Hamad, Nada', 'Shin, Elizabeth', 'Moon, Joon Ho', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Uhm, Jieun', 'Michelis, Fotios V', 'Viswabandya, Auro', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Messner, Hans A', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan']","['Poch Martell M', 'Hamad N', 'Shin E', 'Moon JH', 'Sohn SK', 'Uhm J', 'Michelis FV', 'Viswabandya A', 'Lipton JH', 'Messner HA', 'Kim DDH']","['Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170530,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'cytomegalovirus', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'large granular lymphocytosis']",,2017/04/28 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.12899 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2017 Aug;99(2):160-168. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12899.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of anesthetics on the offspring of rats, and to identify the potential mechanisms underlying these effects. On day 14 of pregnancy, SpragueDawley rats were equally divided into the following 3 groups (n=9): Control group (n=3), 3% sevoflurane group (n=3) and 4% sevoflurane group (n=3). Following birth of the offspring, the juvenile rats were assessed using an openfield test, Morris water maze and a continuous passive avoidance test on different days to determine their learning abilities and memory. Western blot and reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) analyses were used to examine the expression of multiple critical factors associated with the proliferation and apoptosis of nerve cells, including Ki67, nestin, B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), BCL2 associated X (Bax) and caspase3. Additionally, the level of adenosine triphosphate production among the 3 groups were compared. Furthermore, expression alterations in of glycogen synthase kinase3beta (GSK3beta) and betacatenin were examined. The Morris water maze experiment revealed that an increased concentration of sevoflurane exposure significantly reduced the learning and memory abilities of the juvenile rats when compared with controls. In addition, western blotting and RT-qPCR analyses determined that the protein and mRNA expression levels of Bax, caspase3 and GSK3beta were significantly increased relative to the controls. By contrast, the expression levels of nestin, Ki67, Bcl2 and betacatenin were significantly reduced. The results of the present study suggest that exposure of pregnant mice to sevoflurane anesthesia demonstrates a negative effect on the learning and memory abilities of their offspring, and the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway may be involved in this process.","['Wang, Yiyao', 'Li, Yu', 'Xing, Qunzhi', 'Han, Xuechan G', 'Dong, Xu', 'Lu, Yiping', 'Zhou, Mintao']","['Wang Y', 'Li Y', 'Xing Q', 'Han XG', 'Dong X', 'Lu Y', 'Zhou M']","['Department of Anesthesiology, The First Affiliated Hospital and College of Clinical Medicine, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, Henan 471003, P.R.

In the present study, it was demonstrated that PAR1 serves a vital role in heat stressinduced HUVEC apoptosis. When the PAR1 inhibitor, SCH79797 (SCH), or a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting PAR1 were used to inhibit PAR1 signaling, a marked decrease in cell apoptosis, caspase3 activity and the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) associated X (Bax), as well as increased expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl2 family member, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1), were observed. In addition, heat stressinduced apoptosis, caspase3 activity and the expression of Bax were significantly increased following administration of the PAR1 agonist, TFLLRNH2 or adenovirus overexpression of PAR1. This was accompanied by decreased protein expression levels of Mcl1. Furthermore, it was identified that the DNA binding activity of the nuclear factor (NF)kappaB p65 subunit increased and cJun activation was reduced as a result of inhibition of PAR1 signaling by SCH or siRNAmediated PAR1 knockdown in heat stressinduced HUVECs. Additionally, our previous study reported that NFkappaB p65 activation may have an antiapoptosis effect on heat stressed HUVECs, whereas in the present study cJun activation had a proapoptosis effect on heat stressed HUVECs. Taken together, these results indicated that PAR1 signalingmediated cJun activation promotes early apoptosis of HUVEC cells induced by heat stress.","['Zhang, Shuang', 'Liu, Yanan', 'Wang, Zhenglian', 'Liu, Jingxian', 'Gu, Zhengtao', 'Xu, Qiulin', 'Su, Lei']","['Zhang S', 'Liu Y', 'Wang Z', 'Liu J', 'Gu Z', 'Xu Q', 'Su L']","['Department of Graduate School, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, P.R.

This antioxidant activity of alpha-tocopherol can help to prevent cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis and cancer. We investigated the alpha-tocopherol level and the expression of alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) in the leukocytes of children with leukemia. The plasma and erythrocyte alpha-tocopherol levels did not differ between children with leukemia and the control group. However, lymphocytes from children with leukemia had significantly lower alpha-tocopherol levels than lymphocytes from the controls (58.4+/-39.0 ng/mg protein versus 188.9+/-133.6, respectively; p&lt;0.05), despite the higher plasma alpha-tocopherol/cholesterol ratio in the leukemia group (5.83+/-1.64 mumol/mmol versus 4.34+/-0.96, respectively; p&lt;0.05). No significant differences in the plasma and leukocyte levels of isoprostanes (the oxidative metabolites of arachidonic acid) were seen between the leukemia patients and controls. The plasma level of acrolein, a marker of oxidative stress, was also similar in the two groups. Investigation of alpha-TTP expression by leukocytes using real-time PCR showed no difference between the two groups.

In some circumstances a definitive diagnosis can be established from the combined peripheral blood morphologic and immunophenotypic findings obviating the need for bone marrow evaluation, such as for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Occasionally flow cytometric studies are superior to morphologic assessment, such as in screening for hairy cell leukemia or identifying lymphocytic-variant hypereosinophilia. However, there is increasing recognition of small immunophenotypically unusual or abnormal populations of peripheral blood cells, particularly in older patients, which are of uncertain clinical significance, such as monoclonal B lymphocytosis and T-cell clonopathy. Therefore, it is important to integrate peripheral blood smear review findings with the clinical and other information before recommending flow cytometry. In addition, it is important to recognize situations where the results of peripheral blood smear review and flow cytometric immunophenotyping do not explain the clinical findings.","['Craig, F E']",['Craig FE'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, AZ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['Flow cytometry', 'Peripheral blood smear review']",,2017/04/28 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12651 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 May;39 Suppl 1:41-46. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12651.,,20170612,,,IM,"['Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', '*Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/blood/diagnosis/pathology', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis/pathology', '*Lymphocytosis/blood/diagnosis/pathology']",,,['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the significant advances that have been observed are in defining cytogenetic abnormalities, as well as the genetic and epigenetic profiles of AML patients. While new cytogenetic and genetic aberrations such as the FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations are able to guide prognosis for the majority of patients with AML, outcomes are still dismal and relapse rates remain high. It is thought that relapse in AML is in part driven by minimal residual disease (MRD) that remains in the patient following treatment. Thus, there is a need for sensitive and objective methodology for MRD detection. Methodologies such as multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR), digital PCR (dPCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) are being employed to evaluate their utility in MRD assessment. In this review, we will provide an overview of AML and the clinical utility of MRD measurement. We will discuss optimal timing to MRD measurement, the different approaches that are available, and efforts in the standardization across laboratories.","['Cruz, N M', 'Mencia-Trinchant, N', 'Hassane, D C', 'Guzman, M L']","['Cruz NM', 'Mencia-Trinchant N', 'Hassane DC', 'Guzman ML']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,PMC5652069,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myelogenous leukemia', 'digital polymerase chain reaction, leukemia stem cells', 'leukemia-associated immunophenotypes', 'minimal residual disease', 'multiparameter flow cytometry', 'quantitative polymerase chain reaction']",,2017/04/28 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12670 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 May;39 Suppl 1:53-60. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12670.,,20170612,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Flow Cytometry/*methods/standards', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods/standards', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/genetics/metabolism/therapy', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/standards', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']","['R01 CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS912323'],['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to a standardized approach, these cases emphasize the importance of interpretative skills of technologist and hematopathologists in recognizing abnormal patterns in detecting hematological malignancies.","['Keeney, M', 'Hedley, B D', 'Chin-Yee, I H']","['Keeney M', 'Hedley BD', 'Chin-Yee IH']","['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Department of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, Victoria Hospital, London, ON, Canada.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Department of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, Victoria Hospital, London, ON, Canada.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Department of Hematology, London Health Sciences Centre, Victoria Hospital, London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Schulich School of Medicine Western University, London, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD45 negative', 'Flow Cytometry', 'PNH', 'case studies']",,2017/04/28 06:00,2017/06/13 06:00,['2017/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12666 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 May;39 Suppl 1:86-92. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12666.,,20170612,,,IM,"['Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', '*Leukemia, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting histone regulators, such as Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 2 (EZH2), has shown promise in AML. Profiling differential protein expression following inhibition of epigenetic regulators in AML may help to identify novel targets for therapeutics. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Murine models of AML combined with quantitative SILAC analysis were used to identify differentially expressed proteins following inhibition of EZH2 activity using 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZnep). Western blotting and flow cytometry were used to validate a subset of differentially expressed proteins. Gene set analysis was used to determine changes to reported EZH2 target genes. RESULTS: Our quantitative proteomic analysis and subsequent validation of protein changes identified that epigenetic therapy leads to cell death preceded by the induction of differentiation with concurrent p53 up-regulation and cell cycle arrest. Gene set analysis revealed a specific subset of EZH2 target genes that were regulated by DZnep in AML. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These discoveries highlight how this new class of drugs affects AML cell biology and cell survival, and may help identify novel targets and strategies to increase treatment efficacy.","['Sandow, Jarrod J', 'Infusini, Giuseppe', 'Holik, Aliaksei Z', 'Brumatti, Gabriela', 'Averink, Tessa V', 'Ekert, Paul G', 'Webb, Andrew I']","['Sandow JJ', 'Infusini G', 'Holik AZ', 'Brumatti G', 'Averink TV', 'Ekert PG', 'Webb AI']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Australia."", 'Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Australia."", 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170515,Germany,Proteomics Clin Appl,Proteomics.

Somatic SETBP1 mutations were identified by whole exome sequencing in several phenotypes of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), including atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia as well as in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Surprisingly, its recurrent somatic activated mutations are located at the identical positions of germline mutations reported in congenital Schinzel-Giedion syndrome. In general, somatic SETBP1 mutations have a significant clinical impact on the outcome as poor prognostic factor, due to downstream HOXA-pathway as well as associated aggressive types of chromosomal defects (-7/del(7q) and i(17q)), which is consistent with wild-type SETBP1 activation in aggressive types of acute myeloid leukemia and leukemic evolution. Biologically, mutant SETBP1 attenuates RUNX1 and activates MYB. The studies of mouse models confirmed biological significance of SETBP1 mutations in myeloid leukemogenesis, particularly associated with ASXL1 mutations. SETBP1 is a major oncogene in myeloid neoplasms, which cooperates with various genetic events and causes distinct phenotypes of MDS/MPN and sAML.","['Makishima, Hideki']",['Makishima H'],"['Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan. makishima.hideki.8x@kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA. makishima.hideki.8x@kyoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170426,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'Poor prognosis', 'SETBP1', 'Secondary acute myeloid leukemia', 'Self-renewal potential']",,2017/04/28 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2241-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2241-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Jun;105(6):732-742. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2241-1.

The presence of other well-documented risk factors for RVO was also analyzed. In a series of 110 patients (54 males, median age of 67) we found no evidence of PNH. Most patients (97/110) had cardiovascular risk factors and/or hyperhomocysteinemia (67/110). Inherited thrombophilias were rare (three confirmed cases). Therefore, PNH does not appear to play a role in the development of RVO.

Although the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) CA carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) is essential for CA-CA interactions, the CA CTD has been suggested to be largely dispensable for human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) particle biogenesis. To more clearly define the roles of the HTLV-1 CA amino-terminal domain (NTD) and CA CTD in particle biogenesis, we generated and analyzed a panel of Gag proteins with chimeric HIV-1/HTLV-1 CA domains. Subcellular distribution and protein expression levels indicated that Gag proteins with a chimeric HIV-1 CA NTD/HTLV-1 CA CTD did not result in Gag oligomerization regardless of the parent Gag background. Furthermore, chimeric Gag proteins with the HTLV-1 CA NTD produced particles phenotypically similar to HTLV-1 immature particles, highlighting the importance of the HTLV-1 CA NTD in HTLV-1 immature particle morphology. Taken together, these observations support the conclusion that the HTLV-1 CA NTD can functionally replace the HIV-1 CA CTD, but the HIV-1 CA NTD cannot replace the HTLV-1 CA CTD, indicating that the HTLV-1 CA subdomains provide distinct contributions to Gag-Gag oligomerization, particle morphology, and biogenesis. Furthermore, we have shown for the first time that HIV-1 and HTLV-1 Gag domains outside the CA (e.g., matrix and nucleocapsid) impact Gag oligomerization as well as immature particle size and morphology.IMPORTANCE A key aspect in virus replication is virus particle assembly, which is a poorly understood process for most viruses. For retroviruses, the Gag structural protein is the primary driver of virus particle biogenesis, and the CA CTD is the primary determinant of Gag-Gag interactions for HIV-1. In this study, the HTLV-1 capsid amino-terminal domain was found to provide distinct contributions to Gag-Gag oligomerization, particle morphology, and biogenesis. This study provides information that will aid efforts for discovery of therapeutic targets for intervention.","['Martin, Jessica L', 'Mendonca, Luiza M', 'Angert, Isaac', 'Mueller, Joachim D', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Martin JL', 'Mendonca LM', 'Angert I', 'Mueller JD', 'Zhang W', 'Mansky LM']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Pharmacology Graduate Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Characterization Facility, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA mansky@umn.edu.', 'Pharmacology Graduate Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170626,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC5487576,['NOTNLM'],"['*Gag', '*morphology', '*oligomerization', '*retrovirus', '*virus assembly']",,2017/04/28 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2017/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00298-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00298-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Jun 26;91(14). pii: JVI.00298-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00298-17.

Searching for master regulators controlling multiple signaling pathways in T-ALL, we investigated the multifunctional protein redox factor-1 (Ref-1/APE1), which acts as a signaling ""node"" by exerting redox regulatory control of transcription factors important in leukemia. Leukemia patients' transcriptome databases showed increased expression in T-ALL of Ref-1 and other genes of the Ref-1/SET interactome. Validation studies demonstrated that Ref-1 is expressed in high-risk leukemia T cells, including in patient biopsies. Ref-1 redox function is active in leukemia T cells, regulating the Ref-1 target NF-kappaB, and inhibited by the redox-selective Ref-1 inhibitor E3330. Ref-1 expression is not regulated by Notch signaling, but is upregulated by glucocorticoid treatment. E3330 disrupted Ref-1 redox activity in functional studies and resulted in marked inhibition of leukemia cell viability, including T-ALL lines representing different genotypes and risk groups. Potent leukemia cell inhibition was seen in primary cells from ALL patients, relapsed and glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL cells, and cells from a murine model of Notch-induced leukemia. Ref-1 redox inhibition triggered leukemia cell apoptosis and downregulation of survival genes regulated by Ref-1 targets. For the first time, this work identifies Ref-1 as a novel molecular effector in T-ALL and demonstrates that Ref-1 redox inhibition results in potent inhibition of leukemia T cells, including relapsed T-ALL. These data also support E3330 as a specific Ref-1 small-molecule inhibitor for leukemia. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(7); 1401-11.

METHODS: The monoclonal antibodies against human VE-cadherin were prepared from BALB/c mice immunized with prokaryotic expression recombinant proteins, and the best combination of double antibodies was selected by checkerboard titration method. Double antibody sandwich ELISA for the determination of human VE-cadherin was established by using HRP-labeled McAb as a detection antibody and a capture antibody. The methodology performance was evaluated. The plasma concentrations of VE-cadherin in 28 healthy subjects and 60 patients with cancer were determined. RESULTS: The double antibody sandwich ELISA for the determination of human VE-cadherin was established by selecting the combination of double antibodies. The detection limit was 24.7 pg/ml, the coefficients of variation for inner-batch and inter-batch were 4.1%-7.7% and 8.7%-10.8% respectively. The average recovery was 96.7%. The plasma level of soluble VE-cadherin in normal controls was 262.1+/-11.75 pg/ml. The plasma level of soluble VE-cadherin was 173.9+/-17.98 pg/ml in 24 patients with leukemia, 311.7+/-25.24 pg/ml in 14 patients with stomach cancer, 206.8+/-25.01 pg/ml in 11 patients with lung cancer, and 310.7+/-11.82 pg/ml in others patients(9 patients with breast cancer, 1 patients with gliomas, 1 patients with liver cancer).

METHODS: The experiments were divided into 4 groups, including control group(Kasumi-1 cells treated with non-specific siRNA), TAK1 specific siRNA treated group (Kasumi 1 treated with TAK specific siRNA), As2O3 treated group (Kasumi 1 cells treated with As2O3) and combined treated group (Kasumi 1 cells treated with TAK1 specific siRNA plus As2O3). The proliferation inhibition rate of Kasami 1 cells was detected by CCK-8 method, the apoptotic rate of cells was detected by flow eytometry, the expressions of TAK1, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase(p-JNK) and apoptosis-related proteins were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: As2O3 could inhibit Kasumi-1 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner between 0.5 to 20 micromol/L with IC50 of (3.79+/-0.36) micromol/L at 24 h, and also inhibit Kasumi-1 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner between 0.5 to 10 micromol/L with IC50 of (2.38+/-0.17) micromol/L at 48 h, but then the inhibitory effect reached plateau. After treating Kasumi-1 cells with TAK1 siRNA and 3.5 micromol/L As2O3 for 24 h, the proliferation inhibition rate was (10.86+/-1.64)% and (49.80+/-2.19)%, meanwhile the apoptosis rate was (8.47+/-0.75)% and (24.78+/-2.14)%, all significantly higher than those in control group (P<0.05, P<0.01). The proliferation inhibition rate and apoptosis rate of the combined treated group were significantly higher than that in control and single treated groups (P<0.05, P<0.01), TAK1 silencing and 3.5 micromol/L of As2O3 could decrease the expression of TAK1, p-JNK, c-Fos, c-Jun and BCL-2 in different degrees, and increase the expression levels of BAX and the activated (cleaved) caspase-3, 9 with statistically significant differences as compared with control group (P< 0.05). When Kasumi-1 cells were treated with TAK1 specific siRNA plus As2O3 for 24 h, protein expression levels were all significantly greater than that in the single-treated groups (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: TAK1 silencing and As2O3 can separately and synergistically inhibit Kasumi-1 cell proliferation which probably relates with the inducing apoptosis via the JNK and mitochondrial pathway. Meanwhile, TAK1 silencing enhances the inhibitory effect of As2O3 on Kasumi-1 cell proliferation.","['Liu, Sha', 'Yuan, Fang-Fang', 'Mi, Rui-Hua', 'Wang, Xiao-Jiao', 'Fan, Rui-Hua', 'Wei, Xu-Dong']","['Liu S', 'Yuan FF', 'Mi RH', 'Wang XJ', 'Fan RH', 'Wei XD']","['Department of Hematology, The Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University & Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital; Zhengzhou 450008, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University & Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital; Zhengzhou 450008, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University & Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital; Zhengzhou 450008, Henan Province, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University & Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital; Zhengzhou 450008, Henan Province, China.', 'Central Laboratory, The Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University & Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital; Zhengzhou 450008, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University & Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital; Zhengzhou 450008, Henan Province, China.

Among different risk-groups, 148 cases were stratified into the low-risk group and 191 cases were included in the moderate-risk group. Eight-two patients of the high-risk group were analyzed retrospectively for their clinical features, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate. RESULTS: The median follow-up times of 82 patients were 64 months(3.0-76.3 months), 55 patient achieved complete remission(CR) after 1 cycle of induction chemotherapy(CR rate 67.1%), 25 patients relapsed(30.5%) mainly in very early and early relapse phases, significantly different from the low-risk group (P=0.013), 27 pateitns died(32.9%). The 5-year pEFS and pOS were 57.20% and 58.5%, respectively.

METHODS: The cell viability was detected by trypan blue Staining, percentage of apoptotic cells and cell cycle distribution were detected by flow cytometry, the protein expression was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Both inhibitory effect of proliferation and apoptosis-inducing effect were similar between the imatinib-resistant and -sensitive cell lines treated with 25 micromol/L quercetin for 24 hours and with arrest of cell cycle at G2/M phase. Quercetin could not change the expression of BCR-ABL. The expression of gamma-H2AX was markedly enhanced and the phosphorylation of JNK up-regulated by quercetin in both imatinib-resistant and imatinib-sensitive cell lines. CONCLUSION: The growth of imatinib-resistant cells can be inhibited by quercetin, and the apoptosis of cells can be induced by quercetin, which may be related to cell cycle arrest in G2/M. The DNA damage and up-regulation of p-JNK may be involved in these processes.","['Lu, Hong-Ying', 'Chen, Juan', 'DU, Sheng-Hong', 'Jia, Pei-Min', 'Tong, Jian-Hua', 'Wu, Ying-Li', 'Zhou, Li']","['Lu HY', 'Chen J', 'DU SH', 'Jia PM', 'Tong JH', 'Wu YL', 'Zhou L']","['Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai 200025, China; Department of Laboratorial Examination, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine,Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai 200025, China.

METHODS: The clinical data of 156 AML patients with primary induction failure and relapse, except patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia(APL), treated with any of the above 3 regimens in our center from January 2008 to April 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. According to the treatment regimens, 156 patients were divided into MAC group (n=60), FLAG group (n=45) and CAG group (n=51). The complete remission(CR), partial remissison(PR), overall survival(OS), disease-free survival(DFS) and adverse events during the treatment were analyzed, so as to compare and evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 3 different regimens. RESULTS: After 1 course of re-induction chemotherapy, CR in MAC group was significantly higher than that in FLAG and CAG group (55.4% vs 34.1% vs 34.0%)(P<0.05). The OS was not statistically significantly different among 3 groups (P>0.05) with a median OS of 11 months, 5.46 months and 10.2 months, respectively. The myelosuppression was the main adverse event with no significant difference among the groups(P>0.05). More patients treated with MAC regimen underwent febrile neutropenia (93.3% vs 86.7% vs 64.7%)(P<0.001). However, the incidence of fatal infections was not signicantly different among 3 groups(5% vs 8.9% vs 5.9%)(P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with FLAG and CAG regimen, the MAC regimen can enable more AML patients with primary induction failure and refractory to achieve CR without increasing severe adverse events,therefore,this regimen may provide a opportunity for patients to recieve hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Gao, Wen-Hui', 'Li, Hong-Min', 'Yu, Jing-Yi', 'Zheng, Ya-Li', 'Wu, Li-Hua', 'Liu, Qing-Guo', 'Li, Jun-Fan', 'Liu, Chun-Hua', 'Hu, Yi-Ming', 'Xu, Ning', 'Li, Shang-Zhu', 'Mi, Ying-Chang', 'Huang, Ping-Ping']","['Gao WH', 'Li HM', 'Yu JY', 'Zheng YL', 'Wu LH', 'Liu QG', 'Li JF', 'Liu CH', 'Hu YM', 'Xu N', 'Li SZ', 'Mi YC', 'Huang PP']","['Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.

METHODS: Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the level of PRPS1 mRNA and protein expression in bone marrow samples from 176 patients diagnosed as AL (126 cases were newly diagnosed and 50 cases in complete remission), and its relevance with clinical indicators was statistically analyzed. The bone marrow samples from 21 children with non-malignant hematological disease were used as controls. RESULTS: (1)In B-ALL group, the level of PRPS1 mRNA in newly diagnosed patients were significantly higher than that in control and than that in complete remission patients (both P<0.0001). In T-ALL and AML group, differences was only observed between newly diagnosed patients and complete remission patients(both P<0.0001); (2)In B-ALL group, the expression level of PRPS1 increase with along risk enhancement (P<0.01), while no significant difference was observed in T-ALL (P>0.05). In AML patients, expression difference was shown between low risk group and high risk group(P<0.05); (3)High PRPS1 mRNA expression level were associated with high WBC counts and MRD positive in B-ALL patients (P=0.020, P=0.026, respectively); (4)Expression of NT5C2, an essential gene for relapse and drug resistance, was found to be positively correlated with PRPS1 expression in AL samples(P<0.05). CONCLUSION: High expression of PRPS1 is relevant factor of unfavourable prognosis in B-ALL children, which suggest PRPS1 may be a new indicator for prognosis of pediatric B-ALL and an index to guide individualized chemotherapy.","['Ma, Yi-Mei', 'An, Xi-Zhou', 'Guan, Xian-Min', 'Kong, Qing-Lin', 'Li, Peng-Fei', 'Xian, Ying', 'Xiao, Jian-Wen', 'Meng, Yan', 'Liang, Shao-Yan', 'Yu, Jie']","['Ma YM', 'An XZ', 'Guan XM', 'Kong QL', 'Li PF', 'Xian Y', 'Xiao JW', 'Meng Y', 'Liang SY', 'Yu J']","[""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Department of Hematology & Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders of Ministry of Education; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing 400014, China.

Additionally, new and more potent monoclonal antibodies against CD20 have replaced/may replace rituximab in many settings. Areas covered: Herein, we review the entire therapeutic landscape of RR CLL, with particular attention to the new small-molecule kinase inhibitors and BH3-mimetics. We discuss preclinical data with these agents in CLL, cover available efficacy and safety information, and examine potential resistance mechanisms and possible rational combinations to circumvent them. Expert opinion: The availability of potent and selective inhibitors of BCR signaling and of the anti-apoptotic functions of BCL2 has enormously enhanced our therapeutic armamentarium, with unprecedented efficacy now observed in patients who historically had poor outcomes with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT), e.g., those with deletion 17p/11q and/or IGHV-unmutated disease. The next challenge is to optimally sequence these agents and develop rational combinations that will hopefully lead to deeper and more durable remissions than ever seen before. Indeed, long term relapse free survival, already achievable with CIT in patients with genetically favorable-risk disease, now appears to be a realistic possibility for most patients with CLL.","['Abou Zahr, Abdallah', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Abou Zahr A', 'Bose P', 'Keating MJ']","['a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170516,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,PMC6488229,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor', 'BCL2', 'BTK', 'CLL', 'PI3K', 'chemoimmunotherapy', 'ibrutinib', 'idelalisib', 'rational combinations', 'venetoclax']",,2017/04/28 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2017/04/28 06:00'],"['2017/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14656566.2017.1324420 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2017 Jun;18(9):857-873. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2017.1324420.

Through interactions with its PDZ domain, CFTR is capable of regulating other proteins, such as protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The aberrant expression and mutation of CFTR have been observed in several tumor, but not in philadelphia chromosome-positive(Ph+) acute leukemia, including Ph+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia(Ph+ B-ALL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis phases (CML-BC). In this study, we demonstrated the mean expression level of CFTR in Ph+ acute leukemia cells was markedly higher than that in Ph- B-ALL and CML-chronic phase cells. CFTRinh-172, a classic CFTR inhibitor, down-regulated the expression of CFTR, p-BCR-ABL and classical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in Ph+ acute leukemia cells, while imatinib had no effect on CFTR. Importantly, reduced efficacy of CFTRinh-172 was closely associated with elevated PP2A phosphatase activity. Furthermore, we confirmed an interaction between CFTR and the PP2AA subunit in K562 cells. In addition, we demonstrated CFTR and PP2AA interact in the cytosol, resulting in PP2A complex inactivation and increased degradation of PP2A substrates via the lysosomal/proteasome pathway. In conclusion, our results showed CFTR was highly expressed in Ph+ acute leukemia, which protected and maintained the continuous activation of BCR-ABL and the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by decreasing PP2A phosphatase activity. According to this working model of the CFTR-PP2A-BCR-ABL axis, targeting the CFTR protein will activate PP2A and may offer a new treatment strategy for Ph+ acute leukemia, especially for patients exhibiting high levels of CFTR expression.","['Yang, Xi', 'Yan, Tianyou', 'Gong, Yuping', 'Liu, Xuehua', 'Sun, Huaqin', 'Xu, Wenming', 'Wang, Chunsen', 'Naren, Duolan', 'Zheng, Yuhuan']","['Yang X', 'Yan T', 'Gong Y', 'Liu X', 'Sun H', 'Xu W', 'Wang C', 'Naren D', 'Zheng Y']","['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Sichuan University-The Chinese University of Hong Kong Joint Laboratory for Reproductive Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Chengdu, China.', 'Sichuan University-The Chinese University of Hong Kong Joint Laboratory for Reproductive Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Chengdu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."", 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5421860,['NOTNLM'],"['CFTR', 'PP2A', 'Ph+ acute leukemia']",,2017/04/28 06:00,2018/03/23 06:00,['2017/04/28 06:00'],"['2016/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['15510 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15510 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 11;8(15):24437-24448. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15510.,,20180322,,"['0 (CFTR protein, human)', '126880-72-6 (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study in which decitabine treatment was administered prior to full-dose idarubicin and cytarabine (D-IA) for 21 R/R AML patients. RESULTS: After 1 cycle of D-IA, 10/21 (47.6%) patients experienced a complete remission (CR) and 2/21 (9.5%) showed a partial response. There was a 1-month response rate (RR) in 12/21 patients (57.14%); these patients achieved CR after 2 cycles of D-IA. Five of these 12 (40%) patients then received sequential allogeneic stem cell transplantation. At the last follow-up date, 9/21 (42.8%) patients had survived, and 7/21 (33.3%) were in continuous CR. Hematological toxicity and infections were the most prominent toxicities of this regimen. Other toxicities included nausea, vomiting, bleeding, and liver enzyme abnormalities. No mortalities were recorded due to treatment-related toxicity during remission. CONCLUSIONS: The combination was well tolerated, and the RR was encouraging.

However, the regulatory effect of miR-142-3p on drug resistance of AML cells and its underlying mechanism have not been elucidated. Here, we found that miR-142-3p was significantly downregulated and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was dramatically upregulated in AML samples and cells, as well as drug-resistant AML cells. P-gp level and autophagy were markedly enhanced in HL-60/ADR and HL-60/ATRA cells. miR-142-3p overexpression improved drug sensitivity of AML cells by inhibiting cell viability and promoting apoptosis, and inhibited P-gp level and autophagy in drug-resistant AML cells, whereas HMGB1 overexpression obviously reversed these effect. HMGB1 was demonstrated to be a target of miR-142-3p, and miR-142-3p negatively regulated HMGB1 expression. In conclusion, our study elucidated that upregulation of miR-142-3p improves drug sensitivity of AML through reducing P-glycoprotein and repressing autophagy by targeting HMGB1, contributing to better understanding the molecular mechanism of drug resistance in AML.","['Zhang, Yuan', 'Liu, Yufeng', 'Xu, Xueju']","['Zhang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Xu X']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, PR China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, PR China.

Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) represent the main population in CML marrow stroma, which may play a key role in disease support and progression. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a key enzyme of antioxidative metabolism that is associated with cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. We herein up-regulated HO-1 expression of BMSCs and evaluated whether BMSCs influenced K562 cells survival. BMSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of normal people and CML patients. Following co-culture of BMSCs and K562 cells, up-regulating HO-1 expression in bone marrow stromal cells increased the imatinib (IM) resistance of K562 cells, whereas the apoptosis of K562 cells was effectively promoted without BMSCs co-culture. The protection may be mediated by CXCL12 (stromal derived factors 1, SDF-1)/CXCR4 signaling. The CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AKT. As far as drug resistance was concerned, BMSCs counteracted the cytotoxic effect of IM administration in vitro, and they protected K562 cells from the apoptosis induced by kinase inhibitor IM.

We evaluated 206 pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2012 and identified 31 (15%) ML-DS. The incidence of ML-DS was 48 per 100,000 compared to 0.6 per 100,000 for AML in non-DS children. Thus, patients with DS had 80-fold increased risk of ML-DS compared to AML in non-DS children. The median age at diagnosis was 1.8 years, male/female ratio was 1.2, majority (84%) of patients had FAB-M7 subtype, and the cytogenetic abnormalities were normal karyotype (constitutional trisomy 21) in 48%, additional trisomy in 23%, and other aberrations in 29%. Complete remission, cumulative incidences of relapse (CIR), toxic-death, and 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were 96.8%, 19.4%, 13.1%, and 67.7+/-8.4%; respectively. In the present study, multivariate analysis revealed favorable outcome (5-year EFS 86.7+/-8.8%) for patients with normal karyotype. The incidence and clinical characteristics of ML-DS in Saudi patients were comparable to other reports. However, there is a need to optimize risk stratification and treatment intensity to reduce CIR and toxic death rates to further improve outcomes of patients with ML-DS.","['Jastaniah, Wasil', 'Alsultan, Abdulrahman', 'Al Daama, Saad', 'Ballourah, Walid', 'Bayoumy, Mohammad', 'Al-Anzi, Faisal', 'Al Shareef, Omar', 'Abrar, Mohammed Burhan', 'Al Sudairy, Reem', 'Al Ghemlas, Ibrahim']","['Jastaniah W', 'Alsultan A', 'Al Daama S', 'Ballourah W', 'Bayoumy M', 'Al-Anzi F', 'Al Shareef O', 'Abrar MB', 'Al Sudairy R', 'Al Ghemlas I']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Umm AlQura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia; Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University and King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

How cytoskeletal composition affects the physical response of cells to external loads has been intensively studied with a spectrum of techniques, yet quantitative and statistically powerful investigations in the form of titration assays are hampered by the low throughput of most available methods. In this study, we employ real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC), a novel microfluidic tool to examine the effects of biochemically modified F-actin and microtubule stability and nuclear chromatin structure on cell deformation in a human leukemia cell line (HL60). The high throughput of our method facilitates extensive titration assays that allow for significance assessment of the observed effects and extraction of half-maximal concentrations for most of the applied reagents. We quantitatively show that integrity of the F-actin cortex and microtubule network dominate cell deformation on millisecond timescales probed with RT-DC. Drug-induced alterations in the nuclear chromatin structure were not found to consistently affect cell deformation. The sensitivity of the high-throughput cell mechanical measurements to the cytoskeletal modifications we present in this study opens up new possibilities for label-free dose-response assays of cytoskeletal modifications.","['Golfier, Stefan', 'Rosendahl, Philipp', 'Mietke, Alexander', 'Herbig, Maik', 'Guck, Jochen', 'Otto, Oliver']","['Golfier S', 'Rosendahl P', 'Mietke A', 'Herbig M', 'Guck J', 'Otto O']","['Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute for Physics of Complex Systems, Dresden, Germany.', 'Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute for Physics of Complex Systems, Dresden, Germany.', 'Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Biotechnology Center, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'ZIK HIKE, Universitat Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170718,United States,Cytoskeleton (Hoboken),"Cytoskeleton (Hoboken, N.J.)",101523844,PMC5601209,['NOTNLM'],"['cell mechanics', 'cytoskeleton', 'label-free cell characterization', 'real-time deformability cytometry']",,2017/04/27 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cm.21369 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytoskeleton (Hoboken). 2017 Aug;74(8):283-296. doi: 10.1002/cm.21369.

We previously found that PD-L1 expression was upregulated in cattle infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and that an antibody that blocked the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction reactivated T-cell function in vitro. Therefore, this study assessed its antivirus activities in vivo. First, we inoculated the anti-bovine PD-L1 rat monoclonal antibody 4G12 into a BLV-infected cow. However, this did not induce T-cell proliferation or reduction of BLV provirus loads during the test period, and only bound to circulating IgM+ B cells until one week post-inoculation. We hypothesized that this lack of in vivo effects was due to its lower stability in cattle and so established an anti-PD-L1 rat-bovine chimeric antibody (Boch4G12). Boch4G12 was able to bind specifically with bovine PD-L1, interrupt the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, and activate the immune response in both healthy and BLV-infected cattle in vitro. Therefore, we experimentally infected a healthy calf with BLV and inoculated it intravenously with 1 mg/kg of Boch4G12 once it reached the aleukemic (AL) stage. Cultivation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from the tested calf indicated that the proliferation of CD4+ T cells was increased by Boch4G12 inoculation, while BLV provirus loads were significantly reduced, clearly demonstrating that this treatment induced antivirus activities. Therefore, further studies using a large number of animals are required to support its efficacy for clinical application.","['Nishimori, Asami', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Okagawa, Tomohiro', 'Maekawa, Naoya', 'Ikebuchi, Ryoyo', 'Goto, Shinya', 'Sajiki, Yamato', 'Suzuki, Yasuhiko', 'Kohara, Junko', 'Ogasawara, Satoshi', 'Kato, Yukinari', 'Murata, Shiro', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Nishimori A', 'Konnai S', 'Okagawa T', 'Maekawa N', 'Ikebuchi R', 'Goto S', 'Sajiki Y', 'Suzuki Y', 'Kohara J', 'Ogasawara S', 'Kato Y', 'Murata S', 'Ohashi K']","['Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Division of Bioresources, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Global Station for Zoonosis Control, Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE), Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Animal Research Center, Agricultural Research Department, Hokkaido Research Organization, Shintoku, Japan.', 'Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170426,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5405919,,,,2017/04/27 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0174916 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-03611 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Apr 26;12(4):e0174916. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0174916. eCollection 2017.,,20170905,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3230-7109'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/immunology/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'B7-H1 Antigen/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*drug therapy/prevention & control/virology', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*metabolism/physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Proteins/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, germline variants in NUDT15 have been identified as a major genetic cause for MP-related bone marrow suppression, and there is increasing interest in the clinical implementation of NUDT15 genotype-guided MP dose individualization. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the effects of NUDT15 on thiopurine metabolism and identify pharmacologic markers to inform NUDT15 genotype-guided MP dosing. In 55 Japanese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we simultaneously measured both thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) in red blood cells and DNA-incorporated thioguanine (DNA-TG) in white blood cells. TGN levels were significantly lower in patients with NUDT15 deficiency, likely because of toxicity-related MP dose reduction. In contrast, when exposed to the same dose of MP, DNA-TG accumulated more efficiently in vivo with increasing number of risk alleles in NUDT15 (P=4.0x10). Cytosolic TGN and nuclear DNA-TG were correlated positively with each other across genotype groups (P=6.5x10), but the ratio of DNA-TG to TGN was significantly higher in NUDT15-deficient patients (P=3.6x10), consistent with excessive MP activation. In conclusion, our results suggest that DNA-TG is a more relevant MP metabolite than TGN to inform NUDT15 genotype-guided dose adjustments.","['Moriyama, Takaya', 'Nishii, Rina', 'Lin, Ting-Nien', 'Kihira, Kentaro', 'Toyoda, Hidemi', 'Jacob, Nersting', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Yang, Jun J', 'Hori, Hiroki']","['Moriyama T', 'Nishii R', 'Lin TN', 'Kihira K', 'Toyoda H', 'Jacob N', 'Kato M', 'Koh K', 'Inaba H', 'Manabe A', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Yang JJ', 'Hori H']","[""Departments of aPharmaceutical Sciences bOncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA cDepartment of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Graduate School of Medicine dDepartment of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Center for Child Health and Development eDepartment of Pediatrics, St Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo fDepartment of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Mie gDepartment of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan hDepartment of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet iThe Institute of Clinical Medicine, the University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,PMC5510236,,,,2017/04/27 06:00,2018/07/17 06:00,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FPC.0000000000000282 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2017 Jun;27(6):236-239. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000282.,,20180716,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.6.1.- (NUDT15 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Pharmacogenomic Variants', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Purines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrophosphatases/*genetics', 'Thioguanine/blood']","['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM118578/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS865793'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that CD20 is epigenetically regulated and that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) can increase CD20 expression in vitro in CLL. To assess whether HDACis can upregulate CD20 also in vivo in CLL, the HDACi valproate was given to three del13q/NOTCH1wt CLL patients and CD20 levels were analysed (the PREVAIL study). Valproate treatment resulted in expected global activating histone modifications suggesting HDAC inhibitory effects. However, although valproate induced expression of CD20 mRNA and protein in the del13q/NOTCH1wt I83-E95 CLL cell line, no such effects were observed in the patients studied. In contrast to the cell line, in patients valproate treatment resulted in transient recruitment of the transcriptional repressor EZH2 to the CD20 promoter, correlating to an increase of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. This suggests that valproate-mediated induction of CD20 may be hampered by EZH2 mediated H3K27me3 in vivo in CLL. Moreover, valproate treatment resulted in induction of EZH2 and global H3K27me3 in patient cells, suggesting transcriptionally repressive effects of valproate in CLL. Our results suggest new in vivo mechanisms of HDACis which may have implications on the design of future clinical trials in B-cell malignancies.","['Scialdone, Annarita', 'Hasni, Muhammad Sharif', 'Damm, Jesper Kofoed', 'Lennartsson, Andreas', 'Gullberg, Urban', 'Drott, Kristina']","['Scialdone A', 'Hasni MS', 'Damm JK', 'Lennartsson A', 'Gullberg U', 'Drott K']","['Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Clinic of Oncology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5514918,['NOTNLM'],"['CD20', 'EZH2', 'H3K27me3', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'valproate']",,2017/04/27 06:00,2018/03/23 06:00,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['16964 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16964 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 6;8(23):37409-37422. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16964.,,20180322,,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/*genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Valproic Acid/*therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene rearrangement is a useful follow-up marker in B-ALL owing to its high positivity rate. We evaluated the performance and clinical applicability of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay for IGH rearrangement in B-ALL MRD monitoring. IGH rearrangement was tested by using fluorescence PCR-fragment analysis and the NGS assay in eight B-ALL patients. The NGS assay was run on two platforms: the Ion Torrent PGM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) (18 samples from 1st to 7th patients) and the MiSeq system (Illumina, USA) (four samples from 8th patient). All initial diagnostic samples and four follow-up samples were positive for clonal IGH rearrangement with fluorescence PCR-fragment analysis and the NGS assay, and six follow-up samples were positive only with NGS. In one case with BCR-ABL1 translocation, BCR-ABL1 quantitative PCR was negative but the NGS IGH assay was positive just prior to full-blown relapse, suggesting the high sensitivity and clinical utility of the NGS assay. The NGS assay is proposed for MRD monitoring in B-ALL Additional studies are needed to confirm the clinical implications of cases showing positive results only in NGS.","['Shin, Saeam', 'Hwang, In Sik', 'Kim, Jieun', 'Lee, Kyung A', 'Lee, Seung Tae', 'Choi, Jong Rak']","['Shin S', 'Hwang IS', 'Kim J', 'Lee KA', 'Lee ST', 'Choi JR']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hallym University College of Medicine, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 PLUS Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

METHODS: A novel liposomal nanoparticle (NP) was developed using a conjugate derived from 1, 2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino (polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000 -NH2 ) and oestrone (ES, is known to bind the ER) to produce an ES-targeted PEGylated liposome (ES-SSL). The resulting targeted NP was loaded with MTO to produce a targeted liposome-MTO formulation (ES-SSL-MTO). KEY FINDINGS: The targeted formulation (~140 nm, 1.5 mV) achieved over 95% drug encapsulation efficiency and a favourable stability at 4, 25 and 37 degrees C up to 48 h. The flow cytometric data indicated that cellular uptake of ES-SSL into human leukaemia HL-60 cells was mediated via binding the oestrogen receptor. In addition, the ES-SSL-MTO significantly reduced the growth of HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a proof of principle that ES-modified PEGylated liposomes can target the ER, thereby potentially improving the therapeutic benefits in ER-overexpressed tumours.","['Hao, Qiang', 'Xu, Guoxing', 'Yang, Yue', 'Sun, Yuxin', 'Cong, Dengli', 'Li, Hongrui', 'Liu, Xin', 'Wang, Zeng', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Chen, Jinglin', 'Li, Yao', 'Luan, Xue', 'Wang, Lin', 'Tian, Lin', 'Liu, Kun', 'Li, Yan', 'Jiao, Qianru', 'Pei, Jin']","['Hao Q', 'Xu G', 'Yang Y', 'Sun Y', 'Cong D', 'Li H', 'Liu X', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang Z', 'Chen J', 'Li Y', 'Luan X', 'Wang L', 'Tian L', 'Liu K', 'Li Y', 'Jiao Q', 'Pei J']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'School of Clinical Medicine, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170426,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer targeting', 'chemotherapy', 'liposomal nanoparticles', 'oestrogen receptor']",,2017/04/27 06:00,2018/04/10 06:00,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jphp.12736 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2017 Aug;69(8):991-1001. doi: 10.1111/jphp.12736.

The primary endpoints were safety of the recommended dose (Phase 1) and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) by 12 months in chronic-phase CML (CP-CML) patients or major hematologic response (MaHR) by 6 months in patients with advanced phase disease (Phase 2). MCyR was achieved/maintained by 12 months in 65% of CP-CML patients; MaHR was achieved by 6 months in 61% of patients with advanced phase disease. The most common nonhematologic grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) was hypertension (37%); common hematologic grade 3/4 AEs were thrombocytopenia (57%), neutropenia (34%), and leukopenia (26%). Overall, five (14%) patients experienced arterial occlusive events (AOEs); no grade 5 AOEs were reported. The steady-state accumulation ratio of ponatinib (based on area under the curve) ranged from 2.6 (15 mg/day) to 1.3 (45 mg/day). In summary, ponatinib demonstrated efficacy in Japanese patients with CML and Ph(+)ALL resistant/intolerant to prior TKI treatment; safety data support a recommended starting dose of 45 mg/day in these patients.","['Tojo, Arinobu', 'Kyo, Taiichi', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhito', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Kobayashi, Yukio', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Hatake, Kiyohiko', 'Iwasaki, Hiromi', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Usui, Noriko', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Tugnait, Meera', 'Narasimhan, Narayana I', 'Lustgarten, Stephanie', 'Farin, Heinrich', 'Haluska, Frank', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Tojo A', 'Kyo T', 'Yamamoto K', 'Nakamae H', 'Takahashi N', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Tauchi T', 'Okamoto S', 'Miyamura K', 'Hatake K', 'Iwasaki H', 'Matsumura I', 'Usui N', 'Naoe T', 'Tugnait M', 'Narasimhan NI', 'Lustgarten S', 'Farin H', 'Haluska F', 'Ohyashiki K']","['The Institute of Medical Science, The University Of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan. a-tojo@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.', 'Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Aichi, Japan.', 'Osaka City University Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Tokyo Medical University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japan Red Cross Nagoya Daiichi Hospital, Aichi, Japan.', 'The Cancer Institute Hospital Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuok, Japan.', 'Kinki University Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'The Jikei University Daisan Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'BioCancell Therapeutics Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Tokyo Medical University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20170425,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*Japanese population', '*Ph+ALL', '*Phase 1/2', '*Ponatinib']",,2017/04/27 06:00,2018/03/09 06:00,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2238-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2238-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Sep;106(3):385-397. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2238-9.

Current methods of assessing GC resistance are time consuming and have limited reproducibility; in this study, we sought to define a new method of evaluating GC sensitivity and resistance in vitro. METHODS: Based on the mechanisms of GC resistance, we hypothesized that the dual-luciferase report (DLR) assay could reflect the transcription effects of GC downstream of the GC-glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway, thereby allowing the evaluation of reactions to GC. Sixty-two patients with differential GC response were included in this study. The prednisone induction test was used to divide the children with ALL into two groups: GC sensitive (GCS) and GC resistant (GCR). DLR assay was later conducted on those patients to evaluate its value for diagnosis of the GC reactivity. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to identify the optimal assay cutoff for identifying response to GC. RESULTS: Using the DLR assay analysis, we found that GCR subjects showed significantly lower reporter/control ratios for luciferase, as compared with GCS subjects. The optimal cutoff value for GC response was 0.67, with sensitivity of 77.1% and specificity of 93.3%. The DLR assay results were consistent with prednisone induction test results. Further, the DLR assay was simpler, more sensitive, and less time-consuming than the prednisone induction test. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the DLR assay is relatively fast, simple, and sensitive. Accordingly, it could be useful for detecting GC response in children with ALL.","['Wang, X', 'Chen, P', 'Sun, Y', 'Chen, Y', 'Mao, M', 'Jiang, T', 'Ouyang, J']","['Wang X', 'Chen P', 'Sun Y', 'Chen Y', 'Mao M', 'Jiang T', 'Ouyang J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. jiangtangandwang@163.com.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. ouyangjuanandwang@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170425,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Dual-luciferase report assay', 'Glucocorticoid', 'Prognosis']",,2017/04/27 06:00,2018/08/01 06:00,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-017-1661-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-017-1661-y [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2017 Oct;19(10):1241-1246. doi: 10.1007/s12094-017-1661-y.

The current practice of using oral therapy on a large scale has been increasingly adopted for cancer patients. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is just such an example, where the introduction of taking new oral medications, the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL inhibitors (TKI), has now revolutionised the treatment. The aim of our study was to assess treatment adherence in a group of Polish CML patients (a survey was conducted on 140 patient aged >/=18 years) treated with oral TKI (imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib) taking into account the following variables: gender, age, education, place of residence, family circumstances and duration of therapy. In addition, we evaluated whether there is a relationship between how patients perceive their level of adherence to treatment recommendations with how subjectively the required dosage regimen was followed. Half the patients admitted to skipping at least one drug dose during the entire course of treatment and 39% did so within their last treatment month. Patients were also found to overestimate their own adherence assessment; around 60% of those missing at least 1 drug dose within the last treatment month believed they 'always' followed recommendations. The study demonstrated that adherence deteriorates over time. Furthermore, patients aged >65 years and patients suffering at least one comorbid disease had better adherence (p < 0.011).

SUMMARY ANSWER: CRT doses <26 Gy had no demonstrable adverse effect on sperm concentration or morphology. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Treatment with alkylating agents produces oligospermia and azoospermia in some patients. No prior study has been large enough to evaluate the independent effects of alkylating agents and lower dose (<26 Gy) CRT on sperm concentration or morphology. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This cross-sectional study included male adult survivors of pediatric ALL who had received alkylating agent chemotherapy with or without CRT and who enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE) from September 2007 to October 2013. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The inclusion criteria were males, >/=18 years of age, >/=10 years after diagnosis, treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for ALL, and received alkylating agent chemotherapy. Semen analyses were performed on 173 of the 241 (78.1%) adult survivors of pediatric ALL who had received alkylating agent chemotherapy with or without CRT. Cumulative alkylating agent treatment was quantified using the cyclophosphamide equivalent dose (CED). Log-binomial multivariable models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% CI. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Compared to those without CRT, risk of oligospermia or azoospermia was not increased for CRT <20 Gy (P = 0.95) or 20-26 Gy (P = 0.58). Participants 5-9 years of age at diagnosis compared to those 0-4 years of age (RR = 1.30, 95% CI, 1.05-.61) or those treated with 8-12 g/m2 CED (RR = 2.06, 95% CI, 1.08-3.94) or >/=12 g/m2 CED (RR = 2.12, 95% CI, 1.09-4.12) compared to those treated with >0 to <4 g/m2 CED had an increased risk for oligospermia or azoospermia. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our study relied on the results of one semen analysis. ALL survivors who did not participate in SJLIFE or who declined to submit a semen analysis may also have biased our results regarding the proportion with azoospermia or oligospermia, since those who provided a semen specimen were less likely to have previously fathered children compared to those who did not. The lower rate of previous parenthood among participants may have resulted in a higher observed frequency of azoospermia and oligospermia. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Treatment with <26 Gy CRT did not increase the risk of oligospermia or azoospermia, although a CED exceeding 8 g/m2 and an age at diagnosis of 5-9 years did increase risk of oligospermia and azoospermia. These findings can be used to counsel adult survivors of pediatric ALL.

Multivariate regression analysis identified in particular MK(+) (n=22) as a new independent risk factor for poor event-free survival (EFS 23+/-9% vs 53+/-2% for all other patients, P=0.0003), even after exclusion of four patients with monosomy 7 (EFS 28+/-11%, P=0.0081). CK(+) patients without MK had a better prognosis (n=47, EFS 47+/-8%, P=0.46) than those with MK(+) (n=12, EFS 25+/-13%, P=0.024). HK(+) (n=37, EFS 44+/-8% for total cohort, P=0.3) influenced outcome only when t(8;21) patients were excluded (remaining n=16, EFS 9+/-8%, P<0.0001). An extremely poor outcome was observed for MK(+)/HK(+) patients (n=10, EFS 10+/-10%, P<0.0001). Finally, isolated trisomy 8 was also associated with low EFS (n=16, EFS 25+/-11%, P=0.0091). In conclusion, monosomal karyotype is a strong and independent predictor for high-risk pediatric AML. In addition, isolated trisomy 8 and hypodiploidy without t(8;21) coincide with dismal outcome. These results have important implications for risk stratification and should be further validated in independent pediatric cohorts.","['Rasche, M', 'von Neuhoff, C', 'Dworzak, M', 'Bourquin, J-P', 'Bradtke, J', 'Gohring, G', 'Escherich, G', 'Fleischhack, G', 'Graf, N', 'Gruhn, B', 'Haas, O A', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Kremens, B', 'Lehrnbecher, T', 'von Stackelberg, A', 'Tchinda, J', 'Zemanova, Z', 'Thiede, C', 'von Neuhoff, N', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Creutzig, U', 'Reinhardt, D']","['Rasche M', 'von Neuhoff C', 'Dworzak M', 'Bourquin JP', 'Bradtke J', 'Gohring G', 'Escherich G', 'Fleischhack G', 'Graf N', 'Gruhn B', 'Haas OA', 'Klingebiel T', 'Kremens B', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Tchinda J', 'Zemanova Z', 'Thiede C', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Zimmermann M', 'Creutzig U', 'Reinhardt D']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics, St Anna Children's Hospital and Children's Cancer Research Institute, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical School, Saarland University, Homburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', ""Labdia, Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Hemostaseology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital of Frankfurt/Main, Goethe-University Frankfurt/Main, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Hemostaseology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital of Frankfurt/Main, Goethe-University Frankfurt/Main, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Center of Oncocytogenetics, Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, General University Hospital and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Medicine I, University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170425,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5729330,,,,2017/04/27 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2016/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017121 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.121 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2807-2814. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.121.

However, the status of NKD1 expression and its clinical implication in acute myeloid leukemia remain largely elusive. NKD1 transcript level in bone marrow mononuclear cells was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 126 de novo acute myeloid leukemia patients and 30 controls. Clinical significance of NKD1 expression was obtained by the comparison between the patients with low and high NKD1 expression. NKD1 messenger RNA level was significantly decreased in acute myeloid leukemia patients compared with controls ( p = 0.019). There were no significant differences between patients with low and high NKD1 expression in sex, age, peripheral blood cells, bone marrow blasts, French-American-British/World Health Organization subtypes, and karyotypes/karyotypic classifications ( p > 0.05). Although no significant difference was observed in complete remission rate between NKD1(low) and NKD1(high) patients ( p > 0.05), Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that NKD1(low) patients showed shorter overall survival time than NKD1(high) patients in whole-cohort acute myeloid leukemia, non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia, and cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia ( p = 0.014, 0.063, and 0.020). Multivariate analyses disclosed the low NKD1 expression was an independent risk factor in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia patients (hazard ratio = 0.397, p = 0.017). Moreover, the prognostic value of NKD1 expression was confirmed by gene expression profile data in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia patients ( p = 0.028 and 0.011). NKD1 showed significantly increased level after induction chemotherapy achieved complete remission in follow-up paired acute myeloid leukemia patients ( p < 0.001). These findings indicated that reduced NKD1 expression is associated with unfavorable clinical outcome in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia.","['Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Yao, Dong-Ming', 'Han, Li', 'Xiao, Gao-Fei', 'Guo, Hong', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Li, Xi-Xi', 'Yuan, Qian', 'Yang, Lei', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhou JD', 'Yao DM', 'Han L', 'Xiao GF', 'Guo H', 'Zhang TJ', 'Li XX', 'Yuan Q', 'Yang L', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""1 Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""2 Medical Laboratory, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""3 Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""2 Medical Laboratory, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""3 Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""4 Medical Laboratory, Second People's Hospital of Huai'an, Huai'an, People's Republic of China."", ""3 Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""3 Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""1 Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""1 Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""1 Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""3 Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""1 Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""3 Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""1 Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,['NOTNLM'],"['NKD1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'expression', 'prognosis']",,2017/04/27 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428317699123 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2017 Apr;39(4):1010428317699123. doi: 10.1177/1010428317699123.,,20170613,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (NKD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aim to investigate the function of PCSK9 in the radioresistance of PCa cells. METHODS: PCSK9 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was introduced into the PCa cells by transient transfection. Then, cells were exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) at indicated dose rates. Cell damage was detected using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Hoechest 33342/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Rhodamine-123 (Rho-123) dye was used to assay mitochondrial membrane potential alteration. Western blot was used to detect the apoptosis-related protein expression. RESULTS: PCSK9 siRNA treatment significantly protected PCa cells from IR-induced cell damage, including enhancing cell viability, reducing apoptosis, and inhibiting MMPs. Moreover, PCSK9 siRNA repressed the increase of cytochrome C (cyto C), caspase-3, and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X (Bax) expressions induced by IR and promoted Bcl-2 expression, which might partially interpret the radioprotective role of PCSK9 siRNA in PCa cells. CONCLUSION: PCSK9 might impact on radiosensitivity through mitochondrial pathways and serve as a novel therapeutic target for PCa patients.","['Gan, Si-Shun', 'Ye, Jian-Qing', 'Wang, Lei', 'Qu, Fa-Jun', 'Chu, Chuan-Min', 'Tian, Yi-Jun', 'Yang, Wei', 'Cui, Xin-Gang']","['Gan SS', 'Ye JQ', 'Wang L', 'Qu FJ', 'Chu CM', 'Tian YJ', 'Yang W', 'Cui XG']","[""Department of Urinary Surgery of Third Affiliated Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urinary Surgery of Third Affiliated Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urinary Surgery of Third Affiliated Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urinary Surgery of Third Affiliated Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urinary Surgery of Third Affiliated Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urinary Surgery of Third Affiliated Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urinary Surgery of Third Affiliated Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urinary Surgery of Third Affiliated Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170412,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC5396925,['NOTNLM'],"['PCSK9', 'mitochondrial pathway', 'prostate cancer', 'radioresistance']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2017/04/27 06:00,2017/04/27 06:01,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S129413 [doi]', 'ott-10-2139 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Apr 12;10:2139-2146. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S129413. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors acting through the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway has shown efficacy in some chemotherapy-resistant adult cancers, generating interest that these agents may also be helpful to treat certain refractory pediatric malignancies. In this manuscript we review current strategies for targeting the PD-1 pathway, highlighting putative biomarkers and the rationale for investigation of these drugs to treat common pediatric tumors such as sarcoma, neuroblastoma, and high-grade glioma.

Histopathology shows interstitial granulomas composed of epitheloid histiocytes in the reticular dermis with surrounding foci of collagen degeneration and variable neutrophilic inflammation. We report 3 cases of generalized PNGD associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, which may show a variety of cutaneous manifestations. SRSF2 P95 hotspot mutations, found in 40%-50% of CMML cases, were retrospectively detected in skin and bone marrow biopsies of all 3 patients, in 1 of them already 5 years before CMML diagnosis. Generalized PNGD may represent a type of cutaneous manifestation of CMML. Because diagnosis of CMML is frequently difficult in cases with isolated persistent monocytosis and minimal dysplasia in the bone marrow, patients with a generalized PNGD should be evaluated for the presence of hematologic disorders including CMML, ideally supported by mutational analyses.","['Federmann, Birgit', 'Bonzheim, Irina', 'Yazdi, Amir S', 'Schmidt, Janine', 'Fend, Falko', 'Metzler, Gisela']","['Federmann B', 'Bonzheim I', 'Yazdi AS', 'Schmidt J', 'Fend F', 'Metzler G']","['Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, University Hospital and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, University Hospital and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, University Hospital and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, University Hospital and Comprehensive Cancer Center Tuebingen, University of Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen.

However, ruxolitinib, approved in 2011, remains the only one currently available for treatment of myelofibrosis, with many others having been discontinued for toxicity, and considerable uncertainty surrounding the future of those still in development. Areas covered: The available clinical data on pacritinib and momelotinib, the two agents in the most advanced phases of clinical testing in myelofibrosis, are examined in detail. NS-018 and INCB039110, selective inhibitors of JAK2 and JAK1, respectively, are also discussed. Finally, the JAK2 inhibitors no longer in clinical development are summarized in tabular form. Expert opinion: The different agents evaluated clearly differ in their kinomes, toxicity profiles and potential for myelosuppression. If approved, the JAK2-specific non-myelosuppressive inhibitor pacritinib could fulfill a major unmet need, that of patients with significant cytopenias. However, toxicity concerns persist. The data from the pivotal trials of momelotinib do not support its approval, although improvement of anemia is an important benefit. Selective JAK1 inhibition alone is unlikely to succeed in myelofibrosis. In these circumstances, rational ruxolitinib-based combinations may represent the best way forward.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Abou Zahr, Abdallah', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Bose P', 'Abou Zahr A', 'Verstovsek S']","['a Department of Leukemia , University of TX MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of TX MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia , University of TX MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170508,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,,['NOTNLM'],"['CHZ868', 'INCB039110', 'JAK inhibitors', 'Myelofibrosis', 'NS-018', 'RUXOLITINIB', 'momelotinib', 'pacritinib']",,2017/04/27 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2017/04/27 06:00'],"['2017/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2017.1323871 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2017 Jun;26(6):723-734. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2017.1323871.

We aimed to investigate the role of stromal cells, such as bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) and osteoblasts (OBs), in curcumin (CUR) and daunorubicin (DNR) induced apoptosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We used KG1 and U937 as leukemia cell line models and treated them with CUR and DNR. The cells were then co-cultured with BMSCs or a combination of BMSCs and OBs as feeders. After 24 hours of co-culture, BMSCs or OBs were sorted and separated from the leukemia cells and apoptosis levels were analyzed by annexin/propidium iodide (PI) staining on flow cytometry. Potentially involved molecular pathways were analyzed at gene and protein levels by Real time PCR and western blotting, respectively. The results showed AML cells cocultured with BMSCs plus OBs to be more resistant to drug induced-apoptosis compared to co-culture with BMSCs alone or without co-culture. Expression levels of OPN, CXCL-12, IL-6, STAT-3 and VCAM-1 were also significantly up-regulated in OBs and AML cells, at both mRNA and protein levels after co-culture, with concurrent enrichment of CD34+ AML cells. Our data showed, in a stromal cell niche-based model, that OBs revoke the influence of BMSCs on leukemic cells and promote enrichment of both CD34+ and CD34- leukemic stem cell (LSC) compartments in response to CUR and DNR. Up-regulation of OPN, CXCL-12, IL-6, STAT-3 and VCAM-1 in OBs and AML cells in co-culture might be part of molecular mechanisms that block CUR or CUR+DNR-induced apoptosis and promote enrichment of CD34+ and CD34- LSCs.","['Mohammadi, Saeed', 'Nikbakht, Mohsen', 'Sajjadi, Seyed Mehdi', 'Rad, Fariba', 'Chahardouli, Bahram', 'Sabour Takanlu, Javid', 'Rostami, Shahrbano', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Mohammadi S', 'Nikbakht M', 'Sajjadi SM', 'Rad F', 'Chahardouli B', 'Sabour Takanlu J', 'Rostami Sh', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Ghaffari SH']","['Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

In this study, we investigated the changes of Bcl-2 family members in the moderate paclitaxel-resistance of esophageal carcinoma EC109/PTX cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we evaluated the reversal effect using siRNAs and the recombinant inhibitor TW37 targeting Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1. Our findings show that downregulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 can significantly promote EC109/PTX cell apoptosis and reduce the EC109/PTX cell resistance index (RI). Furthermore, TW37 in combination with a P-gp inhibitor can synergistically reverse the paclitaxel resistance in EC109/PTX cells. These results suggest that targeting of the Bcl-2 family and P-gp is capable of reversing the resistance in EC109/PTX cells and the two-inhibitor combination may be a novel treatment strategy for resistant esophageal cancer.","['Shi, Xiaoli', 'Dou, Yinhui', 'Zhou, Kairui', 'Huo, Jinling', 'Yang, Tengjiao', 'Qin, Tiantian', 'Liu, Weihua', 'Wang, Saiqi', 'Yang, Dongxiao', 'Chang, Liming', 'Wang, Cong']","['Shi X', 'Dou Y', 'Zhou K', 'Huo J', 'Yang T', 'Qin T', 'Liu W', 'Wang S', 'Yang D', 'Chang L', 'Wang C']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Technology of Drug Preparation (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Technology of Drug Preparation (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Technology of Drug Preparation (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Technology of Drug Preparation (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Technology of Drug Preparation (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Technology of Drug Preparation (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Technology of Drug Preparation (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Technology of Drug Preparation (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Technology of Drug Preparation (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Technology of Drug Preparation (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, 100 Kexue Avenue, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Technology of Drug Preparation (Zhengzhou University), Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, PR China.

Test results revealed histological features similar to lichenoid dermatitis and early-phase primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with a subtype of mycosis fungoides (MF). Despite topical therapy with steroids, her skin disease continued to progress, so she underwent polymerase chain reaction and gene mutation testing. Two missense mutations were detected. The overall findings supported a diagnosis of co-occurring, CD4-positive large granular lymphocytosis and stage IA MF. The patient continued to receive topical steroids and maintenance phototherapy, and her skin lesions completely resolved after 14 weeks of therapy. Approximately 5 years after her initial presentation, she was free of symptoms, cytopenia, and no skin lesions were present. CD4-positive, large granular lymphocytosis was persistent. This patient case - to our knowledge, the first of its kind - posed dilemmas of a diagnostic and therapeutic nature.

Treatment with chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells targeting the CD19 antigen (CART-19 therapy) has been presented as a promising approach toward improving the outcome of relapsed or refractory disease. However, 10%-20% of the patients suffer another relapse. Epitope-loss under therapy pressure has been suggested as a mechanism of tumor cells to escape the recognition from CART-19 therapy. In this work, we analyzed the expression of CD19 isoforms in a cohort of 14 children with CD19 B-ALL and 6 nonleukemia donors. We showed that an alternatively spliced CD19 mRNA isoform lacking exon 2, and therefore the CART-19 epitope, but not isoforms lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic domains are expressed in leukemic blasts at diagnosis in children and in the bone marrow of nonleukemia donors. Furthermore, we clarified the sequence of a further isoform lacking the epitope recognized by CART-19 therapy and disclosed the presence of new isoforms. In comparison with the children, we showed that alternatively spliced CD19 mRNA isoforms affecting exon 2 are also expressed in 6 adult patients with CD19 B-ALL. On top of that, one of the adults expressed an isoform lacking the CD19 transmembrane and cytosolic domains. In conclusion, we proved that some of the CD19 isoforms contributing to CART-19 escape already preexist at diagnosis and could evolve as a dominant clone during CART-19 therapy suggesting the application of combined treatment approaches.","['Fischer, Jeannette', 'Paret, Claudia', 'El Malki, Khalifa', 'Alt, Francesca', 'Wingerter, Arthur', 'Neu, Marie A', 'Kron, Bettina', 'Russo, Alexandra', 'Lehmann, Nadine', 'Roth, Lea', 'Fehr, Eva-M', 'Attig, Sebastian', 'Hohberger, Alexander', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Faber, Jorg']","['Fischer J', 'Paret C', 'El Malki K', 'Alt F', 'Wingerter A', 'Neu MA', 'Kron B', 'Russo A', 'Lehmann N', 'Roth L', 'Fehr EM', 'Attig S', 'Hohberger A', 'Kindler T', 'Faber J']","[""*Section of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Hospital, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany double daggerThird Department of Medicine, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University section signResearch Center for Immunotherapy (FZI), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University daggerUniversity Cancer Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,PMC5424577,,,,2017/04/26 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000169 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2017 Jun;40(5):187-195. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000169.,,20180116,,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Escape', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study reports on the incidence of SPTs in a contemporary cohort of patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. METHODS: Ovarian cancer patients with a diagnosis of an ovarian malignancy between 1992 and 2012 were identified and characterized from 13 registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. RESULTS: Of 41,073 women with a diagnosis of an ovarian malignancy between 1992 and 2012, 1831 (4.5%) developed a microscopically confirmed SPT. There was no significant difference in the risk of developing an SPT at all sites between women with an ovarian cancer and the general population. There was an elevated risk of site-specific SPTs of the small intestine, vagina, thyroid gland, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in ovarian cancer patients compared with the general Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results population. Conversely, the risk of lung and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was significantly decreased in women with ovarian cancer. An elevated risk of SPTs was observed in women with mucinous, endometrioid, and germ cell tumors. White women had an overall decreased risk of developing a second primary solid tumor, whereas American Indian and Asian/Pacific Islander women had an overall increased risk of an SPT at any site. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SPTs in women with ovarian cancer was not significantly different as compared with the general population. However, divergent rates of SPTs in relation to histology, latency, age, and race were observed.","['Kanninen, Tomi T', 'Nasioudis, Dimitrios', 'Sisti, Giovanni', 'Holcomb, Kevin', 'Di Tommaso, Mariarosaria', 'Khalil, Susan', 'Gojayev, Anar', 'Witkin, Steven S']","['Kanninen TT', 'Nasioudis D', 'Sisti G', 'Holcomb K', 'Di Tommaso M', 'Khalil S', 'Gojayev A', 'Witkin SS']","['*Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York; daggerDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Queens, NY; and double daggerDepartment of Health Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Int J Gynecol Cancer,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,9111626,,,,,2017/04/26 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/IGC.0000000000000950 [doi]', '00009577-201705000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2017 May;27(4):659-667. doi: 10.1097/IGC.0000000000000950.,,20180112,,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we review recent literature on the involvement of lncRNAs in leukemia, including their role in driving or sustaining disease and their potential impact on diagnosis, classification, and prognosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Leukemogenesis is a complex process resulting from the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations. Over the last years, advances in high-throughput sequencing and transcriptome profiling have enabled the identification of lncRNAs involved in leukemia development. lncRNAs are able to distinguish different subtypes of human leukemia and several reports have identified specific patterns of lncRNA expression associated with clinical patient characteristics. Although functional studies on the actual role of these lncRNAs during transformation remain scarce, emerging evidence suggests that complex interactions between coding and non-coding transcript are truly involved in leukemia development. SUMMARY: Introduction of lncRNAs as an additional layer of complexity in human leukemia might provide new molecular genetic insights in the biology of this disease and could create unique opportunities for the identification of novel drug targets and diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.","['Lammens, Tim', 'Durinck, Kaat', 'Wallaert, Annelynn', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter']","['Lammens T', 'Durinck K', 'Wallaert A', 'Speleman F', 'Van Vlierberghe P']","['aDepartment of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital bCancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG) cCenter for Medical Genetics Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,,2017/04/26 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000354 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Jul;24(4):353-358. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000354.,,20171024,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compounds provide a new platform for the study of antiproliferative properties of gold(III) complexes. Seven complexes were tested: the neutral series (C^N(pz)^C)AuX [X = Cl (1), 6-thioguanine (4), C identical withCPh (5), SPh (6)] and an ionic series that included the N-methyl complex [(C^N(pzMe)^C)AuCl]BF4 (7) and the N-heterocyclic carbene complexes [(C^N(pz)^C)AuL](+) with L = 1,3-dimethylbenzimidazol-2-ylidene (2) or 1,3,7,9-tetramethylxanthin-8-ylidene (3). Tests against human leukemia cells identified 1, 2, 3, and 4 as particularly promising, whereas protecting the noncoordinated N atom on the pyrazine ring by methylation (as in 7) reduced the cytotoxicity. Complex 2 proved to be the most effective of the entire series against the HL60 leukemia, MCF-7 breast cancer, and A549 lung cancer cell lines, with IC50 values down to submicromolar levels, associated with a lower toxicity toward healthy human lung fibroblast cells. The benzimidazolylidene complex 2 accumulated more effectively in human lung cancer cells than its caffeine-based analogue 3 and the gold(III) chloride 1. Compound 2 proved to be unaffected by glutathione under physiological conditions for periods of up to 6 days and stabilizes the DNA G-quadruplex and i-motif structures; the latter is the first such report for gold compounds.

In most developed countries 1-2% of patients die during remission induction; however, in developing countries, this figure is higher and the causes of death apparently vary among the populations studied. The aim was to determine the cause of death during remission induction in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the hospital ""Dr. Gaudencio Gonzalez Garza"" of Centro Medico Nacional La Raza from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out and a descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 463 patients with ALL were diagnosed, out of which 5.4% died (n = 25). Among the patients who died, 64% (n = 16) were female and 60% had high-risk clinical features at diagnosis. The main causes of death were septic shock and bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Early mortality was five times higher than the one reported for developed countries, while the causes of death did not differ. Close monitoring is necessary to detect and promptly treat complications secondary to chemotherapy toxicity in Mexican pediatric patients with ALL.","['Aguilar-Hernandez, Maximo', 'Fernandez-Castillo, Gabriela', 'Nunez-Villegas, Nora Nancy', 'Perez-Casillas, Ruy Xavier', 'Nunez-Enriquez, Juan Carlos']","['Aguilar-Hernandez M', 'Fernandez-Castillo G', 'Nunez-Villegas NN', 'Perez-Casillas RX', 'Nunez-Enriquez JC']","['Servicio de Hematologia Pediatrica, Hospital General ""Dr. Gaudencio Gonzalez Garza"", Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico. jcarlos_nu@hotmail.com.']",['spa'],['Journal Article'],,Mexico,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc,Revista medica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,101243727,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'Child', 'Mexico', 'Premature death']",,2017/04/26 06:00,2018/03/07 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc. 2017 May-Jun;55(3):286-291.,,20180306,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*mortality', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,Principales causas de mortalidad durante la fase de induccion a la remision en los pacientes pediatricos con leucemia linfoblastica aguda.,,,,,,

Methods: MN1 expression was measured in 85 newly diagnosed adults younger than 60 years by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Results: At diagnosis 67.4% of cases had elevated MN1 expression, this being associated with a worse prognosis, higher incidence of lymphadenopathy and CD34 transcript expression (p=0.02 and <0.001, respectively). No other molecular or clinical characteristics were significantly associated with MN1expression. Patients with high MN1 expression had lower complete response rate at day 15 compared to patients with low MN1 expression (p=0.09) and a significantly higher relapse rate (21.1% versus 7.7%, respectively, p=0.04). Patients with high MN1 expression had shorter TTP compared to those with low expression, p= 0.07. Conclusion: MN1 expression may predict outcome in AML patients.

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of Wnt antagonists (Wnt5a, HDPR1, DKK1 and DKK3) in patients with AL and in normal controls; pyrophosphate sequencing was performed to detect the methylation status of the Wnt5a promoter; and western blotting was performed to detect the overall expression levels of Wnt5a protein and histone H4K20me1 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in normal controls. The relationship between Wnt5a protein expression and histone H4K20me1 was analyzed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) was performed to investigate the recruitment of H4K20me1 and SET8 to the Wnt5a promoter and coding regions. Our results demonstrated that the expression levels of Wnt antagonists were generally low in AML, but showed differential expression in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). In most cases of AML, methylation of the Wnt5a promoter was observed and Wnt5a protein expression was low. In some cases of AML, the overall level of H4K20me1 protein was higher than that in normal controls. In addition, Wnt5a expression was positively correlated with H4K20me1 expression and was unrelated to the methylation status of its promoter. Moreover, H4K20me1 and SET8 were enriched in the Wnt5a promoter region and coding region. By contrast, Wnt5a expression was unrelated to H4K20me1 expression in normal controls. Moreover, we observed that the methylation of Wnt antagonists was often found in patients with AL, particularly those with AML, whereas the extent of methylation was variable in ALL patients. Wnt5a expression was positively correlated with the enrichment of H4K20me1 and SET8 at the Wnt5a promoter and coding regions. H4K20me1 increased Wnt5a expression by promoting transcription initiation and elongation.","['Zhou, Hua-Rong', 'Fu, Hai-Ying', 'Wu, Dan-Sen', 'Zhang, Yuan-Yuan', 'Huang, Si-Han', 'Chen, Cong-Jie', 'Yan, Jian-Guo', 'Huang, Jin-Long', 'Shen, Jian-Zhen']","['Zhou HR', 'Fu HY', 'Wu DS', 'Zhang YY', 'Huang SH', 'Chen CJ', 'Yan JG', 'Huang JL', 'Shen JZ']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, P.R.

As endogenous H2S exerts pro-cancer functions, inhibition of its production in cancer cells may provide a new cancer treatment strategy and be achieved via regulation of the function of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), one of the main metabolic enzymes synthesizing H2S. This enzyme plays important roles in the development and progression of colon and ovarian cancer, primarily regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics and accelerating cell cycle progression. In the present study, we firstly investigated the role of the CBS/H2S system in human hepatoma cells, and then the inhibitory effect of a quinolone-indolone conjugate QIC2 on this system. When CBS was overexpressed in human hepatoma HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells, inhibition of endogenous CBS/H2S significantly reduced their viability and growth rate, as well as the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells. Meanwhile, CBS knockdown caused multiple effects, including apoptosis of SMMC-7721 cells, an increase in the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/B cell lymphoma/leukemia (Bcl-2) ratio, activation of caspase-3 and polyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), when compared with the scramble siRNA (Sc siRNA)-transfected groups. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; a microsomal enzyme) expression was significantly decreased while the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was increased in the CBS siRNA-transfected SMMC-7721 cells. QIC2 significantly reduced SMMC-7721 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and showed a lower toxicity in human normal liver HL-7702 cells relative to the positive controls sunitinib and doxorubicin (DOX). The compound also inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. Further analysis indicated that QIC2 downregulated the CBS/H2S system, decreased both HO-1 protein and glutathione (GSH) levels while increased the ROS level and activated the caspase-3 cascade. Collectively, our results demonstrated that the CBS/H2S system plays important roles in human hepatoma cells and QIC2 significantly inhibited cell growth via downregulation of the system.","['Jia, Huina', 'Ye, Juan', 'You, Jing', 'Shi, Xiaoyan', 'Kang, Wenyi', 'Wang, Tianxiao']","['Jia H', 'Ye J', 'You J', 'Shi X', 'Kang W', 'Wang T']","['Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, College of Pharmacy, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan 475004, P.R.

However, regulation of PHB is not clearly understood. Here, we focused on the regulation of PHB expression by Wnt signaling, one of dominant regulatory signals in various leukemic cells. High mRNA levels of PHB were found in half of clinical leukemia samples. PHB expression was increased by inhibition of the MAPK pathway and decreased by activation of EGF signal. Although cell proliferating signals downregulated the transcription of PHB, treatment with lithium chloride, an analog of the Wnt signal, induced PHB level in various cell types. We identified the TCF-4/LEF-1 binding motif, CATCTG, in the promoter region of PHB by site-directed mutagenesis and ChIP assay. This beta-catenin-mediated activation of PHB expression was independent of cMYC activation, a product of Wnt signaling. These data indicate that PHB is a direct target of beta-catenin and the increased level of PHB in leukemia can be regulated by Wnt signaling.","['Kim, Dong Min', 'Jang, Hanbit', 'Shin, Myung Geun', 'Kim, Jeong-Hoon', 'Shin, Sang Mo', 'Min, Sang-Hyun', 'Kim, Il-Chul']","['Kim DM', 'Jang H', 'Shin MG', 'Kim JH', 'Shin SM', 'Min SH', 'Kim IC']","['Center for Applied Life Science, Hanbat National University, Daejon 305-719, Republic of Korea.', 'Medical Proteomics Research Center, KRIBB, Daejon 305-806, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University, Hwasun 519-763, Republic of Korea.', 'Medical Proteomics Research Center, KRIBB, Daejon 305-806, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Applied Life Science, Hanbat National University, Daejon 305-719, Republic of Korea.', 'New Drug Development Center, DGMIF, Daegu 701-310, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju 500-757, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170425,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,PMC5442404,,,,2017/04/26 06:00,2018/03/07 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2016/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2017.5599 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2017 Jun;37(6):3201-3208. doi: 10.3892/or.2017.5599.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)restriction fragment length polymorphism and PCR product sequencing were used to detect the genotype of CYP3A5*3. PCR was then used to express the mRNA expression of CYP3A5. A midazolam probe method was used to detect CYP3A enzyme activity, and DNR concentrations were measured using high performance liquid chromatography. Children with different genotypes had different mRNA expression levels of CYP3A5, and CYP3A enzyme activity in children with the CYP3A5*1 allele was higher, compared with that in children with the CYP3A5*3 allele.

The AUC of DNR was increased in children with acute lymphatic leukemia who suffered from cardiotoxicity, compared with those in the normal group. The CYP3A5*3 gene polymorphism was closely associated with the mRNA expression of CYP3A5, CYP3A enzyme activity and DNR plasma drug concentration, and exhibited different drug adverse reactions.","['Huang, Zhen', 'Wang, Juxiang', 'Qian, Jiangchao', 'Li, Yuan', 'Xu, Zhisheng', 'Chen, Min', 'Tong, Hongfei']","['Huang Z', 'Wang J', 'Qian J', 'Li Y', 'Xu Z', 'Chen M', 'Tong H']","[""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325027, P.R.

The present study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of apoptotic celldeath induced by GRh2 and GRg3 in human leukemia Jurkat cells. The Cell Counting kit8 assay was used to determine cell proliferation. Apoptosis was detected by nuclear morphologic observation by Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V-allophycocyanin and 7-amino-actinomycin D assay. mitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, was used to examine the effects of mitochondrial ROS on cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Finally, the expression levels of numerous mitochondrialassociated apoptosis proteins were assessed by western blot analysis. These results demonstrated that GRh2 and GRg3 inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis, and that GRh2 had greater cytotoxicity than GRg3. GRh2 induced generation of more mitochondrial ROS compared with GRg3 in Jurkat cells; however, this effect was ameliorated by subsequent treatment with mitoTEMPO. Furthermore, excess mitochondrial ROS induced by GRh2 was more potent than GRg3 in inhibiting cell proliferation and reducing MMP. In addition, expression levels of apoptosisassociated proteins were significantly increased in Jurkat cells treated with GRh2 than GRg3. In conclusion, these fi ndings suggested that GRh2 and GRg3 induce mitochondrial-associated apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial ROS in human leukemia Jurkat cells. GRh2 may more effectively inhibit cell growth and accelerate apoptosis than GRg3. This study provides a potential novel strategy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Xia, Ting', 'Wang, Ying-Nan', 'Zhou, Chuan-Xin', 'Wu, Li-Mei', 'Liu, Yong', 'Zeng, Qian-Hong', 'Zhang, Xiang-Long', 'Yao, Jia-Hui', 'Wang, Min', 'Fang, Jian-Pei']","['Xia T', 'Wang YN', 'Zhou CX', 'Wu LM', 'Liu Y', 'Zeng QH', 'Zhang XL', 'Yao JH', 'Wang M', 'Fang JP']","['Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology, Ministry of Education, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin 300457, P.R.

While genetic mutations associated with human colorectal cancer development are well-known, little is known about how and whether epigenetic factors specifically contribute to the functional properties of human colorectal CSCs. Here we report that the KDM3 family of histone demethylases plays an important role in tumorigenic potential and survival of human colorectal CSCs by epigenetically activating Wnt target gene transcription. The depletion of KDM3 inhibits tumorigenic growth and chemoresistance of human colorectal CSCs. Mechanistically, KDM3 not only directly erases repressive H3K9me2 marks, but also helps to recruit histone methyltransferase MLL1 to promote H3K4 methylation, thereby promoting Wnt target gene transcription. Our results suggest that KDM3 is a critical epigenetic factor in Wnt signalling that orchestrates chromatin changes and transcription in human colorectal CSCs, identifying potential therapeutic targets for effective elimination of CSCs.","['Li, Jiong', 'Yu, Bo', 'Deng, Peng', 'Cheng, Yingduan', 'Yu, Yongxin', 'Kevork, Kareena', 'Ramadoss, Sivakumar', 'Ding, Xiangming', 'Li, Xinmin', 'Wang, Cun-Yu']","['Li J', 'Yu B', 'Deng P', 'Cheng Y', 'Yu Y', 'Kevork K', 'Ramadoss S', 'Ding X', 'Li X', 'Wang CY']","['Laboratory of Molecular Signaling, Division of Oral Biology and Medicine, School of Dentistry and Broad Stem Cell Research Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Signaling, Division of Oral Biology and Medicine, School of Dentistry and Broad Stem Cell Research Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Signaling, Division of Oral Biology and Medicine, School of Dentistry and Broad Stem Cell Research Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Signaling, Division of Oral Biology and Medicine, School of Dentistry and Broad Stem Cell Research Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Signaling, Division of Oral Biology and Medicine, School of Dentistry and Broad Stem Cell Research Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Signaling, Division of Oral Biology and Medicine, School of Dentistry and Broad Stem Cell Research Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Signaling, Division of Oral Biology and Medicine, School of Dentistry and Broad Stem Cell Research Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Signaling, Division of Oral Biology and Medicine, School of Dentistry and Broad Stem Cell Research Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170425,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC5414094,,,,2017/04/26 06:00,2018/11/21 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms15146 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms15146 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2017 Apr 25;8:15146. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15146.,,20181120,,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (JMJD1C protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM3B protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/surgery', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating/genetics/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['R01 DE015964/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,['Nat Commun. 2019 Nov 4;10(1):5020.

It is also known for its ability to cause side effects, such as allergy and pancreatitis, as well as lipid and coagulation disturbances. The most important laboratory abnormalities are hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) and low antithrombin (AT). HTG is usually considered to be transient and benign in children with ALL, whereas low AT activity predisposes to thrombosis. Studies on the incidence and significance of HTG in children with ALL are scarce, and their findings have not always been congruent. We investigated the incidence and significance of ASP-related HTG, defined as triglyceride values more than five times the upper normal limit, in children with ALL. PROCEDURE: We analyzed the laboratory and clinical data of children diagnosed with ALL at the Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, from July 2008 to December 2014. Triglyceride and AT values were measured before each injection of pegylated ASP. RESULTS: The study group comprised of 92 patients, aged 1-17.9 years at diagnosis (median 4.8 years), almost half (42/92, 46%) of whom had HTG. A significant negative correlation between triglyceride and AT values was observed in those aged over 10 years (P = 0.0002). No significant correlation was found between HTG and thrombosis, osteonecrosis, or pancreatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Although common, ASP-associated HTG was not associated with other ASP-related toxicities. HTG correlated with decreased AT activity in older children, which may explain previous association between HTG and thrombosis. Larger studies are of interest with regard to establishing guidelines for HGT management.","['Persson, Lisa', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Hed Myrberg, Ida', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Nilsson, Anna', 'Ranta, Susanna']","['Persson L', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Hed Myrberg I', 'Heyman M', 'Nilsson A', 'Ranta S']","[""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20170425,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'asparaginase', 'hypertriglyceridemia']",,2017/04/26 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2016/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26559 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Oct;64(10). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26559.

HLA-mismatched unrelated donors (MMURD) are often used as an alternative stem cell source but are associated with increased transplant related complications. Whether ABO incompatibility affects outcome in MMURD transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is unknown. We evaluated 1,013 AML patients who underwent MMURD transplantation between 2005 and 2014. Engraftment rates were comparable between ABO matched and mismatched patients, as were relapse incidence [34%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 28-39; for ABO matched vs. 36%; 95% CI, 32-40; for ABO mismatched; P = .32], and nonrelapse mortality (28%; 95% CI, 23-33; for ABO matched vs. 25%; 95% CI, 21-29; for ABO mismatched; P = .2).

Collections from children with high-risk leukemia present a challenge, especially because the established COBE Spectra apheresis device is being replaced by the novel Spectra Optia device (Optia) in many institutions. Published experience for mononuclear cell collections in children with Optia is lacking. Our aim was to compare the two collection devices and describe modified settings on the Optia to optimize mononuclear cell collections. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: As a quality initiative, we retrospectively collected and compared data from mononuclear cell collections on both devices. Collected data included patient's clinical characteristics; collection parameters, including precollection lymphocyte/CD3 counts, total blood volumes processed, runtimes, and side effects (including complete blood count and electrolyte changes); and product characteristics, including volumes and cell counts. Collection efficiencies and collection ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-six mononuclear cell collections were performed on 20 pediatric patients: 11 with COBE and 15 with Optia. Adequate mononuclear cell products were successfully collected with a single procedure from all patients except one, with mean calculated mononuclear cell collection efficiency that was significantly higher from Optia collections compared with COBE collections (57.9 +/- 4.6% vs 40.3 +/- 6.2%, respectively; p = 0.04). CD3-positive yields were comparable on both machines (p = 0.34) with significantly smaller blood volumes processed on Optia. Collected products had larger volumes on Optia. No significant side effects attributed to the procedure were noted. CONCLUSION: Mononuclear cell apheresis using the Optia device in children is more efficient and is as safe as that with the COBE device.","['Even-Or, Ehud', 'Di Mola, Maria', 'Ali, Muhammad', 'Courtney, Sarah', 'McDougall, Elizabeth', 'Alexander, Sarah', 'Schechter, Tal', 'Whitlock, James A', 'Licht, Christoph', 'Krueger, Joerg']","['Even-Or E', 'Di Mola M', 'Ali M', 'Courtney S', 'McDougall E', 'Alexander S', 'Schechter T', 'Whitlock JA', 'Licht C', 'Krueger J']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Paediatric Laboratory Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170425,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,,,,2017/04/26 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2016/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.14094 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2017 Jun;57(6):1536-1542. doi: 10.1111/trf.14094.

From 1993 to 2012, 543 children from the Nordic countries were treated according to two consecutive protocols: 208 children relapsed. The influence of disease characteristics, first line treatment, relapse therapy and duration of first remission on outcome was analysed. Second complete remission (CR2) was achieved in 146 (70%) patients. Estimated 5-year overall survival (OS5y ) was 39 +/- 4% for the whole group and 43 +/- 4% for the 190 patients given re-induction therapy, of whom 76% received regimens that included fludarabine, cytarabine (FLA) +/- anthracyclines, 18% received Nordic Society for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) upfront blocks and 5% received other regimens. Late relapse >/=1 year from diagnosis, no allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in first remission and core binding factor AML were independent favourable prognostic factors for survival. For the 128 children (124 in CR2) that received SCT as consolidation therapy after relapse, OS5y was 61 +/- 5%. Four of 19 children (21%) survived without receiving SCT as part of relapse therapy. Our data show that intensive re-induction followed by SCT can give cure rates of 40% in children with relapsed AML.","['Karlsson, Lene', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Noren Nystrom, Ulrika', 'Palle, Josefine', 'Tierens, Anne', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas']","['Karlsson L', 'Forestier E', 'Hasle H', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Jonsson OG', 'Lausen B', 'Noren Nystrom U', 'Palle J', 'Tierens A', 'Zeller B', 'Abrahamsson J']","['Institution for Clinical Sciences, Department of Paediatrics, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Paediatrics, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', ""Division of Haematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", ""Children's Hospital, Landspitali University Hospital, Hringbraut, Reykjavik, Iceland."", 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Paediatrics, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Department of Pathobiology and Laboratory Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institution for Clinical Sciences, Department of Paediatrics, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170425,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*allogenic stem cell transplant', '*childhood', '*relapsed', '*survival']",,2017/04/26 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14720 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Aug;178(4):592-602. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14720.

To further characterize this aberration, we investigated the prognostic significance of 13q deletion in 541 patients with BCLPDs. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies with 13q locus-specific LSI-D13S25 and LSI-RB1 probes. 52.1% of the patients with CLL harbored 13q deletion, which was significantly higher than that of other BCLPDs (p < 0.001). The size of 13q deletion was heterogeneous in both CLL and other BCLPDs. However, the distribution of cases with different deletion sizes showed no significant difference between the two groups. Whereas 13q deletion was a favorable prognostic factor in CLL, a large deletion of 13q was associated with poor prognosis in terms of time to first therapy (p = 0.020), progression-free survival (p = 0.05) and overall survival (p = 0.002) in BCLPD cases other than CLL. In conclusion, the deletion of 13q varied in size both in CLL and in other BCLPDs and adversely influenced the prognosis of patients with other BCLPDs.","['Yi, Shuhua', 'Li, Heng', 'Li, Zengjun', 'Xiong, Wenjie', 'Liu, Huimin', 'Liu, Wei', 'Lv, Rui', 'Yu, Zhen', 'Zou, Dehui', 'Xu, Yan', 'An, Gang', 'Qiu, Lugui']","['Yi S', 'Li H', 'Li Z', 'Xiong W', 'Liu H', 'Liu W', 'Lv R', 'Yu Z', 'Zou D', 'Xu Y', 'An G', 'Qiu L']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. zengjunli@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No. 288, Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China. qiulg@ihcams.ac.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170424,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['13q14 deletion', 'BCLPDs', 'Interphase fish', 'Prognosis']",,2017/04/26 06:00,2018/03/09 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2240-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2240-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Sep;106(3):418-425. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2240-2.

RECENT FINDINGS: Ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax are small molecule inhibitors that have revolutionized therapeutic options for patients with CLL, particularly for those with high-risk disease including 17p deletion. These drugs are increasingly finding application in a variety of subtypes of B cell NHL. Intolerance and resistance are concerns for select patients, highlighting the need for continual development of alternate therapies. The treatment armamentarium for CLL and NHL is vastly different than it was just a few years ago. Patients have a much wider range of non-chemotherapy treatment options, some of which produce durable responses and have long-term tolerability. Future research directions will likely focus on identifying the optimal sequences and combination strategies for these new targeted therapies.","['Rosenthal, Allison']",['Rosenthal A'],"['Mayo Clinic Arizona, 5777 E Mayo Blvd, Phoenix, AZ, 85054, USA.

Risk factors and clinical characteristics.,521-527,10.15537/smj.2017.5.16375 [doi],"OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics of pediatric patients colonized or infected by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) at a Saudi children's hospital, to identify risk factors associated with infection, and to investigate the antimicrobial resistance patterns of this emerging pathogen. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, 64 non-duplicating S. maltophilia strains were isolated in Najran Maternity and Children's Hospital, Najran, Saudi Arabia between January 2015 to February 2016. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the reference broth microdilution method. Results: In this study, 48 (75%) isolates were identified in true infections and 16 (25%) isolates were considered colonization. The main types of S. maltophilia infection were pneumonia in 22 (45.8%) patients and bloodstream infection in 14 (29.2%) patients. The significant risk factors included exposure to invasive procedure (p=0.02), and presence of acute leukemia as an underlying disease (p=0.02). The most active antimicrobials were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (100% sensitivity) and tigecycline (93.7% sensitivity). Conclusions: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen among pediatric patients. Accurate identification and susceptibility testing of this emerging pathogen are crucial for the management of infected patients and prevention of spread of this nosocomial pathogen.","['Alqahtani, Jobran M']",['Alqahtani JM'],"['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Najran University, Najran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Previous studies have demonstrated oncogenic potential of certain CSF3R truncation mutations prior to internalization motifs. However, the oncogenic potential of truncating the more distal region of CSF3R cytoplasmic domain as well as cytoplasmic missense mutations remains uncharacterized. Here we identified that CSF3R distal cytoplasmic truncation mutations (Q793-Q823) also harbored leukemogenic potential. Mechanistically, these distal cytoplasmic truncation mutations demonstrated markedly decreased receptor degradation, probably owing to loss of the de-phosphorylation domain (residues N818-F836). Furthermore, all truncations prior to Q823 demonstrated increased expression of the higher molecular weight CSF3R band, which is shown to be essential for the receptor surface expression and the oncogenic potential. We further demonstrated that sufficient STAT5 activation is essential for oncogenic potential. In addition, CSF3R K704A demonstrated transforming capacity due to interruption of receptor ubiquitination and degradation. In summary, we have expanded the region of the CSF3R cytoplasmic domain in which truncation or missense mutations exhibit leukemogenic capacity, which will be useful for evaluating the relevance of CSF3R mutations in patients and helpful in defining targeted therapy strategies.","['Zhang, H', 'Reister Schultz, A', 'Luty, S', 'Rofelty, A', 'Su, Y', 'Means, S', 'Bottomly, D', 'Wilmot, B', 'McWeeney, S K', 'Tyner, J W']","['Zhang H', 'Reister Schultz A', 'Luty S', 'Rofelty A', 'Su Y', 'Means S', 'Bottomly D', 'Wilmot B', 'McWeeney SK', 'Tyner JW']","['Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology, Oregon Health & Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20170425,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5682244,,,,2017/04/26 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017126 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.126 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2752-2760. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.126.

The proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib is approved for relapsed or refractory MM (RRMM). In phase 3 trials, carfilzomib-based regimens (ASPIRE, carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone; ENDEAVOR, carfilzomib-dexamethasone) demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared with standard therapies for RRMM (ASPIRE: lenalidomide-dexamethasone; ENDEAVOR, bortezomib-dexamethasone). This subgroup analysis of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR evaluated outcomes according to prior ASCT status. In total, 446 patients in ASPIRE and 538 in ENDEAVOR had prior ASCT. Median PFS was longer for carfilzomib-based regimens vs non-carfilzomib-based regimens for patients with prior ASCT (ASPIRE: 26.3 vs 17.8 months (hazard ratio (HR)=0.68); ENDEAVOR: not estimable vs 10.2 months (HR=0.61)), those with one prior line of therapy that included ASCT (ASPIRE: 29.7 vs 17.8 months (HR=0.70); ENDEAVOR: not estimable vs 11.2 months (HR=0.46)), and those without prior ASCT (ASPIRE: 26.4 vs 16.6 months (HR=0.76); ENDEAVOR: 17.7 vs 8.5 months (HR=0.43)).

Recently, we implicated the sialyltransferase ST3Gal-6, an enzyme critical to the generation of E-selectin ligands, in MM BM homing and resistance to therapy. Since E-selectin is constitutively expressed in the BM microvasculature, we wished to establish the contribution of E-selectin ligands to MM biology. We report that functional E-selectin ligands are restricted to a minor subpopulation of MM cell lines which, upon expansion, demonstrate specific and robust interaction with recombinant E-selectin in vitro. Moreover, an increase in the mRNA levels of genes involved in the generation of E-selectin ligands was associated with inferior progression-free survival in the CoMMpass study. In vivo, E-selectin ligand-enriched cells induced a more aggressive disease and were completely insensitive to Bortezomib. Importantly, this resistance could be reverted by co-administration of GMI-1271, a specific glycomimetic antagonist of E-selectin. Finally, we report that E-selectin ligand-bearing cells are present in primary MM samples from BM and peripheral blood with a higher proportion seen in relapsed patients. This study provides a rationale for targeting E-selectin receptor/ligand interactions to overcome MM metastasis and chemoresistance.","['Natoni, A', 'Smith, T A G', 'Keane, N', 'McEllistrim, C', 'Connolly, C', 'Jha, A', 'Andrulis, M', 'Ellert, E', 'Raab, M S', 'Glavey, S V', 'Kirkham-McCarthy, L', 'Kumar, S K', 'Locatelli-Hoops, S C', 'Oliva, I', 'Fogler, W E', 'Magnani, J L', ""O'Dwyer, M E""]","['Natoni A', 'Smith TAG', 'Keane N', 'McEllistrim C', 'Connolly C', 'Jha A', 'Andrulis M', 'Ellert E', 'Raab MS', 'Glavey SV', 'Kirkham-McCarthy L', 'Kumar SK', 'Locatelli-Hoops SC', 'Oliva I', 'Fogler WE', 'Magnani JL', ""O'Dwyer ME""]","['Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'GlycoMimetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Department of Hematology, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Department of Hematology, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Department of Hematology, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Insight Centre for Data Analytics, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Experimental Therapeutics for Hematologic Malignancies German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, Heidelberg University Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Department of Hematology, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'GlycoMimetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA.', 'GlycoMimetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA.', 'GlycoMimetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA.', 'GlycoMimetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Department of Hematology, Biomedical Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170425,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5729350,,,,2017/04/26 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2016/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017123 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.123 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2642-2651. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.123.

Natural compounds like curcumin that target such susceptibilities have failed further clinical advancements due to the poor stability and bioavailability as well as the need of high effective doses. We have synthesized and evaluated the anti-cancer activity of several monocarbonyl analogs of curcumin. Interestingly, two novel analogs (Compound A and I) in comparison to curcumin, have increased chemical stability and have greater anti-cancer activity in a variety of human cancer cells, including triple-negative, inflammatory breast cancer cells. In particular, the generation of reactive oxygen species was selective to cancer cells and occurred upstream of mitochondrial collapse and execution of apoptosis. Furthermore, Compound A in combination with another cancer-selective/pro-oxidant, piperlongumine, caused an enhanced anti-cancer effect. Most importantly, Compound A was well tolerated by mice and was effective in inhibiting the growth of human triple-negative breast cancer and leukemia xenografts in vivo when administered intraperitoneally. Thus, exploiting oxidative vulnerabilities in cancer cells could be a selective and efficacious means to eradicate malignant cells as demonstrated by the curcumin analogs presented in this report with high therapeutic potential.","['Pignanelli, Christopher', 'Ma, Dennis', 'Noel, Megan', 'Ropat, Jesse', 'Mansour, Fadi', 'Curran, Colin', 'Pupulin, Simon', 'Larocque, Kristen', 'Wu, Jianzhang', 'Liang, Guang', 'Wang, Yi', 'Pandey, Siyaram']","['Pignanelli C', 'Ma D', 'Noel M', 'Ropat J', 'Mansour F', 'Curran C', 'Pupulin S', 'Larocque K', 'Wu J', 'Liang G', 'Wang Y', 'Pandey S']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Ontario, N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Ontario, N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Ontario, N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Ontario, N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Ontario, N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Ontario, N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Ontario, N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Ontario, N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, University Town, Chashan, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, 325035, P.R.

In herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected cells, ND10 bodies assemble at the sites of DNA entering the nucleus after infection. In sequence, the ND10 bodies become viral replication compartments, and ICP0, a viral E3 ligase, degrades both PML and SP100. The amounts of PML and SP100 and the number of ND10 structures increase in cells exposed to IFN-beta. Earlier studies have shown that PML has three key functions. Thus, (i) the interaction of PML with viral components facilitates the initiation of replication compartments, (ii) viral replication is significantly less affected by IFN-beta in PML(-/-) cells than in parental PML(+/+) cells, and (iii) viral yields are significantly lower in PML(-/-) cells exposed to low ratios of virus per cell compared with parental PML(+/+) cells. This report focuses on the function of SP100. In contrast to PML(-/-) cells, SP100(-/-) cells retain the sensitivity of parental SP100(+/+) cells to IFN-beta and support replication of the DeltaICP0 virus. At low multiplicities of infection, wild-type virus yields are higher in SP100(-/-) cells than in parental HEp-2 cells.

We sought to determine whether the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool was expanded in Fv-2(r)-resistant mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 120-day bone marrow transplantation competitive repopulation assay was used to determine whether FVP-infected Fv-2(r) C57BL/6 mice demonstrated expansion of the HSC pool compared to the pool of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells in the same marrow assayed in vitro. RESULTS: There was a significant expansion of committed hematopoietic progenitors observed in virus-infected Fv-2(s) FVB mice, but not Fv-2(r) C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, Fv-2(r) mice showed no detectable expansion of either committed hematopoietic progenitor cells or the multipotential stem cell pool by competitive repopulation assay. CONCLUSION: Friend virus disease in Fv-2(s) mice is associated with expansion of committed hematopoietic progenitors. Fv-2(r) mice show no expansion of either committed progenitor or pluripotential stem cell numbers.","['Epperly, Michael W', 'Zhang, Xichen', 'Fisher, Renee', 'Hou, Wen', 'Franicola, Darcy', 'Shields, Donna', 'Quickel, Michael', 'Hankey-Giblin, Pamela', 'Wang, Hong', 'Greenberger, Joel S']","['Epperly MW', 'Zhang X', 'Fisher R', 'Hou W', 'Franicola D', 'Shields D', 'Quickel M', 'Hankey-Giblin P', 'Wang H', 'Greenberger JS']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Science, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Penn State University, University Park, PA, U.S.A.', 'Clinical and Translational Science Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Science, Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Penn State University, University Park, PA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A. greenbergerjs@upmc.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,PMC5461439,['NOTNLM'],"['*Friend virus', '*competitive repopulation assay', '*hematopoietic stem cells']",,2017/04/26 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2017/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['31/3/313 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.11061 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2017 May-Jun;31(3):313-320. doi: 10.21873/invivo.11061.,,20180213,,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology/virology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology/virology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology/virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/*pathology/virology', 'Spleen/pathology/virology', 'Splenomegaly/pathology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology/virology']","['TL1 TR002016/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI068021/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002014/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The proportion of emergency presenters who have consulted previously with relevant symptoms is uncertain. AIM: To examine how many patients with cancer, who were diagnosed as emergencies, have had previous primary care consultations with relevant symptoms; and among those, to examine how many had multiple consultations. DESIGN AND SETTING: Secondary analysis of patient survey data from the 2010 English Cancer Patient Experience Survey (CPES), previously linked to population-based data on diagnostic route. METHOD: For emergency presenters with 18 different cancers, associations were examined for two outcomes (prior GP consultation status; and 'three or more consultations' among prior consultees) using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 4647 emergency presenters, 1349 (29%) reported no prior consultations, being more common in males (32% versus 25% in females, P<0.001), older (44% in >/=85 versus 30% in 65-74-year-olds, P<0.001), and the most deprived (35% versus 25% least deprived, P = 0.001) patients; and highest/lowest for patients with brain cancer (46%) and mesothelioma (13%), respectively (P<0.001 for overall variation by cancer site). Among 3298 emergency presenters with prior consultations, 1356 (41%) had three or more consultations, which were more likely in females (P<0.001), younger (P<0.001), and non-white patients (P = 0.017) and those with multiple myeloma, and least likely for patients with leukaemia (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Contrary to suggestions that emergency presentations represent missed diagnoses, about one-third of emergency presenters (particularly those in older and more deprived groups) have no prior GP consultations. Furthermore, only about one-third report multiple (three or more) consultations, which are more likely in 'harder-to-suspect' groups.","['Abel, Gary A', 'Mendonca, Silvia C', 'McPhail, Sean', 'Zhou, Yin', 'Elliss-Brookes, Lucy', 'Lyratzopoulos, Georgios']","['Abel GA', 'Mendonca SC', 'McPhail S', 'Zhou Y', 'Elliss-Brookes L', 'Lyratzopoulos G']","['University of Exeter Medical School (Primary Care), Exeter and Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge.', 'Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge.', 'Public Health England National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, London.', 'Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge.', 'Public Health England National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, London.', 'Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London, London and Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170424,England,Br J Gen Pract,The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,9005323,PMC5442953,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'diagnosis', 'emergency', 'opportunities', 'primary care']",,2017/04/26 06:00,2018/03/29 06:00,['2017/04/26 06:00'],"['2016/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['bjgp17X690869 [pii]', '10.3399/bjgp17X690869 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Gen Pract. 2017 Jun;67(659):e377-e387. doi: 10.3399/bjgp17X690869.

Compared with other donor sources, relapse is similar or even reduced after UCBT despite less graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We performed a retrospective analysis to identify risk factors associated with the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse after UCBT. In this retrospective, registry-based study, we examined the outcomes of 640 children (<18 years) with ALL in first complete remission (CR1; n = 257, 40%) or second complete remission (CR2; n = 383, 60%) who received myeloablative conditioning followed by a single-unit UCBT from 2000 to 2012. Most received antithymocyte globulin (88%) or total body irradiation (TBI; 69%), and cord blood grafts were primarily mismatched at 1 (50%) or 2(+) (34%) HLA loci. Considering patients in CR1, the rates of 5-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and relapse were 59%, 52%, and 23%, respectively. In multivariate analysis (MVA), acute GVHD (grades II to IV) and TBI protected against relapse. In patients in CR2, rates of 5-year OS, LFS, and the cumulative incidence of relapse were 46%, 44%, and 28%, respectively. In MVA, longer duration from diagnosis to UCBT (>/=30 months) and TBI were associated with decreased relapse risk. Importantly, receiving a fully HLA matched graft was a strong risk factor for increased relapse in MVA. An exploratory analysis of all 640 patients supported the important association between the presence of acute GVHD and less relapse but also demonstrated an increased risk of nonrelapse mortality. In conclusion, the impact of GVHD as a graft-versus-leukemia marker is evident in pediatric ALL after UCBT. Strategies that promote graft-versus-leukemia while harnessing GVHD should be further investigated.","['Page, Kristin M', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Diaz de Heredia, Cristina', ""O'Brien, Tracey"", 'Picardi, Alessandra', 'Ayas, Mouhab', 'Bittencourt, Henrique', 'Vora, Ajay J', 'Troy, Jesse', 'Bonfim, Carmen', 'Volt, Fernanda', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Bader, Peter', 'Kurtzberg, Joanne', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Page KM', 'Labopin M', 'Ruggeri A', 'Michel G', 'Diaz de Heredia C', ""O'Brien T"", 'Picardi A', 'Ayas M', 'Bittencourt H', 'Vora AJ', 'Troy J', 'Bonfim C', 'Volt F', 'Gluckman E', 'Bader P', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Rocha V']","['Division of Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.

We aimed to determine the association between the academic status of centers and outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using the National Cancer Data Base, we compared 1-month mortality and long-term overall survival (OS) of 60 738 patients with AML, who received first course treatment between 2003 and 2011 at academic or nonacademic centers (community cancer program, comprehensive community cancer program, and others). Multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression for one-month mortality and Cox regression with backward elimination approach for OS. Patients treated at academic centers differed from those at nonacademic centers in that they were younger with a median age of 62 versus 70 years (P < .0001), more often an ethnic minority (P < .0001), had lower education level (P = .005), lower co-morbidity score (P < .0001), a different income (P < .0001), and insurance profile (P < .0001), and more often received chemotherapy (P < .0001) and transplant (P < .0001). Receipt of care at nonacademic centers was associated with worse 1-month mortality (29% vs. 16%, P < .0001) and 5-year OS (15% vs. 25%; P < .0001). After adjusting for prognostic covariates, the 1-month mortality (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, CI 1.46-1.59; P < .0001) and OS were significantly worse in nonacademic centers, compared to academic centers. Our large database study suggests that the receipt of initial therapy at academic centers is associated with lower 1-month mortality and higher long-term OS. Investigation of the underlying reasons may allow reducing this disparity.","['Bhatt, Vijaya R', 'Shostrom, Valerie', 'Giri, Smith', 'Gundabolu, Krishna', 'Monirul Islam, K M', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Maness, Lori J']","['Bhatt VR', 'Shostrom V', 'Giri S', 'Gundabolu K', 'Monirul Islam KM', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Maness LJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Nebraska Medical Center, College of Public Health, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, College of Public Health, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Division of Medical Oncology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170601,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,,,2017/04/25 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24767 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Aug;92(8):764-771. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24767.

Due to conflicting results, the clinical value of these transcripts remains controversial. The aim of this study was to identify associations of e14a2 and e13a2 transcripts with laboratory variables and also the response to treatment. This study included 203 adult patients with CML treated with Imatinib as first-line drug in a reference hematology center in Northeast Brazil. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained after informed consent. Samples were collected for RNA extraction and analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), according to the international protocol BIOMED-1. The LeukemiaNet 2013 criteria were used to establish the molecular response. The frequency distribution of the BCR-ABL1 transcripts was e14a2 (64%), e13a2 (34%), and double positives (2%). The results showed a statistically significant association of the e14a2 transcript type with thrombocytosis (P = 0.0005) and the e13a2 with higher leukocyte count (P = 0.0491). In a subgroup of 44 patients, the molecular response to treatment with Imatinib was assessed by quantitative PCR at 3 months (BCR-ABL1 </= 10%), 6 months (BCR-ABL1 </= 1%), or 12 months (BCR-ABL1 </= 0.1%). Although patients with the transcript e14a2 showed higher frequency of good responses than patients with the transcript e13a2, this difference was not statistically significant. In agreement with published data, our results showed association of the BCR-ABL1 transcript e14a2 with thrombocytosis and the BCR-ABL1 transcript e13a2 with higher leukocytosis in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Vasconcelos, A P', 'Azevedo, I F', 'Melo, F C B C', 'Neves, W B', 'Azevedo, A C A C', 'Melo, R A M']","['Vasconcelos AP', 'Azevedo IF', 'Melo FCBC', 'Neves WB', 'Azevedo ACAC', 'Melo RAM']","[', , Brasil andrezapamelav@gmail.com.', ', , Brasil.', 'Fundacao de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Pernambuco, , Brasil.', 'Fundacao de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Pernambuco, , Brasil.', 'Fundacao de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Pernambuco, , Brasil.', ', , Brasil.', 'Fundacao de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Pernambuco, , Brasil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170420,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,,,,,2017/04/25 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr-16-02-gmr.16029541 [pii]', '10.4238/gmr16029541 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2017 Apr 20;16(2). pii: gmr-16-02-gmr.16029541. doi: 10.4238/gmr16029541.,,20170807,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MSI2 RBP is a central regulator of translation of cancer stem cell programs. Through proteomic analysis of the MSI2-interacting RBP network and functional shRNA screening, we identified 24 genes required for in vivo leukemia. Syncrip was the most differentially required gene between normal and myeloid leukemia cells. SYNCRIP depletion increased apoptosis and differentiation while delaying leukemogenesis. Gene expression profiling of SYNCRIP-depleted cells demonstrated a loss of the MLL and HOXA9 leukemia stem cell program. SYNCRIP and MSI2 interact indirectly though shared mRNA targets. SYNCRIP maintains HOXA9 translation, and MSI2 or HOXA9 overexpression rescued the effects of SYNCRIP depletion. Altogether, our data identify SYNCRIP as a new RBP that controls the myeloid leukemia stem cell program. We propose that targeting these RBP complexes might provide a novel therapeutic strategy in leukemia.","['Vu, Ly P', 'Prieto, Camila', 'Amin, Elianna M', 'Chhangawala, Sagar', 'Krivtsov, Andrei',

A record number of HCTs (21 884: 16 631 allogeneic (76%) and 5253 autologous (24%)) were reported by 76 centers in China between 1 January 2008 and 30 June 2016. HCT trends included continued growth in transplant activity, a continued rapid increase in haploidentical donors (HID), and slower growth for unrelated donors, matched-related donors (MRD) and cord blood transplantation (CBT). The proportion of HID HCT among allogeneic HCTs increased from 29.6% (313/1062) in 2008 to 48.8% (1939/3975) in 2015, even 51.7% (1157/2237) in the first half of 2016. During this time frame, the proportion of MRD HCTs among allogeneic HCTs decreased from 48.1% (511/1062) to 33.0% (332/3975). The proportion of unrelated donor HCTs among allogeneic HCTs decreased from 20.4 (216/1062) to 13.6% (540/3975). The proportion of CBTs among allogeneic HCTs was increased from 2.1% (22/1062) to 4.2% (184/3975). HCTs have been increasing continuously for all indications except chronic myelogenous leukemia. Severe aplastic anemia is a common HCT indication among non-malignant diseases in China. The number of cases of allogeneic HCT for this disorder has increased annually, from 59 (5.6%) in 2008 to 569 (14.3%) in 2015, even 334 (14.9%) in the first half year in 2016.

Immunotoxins derived from Pseudomonas exotoxin are antibody-toxin fusion proteins that inhibit protein synthesis of mammalian cells via ADP-ribosylation of the eukaryotic elongation factor-2. Here we investigate the role of the Bcl-2 family proteins in the response of cancer cells to immunotoxin challenge. Besides the well-known reduction of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1, following inhibition of protein synthesis, we show for the first time that immunotoxins also reduce the levels of selected proapoptotic BH-3-only proteins. Among these, only Bim protein levels correlated with the ability of immunotoxins to induce an apoptotic response. To support our findings, we verified that a Bim knockout completely abolished immunotoxin-mediated apoptosis. Further, mice bearing either wild-type or Bid knockout tumors responded to immunotoxin treatment with a decrease in growth kinetics, whereas mice engrafted with Bim knockout tumors showed no reduction in tumor size or prolongation of survival following immunotoxin treatment. From these results, we conclude that Bim expression is a major susceptibility factor for tumor cell death and, as such, constitutes a potential biomarker that could be evaluated before immunotoxin treatment. In support of this hypothesis, clinically, we analyzed patient cells before immunotoxin treatment and report that samples of hairy cell leukemia with high levels of Bim protein responded with a greater decrease in leukemic cell count compared with those samples expressing a low level of Bim.","['Antignani, A', 'Segal, D', 'Simon, N', 'Kreitman, R J', 'Huang, D', 'FitzGerald, D J']","['Antignani A', 'Segal D', 'Simon N', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Huang D', 'FitzGerald DJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CCR, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CCR, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CCR, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Cancer and Haematology Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, CCR, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170424,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,,,,2017/04/25 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2016/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2017111 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2017.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Aug 31;36(35):4953-4962. doi: 10.1038/onc.2017.111.

Ara-C is intracellularly converted by the canonical dNTP synthesis pathway to ara-CTP, which serves as a substrate but not an allosteric activator of SAMHD1. Using an AML mouse model, we show here that wild type but not catalytically inactive SAMHD1 reduces ara-C treatment efficacy in vivo. Expanding the clinically relevant substrates of SAMHD1, we demonstrate that THP-1 CRISPR/Cas9 cells lacking a functional SAMHD1 gene showed increased sensitivity to the antimetabolites nelarabine, fludarabine, decitabine, vidarabine, clofarabine, and trifluridine. Within this Extra View, we discuss and build upon both these and our previously reported findings, and propose SAMHD1 is likely active against a variety of nucleoside analog antimetabolites present in anti-cancer chemotherapies. Thus, SAMHD1 may constitute a promising target to improve a wide range of therapies for both hematological and non-haematological malignancies.","['Herold, Nikolas', 'Rudd, Sean G', 'Sanjiv, Kumar', 'Kutzner, Juliane', 'Bladh, Julia', 'Paulin, Cynthia B J', 'Helleday, Thomas', 'Henter, Jan-Inge', 'Schaller, Torsten']","['Herold N', 'Rudd SG', 'Sanjiv K', 'Kutzner J', 'Bladh J', 'Paulin CBJ', 'Helleday T', 'Henter JI', 'Schaller T']","[""a Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden."", ""b Theme of Children's and Women's Health , Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital , Stockholm , Sweden."", 'c Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology , Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'c Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology , Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'd Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology , University Hospital Heidelberg , Heidelberg , Germany.', ""a Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden."", 'c Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology , Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'c Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology , Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', ""a Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden."", ""b Theme of Children's and Women's Health , Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital , Stockholm , Sweden."", 'd Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology , University Hospital Heidelberg , Heidelberg , Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170424,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,PMC5499833,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'SAMHD1', 'Vpx', 'acute myelogenous leukemia', 'ara-C', 'clofarabine', 'cytarabine', 'decitabine', 'drug resistance', 'fludarabine', 'haematological malignancies', 'nelarabine', 'trifluridine', 'vidarabine']",,2017/04/25 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384101.2017.1314407 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2017 Jun 3;16(11):1029-1038. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2017.1314407.

However, how ERG controls normal hematopoiesis, particularly at the stem and progenitor cell level, and how it contributes to leukemogenesis remain incompletely understood. Using homologous recombination, we generated an Erg knockdown allele (Erg(kd) ) in which Erg expression can be conditionally restored by Cre recombinase. Erg(kd/kd) animals die at E10.5-E11.5 due to defects in endothelial and hematopoietic cells, but can be completely rescued by Tie2-Cre-mediated restoration of Erg in these cells. In Erg(kd/+) mice, approximately 40% reduction in Erg dosage perturbs both fetal liver and bone marrow hematopoiesis by reducing the numbers of Lin(-) Sca-1(+) c-Kit(+) (LSK) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and megakaryocytic progenitors. By genetic mosaic analysis, we find that Erg-restored HSPCs outcompete Erg(kd/+) HSPCs for contribution to adult hematopoiesis in vivo. This defect is in part due to increased apoptosis of HSPCs with reduced Erg dosage, a phenotype that becomes more drastic during 5-FU-induced stress hematopoiesis. Expression analysis reveals that reduced Erg expression leads to changes in expression of a subset of ERG target genes involved in regulating survival of HSPCs, including increased expression of a pro-apoptotic regulator Bcl2l11 (Bim) and reduced expression of Jun. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ERG controls survival of HSPCs, a property that may be used by leukemic cells.

Historically, it has been associated with poor prognosis. Intensive treatment, however, has improved its outcome. We determined the outcome of children with this genotype treated with contemporary intensive chemotherapy in Taiwan. PROCEDURE: In Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group 2002 ALL studies, genotypes were determined by cytogenetic analysis and/or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Based on presenting features, immunophenotype and genotype, patients were assigned to one of the three risk groups: standard risk (SR), high risk (HR), or very high risk (VHR). The patients with t(1;19)/TCF3-PBX1 were treated in the HR arm receiving more intensive chemotherapy. The outcomes of patients with t(1;19)/TCF3-PBX1 were compared to that of patients with other subtypes of B-precursor ALL (B-ALL). RESULTS: Of the 1,129 patients with B-ALL, 64 (5.7%) had t(1;19)/TCF3-PBX1; 51 of whom were treated in the HR arm, but 11 were treated in the VHR and 2 in the SR arm because of physician's preference. As a group, 64 patients with t(1;19)/TCF3-PBX1 had similar 5-year event-free survival (83.3 +/- 4.8%) as those with TEL-AML1 (85.2 +/- 3.4%, P = 0.984) or those with hyperdiploidy >50 (84.0 +/- 3.1%, P = 0.748). The cumulative risk of any (isolated plus combined) central nervous system relapse among patients with t(1;19)/TCF3-PBX1 (8.7 +/- 3.8%) tended to be higher than that of patients with TEL-AML1 (5.8 +/- 2.3%, P = 0.749) or those with hyperdiploidy (4.1 +/- 1.8%, P = 0.135), albeit the differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: With contemporary intensive chemotherapy, children with t(1;19)/TCF3-PBX1 fared as well as those with favorable genotypes (TEL-AML1 or hyperdiploidy).","['Yen, Hsiu-Ju', 'Chen,

This has led to routine use of a dose cap of 3,750 IU for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients in most institutions. In pediatric ALL patients, PEG-ASP is not capped. There is concern at our institution that larger doses may result in increased rates of adverse effects and that increased monitoring may be warranted in pediatric patients receiving doses greater than 3,750 IU. The objective of this study is to quantify the difference in the rates of PEG-ASP-associated adverse events between pediatric patients who received doses greater than 3,750 IU and less than or equal to 3,750 IU. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients 1-21 years old with pre-B-cell ALL who received PEG-ASP between 2007 and 2014 at an academic medical center. RESULTS: Of 183 patients included in the analysis, 24 received PEG-ASP doses higher than 3,750 IU and 159 received doses less than or equal to 3,750 IU. The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was significantly higher for patients in the group that received more than 3,750 IU compared with those who received 3,750 IU or less (20.8 vs. 1.89%, respectively; P = 0.0011). The incidence of pancreatitis (P = 0.0306) and hyperglycemia (P = 0.0089) were also higher in the group that received more than 3,750 IU. CONCLUSIONS: PEG-ASP doses higher than 3,750 IU are associated with higher rates of VTE, pancreatitis, and hyperglycemia in pediatric patients with pre-B-cell ALL. Patients receiving more than 3,750 IU should have increased monitoring, and larger, multicenter trials are needed to determine if monitoring, VTE prophylaxis, and potential dose capping recommendations should be added to clinical trial protocols.","['Lebovic, Rachel', 'Pearce, Natalie', 'Lacey, Laura', 'Xenakis, James', 'Faircloth, Cassidy B', 'Thompson, Patrick']","['Lebovic R', 'Pearce N', 'Lacey L', 'Xenakis J', 'Faircloth CB', 'Thompson P']","['Department of Pharmacy Services, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'UNC at Chapel Hill Eshelman School of Pharmacy/United Therapeutics, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Carolinas Healthcare System North East, Charlotte, North Carolina.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Gillings School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170424,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['oncology', 'pediatric', 'pegaspargase']",,2017/04/25 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2016/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26555 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Oct;64(10). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26555.

In cattle, the disease is characterized by life-long persistent lymphocytosis leading to leukemia/lymphoma in about 5% of infected animals. In sheep, as opposed to cattle, the course of the disease is always fatal and clinical symptoms usually occur within a three-year period after infection. For this reason, sheep are an excellent experimental model of retrovirus-induced leukemia. This model can be useful for human pathology, as bovine leukemia virus is closely related to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1. The data presented here provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of the bovine leukemia virus-induced tumorigenic process and indicate the potential marker proteins both for monitoring progression of the disease and as possible targets of pharmacological intervention. A study of the proteome of B lymphocytes from four leukemic sheep revealed 11 proteins with altered expression. Among them, cytoskeleton and intermediate filament proteins were the most abundant, although proteins belonging to the other functional groups, i.e. enzymes, regulatory proteins, and transcription factors, were also present. It was found that trypsin inhibitor, platelet factor 4, thrombospondin 1, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, fibrinogen alpha chain, zyxin, filamin-A, and vitamin D-binding protein were downregulated, whereas cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 5, non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein and small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha were upregulated. Discussed are the possible mechanisms of their altered expression and its significance in the bovine leukemia virus-induced leukemogenic process. Impact statement The submitted manuscript provides new data on the molecular mechanisms of BLV-induced tumorigenic process indicating the potential marker proteins both for monitoring the progression of the disease and as possible targets of pharmacological intervention. This is to my knowledge the first study of the proteome of the transformed lymphocytes in the course of bovine leukemia virus-induced leukemia in susceptible animals. BLV can be considered as useful model for related human pathogen - HTLV-1, another member of the deltaretrovirus genus evolutionary closely related to BLV. Information gathered in this study can be useful to speculate on possible shared mechanisms of deltaretrovirus-induced carcinogenesis.","['Reichert, Michal']",['Reichert M'],"['Department of Pathology, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy 24-100, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170424,England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,PMC5529001,['NOTNLM'],"['*Protein expression', '*bovine leukemia virus', '*sheep B lymphocytes']",,2017/04/25 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1535370217705864 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2017 Jul;242(13):1363-1375. doi: 10.1177/1535370217705864.

We retrospectively evaluated the data of 65 patients, who were followed with the diagnosis of CLL at Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology, between July 2007 and June 2016. The median age of the patients was 64 years (range, 32-83). Twenty-three (35.4%) patients were female, and 42 (64.6%) were male. Early/mild grade BMRF was observed in 46 (70.8%) patients and advanced grade BMRF in 19 (29.2%) patients. Eleven (23.9%) of 46 patients with early/mild grade BMRF and 10 (52.9%) of 19 patients with advanced grade BMRF required treatment during follow-up (p = 0.04). According to the BMIP, 14 (21.5%) patients had diffuse and 51 (78.5%) patients had non-diffuse BMIP. Eleven (78.6%) of 14 patients with diffuse BMIP and 10 (19.6%) of 51 patients with non-diffuse BMIP required treatment during follow-up (p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, both advanced grade BMRF and diffuse BMIP had an impact on occurrence of treatment demand (p = 0.028, HR = 3.535 vs. p < 0.01 HR = 15.033). Multivariate analysis also revealed diffuse BMIP to be effective (p < 0.001, HR 13.089), while advanced grade BMRF failed to significantly influence treatment demand (p = 0.140, HR 2.664). In conclusion, in the light of our findings, it is reasonable to consider that bone marrow biopsy at the time of diagnosis might provide a preliminary information about treatment demand in patients with CLL.","['Eren, Rafet', 'Dogu, Mehmet Hilmi', 'Emir, Servet', 'Huq, Gulben Erdem', 'Okcu, Oguzhan', 'Altindal, Sermin', 'Yokus, Osman', 'Suyani, Elif']","['Eren R', 'Dogu MH', 'Emir S', 'Huq GE', 'Okcu O', 'Altindal S', 'Yokus O', 'Suyani E']","['Department of Hematology, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, P.K.34098, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, P.K.34098, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, P.K.34098, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, P.K.34098, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, P.K.34098, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. elifsuyani@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170424,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow infiltration pattern', 'Bone marrow reticulin fibrosis', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",,2017/04/25 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2016/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-2997-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-2997-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Aug;96(8):1315-1321. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-2997-7.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can act as drug delivery vehicles, especially for cancer therapy. Due to the selective intake of asparagine molecules into malignant cells, AuNPs were coated with asparagine; and CCRF-CEM human T-cell leukemia cells were treated with the new combination, Asn-AuNPs, at 39 degrees C. METHODS: The co-authors from a number of collaborative labs located at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, have initiated the idea and preliminary design of this study in 2011. Hydroxyl surfaced AuNPs were preliminary prepared by tannin free ethanol extract of black tea leaves. These biogenic AuNPs were further capped with asparagines to form asparagine-gold nanoparticle conjugates (Asn-AuNP conjugates). Then CCRF-CEM human T-cell leukemia cells were separately treated with different concentrations of AuNPs and Asn-AuNP conjugates (3, 30, 300 mug/mL). MTT assay and zymography analysis were carried out, and the apoptotic and necrotic effects of Asn-AuNPs were determined in comparison with AuNPs, using flow cytometry assay. RESULTS: Asn-AuNP conjugates at 300 mug/mL significantly inhibited MMPs at 39 degrees C, compared to AuNPs. In terms of cytotoxicity, a remarkable decrease was observed in the percentage of viable cells treated with Asn-AuNP conjugates, rather than AuNPs. Moreover, the AuNPs and Asn-AuNP conjugates enhanced the level of apoptosis at almost similar rates. CONCLUSION: AuNPs are coated with asparagine molecules and the temperature is slightly increased by 2 degrees C, the apoptosis is not only enhanced among cells but also shifts to necrosis in higher concentrations of Asn-AuNP conjugates. More investigations should be carried out to explain the exact mechanism underlying the necrotic effects of Asn-AuNPs.","['Shahriari, Shadab', 'Bakhshi, Maryam', 'Shahverdi, Ahmad Reza', 'Berahmeh, Azar', 'Safavifar, Farnaz', 'Khorramizadeh, Mohammad Reza']","['Shahriari S', 'Bakhshi M', 'Shahverdi AR', 'Berahmeh A', 'Safavifar F', 'Khorramizadeh MR']","['Biosensor Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Cellular-Molecular Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Biosensor Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Cellular-Molecular Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Biotechnology Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Pathobiology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinical Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Biosensor Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Cellular-Molecular Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Public Health,Iranian journal of public health,7505531,PMC5395532,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Asparagine', 'CCRF-CEM cells', 'Gold nanoparticles']",,2017/04/25 06:00,2017/04/25 06:01,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/25 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Public Health. 2017 Mar;46(3):357-367.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the clinical course in adult AML patients since most studies examined pediatric patients. Therefore, this study analyzed the data of patients treated in three prospective trials of the ""Study Alliance Leukemia"" (SAL) study group for CNS involvement. METHODS: In all, 3,261 AML patients included in the prospective AML96, AML2003, and AML60+ trials of the SAL study group were analyzed. Symptomatic patients underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) puncture and CNS involvement was diagnosed depending on morphology and/or flow cytometry of the CSF. Cytogenetic, molecular, clinical, and laboratory parameters were analyzed in order to identify risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients had proven symptomatic CNS involvement. Significantly more patients revealed CNS involvement at relapse (34 patients, 2.9%) compared with first diagnosis (21 patients, 0.6%), p<0.001. CNS involvement at initial diagnosis had a significantly higher frequency in patients with complex aberrant karyotypes, high serum lactate dehydrogenase activity, French-American-British M5 subtype, FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations alone, and co-occurrence of a FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation. Furthermore, AML patients with CNS involvement at diagnosis had an inferior outcome compared with patients without CNS involvement even if treated with intrathecal chemotherapy with an overall survival of 11% versus 30% at 5 years, p=0.004. CONCLUSION: This study analyzed the largest data set of adult AML patients with proven CNS involvement reported so far. The data demonstrated very low prevalence of CNS involvement at initial diagnosis in adult patients with AML, and described new risk factors. In patients with risk factors, intense diagnostic and treatment strategies should be employed in the future.","['Alakel, Nael', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Mohr, Brigitte', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Oelschlagel, Uta', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Schaich, Markus']","['Alakel N', 'Stolzel F', 'Mohr B', 'Kramer M', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Rollig C', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ehninger G', 'Schaich M']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Medicine, Rems-Murr-Klinikum, Winnenden, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170329,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,PMC5386598,['NOTNLM'],"['CNS-involvement', 'Meningeal leukemia', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'extramedullary leukemia']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interests in this work.'],2017/04/25 06:00,2017/04/25 06:01,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S125259 [doi]', 'cmar-9-097 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2017 Mar 29;9:97-102. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S125259. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), high levels of Gal-1 within the tumor microenvironment were associated with worse disease state or poor outcome. Gal-1 can be secreted from cells by an unknown mechanism, and levels in blood samples were associated with high tumor burden and worse disease state in cHL and CLL patients. However, serum levels of Gal-1 have never been investigated in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). We measured serum Gal-1 levels in samples from patients with treatment demanding MM at the time of diagnosis (n=102) and after treatment (n=24) and examined associations of serum Gal-1 with clinicopathological information obtained from patient medical records, as well as data on bone marrow angiogenesis and the macrophage activation biomarkers soluble CD163 (sCD163) and soluble mannose receptor. Serum Gal-1 levels were not elevated in patients with MM at diagnosis compared with healthy donors (median values 8.48 vs 11.93 ng/mL, P=0.05), which is in contrast to results in cHL and CLL. Furthermore, Gal-1 levels did not show association with bone marrow angiogenesis, clinicopathological parameters, overall survival, or response to treatment. There was a statically significant association between Gal-1 and sCD163 levels (R=0.24, P=0.02), but not with soluble mannose receptor (P=0.92). In conclusion, our results indicate that Gal-1 is not an important serum biomarker in MM, which is in contrast to data from patients with cHL and CLL. However, the association with sCD163 is in line with previous data showing that Gal-1 may be involved in alternative (M2-like) activation of macrophages.","['Andersen, Morten Norgaard', 'Ludvigsen, Maja', 'Abildgaard, Niels', 'Petruskevicius, Irma', 'Hjortebjerg, Rikke', 'Bjerre, Mette', 'Honore, Bent', 'Moller, Holger J', 'Andersen, Niels F']","['Andersen MN', 'Ludvigsen M', 'Abildgaard N', 'Petruskevicius I', 'Hjortebjerg R', 'Bjerre M', 'Honore B', 'Moller HJ', 'Andersen NF']","['Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus.', 'Medical Research Laboratory, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Medical Research Laboratory, Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170404,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC5388249,['NOTNLM'],"['angiogenesis', 'galectin-1', 'macrophage', 'multiple myeloma', 'soluble CD163', 'soluble mannose receptor']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2017/04/25 06:00,2017/04/25 06:01,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S124321 [doi]', 'ott-10-1977 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Apr 4;10:1977-1982. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S124321. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to confirm the effect of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 on proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells and sensitivity of tyrosine kinase inhibitor in vitro. METHODS: Two human CML cell lines, K562 and KBM7R (T315I mutant strain), were used. The proliferation of CML cells was detected by MTS (Owen's reagent) assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis assay were examined by flow cytometric analysis. The phosphorylation levels and the expression levels were both evaluated by Western blot analysis. NVP-BEZ235 in combination with imatinib was also used to reveal the effect on proliferation and apoptosis. RESULTS: NVP-BEZ235 significantly inhibited the proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of NVP-BEZ235 inhibiting the proliferation of K562 and KBM7R were 0.37+/-0.21 and 0.43+/-0.27 mumol/L, respectively, after 48 h. Cell apoptosis assay showed that NVP-BEZ235 significantly increased the late apoptotic cells. Cell cycle analysis indicated that the cells were mostly arrested in G1/G0 phase after treatment by NVP-BEZ235. In addition, results also found that, after treatment by NVP-BEZ235, phosphorylation levels of Akt kinase and S6K kinase significantly reduced, and the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3 significantly increased; meanwhile, the expression levels of caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma-2, cyclin D1, and cyclin D2 significantly decreased, and the ratio of LC3II/LC3I was significantly increased with increased LC3II expression level. Moreover, imatinib in combination with NVP-BEZ235 induced a more pronounced colony growth inhibition than imatinib alone. CONCLUSION: NVP-BEZ235 effectively inhibited cell proliferation by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis through deregulating PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in CML cells; in addition, NVP-BEZ235 can enhance cell autophagy, and is conducive to raising CML cell sensitivity to imatinib to inhibit the growth of imatinib-resistant cells.","['Xin, Pengliang', 'Li, Chuntuan', 'Zheng, Yan', 'Peng, Qunyi', 'Xiao, Huifang', 'Huang, Yuanling', 'Zhu, Xiongpeng']","['Xin P', 'Li C', 'Zheng Y', 'Peng Q', 'Xiao H', 'Huang Y', 'Zhu X']","['Department of Haematology, First Hospital of Quanzhou Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Licheng, Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, First Hospital of Quanzhou Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Licheng, Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, First Hospital of Quanzhou Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Licheng, Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, First Hospital of Quanzhou Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Licheng, Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, First Hospital of Quanzhou Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Licheng, Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, First Hospital of Quanzhou Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Licheng, Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Haematology, First Hospital of Quanzhou Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Licheng, Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170403,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,PMC5388256,['NOTNLM'],"['NVP-BEZ235', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'imatinib', 'phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian pathway']",['Disclosure The author reports no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2017/04/25 06:00,2017/12/26 06:00,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S132092 [doi]', 'dddt-11-1115 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2017 Apr 3;11:1115-1126. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S132092. eCollection 2017.,,20171225,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'RUJ6Z9Y0DT (dactolisib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Imidazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Quinolines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior publications have shown rituximab and hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (R-hyperCVAD) can be associated with stem cell mobilization failures. However, those studies did not include the use of plerixafor as rescue for stem cell mobilization failure. We examined our database of 181 consecutive MCL patients who received upfront therapy from 2005 to 2015 with either R-hyperCVAD or less intense chemotherapy (R-bendamustine and R-CHOP only) regimens to assess impact of frontline chemotherapy on collection of hematopoietic cell progenitors before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). In the preplerixafor era (before August 16, 2009), a significant difference in peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection failure between the R-hyperCVAD (12%) and other chemotherapy (11%) groups was not established. However, in the postplerixafor era, use of R-hyperCVAD chemotherapy was associated with significantly higher rates of hematopoietic progenitor cell collection failures (17%) compared with that observed in the other chemotherapy group (4%; P = .04). The rates of mobilization failure declined to 4% in the postplerixafor era from 11% in the preplerixafor era for patients receiving less intensive chemotherapy. Conversely, the rate of mobilization failure increased in the R-hyperCVAD group from 12% in the preplerixafor era to 17% in the postplerixafor era. Plerixafor does not overcome the negative impact of R-hyperCVAD on PBSC mobilization, and caution is warranted in using R-hyperCVAD in patients with newly diagnosed MCL who are candidates for ASCT.","['Salhotra, Amandeep', 'Shan, Yuan', 'Tsai, Ni-Chun', 'Sanchez, James F', 'Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Ali, Haris', 'Paris, Tanya', 'Spielberger, Ricardo', 'Cao, Thai M', 'Nademanee, Auayporn', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Chen, Robert']","['Salhotra A', 'Shan Y', 'Tsai NC', 'Sanchez JF', 'Aldoss I', 'Ali H', 'Paris T', 'Spielberger R', 'Cao TM', 'Nademanee A', 'Forman SJ', 'Chen R']","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, California; Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, Duarte, California.

Only a fraction of AML patients will survive with existing chemotherapy regimens. Hence, there is an urgent and unmet need to identify novel targets and develop better therapeutics in AML. In the past decade, the field of sphingolipid metabolism has emerged into the forefront of cancer biology due to its importance in cancer cell proliferation and survival. In particular, acid ceramidase (AC) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target due to its role in neutralizing the pro-death effects of ceramide. Areas covered: This review highlights key information about AML biology as well as current knowledge on dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism in cancer and AML. We describe AC function and dysregulation in cancer, followed by a review of studies that report elevated AC in AML and compounds known to inhibit the enzyme. Expert opinion: AML has a great need for new drug targets and better therapeutic agents. The finding of elevated AC in AML supports the concept that this enzyme represents a novel and realistic therapeutic target for this common leukemia. More effort is needed towards developing better AC inhibitors for clinical use and combination treatment with existing AML therapies.","['Tan, Su-Fern', 'Pearson, Jennifer M', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Tan SF', 'Pearson JM', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['a Department of Medicine , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'a Department of Medicine , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'a Department of Medicine , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'b University of Virginia Cancer Center , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'a Department of Medicine , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA , USA.', 'b University of Virginia Cancer Center , Charlottesville , VA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170502,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,PMC5738025,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acid ceramidase', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*ceramide', '*sphingosine 1-phosphate']",,2017/04/25 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14728222.2017.1322065 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2017 Jun;21(6):583-590. doi: 10.1080/14728222.2017.1322065.

Whether the aggregation process could modulate allergenicity was investigated. Heating ovalbumin in opposite electrostatic conditions led to small (A-s, about 50 nm) and large (A-L, about 65 mum) aggregates that were used to sensitize mice. The symptoms upon oral challenge and rat basophil leukemia degranulation with native ovalbumin differed on the basis of which aggregates were used during the sensitization. Immunoglobulin-E (IgE) production was significantly lower with A-s than with A-L. Although two common linear IgE-epitopes were found, the aggregates bound and cross-linked IgE similarly or differently, depending on the sensitizing aggregate. The ovalbumin aggregates thus displayed a lower allergenic potential when formed under repulsive rather than nonrepulsive electrostatic conditions. This further demonstrates that food structure modulates the immune response during the sensitization phase with some effects on the elicitation phase of an allergic reaction and argues for the need to characterize the aggregation state of allergens.","['Claude, Mathilde', 'Bouchaud, Gregory', 'Lupi, Roberta', 'Castan, Laure', 'Tranquet, Olivier', 'Denery-Papini, Sandra', 'Bodinier, Marie', 'Brossard, Chantal']","['Claude M', 'Bouchaud G', 'Lupi R', 'Castan L', 'Tranquet O', 'Denery-Papini S', 'Bodinier M', 'Brossard C']","['UR 1268 Biopolymers Interactions Assemblies, INRA , Nantes, France.', 'UR 1268 Biopolymers Interactions Assemblies, INRA , Nantes, France.', 'UR 1268 Biopolymers Interactions Assemblies, INRA , Nantes, France.', 'UR 1268 Biopolymers Interactions Assemblies, INRA , Nantes, France.', 'UMR 1087 Institut du Thorax, INSERM , Nantes, France.', 'UR 1268 Biopolymers Interactions Assemblies, INRA , Nantes, France.', 'UR 1268 Biopolymers Interactions Assemblies, INRA , Nantes, France.', 'UR 1268 Biopolymers Interactions Assemblies, INRA , Nantes, France.', 'UR 1268 Biopolymers Interactions Assemblies, INRA , Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20170502,United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,,['NOTNLM'],"['aggregation', 'egg allergy', 'food structure', 'thermal treatment']",,2017/04/25 06:00,2017/06/09 06:00,['2017/04/25 06:00'],"['2017/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jafc.7b00676 [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2017 May 10;65(18):3693-3701. doi: 10.1021/acs.jafc.7b00676.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 229 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allo-HSCT between 2003 and 2013 with different conditioning regimens (myeloablative, reduced-intensity, chemotherapy-based, or total body irradiation-based). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine levels (fT4) were available in 104 patients before and after allo-HSCT. RESULTS: The median age at transplantation (n=104) was 47 (IQR 40-59)], 37 (35.6%) patients were female, and the overall mortality was 34.6% (n=36). After a median follow-up period of 47 (IQR 25-84) months, overt hypothyroidism (basal TSH>4.49mIU/l, FT4<11.6pmol/l) was observed in 4 patients (3.8%) and subclinical hypothyroidism (basal TSH>4.49mIU/l, normal fT4) was observed in 20 patients (19.2%). Positive thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies were found in 5 (4.8%) patients. A total of 13 patients (12.5%) were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) >/=grade 2 occurred in 55 (52.9%) and chronic GvHD (cGvHD) in 74 (71.2%) of the patients. The risk of developing hypothyroidism was higher in the patients with repeated allo-HSCTs (P=0.024) and with positive TPO antibodies (P=0.045). Furthermore, the development of overt hypothyroidism was inversely proportional to age (P=0.043). No correlation was found with GvHD, HLA-mismatch, total body irradiation, and gender. CONCLUSION: After allo-HSCT, a significant number of patients experience thyroid dysfunction, including subclinical and overt hypothyroidism. Long-term and continuous follow-up for thyroid function after HSCT is important to provide timely and appropriate treatment.","['Medinger, Michael', 'Zeiter, Deborah', 'Heim, Dominik', 'Halter, Jorg', 'Gerull, Sabine', 'Tichelli, Andre', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Nigro, Nicole']","['Medinger M', 'Zeiter D', 'Heim D', 'Halter J', 'Gerull S', 'Tichelli A', 'Passweg J', 'Nigro N']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland; Divison of Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.

Density functional theory calculations pointed out that (R,R)-N,N'-configuration diastereoisomers were energetically the most favorable. Duo to high cytotoxic activity complex 3 was chosen for stability study in DMSO, no decomposition occurs within 24h, and for the reaction with ascorbic acid in which was reduced immediately. Additionally, 3 interacts with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as proven by UV/Vis spectroscopy. In vitro antitumor activity was determined against human cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa), human myelogenous leukemia (K562), and human melanoma (Fem-x) cancer cell lines, as well as against non-cancerous human embryonic lung fibroblast cells MRC-5. The highest activity was observed against K562 cells (IC50: 5.04-6.51muM). Selectivity indices showed that these complexes are less toxic than cisplatin. 3 had a similar viability kinetics on HeLa cells as cisplatin. Drug accumulation studies in HeLa cells showed that the total gold uptake increased much faster than that of cisplatin pointing out that 3 more efficiently enters the cells than cisplatin. Furthermore, morphological and cell cycle analysis reveal that gold(III) complexes induced apoptosis in time- and dose-dependent manner.","['Pantelic, Nebojsa', 'Zmejkovski, Bojana B', 'Kolundzija, Branka', 'Crnogorac, Marija Dordic', 'Vujic, Jelena M', 'Dojcinovic, Biljana', 'Trifunovic, Srecko R', 'Stanojkovic, Tatjana P', 'Sabo, Tibor J', 'Kaluderovic, Goran N']","['Pantelic N', 'Zmejkovski BB', 'Kolundzija B', 'Crnogorac MD', 'Vujic JM', 'Dojcinovic B', 'Trifunovic SR', 'Stanojkovic TP', 'Sabo TJ', 'Kaluderovic GN']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Belgrade, Nemanjina 6, Belgrade, Zemun, Serbia.', 'Department of Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Technology and Metallurgy, University of Belgrade, Studentski trg 14, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Oncology and Radiology, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Oncology and Radiology, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Faculty of Agronomy, University of Kragujevac, Cara Dusana 34, 32000 Cacak, Serbia.', 'Department of Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Technology and Metallurgy, University of Belgrade, Studentski trg 14, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Chemistry Faculty of Science University of Kragujevac, R.

Plasma samples from control (drug-free) and patient (treated with imatinib) groups were analyzed in full-scan mode and the unknown ions occurring only in the patient group were then, as potential imatinib metabolites, subjected to multi-stage fragmentation in order to elucidate their structure. The application of an untargeted approach, as described in this study, enabled the detection of 24 novel structurally unexpected metabolites. Several sulphur-containing compounds, probably originating after the reaction of reactive intermediates of imatinib with endogenous glutathione, were found and annotated as cysteine and cystine adducts. In the proposed mechanism, the cysteine adducts were formed after the rearrangement of piperazine moiety to imidazoline. On the contrary, in vivo S-N exchange occurred in the case of the cystine adducts. In addition, N-O exchange was observed in the collision cell in the course of the fragmentation of the cystine adducts. The presence of sulphur in the cysteine and cystine conjugates was proved by means of ultra-high resolution measurements using Orbitrap Elite. The detection of metabolites derived from glutathione might improve knowledge about the disposition of imatinib towards bioactivation and help to improve understanding of the mechanism of its hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity in humans.","['Vrobel, Ivo', 'Friedecky, David', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Najdekr, Lukas', 'Micova, Katerina', 'Karlikova, Radana', 'Adam, Tomas']","['Vrobel I', 'Friedecky D', 'Faber E', 'Najdekr L', 'Micova K', 'Karlikova R', 'Adam T']","['Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Hnevotinska 5, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic; Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University Hospital Olomouc, I.

They also provide a comprehensive and unique megabase-scale picture of cellular epigenetic state. Thus, normal differentiation involves reproducible changes in RT, and transformation generally perturbs these, although the potential effects of altered RT on the properties of transformed cells remain largely unknown. A major challenge to interrogating these issues in human acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is the low proliferative activity of most of the cells, which may be further reduced in cryopreserved samples and difficult to overcome in vitro. In contrast, the ability of many human ALL cell populations to expand when transplanted into highly immunodeficient mice is well documented. To examine the stability of DNA RT profiles of serially passaged xenografts of primary human B- and T-ALL cells, we first devised a method that circumvents the need for bromodeoxyuridine incorporation to distinguish early versus late S-phase cells. Using this and more standard protocols, we found consistently strong retention in xenografts of the original patient-specific RT features. Moreover, in a case in which genomic analyses indicated changing subclonal dynamics in serial passages, the RT profiles tracked concordantly. These results indicate that DNA RT is a relatively stable feature of human ALLs propagated in immunodeficient mice.

Symptom toxicity often results in complications, treatment delays, and therapy dose reductions that can compromise leukemia therapy and jeopardize chances for long-term survival. Critical to understanding symptom experiences during treatment is the need for exploration of ""why"" inter-individual symptom differences occur; this will determine who may be most susceptible to treatment toxicities. OBJECTIVES: This study examined specific symptom trajectories during the first 18 months of childhood leukemia treatment. Symptom measures included fatigue, sleep disturbances, pain, nausea, and depression. METHODS: Symptom trajectories of 236 children with leukemia three to 18 years old were explored prospectively over four periods: initiation of post-induction therapy, four and eight post-induction therapy, and the last time point was at the beginning of maintenance/continuation therapy. Latent class growth analysis was used to classify patients into distinctive groups with similar symptom trajectories based on patients' response patterns on the symptom measures over time. RESULTS: Three latent classes of symptom trajectories were identified and classified into mild, moderate, and severe symptom trajectories. The only demographic characteristic with a significant relationship to membership in the latent class symptom trajectories was race/ethnicity. All other demographic characteristics including leukemia risk levels showed no significant relationships. CONCLUSION: This study is unique in that groups of patients with similar symptoms were identified rather than groups of symptoms. Further research using latent class growth analysis is needed.","['Hockenberry, Marilyn J', 'Hooke, Mary C', 'Rodgers, Cheryl', 'Taylor, Olga', 'Koerner, Kari M', 'Mitby, Pauline', 'Moore, Ida', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Pan, Wei']","['Hockenberry MJ', 'Hooke MC', 'Rodgers C', 'Taylor O', 'Koerner KM', 'Mitby P', 'Moore I', 'Scheurer ME', 'Pan W']","['Duke University School of Nursing, Durham, North Carolina, USA.

Currently, this is accomplished through amplification of microsatellites followed by capillary electrophoresis. An alternative and theoretically better approach uses multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms located within a small region of DNA, a method we initially developed using HLA-A and called haplotype counting. Herein, we validated seven additional polymorphic loci, sequenced a total of 45 individuals from three of the 1000 Genomes populations (15 from each), and determined the number of haplotypes, heterozygosity, and polymorphic information content for each locus. In addition, we developed a multiplex PCR that amplifies five of these loci simultaneously. Using this strategy with a small cohort of leukemic patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, we first attempted to define a threshold (0.26% recipient) by examining seven patients who tested all donor and did not relapse. Although this initial threshold will need to be confirmed in a larger cohort, we detected increased recipient DNA above this threshold 90 to 145 days earlier than microsatellite positivity, and 127 to 142 days before clinical relapse in four of eight patients (50%). Haplotype counting using these novel loci may be useful for ultrasensitive detection in fields such as bone marrow transplantation, solid organ transplant rejection, patient identification, and forensics.","['Debeljak, Marija', 'Mocci, Evelina', 'Morrison, Max C', 'Pallavajjalla, Aparna', 'Beierl, Katie', 'Amiel, Marie', 'Noe, Michael', 'Wood, Laura D', 'Lin, Ming-Tseh', 'Gocke, Christopher D', 'Klein, Alison P', 'Fuchs, Ephraim J', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Eshleman, James R']","['Debeljak M', 'Mocci E', 'Morrison MC', 'Pallavajjalla A', 'Beierl K', 'Amiel M', 'Noe M', 'Wood LD', 'Lin MT', 'Gocke CD', 'Klein AP', 'Fuchs EJ', 'Jones RJ', 'Eshleman JR']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.

A prospective observational case-control study was performed from March 2013 to February 2016. Infertile women consisted of the patients' group (group 2) while fertile women were the control group (group 1). Infertile women were divided according to infertility cause in women with tubal factor (group 2a), poor ovarian reserve (group 2b), endometriosis (group 2c) and unexplained infertility (group 2d). Endometrial biopsy was performed on 7th-8th postovulatory menstrual day. Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and LIF-Receptor (LIF-R) expression in epithelial and stromal cells were assessed with Immunohistochemistry (IHC). There were 20 infertile with poor ovarian reserve, 15 with tubal factor, 10 with endometriosis and 15 with unexplained infertility included in the analysis. LIF expression in patients with unexplained infertility was significantly compared with controls (P=0.006). No significant difference was observed between patients with tubal factor, poor ovarian reserve and endometriosis compared with control group (P=0.78, P=0.44 and P=0.56 respectively). Analysis of LIF-R expression in sub-categories of infertility indicated that expression was significantly decreased in all sub-groups of infertility. Our study indicated impaired LIF expression levels only in women with unexplained infertility, while LIF-R expression was impaired in all sub-groups of infertile women. Further multicenter prospective studies should be performed in order to assess the exact etiopathogenetic role of these cytokines in the molecular background of infertility.","['Margioula-Siarkou, Chrysoula', 'Prapas, Yannis', 'Petousis, Stamatios', 'Milias, Stefanos', 'Ravanos, Konstantinos', 'Dagklis, Themistoklis', 'Kalogiannidis, Ioannis', 'Mavromatidis, George', 'Haitoglou, Constantinos', 'Prapas, Nikolaos', 'Rousso, David']","['Margioula-Siarkou C', 'Prapas Y', 'Petousis S', 'Milias S', 'Ravanos K', 'Dagklis T', 'Kalogiannidis I', 'Mavromatidis G', 'Haitoglou C', 'Prapas N', 'Rousso D']","['3rd Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece; IAKENTRO, Infertility Center, Thessaloniki, Greece.

Recently, heterozygote human FLI1 mutations have been ascribed to cause thrombocytopenia. We studied induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived megakaryocytes (iMegs) to better understand these clinical disorders, beginning with iPSCs generated from a patient with PTSx and iPSCs from a control line with a targeted heterozygous FLI1 knockout (FLI1(+/-)). PTSx and FLI1(+/-) iMegs replicate many of the described megakaryocyte/platelet features, including a decrease in iMeg yield and fewer platelets released per iMeg. Platelets released in vivo from infusion of these iMegs had poor half-lives and functionality. We noted that the closely linked E26 transformation-specific proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1) is overexpressed in these FLI1-deficient iMegs, suggesting FLI1 negatively regulates ETS1 in megakaryopoiesis. Finally, we examined whether FLI1 overexpression would affect megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. We found increased yield of noninjured, in vitro iMeg yield and increased in vivo yield, half-life, and functionality of released platelets. These studies confirm FLI1 heterozygosity results in pleiotropic defects similar to those noted with other critical megakaryocyte-specific TFs; however, unlike those TFs, FLI1 overexpression improved yield and functionality.","['Vo, Karen K', 'Jarocha, Danuta J', 'Lyde, Randolph B', 'Hayes, Vincent', 'Thom, Christopher S', 'Sullivan, Spencer K', 'French, Deborah L', 'Poncz, Mortimer']","['Vo KK', 'Jarocha DJ', 'Lyde RB', 'Hayes V', 'Thom CS', 'Sullivan SK', 'French DL', 'Poncz M']","['Department of Pharmacology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', ""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; and."", ""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; and."", 'Department of Pharmacology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', ""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; and."", ""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; and."", ""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; and."", 'Mississippi Center for Advanced Medicine, Madison, MS.', ""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; and."", 'Department of Pharmacology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', ""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; and.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170421,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC5492092,,,,2017/04/23 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2017/04/23 06:00'],"['2017/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33262-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-02-770958 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jun 29;129(26):3486-3494. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-02-770958.

However, miR-155's role in regulating FLT3-ITD-mediated disease in vivo remains unclear. In this study, we used a genetic mouse model to determine whether miR-155 influences the development of FLT3-ITD-induced myeloproliferative disease. Results indicate that miR-155 promotes FLT3-ITD-induced myeloid expansion in the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood. Mechanistically, miR-155 increases proliferation of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartments by reducing the growth-inhibitory effects of the interferon (IFN) response, and this involves targeting of Cebpb. Consistent with our observations in mice, primary FLT3-ITD(+) AML clinical samples have significantly higher miR-155 levels and a lower IFN response compared with FLT3-WT AML samples. Further, inhibition of miR-155 in FLT3-ITD(+) AML cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9, or primary FLT3-ITD(+) AML samples using locked nucleic acid antisense inhibitors, results in an elevated IFN response and reduces colony formation. Altogether, our data reveal that miR-155 collaborates with FLT3-ITD to promote myeloid cell expansion in vivo and that this involves a multitarget mechanism that includes repression of IFN signaling.","['Wallace, Jared A', 'Kagele, Dominique A', 'Eiring, Anna M', 'Kim, Carissa N', 'Hu, Ruozhen', 'Runtsch, Marah C', 'Alexander, Margaret', 'Huffaker, Thomas B', 'Lee, Soh-Hyun', 'Patel, Ami B', 'Mosbruger, Timothy L', 'Voth, Warren P', 'Rao, Dinesh S', 'Miles, Rodney R', 'Round, June L', 'Deininger, Michael W', ""O'Connell, Ryan M""]","['Wallace JA', 'Kagele DA', 'Eiring AM', 'Kim CN', 'Hu R', 'Runtsch MC', 'Alexander M', 'Huffaker TB', 'Lee SH', 'Patel AB', 'Mosbruger TL', 'Voth WP', 'Rao DS', 'Miles RR', 'Round JL', 'Deininger MW', ""O'Connell RM""]","['Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170421,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC5465836,,,,2017/04/23 06:00,2017/08/23 06:00,['2017/04/23 06:00'],"['2016/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33322-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-09-740209 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jun 8;129(23):3074-3086. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-09-740209.

Mice lacking all R7-RGS subtypes exhibit diverse neurological phenotypes, and humans bearing mutations in the retinal R7-RGS isoform RGS9-1 have vision deficits. Although each R7-RGS subtype forms heterotrimeric complexes with Gbeta5 and R7-RGS-binding protein (R7BP) that regulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling by accelerating deactivation of Gi/o alpha-subunits, several neurological phenotypes of R7-RGS knock-out mice are not readily explained by dysregulated Gi/o signaling. Accordingly, we used tandem affinity purification and LC-MS/MS to search for novel proteins that interact with R7-RGS heterotrimers in the mouse brain. Among several proteins detected, we focused on Galpha13 because it had not been linked to R7-RGS complexes before. Split-luciferase complementation assays indicated that Galpha13 in its active or inactive state interacts with R7-RGS heterotrimers containing any R7-RGS isoform. LARG (leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)), PDZ-RhoGEF, and p115RhoGEF augmented interaction between activated Galpha13 and R7-RGS heterotrimers, indicating that these effector RhoGEFs can engage Galpha13.R7-RGS complexes. Because Galpha13/R7-RGS interaction required R7BP, we analyzed phenotypes of neuronal cell lines expressing RGS7 and Gbeta5 with or without R7BP. We found that neurite retraction evoked by Galpha12/13-dependent lysophosphatidic acid receptors was augmented in R7BP-expressing cells. R7BP expression blunted neurite formation evoked by serum starvation by signaling mechanisms involving Galpha12/13 but not Galphai/o These findings provide the first evidence that R7-RGS heterotrimers interact with Galpha13 to augment signaling pathways that regulate neurite morphogenesis. This mechanism expands the diversity of functions whereby R7-RGS complexes regulate critical aspects of nervous system development and function.","['Scherer, Stephanie L', 'Cain, Matthew D', 'Kanai, Stanley M', 'Kaltenbronn, Kevin M', 'Blumer, Kendall J']","['Scherer SL', 'Cain MD', 'Kanai SM', 'Kaltenbronn KM', 'Blumer KJ']","['From the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.', 'From the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.', 'From the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.', 'From the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.', 'From the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110 kblumer@wustl.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170421,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC5473243,['NOTNLM'],"['*G protein', '*heterotrimeric G protein', '*neurite outgrowth', '*proteomics', '*regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)']",,2017/04/23 06:00,2017/07/07 06:00,['2017/04/23 06:00'],"['2016/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)40798-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.771923 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2017 Jun 16;292(24):9906-9918. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.771923.

However, the detailed mechanisms of IFNalpha-mediated anti-angiogenesis are not completely understood. Stat1/2/3 and PML are IFNalpha downstream effectors and are pivotal regulators of angiogenesis. Here, we investigated PML's role in the regulation of Stat1/2/3 activity. In Pml knock-out (KO) mice, ablation of Pml largely reduces IFNalpha angiostatic ability in Matrigel plug assays. This suggested an essential role for PML in IFNalpha's anti-angiogenic function. We also demonstrated that PML shared a large cohort of regulatory genes with Stat1 and Stat3, indicating an important role of PML in regulating Stat1 and Stat3 activity. Using molecular tools and primary endothelial cells, we demonstrated that PML positively regulates Stat1 and Stat2 isgylation, a ubiquitination-like protein modification. Accordingly, manipulation of the isgylation system by knocking down USP18 altered IFNalpha-PML axis-mediated inhibition of endothelial cell migration and network formation. Furthermore, PML promotes turnover of nuclear Stat3, and knockdown of PML mitigates the effect of LLL12, a selective Stat3 inhibitor, on IFNalpha-mediated anti-angiogenic activity. Taken together, we elucidated an unappreciated mechanism in which PML, an IFNalpha-inducible effector, possess potent angiostatic activity, doing so in part by forming a positive feedforward loop with Stat1/2 and a negative feedback loop with Stat3. The interplay between PML, Stat1/Stat2, and Stat3 contributes to IFNalpha-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis, and disruption of this network results in aberrant IFNalpha signaling and altered angiostatic activity.","['Hsu, Kuo-Sheng', 'Zhao, Xuan', 'Cheng, Xiwen', 'Guan, Dongyin', 'Mahabeleshwar, Ganapati H', 'Liu, Yu', 'Borden, Ernest', 'Jain, Mukesh K', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Hsu KS', 'Zhao X', 'Cheng X', 'Guan D', 'Mahabeleshwar GH', 'Liu Y', 'Borden E', 'Jain MK', 'Kao HY']","['From the Department of Biochemistry and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and.', 'Case Cardiovascular Research Institute, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and.', 'Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of CWRU, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, and.', 'Case Cardiovascular Research Institute, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and hxk43@cwru.edu.', 'The Comprehensive Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20170421,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC5473212,['NOTNLM'],"['*STAT transcription factor', '*STAT3', '*angiogenesis', '*interferon', '*signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1)']",,2017/04/23 06:00,2017/07/07 06:00,['2017/04/23 06:00'],"['2016/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)40810-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.771071 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2017 Jun 16;292(24):10048-10060. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.771071.

Somatically acquired mutations in DNMT3A occur in haematological malignancies and are frequently present in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) affecting in more than 50% the arginine residue at position 882 (R882). To date, additional cases with TBRS have been published but so far none of the reported cases with TBRS developed AML. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we present the first case of TBRS who developed AML at the age of 15 years. Whole-exome sequencing identified a constitutional heterozygous DNMT3A R882C mutation. Our case exhibits macrocephaly, intellectual disability, distinct facial dysmorphism and other recurrent features fitting with the TBRS phenotype. The AML of the myelomonocytic subtype harboured only few additional somatically acquired mutations, that is, an aberrant karyotype and a recurrent PTPN11 mutation. DISCUSSION: The peculiarity of the specific R882 mutation in contrast to other DNMT3A mutations is discussed, including the hypothesis of the more aggressive nature of this variant.Our case represents the first evidence of the possible increased risk of the development of haematological malignancies in particular AML in cases with TBRS.","['Hollink, Iris H I M', 'van den Ouweland, Ans M W', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Arentsen-Peters, Susan T C J M', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'Wagner, Anja']","['Hollink IHIM', 'van den Ouweland AMW', 'Beverloo HB', 'Arentsen-Peters STCJM', 'Zwaan CM', 'Wagner A']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20170421,England,J Med Genet,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,,['NOTNLM'],"['* DNMT3A', '*Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndromeTBRS', '*acute myeloidleukaemiaAML', '*overgrowth']",['Competing interests: None declared.'],2017/04/23 06:00,2018/07/04 06:00,['2017/04/23 06:00'],"['2017/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['jmedgenet-2017-104574 [pii]', '10.1136/jmedgenet-2017-104574 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Genet. 2017 Dec;54(12):805-808. doi: 10.1136/jmedgenet-2017-104574.

Although the flow cytometric (FC) phenotype of CLPD-NK has been described, studies on FC phenotype of NKTCL are limited. To the best of our knowledge ours is the first study to compare the phenotype of NKTCL, CLPD-NK, reactive NK lymphocytosis (RNKL), and normal NK cells using eight color (8C) FC. METHODS: Specimens analyzed using the Euroflow8C NK Lymphoproliferative Disorder (NKLPD) panel between 2011 and 2014 were identified from our database. All samples were analyzed on the FACSCantoII cytometer. NK cells were identified as CD45+, smCD3-, CD19-, CD56+ and normal T-cells served as internal controls. RESULTS: The majority of NKTCL were CD56 bright, CD16 dim, CD57-, and CD94+. CLPD-NK and RNKL were predominantly CD56+ or dim with positive expression of CD16 and CD57 and weak CD94 expression. Antigen based statistical analyses showed robust division of samples along the NKTCL/normal CD56 bright NK cell and CLPD-NK/RNKL/normal CD56 positive NK cell groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that FC can reliably distinguish NKTCL from CLPD-NK, normal NK cells of CD56+ phenotype, and RNKL. It was proposed that the typical phenotype for NKTCL is: CD56 bright, CD16 dim with positive CD2, CD7, CD94, HLADR, CD25, CD26, and absent CD57. This resembles the phenotype of the CD56 bright immunoregulatory subset of NK cells which we therefore hypothesize is the cell of origin of NKTCL.

However, the available studies provide inconsistent findings, and population-based cohort studies with longitudinal information on vaccinations are lacking. Methods: In a register-based cohort of all children born in Denmark from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2008, followed up until age 15 years or 31 December 2009 ( n = 1 225 404), we evaluated exposure to childhood vaccination and risk of childhood ALL, including information on ALL subtypes. Using Cox regression, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated children. Results: Childhood ALL was diagnosed in 490 children during 10 829 194 person-years of follow-up. Neither the total number of vaccine doses received nor exposure to each vaccination given in childhood was associated with altered risk of ALL, including the following: (i) Haemophilus influenzae type b [HR, 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.68-1.61]; ii) measles, mumps and rubella (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.76-1.34); iii) whole-cell pertussis (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.51-2.39); and iv) diphtheria, tetanus and inactivated polio (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.42-3.13). Analyses conducted according to ALL subtypes defined by immunopheno- and karyotypes showed no association with childhood vaccination. Conclusions: This nationwide cohort study provides no support of the proposed protective effect of childhood vaccination against childhood ALL.","['Soegaard, Signe Holst', 'Rostgaard, Klaus', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Kamper-Jorgensen, Mads', 'Hargreave, Marie', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Hviid, Anders']","['Soegaard SH', 'Rostgaard K', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Kamper-Jorgensen M', 'Hargreave M', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Hviid A']","['Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Unit of Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*aetiology', '*cohort study', '*vaccination']",,2017/04/22 06:00,2018/06/22 06:00,['2017/04/22 06:00'],"['2017/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['3744780 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyx052 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2017 Jun 1;46(3):905-913. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyx052.,,20180621,,['0 (Vaccines)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacterial Infections/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunization Schedule', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines/*therapeutic use', 'Virus Diseases/*prevention & control']",,,"['(c) The Author 2017; all rights reserved.

This work focuses on supervised generative binary classification models, specifically linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The parameters are determined using an expectation maximization algorithm to both address missing data and introduce priors to promote sparsity. The proposed algorithm, expectation-maximization sparse discriminant analysis (EM-SDA), produces a sparse LDA model for datasets with and without missing data. Results: EM-SDA is tested via simulations and case studies. In the simulations, EM-SDA is compared with nearest shrunken centroids (NSCs) and sparse discriminant analysis (SDA) with k-nearest neighbors for imputation for varying mechanism and amount of missing data. In three case studies using published biomedical data, the results are compared with NSC and SDA models with four different types of imputation, all of which are common approaches in the field. EM-SDA is more accurate and sparse than competing methods both with and without missing data in most of the experiments. Furthermore, the EM-SDA results are mostly consistent between the missing and full cases. Biological relevance of the resulting models, as quantified via a literature search, is also presented.

However, the significance of CD25 expression in Ph negative (Ph-) B-LL regarding residual disease (RD) and genetic abnormalities is largely unknown. Methods: CD25 expression by flow cytometry (FC) was correlated with Ph status in 95 newly diagnosed B-LL patients and with RD status in day 29 marrow measured by FC in the context of cytogenetic risk stratification in Ph- patients. Results: CD25 expression was greater in Ph positive (Ph+) patients (80%) than in Ph- patients (17%), predicting Ph+ with 80% sensitivity and 86% specificity. In Ph- patients, CD25 expression (in 14 patients, 16%) was associated with RD in the cytogenetic intermediate-risk group: detectable RD in 50% of CD25+ patients vs 14% of CD25- patients. Interestingly, one CD25+/Ph- patient had a Ph-like genotype ( ZC3HAV1-ABL2 rearrangement), and another had dual MYC-IGH and BCL2-IGH rearrangements. Conclusions: Our findings not only confirm the predictive power of CD25 expression for Ph+ but also demonstrate that CD25 expression is associated with RD (a biomarker correlated with prognosis) in Ph- patients. The latter finding is likely associated with underlying molecular abnormalities, including Ph-like genotype.","['Chen, Pu', 'Chu, Andrew', 'Zia, Hamid', 'Koduru, Prasad', 'Collins, Robert', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Fuda, Franklin', 'Chen, Weina']","['Chen P', 'Chu A', 'Zia H', 'Koduru P', 'Collins R', 'Winick N', 'Fuda F', 'Chen W']","['From the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Pathology.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,['NOTNLM'],"['B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma', 'CD25', 'Cytogenetics', 'Flow cytometry', 'Ph-like', 'Philadelphia chromosome translocation', 'Residual disease', 't(9;22)(q34;q11)']",,2017/04/22 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2017/04/22 06:00'],"['2017/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['2529667 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqw178 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2016 Nov 1;146(5):632-638. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqw178.,,20171013,,"['0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",,,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016.

METHODS: Incident cases diagnosed between 1984 and 2013 were identified from the Manitoba Cancer Registry. We assessed time trends in age-standardized incidence rates using joinpoint regression and in 5-year relative survival using Poisson regression model. Kulldorff's scan method was used to assess spatial variation and clustering. RESULTS: Age-standardized incidence rates (per million person-years) in males and females were 34.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.9-39.1) and 26.2 (95% CI 21.5-30.7) for LL, 10.5 (95% CI 7.7-13.3) and 12.5 (95% CI 9.4-15.7) for HL, 12.5 (95% CI 9.3-15.4) and 7.7 (95% CI 5.2-10.2) for NHL (except for Burkitt lymphomas), and 3.2 (95% CI 1.6-4.7) and 1.5 (95% CI 0.4-2.5) for Burkitt lymphomas. Age- and sex- standardized LL incidence rate increased 1.4% (95% CI 0.3%-2.5%) per year, while the changes for HL and NHL incidence rates were not statistically significant. There were geographic differences in age-standardized incidence rates for LL, HL, and NHL and spatial clusters were detected in southern part of the province. Five-year relative survival has improved over time and there was no difference between rural and urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphoid leukemia incidence rate increased over time and varied by geographic area. Further research should examine the factors contributing to these trends.","['Ye, Xibiao', 'Torabi, Mahmoud', 'Lix, Lisa M', 'Mahmud, Salaheddin M']","['Ye X', 'Torabi M', 'Lix LM', 'Mahmud SM']","['Department of Community Health Sciences, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Max Rady College of Medicine, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170421,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5400229,,,,2017/04/22 06:00,2017/09/08 06:00,['2017/04/22 06:00'],"['2016/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0175701 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-38853 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Apr 21;12(4):e0175701. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0175701. eCollection 2017.,,20170907,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Manitoba/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) induced by IL-6 is frequently detected in liver cancer and has emerged as a viable molecular target for liver cancer treatment. However, few inhibitors targeting up-streams of STAT3 are available for the therapy of liver cancer. We reported the discovery of EVISTA (Raloxifene HCl) as novel inhibitor of IL-6/GP130 protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using multiple ligand simultaneous docking (MLSD) and drug repositioning. The possible effect of Raloxifene in STAT3 signaling or liver cancer cells is still unclear. RESULTS: Raloxifene inhibited the P-STAT3 stimulated by IL-6, but not the induction of STAT1 and STAT6 phosphorylation by IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, and IL-4. Raloxifene inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and resulted in the induction apoptosis on human liver cancer cell-lines. Raloxifene inhibited the targets of STAT3, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and survivin and cell viability, cell migration, and colony formation in liver cancer cells. Further, daily administration of Raloxifene suppressed the Hep-G2 tumor growth in mice in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibitory effect on STAT3 phosphorylation and activity as well as cell viability, migration, and colony forming ability by Raloxifene was examined in human liver cancer cells. Tumor growth was detected via mouse xenograft tumor mode. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Raloxifene is a potent IL-6/GP130 inhibitor and may be a chemoprevention agent for liver cancer by targeting persistent STAT3 signaling.","['Wang, Yina', 'Ma, Haiyan', 'Zhao, Chongqiang', 'Liu, Tianshu', 'Yan, Dan', 'Jou, David', 'Li, Huameng', 'Zhang, Cuntai', 'Lu, Jiagao', 'Li, Chenglong', 'Lin, Jiayuh', 'Li, Sheng', 'Lin, Li']","['Wang Y', 'Ma H', 'Zhao C', 'Liu T', 'Yan D', 'Jou D', 'Li H', 'Zhang C', 'Lu J', 'Li C', 'Lin J', 'Li S', 'Lin L']","['Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus OH, USA."", 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Geriatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus OH, USA."", 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5464902,['NOTNLM'],"['GP130', 'STAT3', 'liver cancer', 'raloxifene']",,2017/04/22 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/22 06:00'],"['2016/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['16898 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16898 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 16;8(20):33683-33693. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16898.,,20180305,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '4F86W47BR6 (Raloxifene Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Raloxifene Hydrochloride/*pharmacology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT6 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A3s are specific to eutherian mammals because no direct homologs exist at the syntenic genomic locus in metatherian (marsupial) or prototherian (monotreme) mammals. However, the A3s in these species have the likely evolutionary precursors, the antibody gene deaminase AID and the RNA/DNA editing enzyme APOBEC1 (A1). Here, we used cell culture-based assays to determine whether opossum A1 restricts the infectivity of retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the mobility of LTR/non-LTR retrotransposons. Opossum A1 partially inhibited HIV-1, as well as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), and the retrotransposon MusD. The mechanism of inhibition required catalytic activity, except for human LINE1 (L1) restriction, which was deamination-independent. These results indicate that opossum A1 functions as an innate barrier to infection by retroviruses such as HIV-1, and controls LTR/non-LTR retrotransposition in marsupials.","['Ikeda, Terumasa', 'Shimoda, Mayuko', 'Ebrahimi, Diako', 'VandeBerg, John L', 'Harris, Reuben S', 'Koito, Atsushi', 'Maeda, Kazuhiko']","['Ikeda T', 'Shimoda M', 'Ebrahimi D', 'VandeBerg JL', 'Harris RS', 'Koito A', 'Maeda K']","['Department of Retrovirology and Self-Defense, Faculty of Life Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Host Defense, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Host Defense, WPI Immunology Frontier Research Center (IFReC), Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'South Texas Diabetes and Obesity Institute, School of Medicine, The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville/Harlingen/Edinburg, Texas 78520, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.', 'Department of Retrovirology and Self-Defense, Faculty of Life Science, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Host Defense, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Host Defense, WPI Immunology Frontier Research Center (IFReC), Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170421,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5399452,,,,2017/04/22 06:00,2019/07/23 06:00,['2017/04/22 06:00'],"['2016/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['srep46719 [pii]', '10.1038/srep46719 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Apr 21;7:46719. doi: 10.1038/srep46719.,,20190722,,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Retroelements)', 'EC 3.5.4.36 (APOBEC-1 Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC-1 Deaminase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Opossums/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retroelements/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']","['R21 CA206309/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI064046/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To maintain a balanced production of all mature lineages and at the same time secure a stem cell reservoir, intricate regulatory programs have evolved to control multi-lineage differentiation and self-renewal in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Leukaemogenic mutations commonly disrupt these regulatory programs causing a block in differentiation with simultaneous enhancement of proliferation. Here, we briefly summarize key aspects of HSPC regulatory programs, and then focus on their disruption by leukaemogenic fusion genes containing the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene. Using MLL as an example, we explore important questions of wider significance that are still under debate, including the importance of cell of origin, to what extent leukaemia oncogenes impose specific regulatory programs and the relevance of leukaemia stem cells for disease development and prognosis. Finally, we suggest that disruption of stem cell regulatory programs is likely to play an important role in many other pathologies including ageing-associated regenerative failure.","['Basilico, Silvia', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Basilico S', 'Gottgens B']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 0XY, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 0XY, UK. bg200@cam.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170420,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,PMC5487585,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*AML', '*HSPC', '*MLL gene']",,2017/04/22 06:00,2018/03/15 06:00,['2017/04/22 06:00'],"['2016/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00109-017-1535-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00109-017-1535-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2017 Jul;95(7):719-727. doi: 10.1007/s00109-017-1535-3.

For comparison, the differentially expressed mRNA functions were annotated using gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis. The microarray revealed that 1011 lncRNAs and 2656 mRNAs differed in AML patients and 6069 lncRNAs and 5338 mRNAs differed in ALL patients from those in healthy controls.

We found that basophils can be confirmed on the basis of the positivity for CD203c and CD294 by flow cytometric analysis. We also found by cytogenetic analysis that basophils were derived from myeloblasts. He refused any chemotherapy and became transfusion-dependent. He died nine months after the transformation.

AIM: To analyze the prognostic parameters of AML at presentation. METHODS: The total sample of 44 AML patients was analyzed on the basis of age <55 and >/=55 years, sex, WBC count <50x10/(9)/l and >/=50x10/(9)/l, the Hb concentration <100 g/l and >/=100 g/l, PLT count <100x10/(9)/l and >/=100x10/(9)/l, Karnofsky score <60% and >60%, cytogenetics, CD56 expression, morphological type and types of treatment (standard and reduced induction chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy/stem cell transplantation - autologous and HLA matched, related, allogeneic, together and separately). RESULTS: The age <55 years, Karnofsky score >60% and standard induction chemotherapy statistically correlated with the higher complete remission (CR) rates, longer relapse free survival (RFS), lower relapse rate (RR), and longer overall survival (OS) (p<0.01). The difference in terms of CR and RR between the sexes were not statistically significant (p<0.05), however women had statistically lower OS comparing to men (9.71+/-4.54 months vs. 38.03+/-9.17 months) (p<0.01). WBC count >/= 50x10/(9)/l and the Hb concentration <100 g/l statistically correlated with shorter OS (p<0.05), while the WBC count >/=50x10/(9)/l statistically correlated with shorter RFS (p<0.05). The PLT count <100x10/(9)/l and >/=100x10/(9)/l was not found as prognostically significant for CR, RR, RFS, and OS (p<0.05). In comparison to the standard induction chemotherapy, both types of high dose chemotherapy/stem cell transplantation (HDT/SCT) (10/22), together and separately, resulted in longer RFS, lower RR, and longer OS (p<0.05). The frequency of cytogenetic risk was intermediate 81.6%, unfavorable 13.2%, and favorable 5.3%, respectively. CD56 + expression statistically correlated with the lower PLT count, higher RR, shorter RFS, and shorter OS (p<0.05). Statistical analysis of the cytogenetic risk and morphological types of AML were not possible due to the small number of patients in stratified groups. CONCLUSIONS: Female sex, the WBC count >50x10/(9)/l, the concentration of Hb <100 g/l, and CD56 + expression, at presentation of AML, should be considered as parameters of adverse risk, especially in latter decisions considering post-remission treatment with HDT/SCT.","['Jahic, Azra', 'Iljazovic, Ermina', 'Hasic, Samira', 'Arnautovic, Aida Custovic', 'Sabitovic, Damir', 'Mesanovic, Semir', 'Sahovic, Haris', 'Simendic, Vlastimir']","['Jahic A', 'Iljazovic E', 'Hasic S', 'Arnautovic AC', 'Sabitovic D', 'Mesanovic S', 'Sahovic H', 'Simendic V']","['Clinic for Oncology, Hematology and Radiotherapy, Department of Hematology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Policlinic for Laboratory Diagnostics, Pathology Department, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Clinic for Oncology, Hematology and Radiotherapy, Department of Hematology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Clinic for Oncology, Hematology and Radiotherapy, Department of Hematology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Policlinic for Laboratory Diagnostics, Department of Clinical Immunology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Policlinic for Laboratory Diagnostics, Department of Genetics, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Clinic for Oncology, Hematology and Radiotherapy, Department of Hematology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'Clinic for Oncology, Hematology and Radiotherapy, Department of Hematology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170205,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Med Arch,"Medical archives (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina)",101635337,PMC5364786,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukaemia', 'prognosis', 'prognostic parameter']",['* Conflict of interest: none declared.'],2017/04/22 06:00,2018/09/20 06:00,['2017/04/22 06:00'],"['2017/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.5455/medarh.2017.71.20-24 [doi]', 'MA-71-20 [pii]']",ppublish,Med Arch. 2017 Feb;71(1):20-24. doi: 10.5455/medarh.2017.71.20-24.

Pinometostat (EPZ-5676), a selective inhibitor of DOT1L, is in clinical development in relapsed/refractory acute leukemia patients harboring rearrangements of the MLL gene. The observation of responses and subsequent relapses in the adult trial treating MLL-r patients motivated preclinical investigations into potential mechanisms of pinometostat treatment-emergent resistance (TER) in cell lines confirmed to have MLL-r. TER was achieved in five MLL-r cell lines, KOPN-8, MOLM-13, MV4-11, NOMO-1, and SEM. Two of the cell lines, KOPN-8 and NOMO-1, were thoroughly characterized to understand the mechanisms involved in pinometostat resistance. Unlike many other targeted therapies, resistance does not appear to be achieved through drug-induced selection of mutations of the target itself. Instead, we identified both drug efflux transporter dependent and independent mechanisms of resistance to pinometostat. In KOPN-8 TER cells, increased expression of the drug efflux transporter ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, MDR1) was the primary mechanism of drug resistance. In contrast, resistance in NOMO-1 cells occurs through a mechanism other than upregulation of a specific efflux pump.

These receptors are targets for therapy with Lutetium-177-labeled somatostatin analogues. We have treated over 1,200 patients with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with [(177)Lu-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotate ((177)Lu-DOTATATE) since the year 2000 and present the results on efficacy, survival, and toxicity of this therapy.Experimental Design: For safety analysis, 610 patients treated with a cumulative dose of at least 100 mCi (3.7 GBq) (177)Lu-DOTATATE were included. A subgroup of 443 Dutch patients who were treated with a cumulative dose of at least 600 mCi (22.2 GBq) (177)Lu-DOTATATE before 2013 was further analyzed for efficacy and survival.Results: The objective response rate of the total group of patients was 39%. Stable disease was reached in 43% of patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for all NET patients were 29 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 26-33 months] and 63 months (95% CI, 55-72 months). Long-term toxicity included acute leukemia in four patients (0.7%) and myelodysplastic syndrome in nine patients (1.5%). No therapy-related long-term renal or hepatic failure occurred.Conclusions: PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE is a favorable therapeutic option in patients with metastatic bronchial and gastroenteropancreatic NETs that express somatostatin receptors. PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE is safe with few side-effects and shows good response rates with PFS of 29 months and OS of 63 months. Clin Cancer Res; 23(16); 4617-24.

Then, a challenge test was conducted by infection of Aeromonas hydrophila for 14 days. The results firstly showed that compared with optimal iron level, iron deficiency decreased lysozyme (LZ) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities, complement 3 (C3), C4 and immunoglobulin M (IgM) contents and down-regulated the mRNA levels of antibacterial peptides, anti-inflammatory cytokines, inhibitor of kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha), target of rapamycin (TOR) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), whereas up-regulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65, IkappaB kinases beta (IKKbeta) and eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) in head kidney and spleen of young grass carp (P < 0.05), indicating that iron deficiency impaired immune function in head kidney and spleen of fish. Secondly, iron deficiency down-regulated the mRNA levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), and inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), and decreased activities and mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes, down-regulated the mRNA levels of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and tight junction complexes, and up-regulated mRNA levels of cysteinyl aspartic acid-protease (caspase) -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), Fas ligand (FasL), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), Kelch-like ECH-associating protein (Keap) 1a, Keap1b, claudin-12 and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and increased malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents in head kidney and spleen of young grass carp (P < 0.05), indicating that iron deficiency impaired structural integrity in head kidney and spleen of fish.

Our group has previously shown that large numbers of functional NK cells can be differentiated in vitro from umbilical cord blood (CB) CD34(+) cells. To produce a clinically relevant and effective immunotherapy, we hypothesized that it is essential that the NK cells are able to proliferate and persist in vivo while maintaining an optimal activation status and killing capacity. METHODS: We evaluated the proliferation capacity, telomere length and terminal differentiation markers expressed by NK cells differentiated in vitro. We also determined how their cytotoxicity compared with peripheral blood (PB) NK cells and CBNK cells when targeting patient acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and solid tumor cell lines. RESULTS: We found that the differentiated NK cells could respond to interleukin-2 and proliferate in vitro. Telomere length was significantly increased, whereas CD57 expression was significantly reduced compared with PBNK cells. The cytotoxicity of the differentiated NK cells was equivalent to that of the PBNK and CBNK cell controls, and priming consistently led to higher levels of killing of patient leukemic blasts and solid tumor cell lines in vitro. Interestingly, this activation step was not required to observe killing of patient AML blasts in vivo. CONCLUSION: We are able to generate NK cells from CBCD34(+) cells in high numbers, allowing for multiple infusions of highly cytotoxic NK cells that have potential to further proliferate in vivo, making them a desirable product for application as an immunotherapy in the clinic.","['Domogala, Anna', 'Blundell, Michael', 'Thrasher, Adrian', 'Lowdell, Mark W', 'Madrigal, J Alejandro', 'Saudemont, Aurore']","['Domogala A', 'Blundell M', 'Thrasher A', 'Lowdell MW', 'Madrigal JA', 'Saudemont A']","['Anthony Nolan Research Institute, London, UK; University College London, London, UK.', 'University College London, London, UK.', 'University College London, London, UK.', 'University College London, London, UK.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, London, UK; University College London, London, UK.', 'Anthony Nolan Research Institute, London, UK; University College London, London, UK.

Recently, we reported on the discovery of high affinity Mcl-1 inhibitors that elicit mechanism-based cell activity. These inhibitors are lipophilic and contain an acidic functionality which is a common chemical profile for compounds that bind to albumin in plasma. Indeed, these Mcl-1 inhibitors exhibited reduced in vitro cell activity in the presence of serum. Here we describe the structure of a lead Mcl-1 inhibitor when bound to Human Serum Albumin (HSA). Unlike many acidic lipophilic compounds that bind to drug site 1 or 2, we found that this Mcl-1 inhibitor binds predominantly to drug site 3.

Acute leukemia (AL) can sometimes begin with osteoarticular signs and radiological investigations such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help guide the diagnosis. We report on two cases of pediatric AL revealed by osteoarticular signs, with MRI helpful in the diagnostic procedure. In these children, the first signs were recurrent joint pain, with no blood count anomalies. There was a delay between the onset of arthralgia and diagnosis due to atypical presentation of the disease. MRI guided the investigations to the diagnosis of AL. The persistence of pain or inflammation must lead to considering a bone MRI and a complete blood count must be repeated in case of persistent inflammatory bone pain to avoid a missed diagnosis of blood disease.","['Flatres, C', 'Pennaneach, A', 'Blondin, G', 'Rivoal, E', 'Haro, S', 'Vic, P']","['Flatres C', 'Pennaneach A', 'Blondin G', 'Rivoal E', 'Haro S', 'Vic P']","['Service de pediatrie, centre hospitalier de Cornouaille, 14, avenue Yves-Thepot, 29107 Quimper cedex, France.

Although histological features are usually sufficient to distinguish lymphoblastic from mature B- or T-cell neoplasms, of greater importance for diagnosis is the characterization of immunophenotype by flow cytometry. LBL occurs more commonly in children than in adults, mostly in males. A bone marrow involvement <25% (or 20% according to WHO) formally distinguishes LBL from ALL. The prognosis of LBL has dramatically improved with the use of intensive ALL-type chemotherapy regimens, which includes intensive intrathecal chemotherapy prophylaxis and consolidation with mediastinal irradiation. Patients with adverse prognostic features assessed by postinduction CT/positron emission tomography scans (PET) and minimal residual disease analysis (MRD) should be considered for high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Further therapeutic progresses are expected from the introduction of new drugs and targeting agents.","['Cortelazzo, Sergio', 'Ferreri, Andres', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio']","['Cortelazzo S', 'Ferreri A', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ponzoni M']","['Oncology Unit, Humanitas/Gavazzeni, Bergamo, Italy.

Sw. (Cucurbitaceae) is used in ethnomedicine, but the diversity of the varietal groups of this species has not often been considered. This is important because we previously reported that different variety of species exhibit different activities across different tumor cell lines. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the chemical composition and biological activities of extracts obtained from S. edule var. nigrum spinosum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leukemia P388 cell line and mononuclear bone marrow cells (MNCBMs) were treated with the extract at a concentration ranging from 40 to 2370 mug/mL for cytotoxicity and viability assays. CD-1 mice were treated with 8-5000 mg/kg extract and monitored every hour for the first 24 h and subsequently for seven days for signs of toxicity (LD50). In addition, the chromatographic profile of the extract was determined by HPLC. RESULTS: The extract inhibits the proliferation of both P388 cells and MNCBMs, with IC50 values of 927 and 1911 mug/mL, respectively, but reduced the viability and induced the apoptosis of only leukemia cells. The LD50 was higher than 5000 mg/kg, and this concentration did not alter the blood chemistry or cell count but doubled the mitotic index in the bone marrow. The HPLC showed the presence of cucurbitacins, phloridzin, naringenin, phloretin, apigenin, and gallic, chlorogenic, vanillic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, and p-coumaric acids. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Sechium edule var. nigrum spinosum contains bioactive compounds that explain the antiproliferative and nutraceutical activities, and its lack of physiological side effects constitutes an added value to a widely consumed vegetable.","['Aguiniga-Sanchez, Itzen', 'Cadena-Iniguez, Jorge', 'Santiago-Osorio, Edelmiro', 'Gomez-Garcia, Guadalupe', 'Mendoza-Nunez, Victor Manuel', 'Rosado-Perez, Juana', 'Ruiz-Ramos, Mirna', 'Cisneros-Solano, Victor Manuel', 'Ledesma-Martinez, Edgar', 'Delgado-Bordonave, Angel de Jesus', 'Soto-Hernandez, Ramon Marcos']","['Aguiniga-Sanchez I', 'Cadena-Iniguez J', 'Santiago-Osorio E', 'Gomez-Garcia G', 'Mendoza-Nunez VM', 'Rosado-Perez J', 'Ruiz-Ramos M', 'Cisneros-Solano VM', 'Ledesma-Martinez E', 'Delgado-Bordonave AJ', 'Soto-Hernandez RM']","['a Postgraduate College, Montencillo , Texcoco , Mexico.', 'b Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, Cell Differentiation and Cancer Research Unit, FES Zaragoza , National Autonomous University of Mexico , Iztapalapa , Mexico.', 'c Interdisciplinary Research Group of Sechium edule in Mexico, GISeM , Estado de Mexico , Mexico.', 'a Postgraduate College, Montencillo , Texcoco , Mexico.', 'c Interdisciplinary Research Group of Sechium edule in Mexico, GISeM , Estado de Mexico , Mexico.', 'b Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, Cell Differentiation and Cancer Research Unit, FES Zaragoza , National Autonomous University of Mexico , Iztapalapa , Mexico.', 'c Interdisciplinary Research Group of Sechium edule in Mexico, GISeM , Estado de Mexico , Mexico.', 'b Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, Cell Differentiation and Cancer Research Unit, FES Zaragoza , National Autonomous University of Mexico , Iztapalapa , Mexico.', 'd Gerontology Research Unit, FES Zaragoza , National Autonomous University of Mexico , Iztapalapa , Mexico.', 'd Gerontology Research Unit, FES Zaragoza , National Autonomous University of Mexico , Iztapalapa , Mexico.', 'd Gerontology Research Unit, FES Zaragoza , National Autonomous University of Mexico , Iztapalapa , Mexico.', 'c Interdisciplinary Research Group of Sechium edule in Mexico, GISeM , Estado de Mexico , Mexico.', 'b Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, Cell Differentiation and Cancer Research Unit, FES Zaragoza , National Autonomous University of Mexico , Iztapalapa , Mexico.', 'b Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, Cell Differentiation and Cancer Research Unit, FES Zaragoza , National Autonomous University of Mexico , Iztapalapa , Mexico.', 'a Postgraduate College, Montencillo , Texcoco , Mexico.', 'c Interdisciplinary Research Group of Sechium edule in Mexico, GISeM , Estado de Mexico , Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,PMC6130647,['NOTNLM'],"['GISeM', 'HPLC', 'chayote', 'cytotoxicity', 'differential']",,2017/04/22 06:00,2017/10/05 06:00,['2017/04/22 06:00'],"['2017/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13880209.2017.1316746 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2017 Dec;55(1):1638-1645. doi: 10.1080/13880209.2017.1316746.,,20171004,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Cucurbitaceae/*chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Methanol/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the cytotoxic effects of ASC, alone or in combination with arsenic trioxide (ATO) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Leukemic cell lines and primary blasts from AML and APL patients were treated with graded concentrations of ASC, alone or in association with standard concentration (1 muM) of ATO. The ASC/ATO combination killed myeloid blasts, including leukemic CD34+ cells, while sparing CD34+ progenitors obtained from normal cord blood and bone marrow. Actually, approximately one-third (11/36) of primary AML cases were highly sensitive to the ASC/ATO combination. The mechanism of cell killing appeared to be related to increased oxidative stress and overproduction of ROS in a non-quantitative fashion, which resulted in induction of apoptosis. These effects were reverted by the addition of the antioxidant N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC). In the APL NB4 model, ASC induced direct degradation of the PML and PML/RARA proteins via caspase activation, while the transcriptional repressor DAXX was recruited in re-constituted PML nuclear bodies. Our findings encourage the design of pilot studies to explore the potential clinical benefit of ASC alone or in combination with ATO in advanced AML and APL.","['Noguera, Nelida I', 'Pelosi, Elvira', 'Angelini, Daniela F', 'Piredda, Maria Liliana', 'Guerrera, Gisella', 'Piras, Eleonora', 'Battistini, Luca', 'Massai, Lauretta', 'Berardi, Anna', 'Catalano, Gianfranco', 'Cicconi, Laura', 'Castelli, Germana', ""D'Angio, Agnese"", 'Pasquini, Luca', 'Graziani, Grazia', 'Fioritoni, Giuseppe', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Mastrangelo, Domenico', 'Testa, Ugo', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Noguera NI', 'Pelosi E', 'Angelini DF', 'Piredda ML', 'Guerrera G', 'Piras E', 'Battistini L', 'Massai L', 'Berardi A', 'Catalano G', 'Cicconi L', 'Castelli G', ""D'Angio A"", 'Pasquini L', 'Graziani G', 'Fioritoni G', 'Voso MT', 'Mastrangelo D', 'Testa U', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Santa Lucia Foundation, I.R.C.C.S.

Cytogenetic analysis showed favorable findings (normal karyotype and isolated 13q14 deletion) in 30 patients, unfavorable (complex karyotype and/or 17p13/11q22 deletion) in 34 cases and intermediate (all other abnormalities) in 36 cases. A complex karyotype was present in 21 patients. Mutations were detected in 56 cases and were associated with unmutated IGHV status (p = 0.040) and complex karyotype (p = 0.047). TP53 disruption (i.e. TP53 mutations and/or 17p13 deletion by FISH) correlated with the presence of >/= 2 mutations (p = 0.001) and a complex karyotype (p = 0.012). By multivariate analysis, an advanced Binet stage (p < 0.001) and an unfavorable karyotype (p = 0.001) predicted a shorter time to first treatment. TP53 disruption (p = 0.019) and the unfavorable karyotype (p = 0.028) predicted a worse overall survival. A shorter time to chemorefractoriness was associated with TP53 disruption (p = 0.001) and unfavorable karyotype (p = 0.025). Patients with both unfavorable karyotype and TP53 disruption presented a dismal outcome (median overall survival and time to chemorefractoriness of 28.7 and 15.0 months, respectively). In conclusion, karyotype analysis refines risk stratification in high-risk CLL patients and could identify a subset of patients with highly unfavorable outcome requiring alternative treatments.","['Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Formigaro, Luca', 'Cavallari, Maurizio', 'Quaglia, Francesca Maria', 'Lista, Enrico', 'Urso, Antonio', 'Guardalben, Emanuele', 'Martinelli, Sara', 'Saccenti, Elena', 'Bassi, Cristian', 'Lupini, Laura', 'Bardi, Maria Antonella', 'Volta, Eleonora', 'Tammiso, Elisa', 'Melandri, Aurora', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Cuneo, Antonio']","['Rigolin GM', 'Formigaro L', 'Cavallari M', 'Quaglia FM', 'Lista E', 'Urso A', 'Guardalben E', 'Martinelli S', 'Saccenti E', 'Bassi C', 'Lupini L', 'Bardi MA', 'Volta E', 'Tammiso E', 'Melandri A', 'Negrini M', 'Cavazzini F', 'Cuneo A']","['Hematology Section, Department of Medical Sciences, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Arcispedale S.

While the clinical manifestation of this patient we report herein was aggressive with lasting fever, splenomegaly and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). T-cell immunophenotype was CD3+CD4-CD8-CD5-CD7-TCRalphabeta+. After comprehensive evaluation, an adjusted chemotherapy regimen CEOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone) with etoposide, a potential effective regimen for HLH was administrated to the patient. Although he received intensive regimen, the patient showed drug resistance and disease progression with central nervous system (CNS) involvement during treatment and showed only transiently response to intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine and dexamethasone. Therefore, considering the refractory elderly patient with fragile physical condition, metronomic regimen T-PEPC (oral administration of thalidomide, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and methyhydrazine) was recommended, which refers to the frequent even daily administration of cytotoxic drugs at comparatively low doses with minimal or prolonged drug-free breaks. The patient responded well to this treatment and remained symptom-free for 8-month follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first case of reporting this unique immunophenotype of dual CD4-/CD8- with aggressive clinical course and CNS involvement that successfully treated with metronomic regimen, suggesting that low dose metronomic regimen could be a better option for elderly patient with aggressive T-LGL leukemia.","['Liu, Yun', 'Fan, Lei', 'Zhao, Huihui', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jianyong']","['Liu Y', 'Fan L', 'Zhao H', 'Xu W', 'Li J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5458284,['NOTNLM'],"['HLH', 'T-LGL leukemia', 'metronomic regimen']",,2017/04/22 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/22 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['15762 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15762 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 9;8(19):32292-32297. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15762.,,20180305,,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Administration, Metronomic', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*secondary', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, how this deletion in the 13q14.3 region is associated with a significant decrease in EFS in children and adolescents with BL is largely unknown. The gene Deleted in Lymphocytic Leukemia 1 (DLEU1) is located in the region of 13q14.3. Here, we report that DLEU1 expression is implicated in the regulation of BL programmed cell death, cell proliferation, and expression of apoptotic genes in transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)s-induced DLEU1 knockdown and DLEU1 overexpressing BL cell lines. Furthermore, NSG mice xenografted with DLEU1 knockdown BL cells had significantly shortened survival (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005), whereas those xenografted with DLEU1 overexpressing BL cells had significantly improved survival (p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001), following treatment with rituximab and/or cyclophosphamide. These data suggest that DLEU1 may in part function as a tumor suppressor gene and confer chemoimmunotherapy resistance in children and adolescents with BL.","['Lee, Sanghoon', 'Luo, Wen', 'Shah, Tishi', 'Yin, Changhong', ""O'Connell, Timmy"", 'Chung, Tae-Hoon', 'Perkins, Sherrie L', 'Miles, Rodney R', 'Ayello, Janet', 'Morris, Erin', 'Harrison, Lauren', 'van de Ven, Carmella', 'Cairo, Mitchell S']","['Lee S', 'Luo W', 'Shah T', 'Yin C', ""O'Connell T"", 'Chung TH', 'Perkins SL', 'Miles RR', 'Ayello J', 'Morris E', 'Harrison L', 'van de Ven C', 'Cairo MS']","['Departments of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Cell Biology and Anatomy, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Microbiology and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Cell Biology and Anatomy, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Microbiology and Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5438612,['NOTNLM'],"['B-NHL', 'DLEU1', 'chemoimmunotherapy', 'genome editing', 'tumor suppressor']",,2017/04/22 06:00,2018/04/04 06:00,['2017/04/22 06:00'],"['2016/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['15711 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15711 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 25;8(17):27839-27853. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15711.,,20180403,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (DLEU1 lncRNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.1.- (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Rituximab/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, human DDX41 and its R525H mutant (R525H) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The ATPase activities of the recombinant DDX41 and R525H proteins were dependent on both ATP and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), such as poly(dG-dC) and poly(dA-dT). High-throughput screening was performed with a dsDNA-dependent ATPase assay using the human R525H proteins.

Objective: To assess the survival impact of SPMs in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (15-39 years) compared with that of pediatric (<15 years) and older adult (>/=40 years) patients with the same SPMs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study of patients with cancer in 13 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results regions in the United States diagnosed from 1992 to 2008 and followed through 2013. Data analysis was performed between June 2016 and January 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Five-year relative survival was calculated overall and for each cancer occurring as a PM or SPM by age at diagnosis. The impact of SPM status on cancer-specific death was examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: A total of 15954 pediatric, 125750 AYAs, and 878370 older adult patients diagnosed as having 14 cancers occurring as a PM or SPM were included. Overall, 5-year survival after an SPM was 33.1% lower for children, 20.2% lower for AYAs, and 8.3% lower for older adults compared with a PM at the same age. For the most common SPMs in AYAs, the absolute difference in 5-year survival was 42% lower for secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 19% for secondary breast carcinoma, 15% for secondary thyroid carcinoma, and 13% for secondary soft-tissue sarcoma. Survival by SPM status was significantly worse in younger vs older patients for thyroid, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, soft-tissue sarcoma, and central nervous system cancer. Adolescents and young adults with secondary Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratio [95% CI], 3.5 [1.7-7.1]); soft-tissue sarcoma (2.8 [2.1-3.9]); breast carcinoma (2.1 [1.8-2.4]); acute myeloid leukemia (1.9 [1.5-2.4]); and central nervous system cancer (1.8 [1.2-2.8]) experienced worse survival compared with AYAs with the same PMs. Conclusion and Relevance: The adverse impact of SPMs on survival is substantial for AYAs and may partially explain the relative lack of survival improvement in AYAs compared with other age groups. The impact of a particular SPM diagnosis on survival may inform age-specific prevention, screening, treatment, and survivorship recommendations.","['Keegan, Theresa H M', 'Bleyer, Archie', 'Rosenberg, Aaron S', 'Li, Qian', 'Goldfarb, Melanie']","['Keegan THM', 'Bleyer A', 'Rosenberg AS', 'Li Q', 'Goldfarb M']","['Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California, Davis, School of Medicine, Sacramento.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California, Davis, School of Medicine, Sacramento.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California, Davis, School of Medicine, Sacramento.', ""John Wayne Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John's Health Center, Santa Monica, California.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,PMC5824209,,,,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['2619709 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.0465 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2017 Nov 1;3(11):1554-1557. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.0465.,,20171128,,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Age Factors', 'Age of Onset', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both CD4+ T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs) infected with HTLV-1 are found in peripheral blood from HTLV-1 carriers. We previously demonstrated that monocyte-derived IL-4 DCs are more susceptible to HTLV-1 infection than autologous primary T-cells, suggesting that DC infection precedes T-cell infection. However, during blood transmission, breast-feeding or sexual transmission, HTLV-1 may encounter different DC subsets present in the blood, the intestinal or genital mucosa respectively. These different contacts may impact HTLV-1 ability to infect DCs and its subsequent transfer to T-cells. Using in vitro monocyte-derived IL-4 DCs, TGF-beta DCs and IFN-alpha DCs that mimic DCs contacting HTLV-1 in vivo, we show here that despite their increased ability to capture HTLV-1 virions, IFN-alpha DCs restrict HTLV-1 productive infection. Surprisingly, we then demonstrate that it is not due to the antiviral activity of type-I interferon produced by IFN-alpha DCs, but that it is likely to be linked to a distinct trafficking route of HTLV-1 in IL-4 DCs vs. IFN-alpha DCs. Finally, we demonstrate that, in contrast to IL-4 DCs, IFN-alpha DCs are impaired in their capacity to transfer HTLV-1 to CD4 T-cells, both after viral capture and trans-infection and after their productive infection. In conclusion, the nature of the DCs encountered by HTLV-1 upon primo-infection and the viral trafficking route through the vesicular pathway of these cells determine the efficiency of viral transmission to T-cells, which may condition the fate of infection.","['Rizkallah, Gerges', 'Alais, Sandrine', 'Futsch, Nicolas', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Journo, Chloe', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Dutartre, Helene']","['Rizkallah G', 'Alais S', 'Futsch N', 'Tanaka Y', 'Journo C', 'Mahieux R', 'Dutartre H']","['International Center for Research in Infectiology, Retroviral Oncogenesis laboratory, INSERM U1111 -Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Equipe labellisee ""Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer"", Lyon, France.', 'International Center for Research in Infectiology, Retroviral Oncogenesis laboratory, INSERM U1111 -Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Equipe labellisee ""Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer"", Lyon, France.', 'International Center for Research in Infectiology, Retroviral Oncogenesis laboratory, INSERM U1111 -Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Equipe labellisee ""Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer"", Lyon, France.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Uehara 207, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa, Japan.', 'International Center for Research in Infectiology, Retroviral Oncogenesis laboratory, INSERM U1111 -Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Equipe labellisee ""Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer"", Lyon, France.', 'International Center for Research in Infectiology, Retroviral Oncogenesis laboratory, INSERM U1111 -Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Equipe labellisee ""Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer"", Lyon, France.', 'International Center for Research in Infectiology, Retroviral Oncogenesis laboratory, INSERM U1111 -Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Equipe labellisee ""Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer"", Lyon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170420,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,PMC5413061,,,,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1006353 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-16-02842 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2017 Apr 20;13(4):e1006353. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006353. eCollection 2017 Apr.,,20170926,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2608-8963', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2505-5000']","['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon Type I)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/virology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/transmission/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/immunology', 'Models, Biological', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology']",,,,,,,,['PLoS Pathog. 2017 Jul 11;13(7):e1006494.

However, current animal models are low throughput and a large number of human diseases are difficult to model in animals. Animal models are less amenable to manipulation of tissue niche components, signalling pathways, epigenetics, and genome editing than ex vivo models. On the other hand, conventional 2D cultures lack the physiological relevance to study precise microenvironmental interactions. Thus, artificial tissues are being developed to study these interactions in the context of immune development, function, and disease. RECENT FINDINGS: New bone marrow and lymph node models have been created to, respectively, study microenvironmental interactions in hematopoiesis and germinal center-like biology. These models have also been extended to understand the effect of these interactions on the progression and therapeutic response in leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma. SUMMARY: 3D in-vitro immune models have elucidated new cellular, biochemical, and biophysical interactions as potential regulatory mechanisms, therapeutic targets, or biomarkers that previously could not be studied in animal models and conventional 2D cultures. Incorporation of advanced biomaterials, microfluidics, genome editing, and single-cell analysis tools will enable further studies of function, driver mutations, and tumor heterogeneity. Continual refinement will help inform the development of antibody and cell-based immunotherapeutics and patient-specific treatment plans.","['Shah, Shivem B', 'Singh, Ankur']","['Shah SB', 'Singh A']","['aMeinig School of Biomedical Engineering bSibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering cGraduate Field Faculty of Immunology and Infectious Disease, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,PMC5720144,,,,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000356 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Jul;24(4):377-383. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000356.,,20171024,,,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomimetic Materials', 'Cellular Microenvironment', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*immunology', 'Models, Animal', '*Tissue Engineering', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['R33 CA212968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS892620'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and methods: We evaluated infection-related complications that were grade >/=3 on National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) and their risk factors in 409 children with newly diagnosed ALL throughout the treatment period. Results: Of the 2420 infection episodes, febrile neutropenia and clinically or microbiologically documented infection were seen in 1107 and 1313 episodes, respectively. Among documented infection episodes, upper respiratory tract was the most common site (n = 389), followed by ear (n = 151), bloodstream (n = 147), and gastrointestinal tract (n = 145) infections. These episodes were more common during intensified therapy phases such as remission induction and reinduction, but respiratory and ear infections, presumably viral in origin, also occurred during continuation phases. The 3-year cumulative incidence of infection-related death was low (1.0+/-0.9%, n = 4), including 2 from Bacillus cereus bacteremia. There was no fungal infection-related mortality. Age 1-9.9 years at diagnosis was associated with febrile neutropenia (P = 0.002) during induction and febrile neutropenia and documented infection (both P < 0.001) during later continuation. White race was associated with documented infection (P = 0.034) during induction. Compared with low-risk patients, standard- and high-risk patients received more intensive therapy during early continuation and had higher incidences of febrile neutropenia (P < 0.001) and documented infections (P = 0.043). Furthermore, poor neutrophil surge after dexamethasone pulses during continuation, which can reflect the poor bone marrow reserve, was associated with infections (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The incidence of infection-related death was low. However, young age, white race, intensive chemotherapy, and lack of neutrophil surge after dexamethasone treatment were associated with infection-related complications. Close monitoring for prompt administration of antibiotics and modification of chemotherapy should be considered in these patients.","['Inaba, H', 'Pei, D', 'Wolf, J', 'Howard, S C', 'Hayden, R T', 'Go, M', 'Varechtchouk, O', 'Hahn, T', 'Buaboonnam, J', 'Metzger, M L', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Jeha, S', 'Cheng, C', 'Evans, W E', 'Relling, M V', 'Pui, C-H']","['Inaba H', 'Pei D', 'Wolf J', 'Howard SC', 'Hayden RT', 'Go M', 'Varechtchouk O', 'Hahn T', 'Buaboonnam J', 'Metzger ML', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Sandlund JT', 'Jeha S', 'Cheng C', 'Evans WE', 'Relling MV', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis,Tennessee, USA.', ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis,Tennessee, USA.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases,, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis,Tennessee, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis,Tennessee, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis,Tennessee, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis,Tennessee, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis,Tennessee, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis,Tennessee, USA.', ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, USA.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis,Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,PMC5834143,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*children', '*infection']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/12/26 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)32205-7 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdw557 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2017 Feb 1;28(2):386-392. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdw557.,,20171225,,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/mortality/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/chemically induced/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']","['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['(c) The Author 2016.

Here we found that depletion of beta-Arrestin1 extended the population doubling time and the percentage of senile cells, the signatures of cellular senescence, of B-ALL LICs. Moreover, lack of beta-Arrestin1 enhanced the expression of proteins (CBX, HIRA) and genes (P53, P16) related to senescence in leukemic Reh cells and B-ALL-LICs-derived leukemic mice. Further results showed that loss of beta-Arrestin1 induced senescence of Reh cells through mediating hTERT-telomerase-telomere axis, which was reversed by BIBR1532, the telomerase activity inhibitor. Importantly, depletion of beta-Arrestin1 decreased the binding of Sp1 to hTERT promoter at the region of -28 to -36 bp. The anti-sense oligonucleotide of this key region downregulated the transcription of hTERT and aggravated the senescence of Reh cells. Further data demonstrated that the depleted beta-Arrestin1 reduced the interaction of P300 with Sp1, thus to reduce Sp1 binding to hTERT promoter, downregulate hTERT transcription, decrease telomerase activity, shorten telomere length, and promote Reh cell senescence. Interestingly, the percentage of senile cells in B-ALL LICs was decreased, which was negatively correlated to good prognosis and beta-Arrestin1 mRNA expression in childhood B-ALL patients. Our study shed a light on the senescence of B-ALL LICs and is regulated by beta-Arrestin1, providing the potential therapeutic target of leukemia by promoting cellular senescence with a key region of hTERT promoter.","['Liu, Shan', 'Liu, Haiyan', 'Qin, Ru', 'Shu, Yi', 'Liu, Zhidai', 'Zhang, Penghui', 'Duan, Caiwen', 'Hong, Dengli', 'Yu, Jie', 'Zou, Lin']","['Liu S', 'Liu H', 'Qin R', 'Shu Y', 'Liu Z', 'Zhang P', 'Duan C', 'Hong D', 'Yu J', 'Zou L']","[""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical Universtiy, Chongqing 400014, China."", 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing 400014, China.', ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical Universtiy, Chongqing 400014, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing 400014, China.', ""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical Universtiy, Chongqing 400014, China."", 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing 400014, China.', ""Center for Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical Universtiy, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical Universtiy, Chongqing 400014, China."", 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing 400014, China.', ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical Universtiy, Chongqing 400014, China."", 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing 400014, China.', ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical Universtiy, Chongqing 400014, China."", 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China.', ""Center for Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical Universtiy, Chongqing 400014, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing 400014, China.', ""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical Universtiy, Chongqing 400014, China."", 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing, Chongqing 400014, China.', 'Chongqing Stem Cell Therapy Engineering Technical Research Center, Chongqing 400014, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170420,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC5603829,,,,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017164 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.164 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Apr 20;8(4):e2756. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.164.,,20170929,,"['0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (beta-Arrestin 1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cellular Senescence/*genetics', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Telomerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'beta-Arrestin 1/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tightly connected to their capacity to overcome replicative mortality, it is achieved either by activation of telomerase or an Alternative mechanism of Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT). Disruption of either of these mechanisms has been shown to induce DNA damage signalling leading to senescence or apoptosis. Telomerase inhibitors are considered as potential anticancer drugs but are ineffective for ALT cancers (~15% of all cancers). Withaferin-A (Wi-A), a major constituent of the medicinal plant, Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), has been shown to exert anti-tumour activity. However, its effect on either telomerase or ALT mechanisms has not been investigated. Here, by using isogenic cancer cells with/without telomerase, we found that Wi-A caused stronger cytotoxicity to ALT cells. It was associated with inhibition of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, an established marker of ALT. Comparative analyses of telomerase positive and ALT cells revealed that Wi-A caused stronger telomere dysfunction and upregulation of DNA damage response in ALT cells. Molecular computational and experimental analyses revealed that Wi-A led to Myc-Mad mediated transcriptional suppression of NBS-1, an MRN complex protein that is an essential component of the ALT mechanism. The results suggest that Wi-A could be a new candidate drug for ALT cancers.","['Yu, Yue', 'Katiyar, Shashank P', 'Sundar, Durai', 'Kaul, Zeenia', 'Miyako, Eijiro', 'Zhang, Zhenya', 'Kaul, Sunil C', 'Reddel, Roger R', 'Wadhwa, Renu']","['Yu Y', 'Katiyar SP', 'Sundar D', 'Kaul Z', 'Miyako E', 'Zhang Z', 'Kaul SC', 'Reddel RR', 'Wadhwa R']","['DAILAB, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST), Tsukuba 305 8565, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba 305 8572, Japan.', 'DAILAB, Department of Biochemical Engineering & Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, New Delhi 110 016, India.', 'DAILAB, Department of Biochemical Engineering & Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, New Delhi 110 016, India.', ""Cancer Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, NSW 2145, Australia."", 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology & Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Ohio 43210, USA.', 'Nanomaterial Research Institute, AIST, Tsukuba 305 8565, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba 305 8572, Japan.', 'DAILAB, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST), Tsukuba 305 8565, Japan.', ""Cancer Research Unit, Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, NSW 2145, Australia."", 'DAILAB, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST), Tsukuba 305 8565, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170420,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC5477593,,,,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201733 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.33 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Apr 20;8(4):e2755. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.33.,,20170929,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6302-6107'],"['0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Withanolides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'L6DO3QW4K5 (withaferin A)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/metabolism', 'Telomere Homeostasis/drug effects', 'Withanolides/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EBV expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response to uncontrolled proliferation. The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates NFkappaB and is critical for survival of EBV-immortalized B cells. However, during early infection EBV induces rapid B cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis. Therefore, we sought to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1/NFkappaB early after infection. We used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected B cells (BCL-2) to early-infected (MCL-1/BCL-2) and immortalized cells (BFL-1). This dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein. This study defines a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis with implications for EBV lymphomagenesis.","['Price, Alexander M', 'Dai, Joanne', 'Bazot, Quentin', 'Patel, Luv', 'Nikitin, Pavel A', 'Djavadian, Reza', 'Winter, Peter S', 'Salinas, Cristina A', 'Barry, Ashley Perkins', 'Wood, Kris C', 'Johannsen, Eric C', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Allday, Martin J', 'Luftig, Micah A']","['Price AM', 'Dai J', 'Bazot Q', 'Patel L', 'Nikitin PA', 'Djavadian R', 'Winter PS', 'Salinas CA', 'Barry AP', 'Wood KC', 'Johannsen EC', 'Letai A', 'Allday MJ', 'Luftig MA']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Virology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Virology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, United States.', 'Molecular Virology, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Virology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, United States.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, United States.', 'Program in Genetics and Genomics, Duke University, Durham, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Virology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Virology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, United States.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, United States.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.', 'Molecular Virology, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Virology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170420,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,PMC5425254,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell', '*BH3 Profiling', '*Epstein-Barr virus', '*apoptosis', '*cancer biology', '*enhancer', '*human', '*infectious disease', '*microbiology', '*virus']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.7554/eLife.22509 [doi]'],epublish,Elife. 2017 Apr 20;6. doi: 10.7554/eLife.22509.,,20180205,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4654-4604', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9879-4704', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2964-1907']","['0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (EBNA-3A antigen)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology/*virology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']","['099273/Z/12/Z /Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA140337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE025994/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI078985/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI064518/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA022443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, deregulation of Dnmt3b is thought to generally promote tumorigenesis. However, the role of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in many types of cancer remains undefined. Here, we show that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are dispensable for homeostasis of the murine epidermis. However, loss of Dnmt3a-but not Dnmt3b-increases the number of carcinogen-induced squamous tumors, without affecting tumor progression. Only upon combined deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, squamous carcinomas become more aggressive and metastatic. Mechanistically, Dnmt3a promotes the expression of epidermal differentiation genes by interacting with their enhancers and inhibits the expression of lipid metabolism genes, including PPAR-gamma, by directly methylating their promoters. Importantly, inhibition of PPAR-gamma partially prevents the increase in tumorigenesis upon deletion of Dnmt3a. Altogether, we demonstrate that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b protect the epidermis from tumorigenesis and that squamous carcinomas are sensitive to inhibition of PPAR-gamma.","['Rinaldi, Lorenzo', 'Avgustinova, Alexandra', 'Martin, Merce', 'Datta, Debayan', 'Solanas, Guiomar', 'Prats, Neus', 'Benitah, Salvador Aznar']","['Rinaldi L', 'Avgustinova A', 'Martin M', 'Datta D', 'Solanas G', 'Prats N', 'Benitah SA']","['Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre for Genomic Regulation, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170420,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,PMC5429093,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*PPARg', '*cancer biology', '*developmental biology', '*enhancers', '*mouse', '*promoters', '*squamous cell carcinomas', '*stem cells', '*transcriptional regulation']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.21697 [doi]', '21697 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2017 Apr 20;6. pii: 21697. doi: 10.7554/eLife.21697.,,20180205,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9059-5049'],"['0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*physiopathology', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Epidermis/*physiology', '*Homeostasis', 'Mice', 'PPAR gamma/*metabolism']",['10-0050/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing the level of residual structure in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which are overrepresented in these cellular processes, has been shown previously to enhance binding affinities and alter cellular function. Conserved proline residues are commonly found flanking regions of IDPs that become helical upon interacting with a partner protein. Here, we mutate these helix-flanking prolines in p53 and MLL and find opposite effects on binding affinity upon an increase in free IDP helicity. In both cases, changes in affinity were due to alterations in dissociation, not association, rate constants, which is inconsistent with conformational selection mechanisms. We conclude that, contrary to previous suggestions, helix-flanking prolines do not regulate affinity by modulating the rate of complex formation. Instead, they influence binding affinities by controlling the lifetime of the bound complex.","['Crabtree, Michael D', 'Borcherds, Wade', 'Poosapati, Anusha', 'Shammas, Sarah L', 'Daughdrill, Gary W', 'Clarke, Jane']","['Crabtree MD', 'Borcherds W', 'Poosapati A', 'Shammas SL', 'Daughdrill GW', 'Clarke J']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge , Cambridge CB2 1EW, U.K.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida , Tampa, Florida 33620, United States.', 'Florida Center for Drug Discovery and Innovation, University of South Florida , Tampa, Florida 33612, United States.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida , Tampa, Florida 33620, United States.', 'Florida Center for Drug Discovery and Innovation, University of South Florida , Tampa, Florida 33612, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge , Cambridge CB2 1EW, U.K.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida , Tampa, Florida 33620, United States.', 'Florida Center for Drug Discovery and Innovation, University of South Florida , Tampa, Florida 33612, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge , Cambridge CB2 1EW, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170426,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,PMC5467178,,,,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/06/16 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00179 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2017 May 9;56(18):2379-2384. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00179.

Polycomb group expression plays an important role in oncogenesis of several types of human cancer. Melanoma nuclear protein 18 and B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus insert site 1 are key Polycomb group proteins. Studies have shown that melanoma nuclear protein 18 is a potential tumor suppression, and B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus insert site 1 is overexpressed in several human malignancies. However, the roles of melanoma nuclear protein 18 and B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus insert site 1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the expression levels of melanoma nuclear protein 18 and B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus insert site 1 in 89 esophageal cancer tissues and paired normal mucosal tissues using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. We found that the expression of melanoma nuclear protein 18 in the carcinoma tissues was significantly lower than that in the noncancerous mucosal tissues (P < .05), and B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus insert site 1 expression in the carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that in the noncancerous mucosal tissues (P < .05). In addition, the expression of melanoma nuclear protein 18 was correlated with clinical stage, depth of invasion, and lymph node metastasis (P < .05) but was not correlated with gender, age, degree of differentiation, or disease-free survival (P > .05). B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus insert site 1 expression was strongly correlated with the degree of differentiation, clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis (P <.05) but was not correlated with the gender, age, depth of invasion or disease-free survival (P > .05). Moreover, there was a negative correlation between melanoma nuclear protein 18 and B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus insert site 1 expressions in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (P < .05). Our study suggests that melanoma nuclear protein 18 and B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus insert site 1 may play a crucial role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Melanoma nuclear protein 18 or B-cell-specific Moloney leukemia virus insert site 1 may be a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","['Ji, Huaijun', 'Cao, Ming', 'Ren, Kunlun', 'Sun, Ningbo', 'Wang, Wei', 'Zhu, Qiang', 'Zang, Qi', 'Jiang, Zhongmin']","['Ji H', 'Cao M', 'Ren K', 'Sun N', 'Wang W', 'Zhu Q', 'Zang Q', 'Jiang Z']","[""Division of Surgery, Graduate Department, Weifang Medical College, Weifang, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Qianfoshan Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Division of Surgery, Graduate Department, Weifang Medical College, Weifang, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Shengli Oilfield Central Hospital, Dongying, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Qianfoshan Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Qianfoshan Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Qianfoshan Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Qianfoshan Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170420,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,PMC5762038,['NOTNLM'],"['Bmi-1', 'Mel-18', 'Polycomb group protein', 'Western blot', 'esophageal squamous cell carcinoma', 'immunohistochemistry', 'real-time PCR']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/04/21 06:01,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/21 06:01 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1533034617705055 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2017 Dec;16(6):828-834. doi: 10.1177/1533034617705055.

These side effects will need to be reduced or avoided if retroviral vectors are to be used clinically for HIV-1 treatment. The addition of chromatin insulators to retroviral vectors is a potential strategy for reducing adverse side effects. Insulators have already been effectively used in retroviral vectors to reduce genotoxicity in pre-clinical studies.

Investigation of molecular changes may help clarify the reasons for the heterogeneity of the disease. Apart from already confirmed TP53 mutations, the novel candidates: NOTCH1, SF3B1, and MYD88 might represent clinically relevant biomarkers. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the mutational status of NOTCH1, MYD88, and SF3B1 and to compare the results with confirmed prognostic factors: ZAP70, CD38, and immunoglobulin heavychain variable region (IGHV) mutation in CLL. The study assessed also prognostic significance in terms of the time to first treatment (TTFT) and subset analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study was conducted on samples of 370 newly diagnosed patients with CLL. The analysis was performed using highresolution melting, Sanger sequencing, and polymerase chain reaction methods. RESULTS Patients harboring the NOTCH1 mutation were significantly more often found among patients with an unmutated IGHV gene status and high expression of CD38 and ZAP70. The MYD88 mutation was equally distributed in patients with mutated and unmutated IGHV status (5 vs 7 patients). For MYD88 and SF3B1, there were no significant differences in the levels of CD38 and ZAP70 expression. The tendency for lower median TTFT was revealed in patients with mutated SF3B1 (P = 0.08). The analysis showed the presence of 14 different types of the subsets of IGHV in 50 of 345 patients (14.5%). The most frequent were subsets #1 and #2. CONCLUSIONS The NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations accompany biological markers of unfavorable prognosis in patients with CLL. The mutations may contribute to the identification of patients with highrisk CLL.","['Putowski, Maciej', 'Podgorniak, Marta', 'Pirog, Marta', 'Knap, Joanna', 'Zaleska, Joanna', 'Purkot, Joanna', 'Zawislak, Jacek', 'Zakrzewska, Ewelina', 'Karczmarczyk, Agnieszka', 'Wlasiuk, Paulina', 'Subocz, Edyta', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof']","['Putowski M', 'Podgorniak M', 'Pirog M', 'Knap J', 'Zaleska J', 'Purkot J', 'Zawislak J', 'Zakrzewska E', 'Karczmarczyk A', 'Wlasiuk P', 'Subocz E', 'Giannopoulos K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170420,Poland,Pol Arch Intern Med,Polish archives of internal medicine,101700960,,,,,2017/04/21 06:00,2019/01/01 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.20452/pamw.3998 [doi]'],ppublish,Pol Arch Intern Med. 2017 Apr 28;127(4):238-244. doi: 10.20452/pamw.3998.

Here, we utilized small RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses to characterize miRNA expression profiles in the liver of domestic cats at 7 days after oral infection with T. gondii (Type II) strain. A total of 384 miRNAs were identified and 82 were differentially expressed, of which 33 were up-regulated and 49 down-regulated. Also, 5690 predicted host gene targets for the differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using the bioinformatic algorithm miRanda. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the predicted gene targets of the dysregulated miRNAs were significantly enriched in apoptosis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the predicted gene targets were involved in several pathways, including acute myeloid leukemia, central carbon metabolism in cancer, choline metabolism in cancer, estrogen signaling pathway, fatty acid degradation, lysosome, nucleotide excision repair, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and VEGF signaling pathway. The expression level of 6 upregulated miRNAs (mmu-miR-21a-5p, mmu-miR-20a-5p, mmu-miR-17-5p, mmu-miR-30e-3p, mmu-miR-142a-3p, and mmu-miR-106b-3p) was confirmed by stem-loop quantitative reverse transcription PCR, which yielded results consistent with the sequencing data. These findings expand our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs underlying T. gondii pathogenesis and contribute new database information on cat miRNAs, opening a new perspective on the prevention and treatment of T. gondii infection.","['Cong, Wei', 'Zhang, Xiao-Xuan', 'He, Jun-Jun', 'Li, Fa-Cai', 'Elsheikha, Hany M', 'Zhu, Xing-Quan']","['Cong W', 'Zhang XX', 'He JJ', 'Li FC', 'Elsheikha HM', 'Zhu XQ']","['State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province 730046, PR China.', 'College of Marine Science, Shandong University at Weihai, Weihai, Shandong Province 264209, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province 730046, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province 730046, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province 730046, PR China.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough, LE12 5RD, UK.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu Province 730046, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5421954,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA-seq', 'Toxoplasma gondii', 'domestic cat', 'liver', 'mircoRNA']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['16108 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16108 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 11;8(15):25599-25611. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16108.,,20180305,,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Domestic', 'Cats', 'Computational Biology/methods', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Ontology', 'Host-Parasite Interactions/*genetics', 'Liver/*metabolism/*parasitology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Toxoplasmosis, Animal/*genetics/*parasitology', '*Transcriptome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although thyroid hormone receptor interactors (TRIPs) are known to play roles in cell cycle, the potential involvement of the novel family member TRIP13 in CLL has not yet been investigated. METHODS: Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to detect expression of TRIP13 in 36 CLL patients and 33 healthy donors CD19+ B cells. Loss-of-function (siRNA) assays were used to alter TRIP13 expression levels. The effect of TRIP13 on cell proliferation and apoptosis was measured by MTT, Annexin V-based flow cytometry and Caspase 3/7 activity assay. Affymetrix GeneChip and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were used to describe an overview of TRIP13 potential biological function and downstream pathways. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to assess the promoting effect of c-MYC on TRIP13 transcription. RESULTS: The qPCR data showed that TRIP13 is significantly over-expressed in CLL patients. Microarray analyses indicated that the biological function of TRIP13 in CLL is majorly cell apoptosis and cell proliferation associated. TRIP13 siRNA expressing cells exhibited a slower cell proliferation rate and underwent apoptosis compared with control cells. TRIP13 knockdown induced CLL cells apoptosis through PUMA independent of p53. TRIP13 up-regulation is induced by c-MYC dependent transcriptional activation. CONCLUSION: Overall, our data suggest the bio-function of TRIP13 in CLL cell for the first time, and that this gene might be a therapeutic target for CLL.","['Zhou, Keshu', 'Zhang, Wentao', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Gui, Ruirui', 'Zhao, Huifang', 'Chai, Xiaofei', 'Li, Yufu', 'Wei, Xudong', 'Song, Yongping']","['Zhou K', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang Q', 'Gui R', 'Zhao H', 'Chai X', 'Li Y', 'Wei X', 'Song Y']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Armed Police Forces Hospital of Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5421944,['NOTNLM'],"['PUMA', 'TRIP13', 'apoptosis', 'c-MYC', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2018/04/11 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['16038 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16038 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 11;8(15):25469-25481. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16038.,,20180410,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (TRIP13 protein, human)']",IM,"['ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we studied the clinicopathological features and outcome of 212 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed CLL in Hong Kong and Singapore. The median age at diagnosis was 64 years. The majority of patients presented with early-stage disease (Binet stage A, 56.1%). Del(13)(q14) was the most frequent abnormality (41.7%) detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Del(17p) and TP53 gene mutations were detected in 7.8% and 8.2% of patients, respectively. MYD88 mutations were found at a higher frequency (11.5%) than expected. CLL with unmutated variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IGHV) occurred in only 31.2% of cases, and was associated with advanced-stage disease (p <0.01) and adverse FISH abnormalities (p<0.01). With a median follow-up of 39 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 108 months. The presence of del(17p) or TP53 mutations was associated with a significantly shorter time to first treatment and an inferior OS (p <0.01). Unmutated IGHV was also associated with a significantly shorter time to treatment (p <0.01). Among patients who required treatment, the median OS and progression-free survival (PFS) were 107 and 23 months, respectively. The presence of del(17p) was associated with a significantly inferior OS and PFS (p <0.01). In summary, Chinese CLL patients had similar genetic aberrations at diagnosis compared with those of Western populations.

Asparagine deprivation by L-asparaginase exacerbated growth inhibition induced by glutamine starvation and autophagy blockage.

However, the precise mechanism of action of the drug remains to be fully elucidated. Tumor-infiltrating macrophages presented in the tumor microenvironment have been shown to promote development and progression of B-cell lymphomas through crosstalk mediated by secreted cytokines and chemokines. Because Btk has been implicated in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways that regulate macrophage activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects of Btk inhibitor on macrophages. Our results demonstrate that Btk inhibition efficiently suppresses production of CXCL12, CXCL13, CCL19, and VEGF by macrophages. Furthermore, attenuated secretion of homeostatic chemokines from Btk inhibitor-treated macrophages significantly compromise adhesion, invasion, and migration of lymphoid malignant cells and even those not driven by Btk expression. The supernatants from Btk inhibitor-treated macrophages also impair the ability of endothelial cells to undergo angiogenic tube formation. Mechanistic analysis revealed that Btk inhibitors treatment downregulates secretion of homeostatic chemokines and cytokines through inactivation of Btk signaling and the downstream transcription factors, NF-kappaB, STAT3, and AP-1. Taken together, these results suggest that the encouraging therapeutic efficacy of Btk inhibitor may be due to both direct cytotoxic effects on malignant B cells and immunomodulatory effects on macrophages present in the tumor microenvironment. This novel mechanism of action suggests that, in addition to B-cell lymphomas, Btk inhibitor may also have therapeutic value in lymphatic malignancies and solid tumors lacking Btk expression.","['Ping, Lingyan', 'Ding, Ning', 'Shi, Yunfei', 'Feng, Lixia', 'Li, Jiao', 'Liu, Yalu', 'Lin, Yufu', 'Shi, Cunzhen', 'Wang, Xing', 'Pan, Zhengying', 'Song, Yuqin', 'Zhu, Jun']","['Ping L', 'Ding N', 'Shi Y', 'Feng L', 'Li J', 'Liu Y', 'Lin Y', 'Shi C', 'Wang X', 'Pan Z', 'Song Y', 'Zhu J']","['Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Pathology, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Chemical Genomics, School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen University Town, Xili, Shenzhen 518055, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5503608,['NOTNLM'],"['Btk', 'ibrutinib', 'immunomodulatory effect', 'macrophages']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2018/06/08 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['16836 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16836 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 13;8(24):39218-39229. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16836.,,20180607,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GCs work by activating the GC receptor (GR), a ligand-induced transcription factor, which in turn regulates genes that induce leukemic cell death. Which GR-regulated genes are required for GC cytotoxicity, which pathways affect their regulation, and how resistance arises are not well understood. Here, we systematically integrate the transcriptional response of B-ALL to GCs with a next-generation short hairpin RNA screen to identify GC-regulated ""effector"" genes that contribute to cell death, as well as genes that affect the sensitivity of B-ALL cells to dex. This analysis reveals a pervasive role for GCs in suppression of B-cell development genes that is linked to therapeutic response. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta), a linchpin in the pre-B-cell receptor and interleukin 7 receptor signaling pathways critical to B-cell development (with CAL-101 [idelalisib]), interrupts a double-negative feedback loop, enhancing GC-regulated transcription to synergistically kill even highly resistant B-ALL with diverse genetic backgrounds. This work not only identifies numerous opportunities for enhanced lymphoid-specific combination chemotherapies that have the potential to overcome treatment resistance, but is also a valuable resource for understanding GC biology and the mechanistic details of GR-regulated transcription.","['Kruth, Karina A', 'Fang, Mimi', 'Shelton, Dawne N', 'Abu-Halawa, Ossama', 'Mahling, Ryan', 'Yang, Hongxing', 'Weissman, Jonathan S', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Tasian, Sarah K', 'Bassik, Michael C', 'Kampmann, Martin', 'Pufall, Miles A']","['Kruth KA', 'Fang M', 'Shelton DN', 'Abu-Halawa O', 'Mahling R', 'Yang H', 'Weissman JS', 'Loh ML', 'Muschen M', 'Tasian SK', 'Bassik MC', 'Kampmann M', 'Pufall MA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.', 'Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa Health Care, Iowa City, IA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.', 'Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa Health Care, Iowa City, IA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.', 'Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa Health Care, Iowa City, IA.', 'Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.', 'Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa Health Care, Iowa City, IA.', 'Coe College, Cedar Rapids, IA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.', 'Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa Health Care, Iowa City, IA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.', 'Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa Health Care, Iowa City, IA.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, CA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital and."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCSF, San Francisco, CA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital and."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCSF, San Francisco, CA.', ""Division of Oncology, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Genetics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics.', 'Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, and.', 'Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, UCSF, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA.', 'Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa Health Care, Iowa City, IA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170419,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC5454339,,,,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/08/23 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33341-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-02-766204 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jun 1;129(22):3000-3008. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-02-766204.

The relationship between these cytopenias and myeloid neoplasms like myelodysplastic syndromes is currently poorly defined. We studied a prospective cohort of patients with unexplained cytopenia with the aim to estimate the predictive value of somatic mutations for identifying subjects with, or at risk of, developing a myeloid neoplasm. The study included a learning cohort of 683 consecutive patients investigated for unexplained cytopenia, and a validation cohort of 190 patients referred for suspected myeloid neoplasm. Using granulocyte DNA, we looked for somatic mutations in 40 genes that are recurrently mutated in myeloid malignancies. Overall, 435/683 patients carried a somatic mutation in at least 1 of these genes. Carrying a somatic mutation with a variant allele frequency >/=0.10, or carrying 2 or more mutations, had a positive predictive value for diagnosis of myeloid neoplasm equal to 0.86 and 0.88, respectively. Spliceosome gene mutations and comutation patterns involving TET2, DNMT3A, or ASXL1 had positive predictive values for myeloid neoplasm ranging from 0.86 to 1.0. Within subjects with inconclusive diagnostic findings, carrying 1 or more somatic mutations was associated with a high probability of developing a myeloid neoplasm during follow-up (hazard ratio = 13.9, P < .001). The predictive values of mutation analysis were confirmed in the independent validation cohort. The findings of this study indicate that mutation analysis on peripheral blood granulocytes may significantly improve the current diagnostic approach to unexplained cytopenia and more generally the diagnostic accuracy of myeloid neoplasms.","['Malcovati, Luca', 'Galli, Anna', 'Travaglino, Erica', 'Ambaglio, Ilaria', 'Rizzo, Ettore', 'Molteni, Elisabetta', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Ferretti, Virginia Valeria', 'Catricala, Silvia', 'Bono, Elisa', 'Todisco, Gabriele', 'Bianchessi, Antonio', 'Rumi, Elisa', 'Zibellini, Silvia', 'Pietra, Daniela', 'Boveri, Emanuela', 'Camaschella, Clara', 'Toniolo, Daniela', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Cazzola, Mario']","['Malcovati L', 'Galli A', 'Travaglino E', 'Ambaglio I', 'Rizzo E', 'Molteni E', 'Elena C', 'Ferretti VV', 'Catricala S', 'Bono E', 'Todisco G', 'Bianchessi A', 'Rumi E', 'Zibellini S', 'Pietra D', 'Boveri E', 'Camaschella C', 'Toniolo D', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Ogawa S', 'Cazzola M']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'enGenome s.r.l., Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Genetics and Cell Biology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Vita Salute University, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Genetics and Cell Biology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Molecular Oncology and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170419,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC5542849,,,,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33284-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-01-763425 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jun 22;129(25):3371-3378. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-01-763425.

Preclinical studies suggest that programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway is critical to inhibit immune surveillance in CLL. This phase 2 study was designed to test the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab, a humanized PD-1-blocking antibody, at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks in relapsed and transformed CLL. Twenty-five patients including 16 relapsed CLL and 9 RT (all proven diffuse large cell lymphoma) patients were enrolled, and 60% received prior ibrutinib. Objective responses were observed in 4 out of 9 RT patients (44%) and in 0 out of 16 CLL patients (0%). All responses were observed in RT patients who had progression after prior therapy with ibrutinib. After a median follow-up time of 11 months, the median overall survival in the RT cohort was 10.7 months, but was not reached in RT patients who progressed after prior ibrutinib. Treatment-related grade 3 or above adverse events were reported in 15 (60%) patients and were manageable. Analyses of pretreatment tumor specimens from available patients revealed increased expression of PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and a trend of increased expression in PD-1 in the tumor microenvironment in patients who had confirmed responses. Overall, pembrolizumab exhibited selective efficacy in CLL patients with RT. The results of this study are the first to demonstrate the benefit of PD-1 blockade in CLL patients with RT, and could change the landscape of therapy for RT patients if further validated.

In a recently reported phase 2 study, midostaurin, a multikinase/KIT inhibitor, demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 60% in advSM but biomarkers predictive of response are lacking. We evaluated the impact of molecular markers at baseline and during follow-up in 38 midostaurin-treated advSM patients. The median overall survival (OS) was 30 months (95% confidence interval, 6-54) from start of midostaurin. ORR and OS were significantly different between S/A/R(neg) (n = 12) and S/A/R(pos) (n = 23) patients (ORR: 75% vs 39%, P = .04; OS: P = .01, HR 4.5 [1.3-16.2]). Depending on the relative reduction of the KIT D816V expressed allele burden (EAB) at month 6, patients were classified as KIT responders (>/=25%, n = 17) or KIT nonresponders (<25%, n = 11). In univariate analyses at month 6, reduction of KIT D816V EAB >/=25%, tryptase >/=50%, and alkaline phosphatase >/=50% were significantly associated with improved OS.

In addition to its antileukemic effects, dasatinib was shown to impact on normal hematopoiesis and cells of the immune system.Due to the fact that the murine in vivo studies so far have not been performed in a chronic-phase CML model under steady-state conditions, our aim was to study the hematopoietic effects of dasatinib (20 mg/kg p.o.) in BCR-ABL expressing SCLtTAxBCR-ABL double transgenic (dtg) mice. Dasatinib robustly antagonized the CML phenotype in vivo in our transgenic mouse model, and this effect included both mature and immature cell populations. However, similar to patients with CML, the fraction of LinnegSca-1+KIT+CD48negCD150+ hematopoietic stem cells was not reduced by dasatinib treatment, suggesting that these cells are not oncogene-addicted. Moreover, we observed differential effects of dasatinib in these animals as compared to wild-type (wt) animals: while granulocytes were significantly reduced in dtg animals, they were increased in wt mice. And Ter119+ erythrocytic and B220+ B cells were increased in dtg mice but decreased in wt mice. Finally, while dasatinib induced a shift from CD49b/NK1.1 positive NK cells from the bone marrow to the spleen in wt animals, there was no change in dtg mice. In conclusion, the present mouse model provides a useful tool to study mechanisms of TKI resistance and dasatinib-associated beneficial effects and adverse events.","['Schubert, Claudia', 'Chatain, Nicolas', 'Braunschweig, Till', 'Schemionek, Mirle', 'Feldberg, Kristina', 'Hoffmann, Melanie', 'Dufva, Olli', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Koschmieder, Steffen']","['Schubert C', 'Chatain N', 'Braunschweig T', 'Schemionek M', 'Feldberg K', 'Hoffmann M', 'Dufva O', 'Mustjoki S', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Koschmieder S']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5471007,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'CML', 'dasatinib', 'mouse model', 'transgenic']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['16152 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16152 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 23;8(21):34736-34749. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16152.,,20180309,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dasatinib/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the KOPN-8 ALL xenograft, Moxe or paclitaxel alone was active, but all mice died from leukemia; when combined, 60% of the mice achieved a sustained complete remission. Against MCL cells in vitro, LR was more active than Moxe and the cells had to be exposed to rIT for more than 24 hours for them to die. To maintain high blood levels in vivo, LR was administered continuously by 7-day pumps achieving a well-tolerated steady plasma concentration of 45 ng/ml. In JeKo-1 xenografts, continuously administered LR was 14-fold more active than bolus doses and the combination with paclitaxel additionally improved responses by 135-fold. Maintaining high rIT-plasma levels greatly improves responses in the JeKo-1 model and paclitaxel substantially enhances bolus and continuously infused rIT, supporting a clinical evaluation against B-cell malignancies.","['Muller, Fabian', 'Stookey, Stephanie', 'Cunningham, Tyler', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Muller F', 'Stookey S', 'Cunningham T', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'MD Program, University of North Caroline, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'MD/PhD Program, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5458156,['NOTNLM'],"['CD22-targeted immunotoxin', 'combination therapy', 'mantle cell lymphoma', 'paclitaxel', 'targeted therapy']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['16141 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16141 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 9;8(19):30644-30655. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16141.,,20180305,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '2NDX4B6N8F (immunotoxin HA22)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bacterial Toxins/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Exotoxins/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism by which intracellular calcium homeostasis participates in dexamethasone sensitivity and resistance on ALL cells remains elusive. Here, we found that treatment of cells with dexamethasone resulted in increased intracellular calcium concentrations through store-operated calcium entry stimulation, which was curtailed by store-operated calcium channel blockers. We show that BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, synergistically enhances dexamethasone lethality in two human ALL cell lines and in three primary specimens. This effect correlated with the inhibition of the prosurvival kinase ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Chelating intracellular calcium with Bapta-AM or inhibiting ERK1/2 with PD98059 significantly potentiated dexamethasone-induced mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, reactive oxygen species production, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activity, and cell death. Moreover, we show that thapsigargin elevates intracellular free calcium ion level, and activates ERK1/2 signaling, resulting in the inhibition of dexamethasone-induced ALL cells apoptosis. Together, these results indicate that calcium-related ERK1/2 signaling pathway contributes to protect cells from dexamethasone sensitivity by limiting mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This report provides a novel resistance pathway underlying the regulatory effect of dexamethasone on ALL cells.","['Abdoul-Azize, Souleymane', 'Dubus, Isabelle', 'Vannier, Jean-Pierre']","['Abdoul-Azize S', 'Dubus I', 'Vannier JP']","['Micro-Environnement et Renouvellement Cellulaire Integre, MERCI UPRES EA 3829, Faculte de Medecine et Pharmacie, Universite de Rouen, 76183 Rouen Cedex, France.', 'Current address: Unite Inserm U1234/Universite de Rouen/IRIB, Rouen, France.', 'Micro-Environnement et Renouvellement Cellulaire Integre, MERCI UPRES EA 3829, Faculte de Medecine et Pharmacie, Universite de Rouen, 76183 Rouen Cedex, France.', 'Current address: Unite Inserm U1234/Universite de Rouen/IRIB, Rouen, France.', 'Micro-Environnement et Renouvellement Cellulaire Integre, MERCI UPRES EA 3829, Faculte de Medecine et Pharmacie, Universite de Rouen, 76183 Rouen Cedex, France.', 'Service Immuno-Hemato-Oncologie Pediatrique, CHU Charles Nicolle, 76031 ROUEN Cedex, France.', 'Current address: Unite Inserm U1234/Universite de Rouen/IRIB, Rouen, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5432339,['NOTNLM'],"['Ca2+ signaling', 'ERK1/2 pathway', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'dexamethasone']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['16039 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16039 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 18;8(16):27339-27352. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16039.,,20180305,,"['0 (Calcium Chelating Agents)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Chelating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that Mcl-1's regulation of chemotherapy-induced senescence (CIS) is dependent on its ability to prevent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In this report, we demonstrate that Mcl-1-regulated CIS requires not only ROS, but specifically mitochondrial ROS, and that these events are upstream of activation of the DNA damage response, another necessary step toward senescence. Mcl-1's anti-senescence activity also involves the unique ability to inhibit ROS formation by preventing the upregulation of pro-oxidants. Specifically, we found that NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are regulated by Mcl-1 and that NOX4 expression in particular is a required step for CIS induction that is blocked by Mcl-1. Lastly, we illustrate that by preventing expression of NOX4, Mcl-1 limits its availability in the mitochondria, thereby lowering the production of mitochondrial ROS during CIS. Our studies not only define the essential role of Mcl-1 in chemoresistance, but also for the first time link a key pro-survival Bcl-2 family member with the NOX protein family, both of which have significant ramifications in cancer progression.","['Demelash, Abeba', 'Pfannenstiel, Lukas W', 'Liu, Li', 'Gastman, Brian R']","['Demelash A', 'Pfannenstiel LW', 'Liu L', 'Gastman BR']","['Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Institutes of Head and Neck, Dermatology and Plastic Surgery, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5438639,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'NOX4', 'cancer therapy', 'reactive oxygen species', 'senescence']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['15962 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15962 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 25;8(17):28154-28168. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15962.,,20180305,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 4)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cellular Senescence/*drug effects/*genetics', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidase 4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",['R01 CA132796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro anti-leukemia activity of Stellettin B (Stel B), a triterpenoid we isolated from marine sponge Jaspis stellifera, on human CML K562 and KU812 cells was recently investigated. Stel B inhibited K562 and KU812 cell proliferation with IC50 as 0.035 muM and 0.95 muM respectively. While no obvious cell cycle arrest was observed, apoptosis was induced in K562 cells after Stel B treatment. The Stel B-induced apoptosis might be in mitochondrial pathway, with increase of Bad and Bax, decrease of Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-9. In addition, dose-dependent increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) occurred. Meanwhile, Stel B inhibited phosphorylation of Stat5, expression of 4 PI3K catalytic isoforms, and phosphorylation of the downstream effectors including PDK1 and Akt, suggesting that inhibition against Stat5 and PI3K might be involved in the apoptosis-inducing effect. Combination of Stel B with Imatinib with ratio as IC50 Stel B : 5xIC50 Imatinib led to synergistic effect.

However, the role of EMPs remains unclear. We found that EMPs derived from TNF-alpha-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EA.hy926) concentrated more microRNA-155 (miR-155) compared with maternal cells. The miR-155 levels in MPs from peripheral blood of aGVHD patients and mice were remarkably elevated and significantly higher than the levels in plasma. Moreover, the rising peak of miR-155 in MPs occurred significantly prior to the peak in T lymphocytes. Additionally, we observed fluorescently-labeled miR-155 in EMPs actively transported into recipient T lymphocytes. Inhibition of miR-155 in EMPs by antagomir-155 did not influence the proliferation and apoptosis of T lymphocytes, but induced defective differentiation toward Th1, Th9 and Th17 cells and skewed differentiation toward Th2 and Treg cells. Furthermore, intravenous injection of miR-155-deficient-EMPs into aGVHD mice significantly attenuated the exacerbation of aGVHD manifestations and abnormal T lymphocytes differentiation induced by high concentration EMPs. Taken together, these data provide a mechanistic framework in which miR-155 delivered by EMPs is involved in aGVHD pathogenesis by activating specific T lymphocytes functions. The results may provide new therapeutic approaches for aGVHD while preserving graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect.","['Zhang, Ran', 'Wang, Xiaoxiao', 'Hong, Mei', 'Luo, Ting', 'Zhao, Miaomiao', 'Shen, Haorui', 'Fang, Jun', 'Li, Xiaojie', 'Zang, Sibin', 'Chen, Ping', 'Nie, Dimin', 'Zheng, Peng', 'Wu, Qiuling', 'Xia, Linghui']","['Zhang R', 'Wang X', 'Hong M', 'Luo T', 'Zhao M', 'Shen H', 'Fang J', 'Li X', 'Zang S', 'Chen P', 'Nie D', 'Zheng P', 'Wu Q', 'Xia L']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5410310,['NOTNLM'],"['T lymphocytes', 'acute graft-versus-host disease', 'differentiation', 'endothelial microparticles', 'microRNA-155']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['15579 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15579 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 4;8(14):23360-23375. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15579.,,20171128,,"['0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn155 microRNA, mouse)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/*etiology/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/methods', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,['Oncotarget. 2017 Aug 28;8(35):60000.

In addition to its oncogenic function, AF1q has been shown to play a role in the onset of basal and drug-induced apoptosis in cancer cells of different histotypes, including ovarian cancer. Through in vitro, ex vivo, and in silico approaches, we demonstrated here that AF1q is also endowed with protumorigenic potential in ovarian cancer. In ovarian cancer cell lines, stable AF1q overexpression caused activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and increased motility/migratory/invasive abilities accompanied by gene expression changes mainly related to Wnt signaling and to signaling pathways involving in ERK/p38 activation. The potential role of AF1q in ovarian cancer progression was confirmed by immunohistochemical and in silico analyses performed in ovarian tumor specimens which revealed that the protein was absent in normal ovarian epithelium and became detectable when atypical proliferation was present. Moreover, AF1q was significantly lower in borderline ovarian tumors (i.e., tumors of low malignant potential without stromal invasion) than in invasive tumors, thus corroborating the association between high AF1q expression and increased migratory/invasive cell behavior and confirming its potential role in ovarian cancer progression. Our findings demonstrated, for the first time, that AF1q is endowed with protumorigenic activity in ovarian cancer, thus highlighting a dual behavior (i.e., protumorigenic and proapoptotic functions) of the protein in the malignancy.","['Tiberio, Paola', 'Lozneanu, Ludmila', 'Angeloni, Valentina', 'Cavadini, Elena', 'Pinciroli, Patrizia', 'Callari, Maurizio', 'Carcangiu, Maria Luisa', 'Lorusso, Domenica', 'Raspagliesi, Francesco', 'Pala, Valentina', 'Daidone, Maria Grazia', 'Appierto, Valentina']","['Tiberio P', 'Lozneanu L', 'Angeloni V', 'Cavadini E', 'Pinciroli P', 'Callari M', 'Carcangiu ML', 'Lorusso D', 'Raspagliesi F', 'Pala V', 'Daidone MG', 'Appierto V']","['Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Biomarkers Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Biomarkers Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Morphofunctional Sciences-Histology, Patology, ""Grigore T.

Therefore, it is urgent to explore the mechanism by which cancer stem cells survive under the treatment of chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin. In this paper, we demonstrated significant decrease of miR-519d in breast cancer stem cells by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Furthermore, we found the enforced expression of miR-519d in T-47D-cancer stem cells significantly increased their sensitivity to cisplatin through the apoptosis pathway. In addition, the gene of MCL-1, which is a member of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, was found to be the target of miR-519d in T-47D-cancer stem cells. Our date demonstrated that enforced miR-519d expression enhanced the cisplatin-induced apoptosis through the MCL-1 dependent mitochondria pathway in breast cancer stem cells. Taken together, the present study suggests that miR-519d reduces chemoresistance in breast cancer stem cells, and understanding of miR-519d may be helpful for increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy.","['Xie, Qing', 'Wang, Shuai', 'Zhao, Yue', 'Zhang, Zhenchao', 'Qin, Chuan', 'Yang, Xianjun']","['Xie Q', 'Wang S', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Qin C', 'Yang X']","['Tumor Signaling and Transduction Lab, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang City, Henan Province, 453003, PR China.', 'Department of Human Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang City, Henan Province, 453003, PR China.', 'Tumor Signaling and Transduction Lab, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang City, Henan Province, 453003, PR China.', 'Department of Human Parasitology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang City, Henan Province, 453003, PR China.', 'Tumor Signaling and Transduction Lab, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang City, Henan Province, 453003, PR China.', 'Tumor Signaling and Transduction Lab, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang City, Henan Province, 453003, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5400641,['NOTNLM'],"['BCSCs', 'MCL-1', 'cisplatin', 'miR-519d', 'resistance']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['15781 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15781 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Mar 28;8(13):22003-22013. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15781.,,20171013,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN519 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently described the small molecule VLX1570 as an inhibitor of proteasome deubiquitinase (DUB) activity that induces proteotoxic stress and apoptosis in cancer cells. Here we show that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are highly sensitive to treatment with VLX1570, resulting in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteasome substrates and loss of cell viability. VLX1570 treatment increased the levels of a number of proteins, including the chaperone HSP70B', the oxidative stress marker heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the cell cycle regulator p21Cip1. Unexpectedly, polybiquitin accumulation was found to be uncoupled from ER stress in ALL cells. Thus, increased phosphorylation of eIF2alpha occurred only at supra-pharmacological VLX1570 concentrations and did not correlate with polybiquitin accumulation. Total cellular protein synthesis was found to decrease in the absence of eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Furthermore, ISRIB (Integrated Stress Response inhibitor) did not overcome the inhibition of protein synthesis. We finally show that VLX1570 can be combined with L-asparaginase for additive or synergistic antiproliferative effects on ALL cells. We conclude that ALL cells are highly sensitive to the proteasome DUB inhibitor VLX1570 suggesting a novel therapeutic option for this disease.","['Mazurkiewicz, Magdalena', 'Hillert, Ellin-Kristina', 'Wang, Xin', 'Pellegrini, Paola', 'Olofsson, Maria Hagg', 'Selvaraju, Karthik', ""D'Arcy, Padraig"", 'Linder, Stig']","['Mazurkiewicz M', 'Hillert EK', 'Wang X', 'Pellegrini P', 'Olofsson MH', 'Selvaraju K', ""D'Arcy P"", 'Linder S']","['Cancer Center Karolinska, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institute, S-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Cancer Center Karolinska, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institute, S-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Health Sciences (IMH), Linkoping University, S-751 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Health Sciences (IMH), Linkoping University, S-751 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Cancer Center Karolinska, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institute, S-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Health Sciences (IMH), Linkoping University, S-751 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Health Sciences (IMH), Linkoping University, S-751 85 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Cancer Center Karolinska, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institute, S-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Health Sciences (IMH), Linkoping University, S-751 85 Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5400570,['NOTNLM'],"['ER stress', 'VLX1570', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'deubiquitinase', 'proteasome']",,2017/04/21 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/04/21 06:00'],"['2016/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['15501 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15501 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Mar 28;8(13):21115-21127. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15501.,,20171010,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Benzylidene Compounds)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (VLX1570)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Deubiquitinating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azepines/*pharmacology', 'Benzylidene Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deubiquitinating Enzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*drug effects', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteins/drug effects', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The occurrence of several SOS cases after the introduction of extended pegylated asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) therapy in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol led us to hypothesize that PEG-asparaginase, combined with other drugs, may trigger SOS during 6-thioguanine-free maintenance therapy. PROCEDURE: In children with ALL treated in Denmark according to the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol, we investigated the risk of SOS during methotrexate (MTX)/6-mercaptopurine (6MP) maintenance therapy that included PEG-asparaginase until week 33 (randomized to two- vs. six-week intervals), as well as alternating high-dose MTX or vincristine/dexamethasone pulses every four weeks. RESULTS: Among 130 children receiving PEG-asparaginase biweekly, 29 developed SOS (>/=2 criteria: hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, ascites, weight gain >/=2.5%, unexplained thrombocytopenia <75 x 10(9) l(-1) ) at a median of 30 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 17-66) into maintenance (cumulative incidence: 27%). SOS cases fulfilling one, two, or three Ponte di Legno criteria were classified as possible (n = 2), probable (n = 8), or verified (n = 19) SOS, respectively. Twenty-six cases (90%) occurred during PEG-asparaginase treatment, including 21 (81%) within 14 days from the last chemotherapy pulse compared with the subsequent 14 days (P = 0.0025). Cytotoxic 6MP metabolites were significantly higher on PEG-asparaginase compared to after its discontinuation. Time-dependent Cox regression analysis showed increased SOS hazard ratio (HR) for erythrocyte levels of methylated 6MP metabolites (HR: 1.09 per 1,000 nmol/mmol hemoglobin increase, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-1.14). Six-week PEG-asparaginase intervals significantly reduced SOS-specific hazards (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PEG-asparaginase increases cytotoxic 6MP metabolite levels and risk of SOS, potentially interacting with other chemotherapy pulses.","['Toksvang, Linea Natalie', 'De Pietri, Silvia', 'Nielsen, Stine N', 'Nersting, Jacob', 'Albertsen, Birgitte K', 'Wehner, Peder S', 'Rosthoj, Steen', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M', 'Nilsson, Daniel', 'Nystad, Tove A', 'Grell, Kathrine', 'Frandsen, Thomas L', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Toksvang LN', 'De Pietri S', 'Nielsen SN', 'Nersting J', 'Albertsen BK', 'Wehner PS', 'Rosthoj S', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Nilsson D', 'Nystad TA', 'Grell K', 'Frandsen TL', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, H.

MBL may precede the development of CLL, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for disease progression and evolution are not completely known. Telomeres are usually short in CLL and their attrition may contribute to disease evolution. Here, we determined the telomere lengths of CD5+CD19+ cells in MBL, CLL, and healthy volunteers. Twenty-one CLL patients, 11 subjects with high-count MBL, and 6 with low-count MBL were enrolled. Two hundred and sixty-one healthy volunteers aged 0 to 88 years were studied as controls. After diagnosis confirmation, a flow cytometry CD19+CD5+-based cell sorting was performed for the study groups. Telomere length was determined by qPCR. Telomere length was similar in the 3 study groups but shorter in these groups compared to normal age-matched subjects that had been enrolled in a previous study from our group. These findings suggest that telomere shortening is an early event in CLL leukemogenesis.","['Furtado, F M', 'Scheucher, P S', 'Santana, B A', 'Scatena, N F', 'Calado, R T', 'Rego, E M', 'Matos, D M', 'Falcao, R P']","['Furtado FM', 'Scheucher PS', 'Santana BA', 'Scatena NF', 'Calado RT', 'Rego EM', 'Matos DM', 'Falcao RP']","['Divisao de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brasil.', 'Divisao de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brasil.', 'Divisao de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brasil.', 'Divisao de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brasil.', 'Divisao de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brasil.', 'Divisao de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brasil.', 'Hospital Universitario Walter Cantidio, Faculdade de Medicina de Fortaleza, Universidade Federal do Ceara, Fortaleza, CE, Brasil.', 'Divisao de Hematologia, Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brasil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170413,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,PMC5441285,,,,2017/04/20 06:00,2017/09/01 06:00,['2017/04/20 06:00'],"['2016/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2017000500603 [pii]', '10.1590/1414-431X20176019 [doi]']",epublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2017 Apr 13;50(5):e6019. doi: 10.1590/1414-431X20176019.,,20170831,,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reference Standards', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Telomere/pathology', 'Telomere Shortening/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are involved in DNA synthesis, transcription, and replication. It has previously been reported that the lack of Lamin A/C expression in lymphoma and leukaemia is due to CpG island promoter hypermethylation. Here, we provide evidence that Lamin A/C is silenced via this mechanism in a subset of neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, Lamin A/C expression can be restored with a demethylating agent. Importantly, Lamin A/C reintroduction reduced cell growth kinetics and impaired migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent cell growth. Cytoskeletal restructuring was also induced. In addition, the introduction of lamin Delta50, known as Progerin, caused senescence in these neuroblastoma cells. These cells were stiffer and developed a cytoskeletal structure that differed from that observed upon Lamin A/C introduction. Of relevance, short hairpin RNA Lamin A/C depletion in unmethylated neuroblastoma cells enhanced the aforementioned tumour properties. A cytoskeletal structure similar to that observed in methylated cells was induced. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy revealed that Lamin A/C knockdown decreased cellular stiffness in the lamellar region. Finally, the bioinformatic analysis of a set of methylation arrays of neuroblastoma primary tumours showed that a group of patients (around 3%) gives a methylation signal in some of the CpG sites located within the Lamin A/C promoter region analysed by bisulphite sequencing PCR. These findings highlight the importance of Lamin A/C epigenetic inactivation for a subset of neuroblastomas, leading to enhanced tumour properties and cytoskeletal changes. Additionally, these findings may have treatment implications because tumour cells lacking Lamin A/C exhibit more aggressive behaviour.","['Rauschert, Ines', 'Aldunate, Fabian', 'Preussner, Jens', 'Arocena-Sutz, Miguel', 'Peraza, Vanina', 'Looso, Mario', 'Benech, Juan C', 'Agrelo, Ruben']","['Rauschert I', 'Aldunate F', 'Preussner J', 'Arocena-Sutz M', 'Peraza V', 'Looso M', 'Benech JC', 'Agrelo R']","['Laboratory of Cellular Signaling and Nanobiology, Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas Clemente Estable, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Epigenetics of Cancer and Aging Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Bioinformatics Core Unit (BCU), Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Epigenetics of Cancer and Aging Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Epigenetics of Cancer and Aging Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Bioinformatics Core Unit (BCU), Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, Bad Nauheim, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Cellular Signaling and Nanobiology, Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas Clemente Estable, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Epigenetics of Cancer and Aging Laboratory, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170419,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5397038,,,,2017/04/20 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2017/04/20 06:00'],"['2016/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0175953 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-44991 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Apr 19;12(4):e0175953. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0175953. eCollection 2017.,,20170428,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3142-9286'],"['0 (LMNA protein, human)', '0 (Lamin Type A)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (prelamin A)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Lamin Type A/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neuroglia/metabolism/pathology', 'Neurons/metabolism/pathology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A substituted tricyclic benzimidazole, SEL120-34A, is a novel inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), which regulates transcription by associating with the Mediator complex. X-ray crystallography has shown SEL120-34A to be a type I inhibitor forming halogen bonds with the protein's hinge region and hydrophobic complementarities within its front pocket. SEL120-34A inhibits phosphorylation of STAT1 S727 and STAT5 S726 in cancer cells in vitro. Consistently, regulation of STATs- and NUP98-HOXA9- dependent transcription has been observed as a dominant mechanism of action in vivo. Treatment with the compound resulted in a differential efficacy on AML cells with elevated STAT5 S726 levels and stem cell characteristics. In contrast, resistant cells were negative for activated STAT5 and revealed lineage commitment. In vivo efficacy in xenotransplanted AML models correlated with significant repression of STAT5 S726.

Persistence of this gap may be caused by financial, social, or educational disparities. Twinning and distance learning initiatives may improve such disparities. Integrating telemedicine into pediatric oncology twinning programs enhances education and facilitates patient-centered capacity building. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an analysis of Web-based meetings held from August 2005 through July 2009 between the International Outreach Program at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the Instituto Materno Infantil de Pernambuco (IMIP) in Recife, Brazil. We determined the effect of these online conferences on the development and implementation of an innovative protocol for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at IMIP. RESULTS: Meetings occurred in 45 months of the 48-month study period with an average of two meetings per month. A total of 163 new patients were discussed during the study period; we retrieved documentation of patient-related discussions for 147 of them, constituting 286 discussions. On average, each patient was discussed 1.9 times (range, 1-15 discussions/patient). Compared with that of the era predating the online meetings (1993-2005), overall mortality, early death, and relapse of patients with ALL decreased after the telemedicine program was instituted at IMIP.

A retrospective study was undertaken to provide information that may lead to improved treatment outcomes. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinicopathological, treatment, and survival information were retrieved from the electronic database registry of a tertiary referral hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil for patients 19-29 years of age diagnosed with cancer between January 2007 and December 2012. RESULTS: There were 960 patients with a median age at diagnosis of 26 years; female patients comprised 59.2%. A previous diagnosis of malignancy was present in 2.3%; 0.4% had malignant tumors that were radiation-associated; regular alcohol use was present in 10.4%; 9% of patients reported tobacco use; a family history of cancer was present in 41.7%. Malignant tumors included carcinomas (45.7%), germ cell and trophoblastic neoplasms (12.3%), and lymphomas (12.1%). Median follow-up was 47.7 months (range: 0.62-100.9 months) during which time 111 patients (13.5%) died. Carcinomas (n = 43, 38.7%), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 18, 16.2%), and leukemias (n = 10, 9.0%) were the most common causes of death. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that carcinomas represent the most common malignancy in adolescents and young adults referred to a tertiary cancer center in Brazil and are the most common cause of mortality. Because clinical outcome may be affected by multiple factors in this patient population, further global studies are needed to characterize this population and improve clinical care.","['de Jesus, Victor Hugo Fonseca', 'Ribeiro, Taynan Nunes', 'Chinen, Ludmilla T Domingos', 'Alves, Vanessa', 'Curado, Maria Paula', 'Fanelli, Marcello Ferretti']","['de Jesus VHF', 'Ribeiro TN', 'Chinen LTD', 'Alves V', 'Curado MP', 'Fanelli MF']","['1 Department of Medical Oncology, A.C.

This study aimed at analyzing the expression pattern of CD200 by flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FCI) and to evaluate its utility in narrowing down the differential diagnosis of MBN, particularly in low-grade lymphomas. METHODS: A total of 160 samples were evaluated by FCI over a period of 2 years (July 2014-June 2016), by a panel of antibodies including CD200. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD200 in the neoplastic population was noted and compared among several groups of MBN. RESULTS: All the 98 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), five being CD23-negative, expressed CD200 with moderate-to-bright intensity (median MFI: 1174). None of the 24 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cases, two being CD23-positive, expressed CD200 (median MFI: 10). All six hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cases expressed CD200. CD200 expression in HCL was brightest among all the MBNs, with a median MFI of 5050. Other MBN (n = 32) expressed CD200 in a proportion of cases and with variable intensity, usually dimmer than CLL. CONCLUSION: CD200 has a valid role in differentiating CLL from MCL, especially in the cases with immunophenotypic overlap. HCL has a consistent and brightest expression of CD200. It would be prudent to include CD200 in the primary panel of antibodies for MBN analysis.","['Rahman, K', 'Kumar, P', 'Gupta, R', 'Singh, M K', 'Nityanand, S']","['Rahman K', 'Kumar P', 'Gupta R', 'Singh MK', 'Nityanand S']","['Department of Hematology, SGPGI, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Hematology, SGPGI, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Hematology, SGPGI, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Hematology, SGPGI, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Hematology, SGPGI, Lucknow, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170419,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD200', 'flow cytometry', 'mature B-cell neoplasm']",,2017/04/20 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2017/04/20 06:00'],"['2016/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12637 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 Aug;39(4):384-391. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12637.

METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 149 cases of newly diagnosed acute leukemia and assessed the utility of evaluating red blood cell morphologic features, and coagulation parameters in determining the presence of DIC as well as differentiating subtypes of acute leukemia. RESULTS: Review of our cohort demonstrates a novel finding, that elevated D-dimer concentrations >/=19 000 ng/mL fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) are a sensitive diagnostic indicator of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with moderate specificity, sensitivity 96%, specificity 92% in acute leukemia subtyping. Similar to other studies, APL showed an increased incidence of DIC (P < 0.01) compared to other subtypes of acute leukemia. Surprisingly, the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear was not a statistically significant indicator of DIC, sensitivity of 36% and specificity of 89%. Finally, the presence of DIC was not a significant indicator of poorer prognosis amongst all patients with AML. CONCLUSION: Overall we identify elevated D-dimer concentrations >/=19 000 ng/mL FEU are a sensitive indicator of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 92% in the subtyping of acute leukemias, and that the presence of schistocytes in peripheral blood smears is not a diagnostically sensitive screening test for DIC with a sensitivity of 36%.","['Shahmarvand, N', 'Oak, J S', 'Cascio, M J', 'Alcasid, M', 'Goodman, E', 'Medeiros, B C', 'Arber, D A', 'Zehnder, J L', 'Ohgami, R S']","['Shahmarvand N', 'Oak JS', 'Cascio MJ', 'Alcasid M', 'Goodman E', 'Medeiros BC', 'Arber DA', 'Zehnder JL', 'Ohgami RS']","['Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Virginia Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Roanoke, VA, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170419,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,['NOTNLM'],"['Coagulations parameters', 'D-dimer levels', 'acute leukemia', 'schistocytes']",,2017/04/20 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2017/04/20 06:00'],"['2016/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12636 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 Aug;39(4):375-383. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12636.

Historically, various names and classifications were used for this rare entity accounting for 2-5% of all acute leukemias depending on the diagnostic criterias used. The currently valid classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 refers to this group of diseases as MPAL. Because adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are frequently present, MPAL is generally considered a disease with a poor prognosis. Knowledge of its treatment is limited to retrospective analyses of small patient cohorts. So far, no treatment recommendations verified by prospective studies have been published. The reported data suggest that induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is more effective than induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia or consolidation chemotherapy. The establishment of cooperative groups and international registries based on the recent WHO criterias are required to ensure further progress in understanding and treatment of MPAL.

It is a multilineage haematopoietin which stimulates proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow myeloid progenitors and increases peripheral white blood cell counts when administered systemically. Treatment is generally well tolerated, although mild to moderate flu-like symptoms are common and rGM-CSF-induced fever and fluid retention may be problematic in occasional patients. rGM-CSF accelerates recovery of peripheral neutrophil counts after bone marrow transplantation, and results of a placebo-controlled randomised trial correlate this with reduced infectious episodes and shortened length of hospitalisation in patients with lymphoid malignancies. A substantial number of patients with graft failure after bone marrow transplantation also respond to rGM-CSF. The duration of myelosuppression secondary to cancer chemotherapy can be significantly reduced by rGM-CSF which has permitted investigation of antineoplastic dose-intensity escalation. In some haematopoietic disorders (e.g. aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia and neutropenia secondary to HIV infection and antiviral therapy), rGM-CSF produces clinically useful increases in peripheral blood granulocyte counts, although the effect is generally not sustained after drug withdrawal. The potential for rGM-CSF to stimulate proliferation of the abnormal clone in myelodysplasia and in acute myelogenous leukaemia following induction therapy is of concern. Available data suggest, however, that with appropriate monitoring and exclusion of high-risk patients this serious potential risk can be avoided, and that myelopoiesis is enhanced in such patients by rGM-CSF treatment. Recombinant colony-stimulating factors are a new therapeutic modality; hence many aspects of their use remain to be clarified. Nonetheless, as one of a small group of novel agents rGM-CSF has major potential in the management of myelosuppression secondary to cytoreductive therapy with or without bone marrow transplantation, and in amelioration of disturbed myelopoiesis. It represents an important application of biotechnology to a difficult area of therapeutics.","['Grant, Susan M', 'Heel, Rennie C']","['Grant SM', 'Heel RC']","['Adis International Limited, 41 Centorian Drive, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, Auckland 10, New Zealand.', 'Adis International Limited, 41 Centorian Drive, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, Auckland 10, New Zealand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,,,,,1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['2017/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.2165/00003495-199243040-00008 [doi]', '10.2165/00003495-199243040-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Drugs. 1992 Apr;43(4):516-560. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199243040-00008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A simple and efficient cocktail method was developed to detect the four probe drugs simultaneously. In this study, Wistar rats were administered intragastric RIF and realgar for 14 days; mixed probe drugs were injected into rats by caudal vein. Through analyzing the pharmacokinetic parameter of mixed probe drugs in rats, we can calculate the CYPs activities. The results showed that RIF could inhibit CYP1A2 enzyme activity and induce CYP2C11 enzyme activity significantly. Interestingly, in realgar high dosage group, CYP3A1/2 enzyme activity was inhibited significantly, and different dosage of realgar manifested a good dose-dependent manner. The RIF results indicated that drug coadministrated with RIF may need to be paid attention in relation to drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Realgar, a toxic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), does have curative effect on acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Its toxicity studies should be focused on. We found that, in realgar high dosage group, CYP3A1/2 enzymes activity was inhibited. This phenomenon may explain its potential toxicity mechanism.","['Xu, Huan-Hua', 'Hao, Fei-Ran', 'Wang, Mei-Xi', 'Ren, Si-Jia', 'Li, Ming', 'Tan, Hong-Ling', 'Wang, Yu-Guang', 'Tang, Xiang-Lin', 'Xiao, Cheng-Rong', 'Liang, Qian-De', 'Gao, Yue', 'Ma, Zeng-Chun']","['Xu HH', 'Hao FR', 'Wang MX', 'Ren SJ', 'Li M', 'Tan HL', 'Wang YG', 'Tang XL', 'Xiao CR', 'Liang QD', 'Gao Y', 'Ma ZC']","['Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, AMMS, Beijing 100850, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170321,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,PMC5379094,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interests.'],2017/04/20 06:00,2017/04/20 06:01,['2017/04/20 06:00'],"['2016/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/2374624 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2017;2017:2374624. doi: 10.1155/2017/2374624.

Variant translocations have been infrequently described in this subtype of leukemia. CASE REPORT We describe the case of a 3-month-old girl who presented with progressive abdominal distension, vomiting, and fever. Although there was no morphologic evidence of leukemia in the bone marrow, cytogenetic and metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis identified an insertion of p13p31 bands of chromosome 1 onto the long arm of chromosome 22, resulting in the karyotype: 46,XX,ins(22;1)(q13;p13p31). Subsequent liver biopsy demonstrated extensive involvement by AMKL. CONCLUSIONS AMKL can present with fewer than 20% blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow, necessitating careful evaluation for extramedullary disease. In other situations, bone marrow fibrosis can result in difficult marrow aspirations and a falsely decreased blast count. This case report highlights the critical role of careful cytogenetic and FISH testing in the diagnosis of AMKL.","['Margolskee, Elizabeth', 'Saab, Jad', 'Geyer, Julia T', 'Aledo, Alexander', 'Mathew, Susan']","['Margolskee E', 'Saab J', 'Geyer JT', 'Aledo A', 'Mathew S']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine/New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine/New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine/New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine/New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine/New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20170419,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,PMC5404477,,,,2017/04/20 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2017/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]']","['901855 [pii]', '10.12659/ajcr.901855 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2017 Apr 19;18:422-426. doi: 10.12659/ajcr.901855.,,20171201,,,IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have indicated the involvement of CADM1 in cell-cell contact between cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and virus infected cells. We previously reported that cell-cell interaction between lymphoma cells and macrophages induces lymphoma cell proliferation. In the present study, we investigated whether CADM1 is associated with cell-cell interaction between several human lymphoma cell lines and macrophages.CADM1 expression was observed in the ATLL cell lines, ATN-1, ATL-T, and ATL-35T, and in the B cell lymphoma cell lines, TL-1, DAUDI, and SLVL, using western blotting. Significant cell-cell interaction between macrophages and ATN-1, ATL-T, ATL-35T and MT-2, DAUDI, and SLVL cells, as assessed by induction of cell proliferation, was observed. Immunohistochemical analysis of human biopsy samples indicated CADM1 expression in 10 of 14 ATLL cases; however, no case of follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was positive for CADM1. Finally, the interaction of macrophages with cells of the CADM1-negative ED ATLL cell line and CADM1-transfected ED cells was tested. However, significant cell-cell interaction between macrophage and CADM1-transfected ED cells was not observed. We conclude that CADM1 was not associated with cell-cell interaction between lymphoma cells and macrophages, although CADM1 may be a useful marker of ATLL for diagnostic procedures.","['Komohara, Yoshihiro', 'Ma, Chaoya', 'Yano, Hiromu', 'Pan, Cheng', 'Horlad, Hasita', 'Saito, Yoichi', 'Ohnishi, Koji', 'Fujiwara, Yukio', 'Okuno, Yutaka', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Shimosaki, Shunsuke', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Wakayama, Tomohiko', 'Takeya, Motohiro']","['Komohara Y', 'Ma C', 'Yano H', 'Pan C', 'Horlad H', 'Saito Y', 'Ohnishi K', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Okuno Y', 'Nosaka K', 'Shimosaki S', 'Morishita K', 'Matsuoka M', 'Wakayama T', 'Takeya M']","['Department of Cell Pathology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Department of Cell Pathology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Department of Cell Pathology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Department of Cell Pathology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Department of Cell Pathology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Department of Cell Pathology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Department of Cell Pathology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Department of Cell Pathology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University.', 'Department of Histology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.', 'Department of Cell Pathology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170418,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,PMC6144270,['NOTNLM'],"['ATLL', 'CADM1', 'TAM', 'TSLC1', 'macrophage']",,2017/04/20 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3960/jslrt.17003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2017 Jul 5;57(1):15-20. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.17003.

In the presence of poly-gamma-glutamic acid (PGA) or chondroitin sulfate (CDR), cell lines (HKOX3-PGA, HKOX3-CDR) were established from the same single ATLL case using interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and feeder cells expressing OX40L (OX40L(+)HK). Dextran sulfate inhibited growth in both HKOX3 cell lines. Both PGA and OX40L(+)HK were indispensable for HKOX3-PGA growth, but HKOX3-CDR could proliferate in the presence of CDR or OX40L(+)HK alone.

The BCL-2 proteins BAX and BAK can commit mammalian cells to apoptosis and are inhibited by retrotranslocation from the mitochondria into the cytosol. The subcellular localization of BAX and BAK could determine the cellular predisposition to apoptotic death.Experimental Design: The relative localization of BAX and BAK was determined by fractionation of AML cell lines and patient samples of a test cohort and a validation cohort.Results: This study shows that relative BAX localization determines the predisposition of different AML cell lines to apoptosis. Human AML displays a surprising variety of relative BAX localizations. In a test cohort of 48 patients with AML, mitochondria-shifted BAX correlated with improved patient survival, FLT3-ITD status, and leukocytosis. Analysis of a validation cohort of 80 elderly patients treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy confirmed that relative BAX localization correlates with probability of disease progression, FLT3-ITD status, and leukocytosis. Relative BAX localization could therefore be helpful to identify elderly or frail patients who may benefit from cytotoxic therapy.Conclusions: In this retrospective analysis of two independent AML cohorts, our data suggest that Bax localization may predict prognosis of patients with AML and cellular predisposition to apoptosis, combining the actual contribution of known and unknown factors to a final ""common path.""

METHODS: In silico analysis using publicly available databases was done to select the SLC and ABC genes and their promoters for the next-generation sequencing. SNPs associated with the imatinib response were identified using Fisher's exact probability tests and subjected to the linkage disequilibrium analyses with regulatory loci of concerned genes. We analyzed cumulative achievement of major molecular response and probability of event free survival in relation to identified SNP genotypes in 129 CML patients and performed multivariate analysis for determination of genotypes as independent predictors of outcome. Gene expression analysis of eight cell lines naturally carrying different genotypes was performed to outline an impact of genotypes on the gene expression. RESULTS: We observed significant differences in the frequencies of the rs460089-GC and rs460089-GG (SLC22A4) genotypes among rs2631365-TC (SLC22A5) genotype carriers that were associated with optimal and non-optimal responses, respectively. Loci rs460089 and rs2631365 were in highly significant linkage disequilibrium with 12 regulatory loci in introns of SLC22A4 and SLC22A5 encoding imatinib transporters. Genotype association analysis with the response to imatinib indicated that rs460089-GC carriers had a significantly higher probability of achieving a stable major molecular response (BCR-ABL1 transcript level below or equal to 0.1% in the international scale). In contrast, the rs460089-GG represented a risk factor for imatinib failure, which was significantly higher in rs460089-GG_rs2631365-TC carriers. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study depicted potentially important genetic markers predicting outcome of imatinib treatment, which may be helpful for tailoring therapy in clinical practice.","['Jaruskova, Monika', 'Curik, Nikola', 'Hercog, Rajna', 'Polivkova, Vaclava', 'Motlova, Eliska', 'Benes, Vladimir', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Pecherkova, Pavla', 'Belohlavkova, Petra', 'Vrbacky, Filip', 'Machova Polakova, Katerina']","['Jaruskova M', 'Curik N', 'Hercog R', 'Polivkova V', 'Motlova E', 'Benes V', 'Klamova H', 'Pecherkova P', 'Belohlavkova P', 'Vrbacky F', 'Machova Polakova K']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 12820, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Clinical and Experimental Hematology, 1st Medicine Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 12820, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathophysiology, 1st Medicine Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Genomics Core Facility, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 12820, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 12820, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Genomics Core Facility, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 12820, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Clinical and Experimental Hematology, 1st Medicine Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CELL, the Czech Leukemia Study Group for Life, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 12820, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CELL, the Czech Leukemia Study Group for Life, Brno, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine Hematology, Charles University Faculty Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine Hematology, Charles University Faculty Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 12820, Prague, Czech Republic. katerina.machova@uhkt.cz.', 'Institute of Clinical and Experimental Hematology, 1st Medicine Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic. katerina.machova@uhkt.cz.', 'CELL, the Czech Leukemia Study Group for Life, Brno, Czech Republic. katerina.machova@uhkt.cz.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170418,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,PMC5395939,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*Imatinib', '*Response', '*SLC']",,2017/04/20 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2017/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-017-0523-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-017-0523-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2017 Apr 18;36(1):55. doi: 10.1186/s13046-017-0523-3.,,20171218,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (SLC22A4 protein, human)', '0 (SLC22A5 protein, human)', '0 (Solute Carrier Family 22 Member 5)', '0 (Symporters)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Mutation Rate', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', 'Solute Carrier Family 22 Member 5/*genetics', 'Symporters', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is considered a very safe drug, with mostly mild and reversible side effects. Lately, it has been suggested that adverse events may occur after a long term. We report a case of a 72-year-old woman diagnosed with blastic phase of Philadelphia chromosome positive CML treated with IM for 28 months. The patient presented first with ascites as a side effect of the drug. When the ascites re-occurred, it was caused by neuroendocrine tumor (NET) with peritoneal carcinomatosis. We believe this is the first case of a NET as a secondary malignancy (SM) after IM treatment. SM have been described in patients on IM before.

However, in-situ comprehensive observation and the quantitative analysis of the direct membrane translocation processes are challenging, and the mechanism therefore remains still unresolved. In this work, real-time in-cell NMR spectroscopy was applied to investigate the direct membrane translocation of octaarginine (R8) into living cells. By introducing 4-trifluoromethyl-l-phenylalanine to the N terminus of R8, the non-endocytic membrane translocation of (19)F-labeled R8 ((19)F-R8) into a human myeloid leukemia cell line was observed at 4 degrees C with a time resolution in the order of minutes. (19)F NMR successfully detected real-time R8 translocation: the binding to anionic GAGs at the cell surface, followed by the penetration into the cell membrane, and the entry into cytosol across the membrane. The NMR concentration analysis enabled quantification of how much of R8 was staying in the respective translocation processes with time in situ. Taken together, our in-cell NMR results provide the physicochemical rationale for spontaneous penetration of CPPs in cell membranes.","['Takechi-Haraya, Yuki', 'Aki, Kenzo', 'Tohyama, Yumi', 'Harano, Yuichi', 'Kawakami, Toru', 'Saito, Hiroyuki', 'Okamura, Emiko']","['Takechi-Haraya Y', 'Aki K', 'Tohyama Y', 'Harano Y', 'Kawakami T', 'Saito H', 'Okamura E']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, 7-2-1 Kamiohno, Himeji 670-8524, Japan. haraya@nihs.go.jp.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, 7-2-1 Kamiohno, Himeji 670-8524, Japan. aki@gm.himeji-du.ac.jp.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, 7-2-1 Kamiohno, Himeji 670-8524, Japan. ytohyama@himeji-du.ac.jp.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, 7-2-1 Kamiohno, Himeji 670-8524, Japan. harano@gm.himeji-du.ac.jp.', 'Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, 3-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan. kawa@protein.osaka-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Biophysical Chemistry, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, 5 Nakauchi-cho, Misasagi, Yamashina-ku, Kyoto 607-8414, Japan. hsaito@mb.kyoto-phu.ac.jp.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, 7-2-1 Kamiohno, Himeji 670-8524, Japan. emiko@himeji-du.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170415,Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,PMC5490399,['NOTNLM'],"['cell penetrating peptide', 'glycosaminoglycan', 'heparin', 'in-cell nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'non-endocytic membrane translocation', 'octaarginine']",,2017/04/20 06:00,2017/04/20 06:01,['2017/04/20 06:00'],"['2017/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/20 06:01 [medline]']","['ph10020042 [pii]', '10.3390/ph10020042 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2017 Apr 15;10(2). pii: ph10020042. doi: 10.3390/ph10020042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median survival ranges between 3-9 months from initial diagnosis. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have been shown to prolong survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML, but there is limited data of their efficacy in AEL. We collected data from 210 AEL patients treated at 28 international sites. Overall survival (OS) and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was used for subgroup comparisons. Survival between treatment groups was compared using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Eighty-eight patients were treated with HMAs, 44 front line, and 122 with intensive chemotherapy (ICT). ICT led to a higher overall response rate (complete or partial) compared to first-line HMA (72% vs. 46.2%, respectively; p </= 0.001), but similar progression-free survival (8.0 vs. 9.4 months; p = 0.342). Overall survival was similar for ICT vs. HMAs (10.5 vs. 13.7 months; p = 0.564), but patients with high-risk cytogenetics treated with HMA first-line lived longer (7.5 for ICT vs. 13.3 months; p = 0.039).

The Medical Research Council (MRC) and the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classifications distinguish between favorable, intermediate and adverse cytogenetic risk patients who differ in their treatment response and overall survival. Conventional cytogenetic analyses are a mandatory component of AML diagnostics but they are time-consuming; therefore, therapeutic decisions in elderly patients are often delayed. We investigated whether a screening approach using a panel of seven fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes would allow rapid identification of adverse chromosomal changes. In a cohort of 334 AML patients, our targeted FISH screening approach identified 80% of adverse risk AML patients with a specificity of 99%. Incorporating FISH screening into diagnostic workup has the potential to accelerate risk stratification and treatment selection, particularly in older patients. This approach may allow therapeutic decisions more quickly, which benefits both patients and physicians and might save costs.","['Sandhofer, Nadine', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Kakadia, Purvi M', 'Pasalic, Zlatana', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Neusser, Michaela', 'Steinlein, Ortrud', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Subklewe, Marion', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Schneider, Stephanie', 'Braess, Jan']","['Sandhofer N', 'Metzeler KH', 'Kakadia PM', 'Pasalic Z', 'Hiddemann W', 'Neusser M', 'Steinlein O', 'Fiegl M', 'Subklewe M', 'Spiekermann K', 'Bohlander SK', 'Schneider S', 'Braess J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, University of Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, University of Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Hospital Barmherzige Bruder, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20170519,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,,,,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/10/07 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22466 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2017 Aug;56(8):632-638. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22466.

Bufalin has been reported to induce apoptosis in various tumor cells. However, there is no report showing that bufalin could downregulate Mcl-1 expression in NSCLC. METHODS: Cell proliferation was analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay in H1975 cells. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Mcl-1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The expression of apoptosis-associated proteins in H1975 cells was detected by western blotting. The levels of Mcl-1 ubiquitination and NOXA were analyzed by Immunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: Cell growth was inhibited by bufalin in a time and dose-dependent manner. Bufalin induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells by activating caspase cascades and downregulating Mcl-1 expression. However, overexpression of Mcl-1 diminished bufalin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, bufalin did not reduce Mcl-1 mRNA expression in H1975 cells, but strongly promoted Mcl-1 protein degradation. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 markedly prevented the degradation of Mcl-1 and blocked bufalin-induced Mcl-1 reduction. Bufalin did not significantly affect NOXA protein levels, but downregulated the expression of p-GSK-3beta. GSK-3 inhibitor and GSK-3beta siRNA resulted in increased levels of Mcl-1 and reversed the bufalin-induced Mcl-1 degradation. CONCLUSION: Bufalin induced cell apoptosis in H1975 cells may be through downregulation of Mcl-1. Proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 via GSK-3beta activation was involved in bufalin-induced apoptosis.","['Kang, Xiao-Hong', 'Zhang, Jing-Hang', 'Zhang, Qing-Qin', 'Cui, Yan-Hui', 'Wang, Ying', 'Kou, Wei-Zheng', 'Miao, Zhan-Hui', 'Lu, Ping', 'Wang, Li-Fang', 'Xu, Zhen-Ye', 'Cao, Fei']","['Kang XH', 'Zhang JH', 'Zhang QQ', 'Cui YH', 'Wang Y', 'Kou WZ', 'Miao ZH', 'Lu P', 'Wang LF', 'Xu ZY', 'Cao F']","['Department of Oncology, Xinxiang, China.', 'Department of pathology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xinxiang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xinxiang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xinxiang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xinxiang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xinxiang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xinxiang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of TCM, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of TCM, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Oncology, The First People's Hospital of Ping Ding Shan, Henan, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170414,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bufalin', 'Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta', 'Mcl-1', 'NSCLC']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['000475438 [pii]', '10.1159/000475438 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2017;41(5):2067-2076. doi: 10.1159/000475438.

We evaluated the effectiveness of extended slow-dose transfusion (ESDT) in increasing platelet increments in multitransfused patients. METHODS: Patients treated after the implementation of ESDT were compared with historical controls treated with standard single-donor platelet (SDP) transfusions. Cohorts of early and late recipients were assembled for comparison, i.e. the 8th or 9th and 11th platelet unit per patient, respectively. Patients in the ESDT group received transfusions equal to half an SDP unit, administered over 4 h. Effectiveness was defined as a higher corrected count increment (CCI) at 1, 12, and 24 h after transfusion. RESULTS: In the early-recipients cohort, 24-h-posttransfusion increments were available for 29 ESDT patients and 6 standard patients, and did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.078). The 24-h-posttransfusion increment was available for 20 ESDT patients and 7 standard patients in the late-recipients cohort. The CCI was significantly higher in the ESDT group (p = 0.042). ABO compatibility improved the CCI (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: ESDT demonstrated slightly higher increments at 24 h after transfusion in late recipients, suggesting this could be a cost-effective approach for the treatment of thrombocytopenic multitransfused hemato-oncological patients.","['Gurevich-Shapiro, Anna', 'Tzadok, Sharon', 'Rosenberg, Alina', 'Inbal, Aida', 'Bar-Natan, Michal', 'Wolach, Ofir', 'Raanani, Pia']","['Gurevich-Shapiro A', 'Tzadok S', 'Rosenberg A', 'Inbal A', 'Bar-Natan M', 'Wolach O', 'Raanani P']","['Internal Medicine Department H, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170419,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematology/oncology', 'Platelet refractoriness', 'Platelet transfusion', 'Supportive care', 'Thrombocytopenia']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['000465510 [pii]', '10.1159/000465510 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2017;137(4):183-190. doi: 10.1159/000465510.

It has been demonstrated that chidamide can inhibit cell cycle, promote apoptosis and induce differentiation in leukemia cells, whereas its effect on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with FLT3-ITD mutation has not been clarified. In this study, we found that chidamide specifically induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in FLT3-ITD positive AML cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner. We also found chidamide had the cytotoxicity effect on FLT3-ITD positive and negative AML cells. Moreover, with respect to relapsed/refractory patients, chidamide showed the same effectiveness as that in de novo AML patients.

RESULTS: Of 174 patients, 82% had B-phenotype, 11% Burkitt leukemia (excluded), and 7% T-phenotype. Philadelphia chromosome positivity (Ph+) occurred in 35%. Of the 155 B- and T-ALL patients, 80% were treated with intensive protocols, and 20% with a palliative approach. Higher age and WHO performance status >/=2 influenced the choice of palliation.

With intensive treatment, platelet count </=35x10(9) /L and age >/=75 years were adverse prognostic factors for OS, Ph+ was not. Male sex was an adverse prognostic factor in the 55-64 year age-group. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high frequency of Ph+ in older/elderly patients, with no evidence of poorer outcome compared to Ph-negative disease. Overall prognosis for elderly patients with ALL remains dismal, despite the use of age-adapted treatment.","['Kozlowski, Piotr', 'Lennmyr, Emma', 'Ahlberg, Lucia', 'Bernell, Per', 'Hulegardh, Erik', 'Karbach, Holger', 'Karlsson, Karin', 'Tomaszewska-Toporska, Beata', 'Astrom, Maria', 'Hallbook, Helene']","['Kozlowski P', 'Lennmyr E', 'Ahlberg L', 'Bernell P', 'Hulegardh E', 'Karbach H', 'Karlsson K', 'Tomaszewska-Toporska B', 'Astrom M', 'Hallbook H']","['Department of Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Orebro University, Orebro, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Linkoping, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Coagulation, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, University Hospital of Umea, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Orebro University, Orebro, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170614,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'elderly', 'epidemiology']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.12896 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2017 Aug;99(2):141-149. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12896.

The sources of variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters were characterized and quantified to support dosing recommendations. Patients received intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) twice-weekly, on days 1, 4, and 8 during specific blocks or cycles of both trials and on day 11 of block 1 of study AALL07P1, in combination with multiagent chemotherapy. Blood samples were obtained and the plasma was harvested on day 8 over 0-72 hours postdose to measure bortezomib concentrations by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Concentration-time data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Covariates were examined using forward addition (P < .01)/backward elimination (P < .001). Data were included from 104 patients (49%/51% acute lymphoblastic leukemia/acute myelogenous leukemia; 60%/40% aged 2-11 years/12-16 years). Bortezomib pharmacokinetics were described by a 3-compartment model with linear elimination. Body surface area adequately accounted for variability in clearance (exponent 0.97), supporting body surface area-based dosing. Stratified visual predictive check simulations verified that neither age group nor patient population represented sources of meaningful pharmacokinetic heterogeneity not accounted for by the final population pharmacokinetic model. Following administration of 1.3 mg/m(2) intravenous bortezomib doses, body surface area-normalized clearance in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adult patients, thereby indicating that this dose achieves similar systemic exposures in pediatric patients.","['Hanley, Michael J', 'Mould, Diane R', 'Taylor, Timothy J', 'Gupta, Neeraj', 'Suryanarayan, Kaveri', 'Neuwirth, Rachel', 'Esseltine, Dixie-Lee', 'Horton, Terzah M', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Lu, Xiaomin', 'Milton, Ashley', 'Venkatakrishnan, Karthik']","['Hanley MJ', 'Mould DR', 'Taylor TJ', 'Gupta N', 'Suryanarayan K', 'Neuwirth R', 'Esseltine DL', 'Horton TM', 'Aplenc R', 'Alonzo TA', 'Lu X', 'Milton A', 'Venkatakrishnan K']","['Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Projections Research Inc, Phoenixville, PA, USA.', 'Projections Research Inc, Phoenixville, PA, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA, USA.', ""Baylor College of Medicine, Dan L.

We recently demonstrated that Cortactin is overexpressed in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). This work was aimed at defining the functional role of Cortactin in these patients. We found that Cortactin is variably expressed in CLL patients both in the peripheral blood and lymph nodes and that its expression correlates with the release of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and the motility of neoplastic cells. Cortactin knockdown, by siRNA, induced a reduction in MMP-9 release as well as a decrease of migration capability of leukaemic B cells in vitro, also after chemotactic stimulus. Furthermore, Cortactin phosphorylation was lowered by the Src kinase-inhibitor PP2 with a consequent decrease of MMP-9 release in culture medium. An impaired migration, as compared to control experiments without Cortactin knockdown, was observed following CXCL12 triggering. Reduced Cortactin expression and phosphorylation were also detected both in vivo and in vitro after treatment with Ibrutinib, a Btk inhibitor. Our results highlight the role of Cortactin in CLL as a check-point molecule between the BCR and CXCR4 signalling pathways.","['Martini, Veronica', 'Gattazzo, Cristina', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Trimarco, Valentina', 'Pizzi, Marco', 'Chiodin, Giorgia', 'Severin, Filippo', 'Scomazzon, Edoardo', 'Guzzardo, Vincenza', 'Saraggi, Deborah', 'Raggi, Flavia', 'Martinello, Leonardo', 'Facco, Monica', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Piazza, Francesco', 'Brunati, Anna Maria', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Trentin, Livio']","['Martini V', 'Gattazzo C', 'Frezzato F', 'Trimarco V', 'Pizzi M', 'Chiodin G', 'Severin F', 'Scomazzon E', 'Guzzardo V', 'Saraggi D', 'Raggi F', 'Martinello L', 'Facco M', 'Visentin A', 'Piazza F', 'Brunati AM', 'Semenzato G', 'Trentin L']","['Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, General Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, General Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, General Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170417,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell receptor and Ibrutinib', '*Cortactin', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*matrix metalloproteinase-9']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14642 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Jul;178(1):81-93. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14642.

In this study, EuroFlow-based 8-colour flow cytometry and innovative analysis tools were used to first characterize the immunophenotypic maturation of normal BCPs in bone marrow (BM) from healthy children, resulting in a continuous multiparametric pathway including transition stages. This pathway was subsequently used as a reference to characterize the immunophenotypic maturation of regenerating BCPs in BM from children treated for BCP-ALL. We identified pre-B-I cells that expressed low or dim CD34 levels, in contrast to the classical CD34(high) pre-B-I cell immunophenotype. These CD34(-dim) pre-B-I cells were relatively abundant in regenerating BM (11-85% within pre-B-I subset), while hardly present in healthy control BM (9-13% within pre-B-I subset; P = 0.0037). Furthermore, we showed that some of the BCP-ALL diagnosis immunophenotypes (23%) overlapped with CD34(-dim) pre-B-I cells. Our results indicate that newly identified CD34(-dim) pre-B-I cells can be mistaken for residual BCP-ALL cells, potentially resulting in false-positive MRD outcomes.

Using data from the California Cancer Registry linked to hospital discharge records from 1999 to 2012, we identified patients aged >/=15 years with AML who received inpatient treatment (N = 6359). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association of complications with early mortality, adjusting for sociodemographic factors, comorbidities and hospital type. Early mortality decreased over time (25.3%, 1999-2000; 16.8%, 2011-2012) across all age groups, but was higher in older patients (6.9%, 15-39, 11.4%, 40-54, 18.6% 55-65, and 35.8%, >65 years). Major bleeding [Odds ratio (OR) 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-1.9], liver failure (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.1), renal failure (OR 2.4, 95% CI 2.0-2.9), respiratory failure (OR 7.6, 95% CI 6.2-9.3) and cardiac arrest (OR 15.8, 95% CI 8.7-28.6) were associated with early mortality. Higher early mortality was also associated with single marital status, low neighbourhood socioeconomic status, lack of health insurance and comorbidities. Treatment at National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centres was associated with lower early mortality (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.6). In conclusion, organ dysfunction, hospital type and sociodemographic factors impact early mortality. Further studies should investigate how differences in healthcare delivery affect early mortality.","['Ho, Gwendolyn', 'Jonas, Brian A', 'Li, Qian', 'Brunson, Ann', 'Wun, Ted', 'Keegan, Theresa H M']","['Ho G', 'Jonas BA', 'Li Q', 'Brunson A', 'Wun T', 'Keegan THM']","['Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170417,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,PMC5444943,['NOTNLM'],"['* AML', '*acute leukaemia', '*early mortality', '*epidemiology', '*outcomes research']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14631 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Jun;177(5):791-799. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14631.

We reviewed long-term data from three clinical trials to characterize the toxicity and efficacy of patients receiving bendamustine. Data were available for 149 subjects at 21 sites. The median age was 60 years at the start of bendamustine (range 39-84), and patients had received a median of 3 prior therapies. The histologies included grades 1-2 follicular lymphoma (FL; n = 73), grade 3 FL (n = 23), small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 20), marginal zone lymphoma (n = 15), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 9), transformed lymphomas (n = 5), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (n = 2) and not reported (n = 2). The median event-free survival was 14.1 months. Nine of 12 attempted stem cell collections were successful. With a median follow-up of 8.9 years, 23 patients developed 25 cancers, including 8 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia. These data provide important information regarding the long-term toxicity of bendamustine in previously treated patients. A small but meaningful number of patients achieved durable remissions following bendamustine. These rigorously collected, patient-level, long-term follow-up data provide reassurance that bendamustine or bendamustine plus rituximab is associated with efficacy and safety for patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","['Martin, Peter', 'Chen, Zhengming', 'Cheson, Bruce D', 'Robinson, Katherine S', 'Williams, Michael', 'Rajguru, Saurabh A', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W', 'van der Jagt, Richard H', 'LaCasce, Ann S', 'Joyce, Robin', 'Ganjoo, Kristen N', 'Bartlett, Nancy L', 'Lemieux, Bernard', 'VanderWalde, Ari', 'Herst, Jordan', 'Szer, Jeffrey', 'Bar, Michael H', 'Cabanillas, Fernando', 'Dodds, Anthony J', 'Montgomery, Paul G', 'Pressnail, Bryn', 'Ellis, Tricia', 'Smith, Mitchell R', 'Leonard, John P']","['Martin P', 'Chen Z', 'Cheson BD', 'Robinson KS', 'Williams M', 'Rajguru SA', 'Friedberg JW', 'van der Jagt RH', 'LaCasce AS', 'Joyce R', 'Ganjoo KN', 'Bartlett NL', 'Lemieux B', 'VanderWalde A', 'Herst J', 'Szer J', 'Bar MH', 'Cabanillas F', 'Dodds AJ', 'Montgomery PG', 'Pressnail B', 'Ellis T', 'Smith MR', 'Leonard JP']","['Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'University of Wisconsin Hospital, Madison, WI, USA.', 'University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Stanford University, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', ""Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'West Cancer Center, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Health Sciences North, Sudbury, ON, Canada.', 'Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.', 'Bennet Cancer Center, Stamford, CT, USA.', 'Auxillio Cancer Center, San Juan, Puerto Rico.', ""St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""St. Luke's Mountain States Tumor Institute, Boise, ID, USA."", 'Royal Victoria Hospital, Barrie, ON, Canada.', 'Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170417,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,PMC5737737,['NOTNLM'],"['*chemotherapy', '*haemotoxicity', '*lymphomas']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14667 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Jul;178(2):250-256. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14667.

However, for patients with leukaemia, there is a risk of malignant cell transmission. Our objective was to evaluate minimal disseminated disease in OT from leukaemia patients and test a follicle isolation technique to obtain disease-free follicle suspensions. Cryopreserved OT from 12 leukaemia patients was thawed and analysed by histology and long-term xenografting in immunosuppressed mice. In 10 patients, follicles were isolated from OT, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on tissue, digested ovarian suspensions and isolated follicle suspensions to investigate leukaemic cell presence. Mean patient age was 17.1 years. An average of 3.2 follicles were isolated per mm(2) of cortex. Xenografting of OT induced leukaemic masses in 2/12 mice. PCR identified leukaemic cell presence in 66% of OT. Malignant cells were also detected in digested ovarian suspensions. However, none of the follicle samples (>2300 follicles tested) showed any malignant cell presence after washing. This study demonstrates that it is possible to recover large numbers of viable follicles from cryopreserved OT of leukaemia patients. All isolated and washed follicle suspensions tested negative for leukaemic cells, giving leukaemia patients genuine hope of fertility restoration.","['Soares, Michelle', 'Saussoy, Pascale', 'Maskens, Mathilde', 'Reul, Helene', 'Amorim, Christiani A', 'Donnez, Jacques', 'Dolmans, Marie-Madeleine']","['Soares M', 'Saussoy P', 'Maskens M', 'Reul H', 'Amorim CA', 'Donnez J', 'Dolmans MM']","['Pole de Recherche en Gynecologie, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Departement de Gynecologie, Cliniques Universitaires St. Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Departement de Biologie Clinique, Cliniques Universitaires St. Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pole de Recherche en Gynecologie, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pole de Recherche en Gynecologie, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pole de Recherche en Gynecologie, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', ""Societe de Recherche pour l'Infertilite, Brussels, Belgium."", 'Pole de Recherche en Gynecologie, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Departement de Gynecologie, Cliniques Universitaires St. Luc, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170417,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Oncofertility', '*artificial ovary', '*fertility preservation', '*leukaemia', '*minimal disseminated disease', '*ovarian metastasis']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14657 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Jul;178(2):231-239. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14657.

Methods: An 11-year-old girl presented with an enlarged mass on her left arm and underwent an incisional biopsy. Results: Histopathologic examination and immunohistochemistry studies showed a monotonous proliferation of blasts that were CD4-, CD56+, and CD123+. There was no evidence of leukemic dissemination. Next-generation sequencing detected PBRM1 and CIC gene abnormalities. We confirmed and validated a novel PBRM1 mutation by conventional polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Conclusions: CD4- variant of BPDCN may be mistaken for myeloid sarcoma or extramedullary lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma because of their overlapping morphologic and immunophenotypic features; thus, a careful clinicopathologic evaluation is essential to reach the correct diagnosis. PBRM1 mutation seems to be a driver event in this case.

Methods: Next-generation sequencing results of 75 cases of PMF, 33 cases of PV, and 27 cases of ET were compared. Results: Mutation rates of ASXL1 and SRSF2 were significantly higher in PMF than in PV or ET. ASXL1 mutations appeared to be more frequently associated with risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia than JAK2 or TET2 mutations. The most common mutation-cytogenetic combinations in myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) were mutations of JAK2 or ASXL1 with del(20q) and were more common in patients with PMF and PV than in patients with ET. Differences were also found between patients with PMF and PV. Conclusions: PMF, PV, and ET show different mutational profiles, which may be helpful in resolving the differential diagnosis between MPNs.

However, the relevant molecular mechanism of the mutation in AML pathogenesis remains obscure. In this study, we established K562 and SKM1 cell model carrying the DNMT3A R882H mutation via transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, and discovered that mutated DNMT3A could promote the proliferative capability of malignant cell clones. Further RNA microarray analysis revealed that some genes crucial for glutathione (GSH) synthesis, including CTH, PSPH, PSAT1 and especially SLC7A11 (the cysteine/glutamate transporter) were significantly up-regulated, which resulted in significant elevation of intracellular GSH levels. A subsequent experiment demonstrated that the mutant clones are resistant to chemotherapy as well as SLC7A11-inhibitorsBy shRNA induced SLC7A11 silencing, we discovered profoundly decreased cellular GSH and cell proliferative ability of DNMT3A mutated clones. Our results provided novel insight into the role of the DNMT3A R882H mutation in AML pathogenesis and suggested that targeting the cellular GSH synthetic pathway could enhance the current therapy for AML patients with the DNMT3A R882H mutation.","['Yang, Li', ""Liu, Ya'Nan"", 'Zhang, Na', ""Ding, Xiao'Yi"", 'Zhang, Wei', ""Shen, Ke'Feng"", 'Huang, Liang', ""Zhou, Jian'Feng"", 'Cui, Sen', ""Zhu, Zun'Min"", 'Hu, Zheng', 'Xiao, Min']","['Yang L', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang N', 'Ding X', 'Zhang W', 'Shen K', 'Huang L', 'Zhou J', 'Cui S', 'Zhu Z', 'Hu Z', 'Xiao M']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, P.R.China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei Province, P.R.

Current treatment regiments have significantly improved the overall outcomes even if higher risk subgroups - those harboring TP53 mutations or deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p) - remain highly challenging. In the present work, we identified USP7, a known de-ubiquitinase with multiple roles in cellular homeostasis, as a potential therapeutic target in CLL. We demonstrated that in primary CLL samples and in CLL cell lines USP7 is: i) over-expressed through a mechanism involving miR-338-3p and miR-181b deregulation; ii) functionally activated by Casein Kinase 2 (CK2), an upstream interactor known to be deregulated in CLL; iii) effectively targeted by the USP7 inhibitor P5091. Treatment of primary CLL samples and cell lines with P5091 induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis, through the restoration of PTEN nuclear pool, both in TP53-wild type and -null environment. Importantly, PTEN acts as the main tumor suppressive mediator along the USP7-PTEN axis in a p53 dispensable manner.

Imatinib resistance often results from a secondary mutation in BCR-ABL1. However, in the absence of a mutation in BCR-ABL1, the basis of BCR-ABL1-independent resistance must be elucidated. To gain insight into the mechanisms of BCR-ABL1-independent imatinib resistance, we performed an array-based comparative genomic hybridization.

Combined treatment of K562/IR cells with imatinib and a MET inhibitor suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, but did not affect AKT activation.

Previously we demonstrated that overexpression of Hedgehog downstream mediators GLI1/2 confers an adverse prognosis to patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is correlated with a FLT3 mutated status. To analyze a possible non-canonical activation of the Hedgehog pathway via FLT3 and PI3K, we performed blocking experiments utilizing inhibitors for FLT3 (sunitinib), PI3K (PF-04691502) and GLI1/2 (GANT61) in FLT3-mutated and FLT3 wildtype AML cell lines and primary blasts. Combination of all three compounds had stronger anti-leukemic effects in FLT3-mutated compared to FLT3 wildtype AML cells in vitro. Interestingly, the colony growth of normal CD34+ cells from healthy donors was not impeded by the triple inhibitor combination possibly opening a therapeutic window for the clinical use of inhibitor combinations. Besides, combined treatment with sunitinib, PF-04691502 and GANT61 significantly prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with FLT3-mutated MV4-11 cells compared to the single agent treatments. Furthermore, the inhibition of FLT3 and PI3K resulted in reduced GLI protein expression and promotor activity in FLT3-mutated but not in FLT3 wildtype AML cell lines in western blotting and GLI1/2 promoter assays supporting our hypothesis of non-canonical GLI activation via FLT3.In summary, FLT3-mutated in contrast to FLT3 wildtype cells or normal human hematopoietic progenitor cells are exquisitely sensitive to combined inhibition by FLT3, PI3K and GLI1/2 overcoming some of the limitations of current FLT3 directed therapy in AML. The development of GLI1/2 inhibitors is highly desirable.","['Latuske, Emily-Marie', 'Stamm, Hauke', 'Klokow, Marianne', 'Vohwinkel, Gabi', 'Muschhammer, Jana', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Jucker, Manfred', 'Kebenko, Maxim', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Wellbrock, Jasmin']","['Latuske EM', 'Stamm H', 'Klokow M', 'Vohwinkel G', 'Muschhammer J', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Jucker M', 'Kebenko M', 'Fiedler W', 'Wellbrock J']","['Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5438723,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3', 'GLI', 'Hedgehog', 'non-canonical']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/04/25 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16304 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16304 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 25;8(17):29187-29201. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16304.,,20180424,,"['0 (Gli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gleevec's success in turning a fatal leukemia into a manageable chronic disease has been trumpeted in medical, economic, political and social circles because it is considered the first successful targeted therapy. Investments have been immense in omics analyses and while in some cases they greatly helped the management of patients, in others targeted therapies failed to achieve clinically stable recurrence-free disease course or to substantially extend survival. Nevertheless protein kinase controlling approaches have persisted despite early warnings that the targeted genomics narrative is overblown. Experimental and clinical observations with Phenformin suggest an alternative explanation for Gleevec's mode of action. Using 13C-guided precise flux measurements, a comparative multiple cell line study demonstrated the drug's downstream impact on submolecular fatty acid processing metabolic events that occurred independent of Gleevec's molecular target. Clinical observations that hyperlipidemia and diabetes are both reversed in mice and in patients taking Gleevec support the drugs' primary metabolic targets by biguanides and statins. This is evident by structural data demonstrating that Gleevec shows pyridine- and phenyl-guanidine homology with Phenformin and identical phenylcarbamoyl structural and ligand binding homology with Lipitor. The misunderstood mechanism of action of Gleevec is emblematic of the pervasive flawed reasoning that genomic analysis will lead to targeted, personalized diagnosis and therapy. The alternative perspective for Gleevec's mode of action may turn oncotargets towards metabolic channel reaction architectures in leukemia and melanoma, as well as in other cancers.","['Somlyai, Gabor', 'Collins, T Que', 'Meuillet, Emmanuelle J', 'Hitendra, Patel', ""D'Agostino, Dominic P"", 'Boros, Laszlo G']","['Somlyai G', 'Collins TQ', 'Meuillet EJ', 'Hitendra P', ""D'Agostino DP"", 'Boros LG']","['HYD, LLC for Cancer Research & Drug Development, Budapest, Hungary, European Union.', 'CignatureHealth Metabolic Clinic, Santa Monica, CA, USA.', 'EPIGENIX Foundation, El Segundo, CA, USA.', 'The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology, Morsani College of Medicine, Hyperbaric Biomedical Research Laboratory, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine, Westwood, CA, USA.', 'Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute (LABIOMED) at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA, USA.', 'SiDMAP, LLC, Culver City, CA, USA.', 'UCLA Clinical and Translational Science Institute, Torrance, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5564842,['NOTNLM'],"['deuterobolomics', 'imatinib', 'lipitor', 'metformin', 'phenformin']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/05/18 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16238 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16238 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 25;8(30):50187-50192. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16238.,,20180517,,"['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)', 'A0JWA85V8F (Atorvastatin)', 'DD5K7529CE (Phenformin)']",IM,"['Atorvastatin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Metformin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Phenformin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']","['K08 CA090403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AT003960/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000124/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001881/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although efficacious, current treatment regimens require a dosing holiday due to severe neutropenia potentially leading to an increased risk of infections, as well as tumor regrowth and emergence of drug resistance. Therefore, a next generation CDK4/6 inhibitor that can inhibit proliferation of CDK4/6-dependent tumors while minimizing neutropenia could reduce both the need for treatment holidays and the risk of inducing drug resistance.Here, we describe the preclinical characterization and development of G1T38; a novel, potent, selective, and orally bioavailable CDK4/6 inhibitor. In vitro, G1T38 decreased RB1 (RB) phosphorylation, caused a precise G1 arrest, and inhibited cell proliferation in a variety of CDK4/6-dependent tumorigenic cell lines including breast, melanoma, leukemia, and lymphoma cells. In vivo, G1T38 treatment led to equivalent or improved tumor efficacy compared to the first-in-class CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, in an ER+ breast cancer xenograft model. Furthermore, G1T38 accumulated in mouse xenograft tumors but not plasma, resulting in less inhibition of mouse myeloid progenitors than after palbociclib treatment. In larger mammals, this difference in pharmacokinetics allowed for 28 day continuous dosing of G1T38 in beagle dogs without producing severe neutropenia. These data demonstrate G1T38 has unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, which result in high efficacy against CDK4/6 dependent tumors while minimizing the undesirable on-target bone marrow activity, thus potentially allowing G1T38 to be used as a continuous, daily oral antineoplastic agent.","['Bisi, John E', 'Sorrentino, Jessica A', 'Jordan, Jamie L', 'Darr, David D', 'Roberts, Patrick J', 'Tavares, Francis X', 'Strum, Jay C']","['Bisi JE', 'Sorrentino JA', 'Jordan JL', 'Darr DD', 'Roberts PJ', 'Tavares FX', 'Strum JC']","['G1 Therapeutics, Preclinical Research and Development, Research Triangle Park, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'G1 Therapeutics, Preclinical Research and Development, Research Triangle Park, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'University of North Carolina, MP1U, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'University of North Carolina, MP1U, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'G1 Therapeutics, Preclinical Research and Development, Research Triangle Park, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'ChemoGenics BioPharma, Department of Chemistry, Research Triangle Park, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'G1 Therapeutics, Preclinical Research and Development, Research Triangle Park, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5522071,['NOTNLM'],"['CDK4/6', 'ER+ breast cancer', 'G1T38', 'NSCLC', 'cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/04/07 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16216 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16216 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 27;8(26):42343-42358. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16216.,,20180406,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'G9ZF61LE7G (palbociclib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have therefore created the first BRD9-directed chemical degraders, through iterative design and testing of heterobifunctional ligands that bridge the BRD9 bromodomain and the cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Degraders of BRD9 exhibit markedly enhanced potency compared to parental ligands (10- to 100-fold). Parallel study of degraders with divergent BRD9-binding chemotypes in models of acute myeloid leukemia resolves bromodomain polypharmacology in this emerging drug class. Together, these findings reveal the tractability of non-BET bromodomain containing proteins to chemical degradation, and highlight lead compound dBRD9 as a tool for the study of BRD9.","['Remillard, David', 'Buckley, Dennis L', 'Paulk, Joshiawa', 'Brien, Gerard L', 'Sonnett, Matthew', 'Seo, Hyuk-Soo', 'Dastjerdi, Shiva', 'Wuhr, Martin', 'Dhe-Paganon, Sirano', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Bradner, James E']","['Remillard D', 'Buckley DL', 'Paulk J', 'Brien GL', 'Sonnett M', 'Seo HS', 'Dastjerdi S', 'Wuhr M', 'Dhe-Paganon S', 'Armstrong SA', 'Bradner JE']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170418,Germany,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),0370543,PMC5967236,['NOTNLM'],"['*bromodomain', '*cancer', '*drug design', '*epigenetics', '*protein degradation']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2019/02/27 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/anie.201611281 [doi]'],ppublish,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2017 May 15;56(21):5738-5743. doi: 10.1002/anie.201611281.

Immunostaining on paraffin sections makes it possible to perform immunophenotyping in situ. However, normal bone marrow contains CD103-positive cells, which are not B cells, making it difficult to be certain about low-level involvement by HCL. OBJECTIVE: - To develop dual immunostaining for confirmation that CD103 is expressed in B cells, which may be highly desirable in assessing low-level involvement by HCL. DESIGN: - We developed a dual immunostaining approach using a B-cell marker, Pax5, expressed in the nucleus, in combination with a membrane marker, CD103. RESULTS: - We analyzed 6 HCLs, 7 marginal zone lymphomas, 12 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, 7 follicular lymphomas, 5 chronic lymphocytic leukemias, 5 mantle cell lymphomas, 1 multiple myeloma (lymphocytic variant), and 3 bone marrows not involved by any B-cell neoplasm. Our dual staining approach confirmed that only the neoplastic cells of HCL were positive for both CD103 and Pax5. CONCLUSIONS: - This dual-staining method is particularly helpful in cases with low-level involvement by HCL and can be used for determining minimal residual disease after treatment.","['Rozenvald, Igor B', 'Richardson, Maurice D', 'Brock, Lenessa', 'Maiese, Russell L']","['Rozenvald IB', 'Richardson MD', 'Brock L', 'Maiese RL']","['From AmeriPath Northeast, Shelton, Connecticut.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170418,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,,,,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/10/12 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/arpa.2016-0215-OA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2017 Jun;141(6):837-840. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2016-0215-OA.

Acquired mutations in BTK and PLCG2 can cause relapse, but data regarding the prevalence and natural history of these mutations are limited. Patients and Methods Patients accrued to four sequential studies of ibrutinib were included in these analyses. Deep sequencing for BTK and PLCG2 was performed retrospectively on patients who experienced relapse and prospectively on a screening population. Results With a median follow-up time of 3.4 years, the estimated cumulative incidence of progression at 4 years is 19% (95% CI, 14% to 24%). Baseline karyotypic complexity, presence of del(17)(p13.1), and age less than 65 years were risk factors for progression. Among patients who experienced relapse, acquired mutations of BTK or PLCG2 were found in 85% (95% CI, 71% to 94%), and these mutations were detected an estimated median of 9.3 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 11.7 months) before relapse. Of a group of 112 patients examined prospectively, eight patients have experienced relapse, and all of these patients had acquired resistance mutations before relapse. A resistance mutation was detected in an additional eight patients who have not yet met criteria for clinical relapse. Conclusion Relapse of chronic lymphocytic leukemia after ibrutinib is an issue of increasing clinical significance. We show that mutations in BTK and PLCG2 appear early and have the potential to be used as a biomarker for future relapse, suggesting an opportunity for intervention.","['Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Guinn, Daphne', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Blachly, James S', 'Lozanski, Arletta', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Zhao, Weiqiang', 'Coleman, Joshua', 'Jones, Daniel', 'Abruzzo, Lynne', 'Gordon, Amber', 'Mantel, Rose', 'Smith, Lisa L', 'McWhorter, Samantha', 'Davis, Melanie', 'Doong, Tzyy-Jye', 'Ny, Fan', 'Lucas, Margaret', 'Chase, Weihong', 'Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Flynn, Joseph M', 'Maddocks, Kami', 'Rogers, Kerry', 'Jaglowski, Samantha', 'Andritsos, Leslie A', 'Awan, Farrukh T', 'Blum, Kristie A', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Byrd, John C']","['Woyach JA', 'Ruppert AS', 'Guinn D', 'Lehman A', 'Blachly JS', 'Lozanski A', 'Heerema NA', 'Zhao W', 'Coleman J', 'Jones D', 'Abruzzo L', 'Gordon A', 'Mantel R', 'Smith LL', 'McWhorter S', 'Davis M', 'Doong TJ', 'Ny F', 'Lucas M', 'Chase W', 'Jones JA', 'Flynn JM', 'Maddocks K', 'Rogers K', 'Jaglowski S', 'Andritsos LA', 'Awan FT', 'Blum KA', 'Grever MR', 'Lozanski G', 'Johnson AJ', 'Byrd JC']","['All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'All authors: The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20170213,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC5455463,,,,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2016.70.2282 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2017 May 1;35(13):1437-1443. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2016.70.2282.

In this report, we detailed the pharmacologic properties of puquitinib, a novel, orally available PI3Kdelta inhibitor. Puquitinib, which binds to the ATP-binding pocket of PI3Kdelta, was highly selective and potent for PI3Kdelta relative to other PI3K isoforms and a panel of protein kinases, exhibiting low-nanomolar biochemical and cellular inhibitory potencies. Additional cellular profiling demonstrated that puquitinib inhibited proliferation, induced G1 -phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, through downregulation of PI3K signaling. In in vivo AML xenografts, puquitinib alone showed stronger efficacy than the well-known p110delta inhibitor, CAL-101, in association with a reduction in AKT and ERK phosphorylation in tumor tissues, without causing noticeable toxicity. Furthermore, the combination of puquitinib with cytotoxic drugs, especially daunorubicin, yielded significantly stronger antitumor efficacy compared with each agent alone. Thus, puquitinib is a promising agent with pharmacologic properties that are favorable for the treatment of AML.","['Xie, Chengying', 'He, Ye', 'Zhen, Mingyue', 'Wang, Yulan', 'Xu, Yongping', 'Lou, Liguang']","['Xie C', 'He Y', 'Zhen M', 'Wang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Lou L']","['Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170523,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC5497803,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CAL-101', 'PI3K signaling', 'PI3Kdelta', 'puquitinib']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/09/16 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13263 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2017 Jul;108(7):1476-1484. doi: 10.1111/cas.13263.

We previously described a recurrent t(X;6)(p11;q23) translocation generating an MYB-GATA1 fusion gene in male infants with ABL. To better understand its role, the chimeric MYB-GATA1 transcription factor was expressed in CD34-positive haematopoietic progenitors, which were transplanted into immunodeficient mice. Cells expressing MYB-GATA1 showed increased expression of markers of immaturity (CD34), of granulocytic lineage (CD33 and CD117), and of basophilic differentiation (CD203c and FcRI). UT-7 cells also showed basophilic differentiation after MYB-GATA1 transfection. A transcriptomic study identified nine genes deregulated by both MYB-GATA1 and basophilic differentiation. Induction of three of these genes (CCL23, IL1RL1, and NTRK1) was confirmed in MYB-GATA1-expressing CD34-positive cells by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Interleukin (IL)-33 and nerve growth factor (NGF), the ligands of IL-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1) and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1), respectively, enhanced the basophilic differentiation of MYB-GATA1-expressing UT-7 cells, thus demonstrating the importance of this pathway in the basophilic differentiation of leukaemic cells and CD34-positive primary cells. Finally, gene reporter assays confirmed that MYB and MYB-GATA1 directly activated NTRK1 and IL1RL1 transcription, leading to basophilic skewing of the blasts. MYB-GATA1 is more efficient than MYB, because of better stability. Our results highlight the role of IL-33 and NGF receptors in the basophilic differentiation of normal and leukaemic cells.

Some candidate gene variants are associated with its toxicities, but the major variants and effects of combined variants remain unclear. We used Cox regression analysis to evaluate the time-dependent association between candidate variants and the cumulative incidence of 6-MP intolerability in 95 Japanese patients. The major risk factors for severe leukopenia were ABCC4 rs3765534, NUDT15 rs116855232 and rs186364861 in multi-covariate analysis (P<0.05).

We aimed to describe early and late overall mortality, cause-specific mortality, and key adverse health outcomes in a large, single-institutional cohort of patients with ES. METHODS: Patients with ES diagnosed at age less than 40 years and treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering between 1974 and 2012 were included. Overall survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards were used to examine the association of clinical and pathologic variables with overall survival. Cause-specific mortality was evaluated with the cumulative incidence function accounting for competing risks. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with ES (60.3% male; median age at diagnosis: 16.8 years [range: 0.3-39]; 30.0% with metastatic disease at diagnosis) were followed for a median of 7.8 years (range: 0.2-37). Five-year overall survival was 65.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 59.8-71.1%) for the entire cohort; 78.6% for those with localized disease; 40.1% for those with isolated pulmonary metastases; and 28.1% for those with extrapulmonary metastases. In multivariable analysis, older age at diagnosis, minority race/ethnicity, and metastatic disease at diagnosis were associated with inferior survival. Ten-year cumulative incidence of relapse/progression was 40.1%, with eight late relapses occurring at a median of 6.3 years after diagnosis (range: 5-14). Seventeen patients developed subsequent neoplasms (treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia = 9; solid tumors = 6; nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC] = 4). Excluding NMSC and melanoma in situ, the cumulative incidence of subsequent malignant neoplasms at 25 years was 15% (95% CI, 4.8-25.1%). CONCLUSION: Patients with ES are at high risk for relapse/progression and second cancers.","['Friedman, Danielle Novetsky', 'Chastain, Katherine', 'Chou, Joanne F', 'Moskowitz, Chaya S', 'Adsuar, Roberto', 'Wexler, Leonard H', 'Chou, Alexander J', 'DeRosa, Amelia', 'Candela, Joanne', 'Magnan, Heather', 'Pun, Shawn', 'Kahan, Tamara', 'Wolden, Suzanne L', 'Meyers, Paul A', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C']","['Friedman DN', 'Chastain K', 'Chou JF', 'Moskowitz CS', 'Adsuar R', 'Wexler LH', 'Chou AJ', 'DeRosa A', 'Candela J', 'Magnan H', 'Pun S', 'Kahan T', 'Wolden SL', 'Meyers PA', 'Oeffinger KC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Epidemiology-Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Epidemiology-Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20170418,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ewing sarcoma', 'risk', 'second cancers', 'survivors']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26562 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Nov;64(11). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26562.

Although trials of this therapy have produced impressive results, the in vitro methods they require to generate large numbers of tumour-specific T cells are too elaborate for widespread application to treat cancer patients. Here, we describe a method to quickly program circulating T cells with tumour-recognizing capabilities, thus avoiding these complications. Specifically, we demonstrate that DNA-carrying nanoparticles can efficiently introduce leukaemia-targeting CAR genes into T-cell nuclei, thereby bringing about long-term disease remission. These polymer nanoparticles are easy to manufacture in a stable form, which simplifies storage and reduces cost. Our technology may therefore provide a practical, broadly applicable treatment that can generate anti-tumour immunity 'on demand' for oncologists in a variety of settings.","['Smith, Tyrel T', 'Stephan, Sirkka B', 'Moffett, Howell F', 'McKnight, Laura E', 'Ji, Weihang', 'Reiman, Diana', 'Bonagofski, Emmy', 'Wohlfahrt, Martin E', 'Pillai, Smitha P S', 'Stephan, Matthias T']","['Smith TT', 'Stephan SB', 'Moffett HF', 'McKnight LE', 'Ji W', 'Reiman D', 'Bonagofski E', 'Wohlfahrt ME', 'Pillai SPS', 'Stephan MT']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Technology Access Foundation (TAF) Academy, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Technology Access Foundation (TAF) Academy, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Comparative Pathology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Technology Access Foundation (TAF) Academy, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Molecular Engineering &Sciences Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98105, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170417,England,Nat Nanotechnol,Nature nanotechnology,101283273,PMC5646367,,,,2017/04/19 06:00,2019/05/09 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['nnano.2017.57 [pii]', '10.1038/nnano.2017.57 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Nanotechnol. 2017 Aug;12(8):813-820. doi: 10.1038/nnano.2017.57.

Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, demonstrates promising clinical activity in CLL. It is reported that ibrutinib, additionally to directly targeting leukemic cells, also inhibits the interactions of these cells with T cells, macrophages and accessory cells. Assessment of these mechanisms is important because of their non -direct anti-leukemic effects and to identify possible side effects connected with long-term drug administration.The aim of this study was to assess the in vivo effects of ibrutinib on T-cell subpopulations and cytokine network in CLL. The analysis was performed on a group of 19 patients during first month of ibrutinib therapy. The standard multicolor flow cytometry and cytometric bead array methods were used for assessment of T-cell subsets and cytokines/chemokines, respectively.The data obtained indicates that Ibrutinib treatment results in changes in T-cell subpopulations and cytokine network in CLL patients. Particularly, a significant reduction of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood was observed. By targeting these populations of T cells Ibrutinib can stimulate rejection of tumor cells by the immune system.","['Podhorecka, Monika', 'Goracy, Aneta', 'Szymczyk, Agnieszka', 'Kowal, Malgorzata', 'Ibanez, Blanca', 'Jankowska-Lecka, Olga', 'Macheta, Arkadiusz', 'Nowaczynska, Aleksandra', 'Drab-Urbanek, Elzbieta', 'Chocholska, Sylwia', 'Jawniak, Dariusz', 'Hus, Marek']","['Podhorecka M', 'Goracy A', 'Szymczyk A', 'Kowal M', 'Ibanez B', 'Jankowska-Lecka O', 'Macheta A', 'Nowaczynska A', 'Drab-Urbanek E', 'Chocholska S', 'Jawniak D', 'Hus M']","['Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5471000,['NOTNLM'],"['T regulatory cells', 'T-cells', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'cytokines', 'ibrutinib']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16148 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16148 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 23;8(21):34661-34669. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16148.,,20180309,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrazoles/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*drug effects/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The small molecule inhibitor volasertib induces a mitotic block via inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 and has shown remarkable anti-leukemic activity when combined with low-dose cytarabine. We have demonstrated that AML cells are highly vulnerable to cell death in mitosis yet manage to escape a mitotic block through mitotic slippage by sustained proteasome-dependent slow degradation of cyclin B. Therefore, we tested whether interfering with mitotic slippage through proteasome inhibition arrests and kills AML cells more efficiently during mitosis. We show that therapeutic doses of bortezomib block the slow degradation of cyclin B during a volasertib-induced mitotic arrest in AML cell lines and patient-derived primary AML cells. In a xenotransplant mouse model of human AML, mice receiving volasertib in combination with bortezomib showed superior disease control compared to mice receiving volasertib alone, highlighting the potential therapeutic impact of this drug combination.","['Schnerch, Dominik', 'Schuler, Julia', 'Follo, Marie', 'Felthaus, Julia', 'Wider, Dagmar', 'Klingner, Kathrin', 'Greil, Christine', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Engelhardt, Monika', 'Wasch, Ralph']","['Schnerch D', 'Schuler J', 'Follo M', 'Felthaus J', 'Wider D', 'Klingner K', 'Greil C', 'Duyster J', 'Engelhardt M', 'Wasch R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Oncotest GmbH, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Oncotest GmbH, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5400573,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'APC/C', 'antimitotic therapy', 'mitotic slippage', 'proteasome inhibition']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/05/26 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['15503 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15503 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Mar 28;8(13):21153-21166. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15503.,,20170524,,"['0 (BI 6727)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pteridines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin B/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Frail Elderly', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Pteridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preclinical data suggest that TKI combinations may overcome resistance. We report on a heavily pre-treated 78 year-old female patient with CML who developed multi-resistant blast crisis with bone marrow fibrosis and a Ph- clone. Treatment with ponatinib resulted in blast cell clearance, decrease in fibrosis, and disappearance of BCR-ABL1, but also in severe thrombocytopenia with bleedings requiring platelet transfusions. We therefore switched from ponatinib to bosutinib. During bosutinib, platelet counts recovered. However, after 6 months, BCR-ABL1 mRNA levels increased to > 1%. Therefore, we switched back to ponatinib, and this was again followed by disappearance of BCR-ABL1 and a decrease in platelets. During the next 2 years, we applied ponatinib and bosutinib in continuous rotation-cycles and added hydroxyurea in order to suppress all sub-clones and to balance between efficacy and potential side effects following the principle of personalized medicine. With this approach the patient remained in complete molecular response and reached normal blood counts and a normal quality of life without vascular or other side effects. In conclusion, TKI rotation is a novel potent approach to suppress multiple resistant sub-clones and to balance between clinical efficacy and side effects in patients with advanced CML. Clinical trials are now warranted to show that TKI-rotation is in general safe and effective in these patients.","['Valent, Peter', 'Herndlhofer, Susanne', 'Schneeweiss, Mathias', 'Boidol, Bernd', 'Ringler, Anna', 'Kubicek, Stefan', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Hadzijusufovic, Emir', 'Mullauer, Leonhard', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Superti-Furga, Giulio', 'Mannhalter, Christine']","['Valent P', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Schneeweiss M', 'Boidol B', 'Ringler A', 'Kubicek S', 'Gleixner KV', 'Hoermann G', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Mullauer L', 'Sperr WR', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Mannhalter C']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Austria.', 'Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5410285,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1 mutations', 'CML', 'drug resistance', 'nilotinib', 'ponatinib']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['15481 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15481 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 4;8(14):23061-23072. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15481.,,20180112,,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aniline Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Substitution/*adverse effects/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Multiple Chronic Conditions/drug therapy', 'Nitriles/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyridazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Quinolines/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms of aberrant self-renewal underlying PLZF-mediated leukemogenesis are poorly understood. To investigate these mechanisms, comprehensive expression profiling of mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced with Plzf was performed, which revealed the involvement of a key transcriptional coactivator, Eya2, a target molecule shared by Plzf and PLZF-RARA, in the aberrant self-renewal. Indeed, PLZF-RARA as well as Plzf rendered those cells immortalized through upregulation of Eya2. Eya2 also led to immortalization without differentiation block, while depletion of Eya2 suppressed clonogenicity in cells immortalized by PLZF-RARA without influence on differentiation and apoptosis. Interestingly, cancer outlier profile analysis of human samples of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed a subtype of AML that strongly expressed EYA2 In addition, gene set enrichment analysis of human AML samples, including TCGA data, showed that this subtype of AML was more closely associated with the properties of leukemic stem cells in its gene expression signature than other AMLs. Therefore, EYA2 may be a target for molecular therapy in this subtype of AML, including PLZF-RARA APL.","['Ono, Ryoichi', 'Masuya, Masahiro', 'Ishii, Satomi', 'Katayama, Naoyuki', 'Nosaka, Tetsuya']","['Ono R', 'Masuya M', 'Ishii S', 'Katayama N', 'Nosaka T']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan onor-tky@umin.net nosaka@doc.medic.mie-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan onor-tky@umin.net nosaka@doc.medic.mie-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170615,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC5472835,['NOTNLM'],['*leukemia'],,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/09/14 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00585-16 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00585-16 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2017 Jun 15;37(13). pii: MCB.00585-16. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00585-16.

ARGalaxy consists of four parts: the demultiplex tool, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT) concatenate tool, the immune repertoire pipeline, and the somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) pipeline. Together they allow the analysis of all different aspects of the immune repertoire. All pipelines can be run independently or combined, depending on the available data and the question of interest. The demultiplex tool allows data trimming and demultiplexing, whereas with the concatenate tool multiple IMGT/HighV-QUEST output files can be merged into a single file. The immune repertoire pipeline is an extended version of our previously published ImmunoGlobulin Galaxy (IGGalaxy) virtual machine that was developed to visualize V(D)J gene usage. It allows analysis of both BCR and TCR rearrangements, visualizes CDR3 characteristics (length and amino acid usage) and junction characteristics, and calculates the diversity of the immune repertoire. Finally, ARGalaxy includes the newly developed SHM and CSR pipeline to analyze SHM and/or CSR in BCR rearrangements. It analyzes the frequency and patterns of SHM, Ag selection (including BASELINe), clonality (Change-O), and CSR. The functionality of the ARGalaxy tool is illustrated in several clinical examples of patients with primary immunodeficiencies. In conclusion, ARGalaxy is a novel tool for the analysis of the complete immune repertoire, which is applicable to many patient groups with disturbances in the immune repertoire such as autoimmune diseases, allergy, and leukemia, but it can also be used to address basic research questions in repertoire formation and selection.","['IJspeert, Hanna', 'van Schouwenburg, Pauline A', 'van Zessen, David', 'Pico-Knijnenburg, Ingrid', 'Stubbs, Andrew P', 'van der Burg, Mirjam']","['IJspeert H', 'van Schouwenburg PA', 'van Zessen D', 'Pico-Knijnenburg I', 'Stubbs AP', 'van der Burg M']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3015 CN Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3015 CN Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3015 CN Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3015 CE Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3015 CN Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3015 CE Rotterdam, the Netherlands m.vanderburg@erasmusmc.nl a.stubbs@erasmusmc.nl.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3015 CN Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and m.vanderburg@erasmusmc.nl a.stubbs@erasmusmc.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170417,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC5421304,,,,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/09/20 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1601921 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1601921 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2017 May 15;198(10):4156-4165. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1601921.

The molecular and genetic mechanisms in most patients with inherited platelet defects are unknown. There is now increasing evidence that mutations in hematopoietic TFs are an important underlying cause for defects in platelet production, morphology, and function. The hematopoietic TFs implicated in patients with impaired platelet function and number include runt-related transcription factor 1, Fli-1 proto-oncogene, E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factor (friend leukemia integration 1), GATA-binding protein 1, growth factor independent 1B transcriptional repressor, ETS variant 6, ecotropic viral integration site 1, and homeobox A11. These TFs act in a combinatorial manner to bind sequence-specific DNA within promoter regions to regulate lineage-specific gene expression, either as activators or repressors. TF mutations induce rippling downstream effects by simultaneously altering the expression of multiple genes. Mutations involving these TFs affect diverse aspects of megakaryocyte biology, and platelet production and function, culminating in thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction. Some are associated with predisposition to hematologic malignancies. These TF variants may occur more frequently in patients with inherited platelet defects than generally appreciated.

Comprehensive preclinical characterization of ABBV-075 demonstrated broad activity across cell lines and tumor models, representing a variety of hematologic malignancies and solid tumor indications. In most cancer cell lines derived from solid tumors, ABBV-075 triggers prominent G1 cell-cycle arrest without extensive apoptosis. In this study, we show that ABBV-075 efficiently triggers apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma cells. Apoptosis induced by ABBV-075 was mediated in part by modulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, exhibiting synergy with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in preclinical models of AML. In germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, BCL-2 levels or venetoclax sensitivity predicted the apoptotic response to ABBV-075 treatment. In vivo combination studies uncovered surprising benefits of low doses of ABBV-075 coupled with bortezomib and azacitidine treatment, despite the lack of in vitro synergy between ABBV-075 and these agents. The in vitro/in vivo activities of ABBV-075 described here may serve as a useful reference to guide the development of ABBV-075 and other BET family inhibitors for cancer therapy.

To validate this hypothesis in vivo, we developed a clinically relevant chemotherapeutic approach treating patient-derived xenografts (PDX) with cytarabine (AraC). AraC residual AML cells are enriched in neither immature, quiescent cells nor LSCs. Strikingly, AraC-resistant preexisting and persisting cells displayed high levels of reactive oxygen species, showed increased mitochondrial mass, and retained active polarized mitochondria, consistent with a high oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) status. AraC residual cells exhibited increased fatty-acid oxidation, upregulated CD36 expression, and a high OXPHOS gene signature predictive for treatment response in PDX and patients with AML. High OXPHOS but not low OXPHOS human AML cell lines were chemoresistant in vivo. Targeting mitochondrial protein synthesis, electron transfer, or fatty-acid oxidation induced an energetic shift toward low OXPHOS and markedly enhanced antileukemic effects of AraC. Together, this study demonstrates that essential mitochondrial functions contribute to AraC resistance in AML and are a robust hallmark of AraC sensitivity and a promising therapeutic avenue to treat AML residual disease.Significance: AraC-resistant AML cells exhibit metabolic features and gene signatures consistent with a high OXPHOS status. In these cells, targeting mitochondrial metabolism through the CD36-FAO-OXPHOS axis induces an energetic shift toward low OXPHOS and strongly enhanced antileukemic effects of AraC, offering a promising avenue to design new therapeutic strategies and fight AraC resistance in AML.

Classical Rfv3 studies utilized FV stocks containing lactate-dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV), a potent type I interferon inducer. Previously, we showed that APOBEC3 is required for the anti-FV activity of exogenous IFN-alpha treatment. Thus, type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) signaling may be required for the APOBEC3/Rfv3 response. RESULTS: To test if the APOBEC3/Rfv3 response is dependent on type I IFN signaling, we infected IFNAR knockout versus IFNAR/APOBEC3 double-knockout mice with FV/LDV or LDV-free FV, and evaluated acute FV infection and subsequent NAb titers. We show that LDV co-infection and type I IFN signaling are not required for innate APOBEC3-mediated restriction. By contrast, removal of LDV and/or type I IFN signaling abrogated the APOBEC3-dependent NAb response. CONCLUSIONS: APOBEC3 can restrict retroviruses in a type I IFN-independent manner in vivo. By contrast, the ability of APOBEC3 to promote NAb responses is type I IFN-dependent. These findings reveal novel insights on the interplay between type I IFNs and APOBEC3 in vivo that may have implications for augmenting antiretroviral NAb responses.","['Barrett, Bradley S', 'Harper, Michael S', 'Jones, Sean T', 'Guo, Kejun', 'Heilman, Karl J', 'Kedl, Ross M', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Santiago, Mario L']","['Barrett BS', 'Harper MS', 'Jones ST', 'Guo K', 'Heilman KJ', 'Kedl RM', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Santiago ML']","['Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID, NIH, Hamilton, MT, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA. mario.santiago@ucdenver.edu.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA. mario.santiago@ucdenver.edu.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado Denver, Mail Stop B-168, 12700 E 19th Avenue, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA. mario.santiago@ucdenver.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170417,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC5392950,['NOTNLM'],"['*Deaminase', '*Friend retrovirus', '*IFNAR', '*LDV', '*Neutralizing antibody']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/04/25 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-017-0349-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-017-0349-2 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2017 Apr 17;14(1):25. doi: 10.1186/s12977-017-0349-2.,,20170424,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7792-2706'],"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Ifnar1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology/physiology', 'Interferon Type I/*metabolism', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta/deficiency', '*Signal Transduction', '*Virus Replication']","['R01 AI116603/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007405/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008497/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HCMV infection may cause hepatitis and elevate the liver enzymes aspartate transferase (AST) and alanine transferase (ALT). This study aimed to analyse the associations between liver enzyme levels and infection with HCMV antigenaemia after BMT. Methods Data from 30 patients after BMT were collected at different time points (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 months post-transplantation). The patients were divided into the HCMV antigenaemia-positive and HCMV antigenaemia-negative groups according to a peripheral blood pp65 antigen assay. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify HCMV pp65 antigen and conventional methods were used to detect liver enzyme levels. Results Twelve patients were pp65 antigenaemia-positive and 10 patients were positive in the first 3 months post-transplant. Liver enzyme levels were increased after positivity for HCMV antigenaemia (p = 0.034 and p = 0.018 for ALT and AST, respectively). One month before antigenaemia, AST levels were higher in the HCMV antigenaemia-positive group compared with the negative group (p = 0.006). Conclusion HCMV antigenaemia mostly occurs in the early stage of post-BMT and early abnormal liver enzyme levels may increase the chance of HCMV antigenaemia after BMT.","['Ye, Baning', 'Zhao, Hong']","['Ye B', 'Zhao H']","[""1 Department of Intensive Care Unit, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."", '2 Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170219,England,J Int Med Res,The Journal of international medical research,0346411,PMC5536655,['NOTNLM'],"['Human cytomegalovirus', 'antigenaemia', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'liver enzymes']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/0300060516689013 [doi]'],ppublish,J Int Med Res. 2017 Apr;45(2):673-679. doi: 10.1177/0300060516689013.

Analysis of the effects of pan-PIM protein kinase inhibitors on human T-ALL cell lines demonstrated that the sensitive cell lines expressed higher PIM1 protein kinase levels, whereas T-ALL cell lines with NOTCH mutations tended to have lower levels of PIM1 kinase and were insensitive to these inhibitors. NOTCH-mutant cells selected for resistance to gamma secretase inhibitors developed elevated PIM1 kinase levels and increased sensitivity to PIM inhibitors. Gene profiling using a publically available T-ALL dataset demonstrated overexpression of PIM1 in the majority of early T-cell precursor (ETP)-ALLs and a small subset of non-ETP ALL. While the PIM inhibitors blocked growth, they also stimulated ERK and STAT5 phosphorylation, demonstrating that activation of additional signaling pathways occurs with PIM inhibitor treatment. To block these pathways, Ponatinib, a broadly active tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia, was added to this PIM-inhibitor regimen. The combination of Ponatinib with a PIM inhibitor resulted in synergistic T-ALL growth inhibition and marked apoptotic cell death. Treatment of mice engrafted with human T-ALL with these two agents significantly decreased the tumor burden and improved the survival of treated mice. This dual therapy has the potential to be developed as a novel approach to treat T-ALL with high PIM expression.","['Padi, Sathish K R', 'Luevano, Libia A', 'An, Ningfei', 'Pandey, Ritu', 'Singh, Neha', 'Song, Jin H', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong', 'Mehrotra, Shikhar', 'Kraft, Andrew S']","['Padi SKR', 'Luevano LA', 'An N', 'Pandey R', 'Singh N', 'Song JH', 'Aster JC', 'Yu XZ', 'Mehrotra S', 'Kraft AS']","['University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Division, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5444737,['NOTNLM'],"['ETP-ALL', 'PIM kinase', 'T-ALL', 'ponatinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16320 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16320 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 2;8(18):30199-30216. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16320.,,20180305,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['P30 CA023074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA138313/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES006694/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathways regulating GD2 expression, and their anomalous functions in BCSC, are unclear. Proteomic analysis of GD2+ and GD2- cells from breast cancer cell lines revealed the activation of NFkappaB signaling in GD2+ cells. Dose- and time-dependent suppression of NFkappaB signaling by the small molecule inhibitor BMS-345541 reduced GD2+ cells by > 90%. Likewise, BMS-345541 inhibited BCSC GD3S expression, mammosphere formation, and cell migration/invasion in vitro. Breast tumor-bearing mice treated with BMS-345541 showed a statistically significant decrease in tumor volume and exhibited prolonged survival compared to control mice, with a median survival of 78 d for the BMS-345541-treated group vs. 58 d for the controls. Moreover, in an experimental metastases model, treatment with BMS-345541 reduced the lung metastases by > 5-fold. These data suggest that GD2 expression and function,and NFkappaB signaling, are related, and they control BCSCs tumorigenic characteristics. Thus, the suppression of NFkappaB signaling by BMS-345541 is a potentially important advance in controlling breast cancer growth and metastases.","['Battula, Venkata Lokesh', 'Nguyen, Khoa', 'Sun, Jeff', 'Pitner, Mary Kathryn', 'Yuan, Bin', 'Bartholomeusz, Chandra', 'Hail, Numsen', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Battula VL', 'Nguyen K', 'Sun J', 'Pitner MK', 'Yuan B', 'Bartholomeusz C', 'Hail N', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Breast Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Breast Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Breast Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5514883,['NOTNLM'],"['GD2', 'GD3 synthase', 'NFkappaB', 'breast cancer', 'cancer stem cells']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/03/20 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16294 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16294 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 6;8(23):36936-36949. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16294.,,20180319,,"[""0 (4(2'-aminoethyl)amino-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxaline)"", '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '65988-71-8 (ganglioside, GD2)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.8 (alpha-N-acetylneuraminate alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gangliosides/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Quinoxalines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Sialyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In stable aneuploid cells NTRC 0066-0 induced acute CIN, whereas in cells with high levels of pre-existing CIN there was only a small additional fraction of cells mis-segregating their chromosomes. In proliferation assays stable aneuploid cells were more sensitive than cell lines with pre-existing CIN. Tetraploids are thought to be an intermediate between diploid and unstable aneuploid cells. TTK inhibitors had the same potency on post-tetraploid and parental diploid cells, which is remarkable because the post-tetraploids are more resistant to mitotic drugs. Finally, we confirm that the reference compound reversine is a TTK inhibitor and like NTRC 0066-0, inhibits the proliferation of patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids. In contrast, treatment with TTK inhibitor did not reduce the viability of non-proliferating T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells samples. Consequently, TTK inhibitor therapy is expected to spare non-dividing cells, and may be used to target stable aneuploid tumors.","['Libouban, Marion A A', 'de Roos, Jeroen A D M', 'Uitdehaag, Joost C M', 'Willemsen-Seegers, Nicole', 'Mainardi, Sara', 'Dylus, Jelle', 'de Man, Jos', 'Tops, Bastiaan', 'Meijerink, Jules P P', 'Storchova, Zuzana', 'Buijsman, Rogier C', 'Medema, Rene H', 'Zaman, Guido J R']","['Libouban MAA', 'de Roos JADM', 'Uitdehaag JCM', 'Willemsen-Seegers N', 'Mainardi S', 'Dylus J', 'de Man J', 'Tops B', 'Meijerink JPP', 'Storchova Z', 'Buijsman RC', 'Medema RH', 'Zaman GJR']","['Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany.', 'Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Translational Research Center B.V., Oss, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5503534,['NOTNLM'],"['Mps1', 'TTK', 'aneuploidy', 'chromosome instability', 'kinase inhibitor']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/04/05 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16213 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16213 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 13;8(24):38309-38325. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16213.,,20180404,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.1 (TTK protein, human)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromosomal Instability/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To provide a better understanding of a prenatal origin of leukemia, umbilical cord blood from 500 newborns was screened for the presence of the most frequent PFG associated with pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This screening revealed relatively high incidence of ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL1 (p190) and MLL-AF4 at very low frequencies, averaging ~14 copies per 100,000 cells. We assume that most of these PFG might originate relatively late in embryonic/fetal development and will be eliminated later during postnatal development. The obtained results suggested that higher PFG copy numbers originating in specific time windows of the hematopoietic stem cell hierarchy may define a better prognostic tool for the assessment of leukemogenic potential. We have observed no significant effect of low-copy PFG on radiation-induced DNA damage response, accumulation of endogenous DNA double-stranded breaks, and apoptosis in either lymphocytes or HSPC. Imaging flow cytometry showed lower level of gammaH2AX foci in HSPC in comparison to lymphocytes suggesting better protection of HSPC from DNA damage.","['Kosik, Pavol', 'Skorvaga, Milan', 'Durdik, Matus', 'Jakl, Lukas', 'Nikitina, Ekaterina', 'Markova, Eva', 'Kozics, Katarina', 'Horvathova, Eva', 'Belyaev, Igor']","['Kosik P', 'Skorvaga M', 'Durdik M', 'Jakl L', 'Nikitina E', 'Markova E', 'Kozics K', 'Horvathova E', 'Belyaev I']","['Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Tomsk, Russia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5482620,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage response', 'apoptosis', 'pre-leukemic fusion genes', 'stem cells']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16211 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16211 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 30;8(22):35824-35834. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16211.,,20180326,,"['0 (Cell-Free Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/radiation effects', '*Cell-Free Nucleic Acids', '*DNA Damage/radiation effects', 'DNA Repair', '*Fetal Blood', '*Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/epidemiology/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we showed that xanthohumol (XN) induces paraptosis of leukemia cells. The paraptosis is one cell death which is characterized by dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum and/or mitochondria. The results demonstrated that XN treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation and triggered extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation of HL-60 leukemia cells, but it did not cause the cleavage of caspase-3 protein or apoptosis. In contrast, XN treatment resulted in LC3-II accumulation through blocking of autophagosome maturation. Interestingly, the induction of cytoplasmic vacuolization by XN is not associated with autophagy modulated by XN, therefore, XN-induced cell death of HL-60 leukemia cells is not the classical apoptotic cell death. Intriguingly, XN treatment triggered the dilatation of endoplasma reticulum (ER) and induced ER stress by upregulating C/EBP homologous protein and unfolded protein response regulator Grp78/Bip. Furthermore, XN treatment triggered p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and its specific inhibitor inhibited the paraptosis of HL-60 leukemia cells by XN. In conclusion, we for the first time demonstrated that XN treatment can induce paraptosis of leukemia cells through activation of p38 MAPK signaling.","['Mi, Xiangquan', 'Wang, Chunming', 'Sun, Chao', 'Chen, Xu', 'Huo, Xiang', 'Zhang, Yiming', 'Li, Gang', 'Xu, Bo', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Xie, Jianxin', 'Wang, Zhenhua', 'Li, Ji']","['Mi X', 'Wang C', 'Sun C', 'Chen X', 'Huo X', 'Zhang Y', 'Li G', 'Xu B', 'Zhang J', 'Xie J', 'Wang Z', 'Li J']","['School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, P.R.

Thus, determining how cells cope with replicative stress can help our understanding of oncogenesis and lead to the identification of new antitumor treatment targets. We previously showed that constitutive overexpression of the oncogenic transcription factor Spi1/PU.1 leads to pre-leukemic cells that have a shortened S phase duration with an increased replication fork speed and increased mutability in the absence of DNA breaks. Here, we demonstrate that the S phase checkpoint protein CHK1 is maintained in a low phosphorylation state in Spi1/PU.1-overexpressing cells and provide evidence that this is not due to negative control of its primary kinase ATR. Notably, we found that the expression of the CHK1 phosphatase PP1alpha is increased in Spi1/PU.1-overexpressing cells. By exogenously modulating its activity, we demonstrate that PP1alpha is required to maintain CHK1 in a dephosphorylated state and, more importantly, that it is responsible for the accelerated replication fork progression in Spi1/PU.1-overexpressing cells. These results identify a novel pathway by which an oncogene influences replication in the absence of DNA damage.","['Rimmele, Pauline', 'Esposito, Michela', 'Delestre, Laure', 'Guervilly, Jean-Hugues', 'Ridinger-Saison, Maya', 'Despras, Emmanuelle', 'Moreau-Gachelin, Francoise', 'Rosselli, Filippo', 'Guillouf, Christel']","['Rimmele P', 'Esposito M', 'Delestre L', 'Guervilly JH', 'Ridinger-Saison M', 'Despras E', 'Moreau-Gachelin F', 'Rosselli F', 'Guillouf C']","['Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U830, Paris, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Inserm U1170, Villejuif, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Inserm U1170, Villejuif, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'CNRS UMR8200, Equipe Labellisee La Ligue Contre Le Cancer, Villejuif, France.', 'Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U830, Paris, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'CNRS UMR8200, Equipe Labellisee La Ligue Contre Le Cancer, Villejuif, France.', 'Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U830, Paris, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'CNRS UMR8200, Equipe Labellisee La Ligue Contre Le Cancer, Villejuif, France.', 'Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U830, Paris, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Inserm U1170, Villejuif, France.', 'CNRS, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5514894,['NOTNLM'],"['CHK1', 'DNA replication', 'PP1', 'Spi1/PU.1 oncogene', 'leukemia']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/03/20 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16183 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16183 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 6;8(23):37104-37114. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16183.,,20180319,,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1/genetics/*metabolism', '*DNA Replication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, although 2i could sustain ES cells self-renewal, LIF is routinely added. The roles of Stat3 activation are still unclear now. Here we investigated whether Jak/Stat3 might also contribute to the induction of ground state pluripotency. We introduced a lentiviral construct with 7-repeat Stat3-binding sequence to drive Renilla luciferase into ES cells, which can be used as a reporter to detect Stat3 activation by noninvasive bioluminescence imaging. Using this ES cells, we investigated the role of Stat3 activation in ground state maintenance. The results showed that Stat3 could be activated by 2i. Stattic, a chemical inhibitor of Stat3 phosphorylation, could effectively inhibit Stat3 activation in ES cells. When Stat3 activation was suppressed, ground state related genes were down regulated, and ES cells could not be maintained the ground state pluripotency even in 2i medium. All of these results indicate Stat3 activation is required in ground state maintenance.","['Wang, Dan', 'Sang, Hui', 'Zhang, Kaiyue', 'Nie, Yan', 'Zhao, Shuang', 'Zhang, Yan', 'He, Ningning', 'Wang, Yuebing', 'Xu, Yang', 'Xie, Xiaoyan', 'Li, Zongjin', 'Liu, Na']","['Wang D', 'Sang H', 'Zhang K', 'Nie Y', 'Zhao S', 'Zhang Y', 'He N', 'Wang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Xie X', 'Li Z', 'Liu N']","['Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Lab, Beijing Institute of Transfusion Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5458203,['NOTNLM'],"['Stat3 signal pathway', 'embryonic stem cell', 'ground state', 'imaging']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16112 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16112 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 9;8(19):31227-31237. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16112.,,20180326,,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated a novel Fc-engineered antibody against CD157 (MEN1112) for its suitability as immunotherapy in AML. CD157 was expressed in 97% of primary AML patient samples. A significant, albeit lower expression level of CD157 was observed within the compartment of leukemia-initiating cells, which are supposed to be the major source of relapse. In healthy donor bone marrow, CD157 was expressed on CD34+ cells. In ex vivo assays, MEN1112 triggered natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity against AML cell lines and primary AML cells. Compared to its parental analogue, the Fc-engineered antibody exhibited higher antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity responses. Using NK cells from AML patients, we observed heterogeneous MEN1112-mediated cytotoxicity against AML cells, most likely due to well-documented defects in AML-NK cells and corresponding inter-patient variations in NK cell function. Cytotoxicity could not be correlated to the time after completion of chemotherapy. In summary, we could demonstrate that CD157 is strongly expressed in AML. MEN1112 is a promising antibody construct that showed high cytotoxicity against AML cells and warrants further clinical testing. Due to variability in NK-cell function of AML patients, the time of application during the course of the disease as well as combinatorial strategies might influence treatment results.","['Krupka,

Meanwhile, 2-DG can kill cancer cells under normoxia. However, its efficacy is limited by the high-dose induced systemic toxicity. Here, we showed that low-dose 2-DG could be used as a single agent to kill acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, and as a GC sensitizer to overcome GC resistance under normoxia. Addition of exogenous mannose, a sugar essential for N-linked glycosylation, rescued 2-DG-treated ALL cells, indicating that inhibition of N-linked glycosylation and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress is the main mechanism for 2-DG to induce cell death and reverse GC resistance in ALL cells. These data provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in GC resistance. More important, it indicates that 2-DG might be the promising drug for designing novel high efficiency and low toxic protocol for ALL patients.","['Gu, Ling', 'Yi, Zhihui', 'Zhang, Yanle', 'Ma, Zhigui', 'Zhu, Yiping', 'Gao, Ju']","['Gu L', 'Yi Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma Z', 'Zhu Y', 'Gao J']","['Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, West China University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children, Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5458182,['NOTNLM'],"['2-deoxy-D-glucose', 'N-Linked glycosylation', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'glucocorticoid resistance', 'glycolysis']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16046 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16046 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 9;8(19):30978-30991. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16046.,,20180326,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deoxyglucose/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis and repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) are vital processes in leukemogenesis. High doses of ionizing radiation are the best known agent that induces leukemia, but less is known about the leukemogenic potential of low doses. While umbilical cord blood (UCB) serves as a valuable source of the HSPC for both research and clinics, the data on DNA damage response and apoptosis in UCB HSPC are very limited. We have studied apoptosis and DSB in the UCB-derived CD34+HSPC and CD34- lymphocytes at different time points post-irradiation with low and therapeutic doses of gamma-rays. DSB were enumerated with gammaH2AX foci using imaging flow cytometry. Different stages of apoptosis were analyzed using Annexin/7-AAD assay and gammaH2AX pan-staining by flow cytometry and imaging flow cytometry, respectively. Our results have consistently shown significantly higher resistance of CD34+ stem/progenitor cells to endogenous and radiation induced apoptosis as compared to CD34- lymphocytes. At the same time, no statistically significant difference was found in DSB repair between HSPC and lymphocytes as enumerated by the gammaH2AX foci. To conclude, we show for the first time that hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells are less prone to undergo apoptosis than lymphocytes what may be accounted for higher expression of anti-apoptotic proteins in CD34+ cells but was unlikely dealt with DSB repair.","['Durdik, Matus', 'Kosik, Pavol', 'Kruzliakova, Jana', 'Jakl, Lukas', 'Markova, Eva', 'Belyaev, Igor']","['Durdik M', 'Kosik P', 'Kruzliakova J', 'Jakl L', 'Markova E', 'Belyaev I']","['Laboratory of Radiobiology, Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Laboratory of Radiobiology, Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Laboratory of Radiobiology, Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Laboratory of Radiobiology, Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Laboratory of Radiobiology, Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Laboratory of Radiobiology, Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5564729,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'flow cytometry', 'imagestream', 'imaging flow cytometry', 'gammaH2AX']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16455 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16455 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jul 25;8(30):48846-48853. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16455.,,20180423,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics/radiation effects', 'Biomarkers', '*DNA Damage/radiation effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gamma Rays', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/radiation effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated circular RNAs (circRNAs) are implicated in pathogenic processes; however, no research has indicated circRNAs are involved in resistance to disease. In this study, over 1800 circRNAs were detected by circRNA sequencing of liver tissues from ALV-J-resistant (n = 3) and ALV-J-susceptible chickens (n = 3). 32 differentially expressed circRNAs were selected for analyzing including 12 upregulated in ALV-J-resistant chickens and 20 upregulated in ALV-J-susceptible chickens, besides, the top five microRNAs (miRNAs) for 12 upregulated circRNAs in ALV-J-resistant chickens were analyzed. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses were performed for miRNA target genes, the predicted genes were mainly involved in immune pathways. This study provides the first evidence that circRNA alterations are involved in resistance to ALV-J-induced tumor formation.

We propose that TQ curbs cancer cell growth through dysfunction of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). Molecular docking analysis revealed that TQ might interact with the catalytic pocket of DNMT1 and compete with co-factor SAM/SAH for DNMT1 inhibition. In vitro inhibitory assays showed that TQ decreases DNMT1 methylation activity in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent IC50 of 30 nM. Further, exposure of leukemia cell lines and patient primary cells to TQ resulted in DNMT1 downregulation, mechanistically, through dissociation of Sp1/NFkB complex from DNMT1 promoter. This led to a reduction of DNA methylation, a decrease of colony formation and an increase of cell apoptosis via the activation of caspases. In addition, we developed and validated a sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method and successfully detected a dynamic change of TQ in mouse plasma after administration of TQ through the tail vein, and determined a tolerable dose of TQ to be 15 mg/kg in mouse. TQ administration into leukemia-bearing mice induced leukemia regression, as indicated by the reversed splenomegaly and the inhibited leukemia cell growth in lungs and livers. Our study for the first time demonstrates that DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation mediates the anticancer actions of TQ, opening a window to develop TQ as a novel DNA hypomethylating agent for leukemia therapy.","['Pang, Jiuxia', 'Shen, Na', 'Yan, Fei', 'Zhao, Na', 'Dou, Liping', 'Wu, Lai-Chu', 'Seiler, Christopher L', 'Yu, Li', 'Yang, Ke', 'Bachanova, Veronika', 'Weaver, Eric', 'Tretyakova, Natalia Y', 'Liu, Shujun']","['Pang J', 'Shen N', 'Yan F', 'Zhao N', 'Dou L', 'Wu LC', 'Seiler CL', 'Yu L', 'Yang K', 'Bachanova V', 'Weaver E', 'Tretyakova NY', 'Liu S']","['The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43021, USA.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing 100853, China.', ""Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Stem Cell Therapy, The Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Prairie Pharms LLC, Nora Springs, IA 50458, USA.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN 55912, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5470982,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'DNA methyltransferase', 'bioactive compounds', 'leukemia', 'thymoquinone']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/03/23 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2017/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16431 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16431 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 23;8(21):34453-34467. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16431.,,20180322,,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'O60IE26NUF (thymoquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoquinones/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Catalytic Domain/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000114/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR000113/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA155915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that ERRF also plays an important role in the response of ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells to lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor that interrupts the ERBB2 and EGFR pathway. In ERBB2-positive breast cancer cell lines, lower levels of ERRF expression correlated with lapatinib resistance, restoration of ERRF expression in lapatinib-resistant cell lines JIMT-1 and MDA-MB-453 enhanced their lapatinib responses, and knockdown of ERRF in lapatinib sensitive cell lines BT-474 and SK-BR-3 caused lapatinib resistance. ERRF-enhanced lapatinib sensitivity was also confirmed in xenograft tumors of JIMT-1 cells. In patients with ERBB2-positive breast cancer, higher level of ERRF expression correlated with both pathologic complete response (pCR) to lapatinib and better survival. Mechanistically, ERRF expression in resistant cells promoted lapatinib-induced apoptosis by attenuating MCL1 and ERBB2 expression. These results suggest that ERRF plays an important role in lapatinib response of ERBB2-positive breast cancer, and further study of ERRF could lead to improved prediction and sensitivity of lapatinib response.","['Qi, Leilei', 'Zhang, Baotong', 'Zhang, Shiying', 'Ci, Xinpei', 'Wu, Qiao', 'Ma, Gui', 'Luo, Ang', 'Fu, Liya', 'King, Jamie L', 'Nahta, Rita', 'Dong, Jin-Tang']","['Qi L', 'Zhang B', 'Zhang S', 'Ci X', 'Wu Q', 'Ma G', 'Luo A', 'Fu L', 'King JL', 'Nahta R', 'Dong JT']","['Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Emory Winship Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Emory Winship Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.', 'Emory Winship Cancer Institute, Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China.', 'Emory Winship Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5482638,['NOTNLM'],"['ERBB2', 'ERRF', 'breast cancer', 'drug resistance', 'lapatinib']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16425 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16425 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 30;8(22):36054-36066. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16425.,,20180326,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SRARP protein, human)', '0VUA21238F (Lapatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lapatinib', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We noticed that ALL-related GATA3 polymorphism located around in the tissue-specific enhancer, and significantly associated with GATA3 expression. Although the regulatory network of GATA3 has been well reported in T cells, the functional status of GATA3 is poorly understood in B-ALL. We thus conducted genome-wide gene expression association analyses to reveal expression associated genes and pathways in nine independent B-ALL patient cohorts. In B-ALL patients, 173 candidates were identified to be significantly associated with GATA3 expression, including some reported GATA3-related genes (e.g., ITM2A) and well-known tumor-related genes (e.g., STAT4). Some of the candidates exhibit tissue-specific and subtype-specific association with GATA3. Through overexpression and down-regulation of GATA3 in leukemia cell lines, several reported and novel GATA3 regulated genes were validated. Moreover, association of GATA3 expression and its targets can be impacted by SNPs (e.g., rs4894953), which locate in the potential GATA3 binding motif. Our findings suggest that GATA3 may be involved in multiple tumor-related pathways (e.g., STAT/JAK pathway) in B-ALL to impact leukemogenesis through epigenetic regulation.","['Hou, Qianqian', 'Liao,

Greater precision identifying persons likely to relapse is important. We did bio-informatics analyses of transcriptomic data to identify mRNA transcripts aberrantly-expressed in B-cell ALL. We selected 9 candidate genes for validation 7 of which proved significantly-associated with B-cell ALL. We next focused on function and clinical correlations of the cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to examine gene transcript levels in bone marrow samples from 236 adults with B-cell ALL compared with samples from normals. CSRP2 was over-expressed in 228 out of 236 adults (97%) with newly-diagnosed B-cell ALL. A prognostic value was assessed in 168 subjects. In subjects with normal cytogenetics those with high CSRP2 transcript levels had a higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and worse relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with subjects with low transcript levels (56% [95% confidence interval, 53, 59%] vs. 19% [18, 20%]; P = 0.011 and 41% [17, 65%] vs. 80% [66-95%]; P = 0.007). In multivariate analyses a high CSRP2 transcript level was independently-associated with CIR (HR = 5.32 [1.64-17.28]; P = 0.005) and RFS (HR = 5.56 [1.87, 16.53]; P = 0.002). Functional analyses indicated CSRP2 promoted cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, in vitro colony formation and cell migration ability. Abnormal CSRP2 expression was associated with resistance to chemotherapy; sensitivity was restored by down-regulating CSRP2 expression.","['Wang, Shu-Juan', 'Wang, Ping-Zhang', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Liu, Yan-Rong', 'Lai, Yue-Yun', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Ruan, Guo-Rui']","['Wang SJ', 'Wang PZ', 'Gale RP', 'Qin YZ', 'Liu YR', 'Lai YY', 'Jiang H', 'Jiang Q', 'Zhang XH', 'Jiang B', 'Xu LP', 'Huang XJ', 'Liu KY', 'Ruan GR']","[""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Ministry of Health, China, Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics, Beijing, China.', 'Hematology Research Center, Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', ""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital and Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5482632,['NOTNLM'],"['CSRP2', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'prognostic factor', 'relapse']",,2017/04/19 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/19 06:00'],"['2016/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['16416 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16416 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 30;8(22):35984-36000. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16416.,,20180326,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CSRP2 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Muscle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the current delipidation and decellularization methods either involve tedious and lengthy processes or require toxic chemicals, which may result in the elimination of vital proteins and growth factors found in the ECM. Hence, an alternative delipidation and decellularization method for adipose tissue was developed using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) that eliminates the need of any harsh chemicals and also reduces the amount of processing time required. The resultant SC-CO2-treated ECM material showed an absence of nuclear content but the preservation of key proteins such as collagen Type I, collagen Type III, collagen Type IV, elastin, fibronectin and laminin. In addition, other biological factors such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were also retained. Subsequently, the resulting SC-CO2-treated ECM material was used as a bioactive coating on tissue culture plastic (TCP). Four different cell types including adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), immortalized human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells and human monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) were used in this study to show that the SC-CO2-treated ECM coating can be potentially used for various biomedical applications. The SC-CO2-treated ECM material showed improved cell-material interactions for all cell types tested. In addition, in vitro scratch wound assay using HaCaT cells showed that the presence of SC-CO2-treated ECM material enhanced keratinocyte migration whilst the in vitro cellular studies using THP-1-derived macrophages showed that the SC-CO2-treated ECM material did not evoke pro-inflammatory responses from the THP-1-derived macrophages. Overall, this study shows the efficacy of SC-CO2 method for delipidation and decellularization of adipose tissue whilst retaining its ECM and its subsequent utilization as a bioactive surface coating material for soft tissue engineering, angiogenesis and wound healing applications.","['Wang, Jun Kit', 'Luo, Baiwen', 'Guneta, Vipra', 'Li, Liang', 'Foo, Selin Ee Min', 'Dai, Yun', 'Tan, Timothy Thatt Yang', 'Tan, Nguan Soon', 'Choong, Cleo', 'Wong, Marcus Thien Chong']","['Wang JK', 'Luo B', 'Guneta V', 'Li L', 'Foo SEM', 'Dai Y', 'Tan TTY', 'Tan NS', 'Choong C', 'Wong MTC']","['School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 639798, Singapore.', 'School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 639798, Singapore.', 'School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 639798, Singapore.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, 60 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637551, Singapore.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, 60 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637551, Singapore.', 'School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 62 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637459, Singapore.', 'School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 62 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637459, Singapore.', ""School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, 60 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637551, Singapore; Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, 61 Biopolis Drive, Proteos, Singapore 138673, Singapore; KK Research Centre, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, 100 Bukit Timah Road, Singapore 229899, Singapore."", ""School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 639798, Singapore; KK Research Centre, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, 100 Bukit Timah Road, Singapore 229899, Singapore.

Compound 11a (with 4-methoxybenzoyl as N-substituent in the cap and 4-(aminomethyl) benzoyl as the linker group) exhibited selectivity against HDAC1 to some extent, and showed potent antiproliferative activity against several tumor cell lines. In vivo studies revealed that compound 11a displayed potent oral antitumor activity in both hematological tumor cell U937 xenograft model and solid tumor cell HCT116 xenograft model with no obvious toxicity. Further modification of benzamide 3, 11a and 19 afforded new thienyl and phenyl compounds (50a, 50b, 63a, 63b and 63c) with dramatic HDAC1 and HDAC2 dual selectivity, and the fluorine containing compound 56, with moderate HDAC3 selectivity.","['Li, Xiaoyang', 'Zhang, Yingjie', 'Jiang, Yuqi', 'Wu, Jingde', 'Inks, Elizabeth S', 'Chou, C James', 'Gao, Shuai', 'Hou, Jinning', 'Ding, Qinge', 'Li, Jingyao', 'Wang, Xue', 'Huang, Yongxue', 'Xu, Wenfang']","['Li X', 'Zhang Y', 'Jiang Y', 'Wu J', 'Inks ES', 'Chou CJ', 'Gao S', 'Hou J', 'Ding Q', 'Li J', 'Wang X', 'Huang Y', 'Xu W']","[""Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Shandong University, Ji'nan, Shandong, 250012, PR China; Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, 29425, United States."", ""Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Shandong University, Ji'nan, Shandong, 250012, PR China; Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Ji'nan, Shandong, 250012, PR China.

This population is not well described and may be under-reported. Better understanding of risk factors for early death and scope of the problem could lead to prevention of these occurrences and thus better survival rates in childhood cancer. Methods We retrieved data from SEER 13 registries on 36,337 patients age 0 to 19 years diagnosed with cancer between 1992 and 2011. Early death was defined as death within 1 month of diagnosis. Socioeconomic status data for each individual's county of residence were derived from Census 2000. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and corresponding 95% CIs were estimated for the association between early death and demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors. Results Percentage of early death in the period was 1.5% (n = 555). Children with acute myeloid leukemia, infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hepatoblastoma, and malignant brain tumors had the highest risk of early death. On multivariable analysis, an age younger than 1 year was a strong predictor of early death in all disease groups examined. Black race and Hispanic ethnicity were both risk factors for early death in multiple disease groups. Residence in counties with lower than median average income was associated with a higher risk of early death in hematologic malignancies. Percentages of early death decreased significantly over time, especially in hematologic malignancies. Conclusion Risk factors for early death in childhood cancer include an age younger than 1 year, specific diagnoses, minority race and ethnicity, and disadvantaged socioeconomic status. The population-based disease-specific percentages of early death were uniformly higher than those reported in cooperative clinical trials, suggesting that early death is under-reported in the medical literature. Initiatives to identify those at risk and develop preventive interventions should be prioritized.","['Green, Adam L', 'Furutani, Elissa', 'Ribeiro, Karina Braga', 'Rodriguez Galindo, Carlos']","['Green AL', 'Furutani E', 'Ribeiro KB', 'Rodriguez Galindo C']","[""Adam L.

The aim of this work was to provide basic insight into interactions between fluorescently labeled PPI-m dendrimer and two distinct leukemia cell models: CCRF-1301 lymphoid cell line and HL-60 myeloid cell line. We applied qualitative confocal imaging and quantitative flow cytometry, as well as trypan blue quenching and pharmacological inhibition, to investigate the course, kinetics, and molecular mechanisms of internalization of nanoparticles. CCRF-1301 cells take up glycodendrimer macromolecules via a relatively slow, adsorptive endocytosis process, which is cholesterol-dependent, clathrin- and caveolin-independent, and not followed by recycling or exocytosis. Morphological features of this phenomenon point to the involvement of aggregation-induced cell polarity changes (capping). In HL-60 cells, internalization is very fast, independent of binding to the cell surface, and proceeds from the fluid phase via a classical clathrin-dependent mechanism, ending up in an endolysosomal compartment from which it is not further released. This substantial difference in internalization rate and mechanism between two cell types has important repercussions for potential application of this class of glycodendrimers as drug delivery agents.","['Studzian, Maciej', 'Szulc, Aleksandra', 'Janaszewska, Anna', 'Appelhans, Dietmar', 'Pulaski, Lukasz', 'Klajnert-Maculewicz, Barbara']","['Studzian M', 'Szulc A', 'Janaszewska A', 'Appelhans D', 'Pulaski L', 'Klajnert-Maculewicz B']","['Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden , Hohe Str. 6, 01069 Dresden, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Transcriptional Regulation, Institute of Medical Biology PAS , Lodowa 106, 93-232 Lodz, Poland.', 'Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden , Hohe Str. 6, 01069 Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170425,United States,Biomacromolecules,Biomacromolecules,100892849,,,,,2017/04/18 06:00,2018/02/15 06:00,['2017/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biomac.7b00046 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomacromolecules. 2017 May 8;18(5):1509-1520. doi: 10.1021/acs.biomac.7b00046.

However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is mediated by the same T cells and remains a significant clinical problem associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. In this issue of the JCI, Ni and colleagues used several murine models of GVHD to evaluate the effect of CD4+ T cell depletion on GVL versus GVHD and revealed that depletion of CD4+ T cells leads to the upregulation of PD-L1 by recipient tissues and donor CD8+ T cells. Interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 in GVHD-targeted tissues resulted in CD8+ T cell exhaustion and apoptosis, thereby preventing GVHD, whereas PD-L1 interactions with CD80 in lymphoid tissue promoted CD8+ T cell survival and expansion, thereby enhancing the GVL response. By separating these seemingly similar alloreactive T cell responses based on the context of interaction, the results of this study may lay the groundwork for the development of effective clinical strategies to enhance GVL while minimizing GVHD following allogeneic HCT.","['Brennan, Todd V', 'Yang, Yiping']","['Brennan TV', 'Yang Y']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170417,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC5409065,,,,2017/04/18 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2017/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['94196 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI94196 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2017 May 1;127(5):1627-1630. doi: 10.1172/JCI94196.

The interaction of PD-L1 with CD80 alone has been shown to exacerbate the severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), whereas costimulation of CD80 and PD-1 ameliorates GVHD. Here we have demonstrated that temporary depletion of donor CD4+ T cells early after hematopoietic cell transplantation effectively prevents GVHD while preserving strong graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects in allogeneic and xenogeneic murine GVHD models. Depletion of donor CD4+ T cells increased serum IFN-gamma but reduced IL-2 concentrations, leading to upregulation of PD-L1 expression by recipient tissues and donor CD8+ T cells. In GVHD target tissues, the interactions of PD-L1 with PD-1 on donor CD8+ T cells cause anergy, exhaustion, and apoptosis, thereby preventing GVHD. In lymphoid tissues, the interactions of PD-L1 with CD80 augment CD8+ T cell expansion without increasing anergy, exhaustion, or apoptosis, resulting in strong GVL effects. These results indicate that the outcome of PD-L1-mediated signaling in CD8+ T cells depends on the presence or absence of CD4+ T cells, the nature of the interacting receptor expressed by CD8+ T cells, and the tissue environment in which the signaling occurs.","['Ni, Xiong', 'Song, Qingxiao', 'Cassady, Kaniel', 'Deng, Ruishu', 'Jin, Hua', 'Zhang, Mingfeng', 'Dong, Haidong', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Martin, Paul J', 'Chen, Yuan-Zhong', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Zeng, Defu']","['Ni X', 'Song Q', 'Cassady K', 'Deng R', 'Jin H', 'Zhang M', 'Dong H', 'Forman S', 'Martin PJ', 'Chen YZ', 'Wang J', 'Zeng D']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170417,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC5409099,,,,2017/04/18 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2017/04/18 06:00'],"['2016/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['91138 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI91138 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2017 May 1;127(5):1960-1977. doi: 10.1172/JCI91138.

CLINICAL REPORT: A 7-year-old boy presented with unexplained splenomegaly, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mild learning difficulties, easy bruising, mild thrombocytopenia, and subtle dysmorphic features. Extensive haematological testing including a bone marrow biopsy showed mild megaloblastoid erythropoiesis and borderline fibrosis. There were no haematological cytogenetic anomalies or other haematological pathology to explain the splenomegaly. Metabolic testing and chromosomal microarray were unremarkable. Trio whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a pathogenic de novo heterozygous germline CBL variant (c.1111T > C, p.Y371H), previously reported to cause CBL syndrome and implicated in development of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). DISCUSSION: CBL syndrome (more formally known as ""Noonan-syndrome-like disorder with or without juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia"") has overlapping features to Noonan syndrome with significant variability. CBL syndrome and other RASopathy disorders-including Noonan syndrome, neurofibromatosis 1, and Costello syndrome-are important to recognize as these are associated with a cancer-predisposition. CBL syndrome carries a very high risk for JMML, thus accurate diagnosis is of utmost importance. The diagnosis of CBL syndrome in this patient would not have been possible based on clinical features alone.

Developing novel and effective molecular-targeted approaches is thus a major priority. Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell (CAR-T) therapy, as one of the most promising targeted immunotherapies, has drawn extensive attention and resulted in multiple applications. According to published studies, CD19-directed CAR-T cells (CD19 CAR-T) can reach a complete remission rate of 94% in both children and adults with refractory/relapsed ALL, much higher than that of chemotherapy. However, the encouraging outcomes are often associated with complications such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), serious neurotoxicity, and on-target off-tumor effect, which seriously impeded further clinical application of CAR-T cells. Moreover, CAR-T therapy is typically associated with high relapse rate. This article briefly reviews the manufacture technologies, the conditioning regimens, the cell infusion doses, as well as the prevention and treatment strategies of complications for CAR-T cell therapy.","['Wei, Guoqing', 'Ding, Lijuan', 'Wang, Jiasheng', 'Hu, Yongxian', 'Huang, He']","['Wei G', 'Ding L', 'Wang J', 'Hu Y', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang China.0000 0004 1759 700Xgrid.13402.34']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170414,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,PMC5391552,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'CD19', 'Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell (CAR-T)', 'Complication', 'Conditioning regimen', 'Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)', 'Relapse']",,2017/04/18 06:00,2017/04/18 06:01,['2017/04/18 06:00'],"['2017/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-017-0070-9 [doi]', '70 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2017 Apr 14;6:10. doi: 10.1186/s40164-017-0070-9. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, miR-200c was up- and downregulated in two renal cancer cell lines, namely ACHN and A498, and the proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of the cells were measured. The expression levels of various mRNAs and proteins were then analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. It was found that miR-200c suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion of the renal cancer cells and, conversely, the inhibition of endogenous miR-200c resulted in increased cell proliferation and metastasis. Furthermore, a luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-200c directly targeted the 3' untranslated regions of the oncogenes B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi-1) and E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3) mRNAs, reduced the expression of Bmi-1 and E2F3 and regulated the expression of downstream genes, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, p14 and p16.

However, few studies have investigated lncRNAs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have identified one particular lncRNA, treRNA, which is overexpressed in CLL B-cells. We measured transcript expression in 144 CLL patient samples and separated samples into high or low expression of treRNA relative to the overall median. We found that high expression of treRNA is significantly associated with shorter time to treatment. High treRNA also correlates with poor prognostic indicators such as unmutated IGHV and high ZAP70 protein expression. We validated these initial findings in samples collected in a clinical trial comparing the nucleoside analog fludarabine alone or in combination with the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide in untreated CLL samples collected prior to starting therapy (E2997). High expression of treRNA was independently prognostic for shorter progression free survival in patients receiving fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. Given these results, in order to study the role of treRNA in DNA damage response we generated a model cell line system where treRNA was over-expressed in the human B-CLL cell line OSU-CLL. Relative to the vector control line, there was less cell death in OSU-CLL over-expressing treRNA after exposure to fludarabine and mafosfamide, due in part to a reduction in DNA damage. Therefore, we suggest that treRNA is a novel biomarker in CLL associated with aggressive disease and poor response to chemotherapy through enhanced protection against cytotoxic mediated DNA damage.","['Miller, Cecelia R', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Fobare, Sydney', 'Chen, Timothy L', 'Liu, Chaomei', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Blachly, James S', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Lucas, David M', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Sampath, Deepa', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'Hertlein, Erin K']","['Miller CR', 'Ruppert AS', 'Fobare S', 'Chen TL', 'Liu C', 'Lehman A', 'Blachly JS', 'Zhang X', 'Lucas DM', 'Grever MR', 'Tallman MS', 'Flinn IW', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Sampath D', 'Coombes KR', 'Hertlein EK']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Hendrix College, Conway, AR, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, MD Anderson Cancer Center at University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Sarah Cannon Research Institute and Tennessee Oncology, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center at University of California at San Diego, La Jolla CA, USA.', 'The Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Research Consortium, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center at University of California at San Diego, La Jolla CA, USA.', 'The Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Research Consortium, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5432228,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'lncRNA', 'prognostic factor', 'treRNA']",,2017/04/17 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/17 06:00'],"['2017/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['15401 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15401 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 18;8(16):25942-25954. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15401.,,20180305,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (tre long noncoding RNA, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', '*DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Treatment Outcome', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics']","['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA133250/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM068412/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, independent gene expression profile studies have evidenced a positive correlation between ZNF521 mRNA overexpression and MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leaving open the question on the role of ZNF521 in this subtype of leukemia. In this study, we sought to analyze the effect of ZNF521 depletion on MLL-rearranged AML cell lines and MLL-AF9 xenograft primary cells. Knockdown of ZNF521 with short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) led to decreased leukemia proliferation, reduced colony formation and caused cell cycle arrest in MLL-rearranged AML cell lines. Importantly, we showed that loss of ZNF521 substantially caused differentiation of both MLL-rearranged cell lines and primary cells. Moreover, gene profile analysis in ZNF521-silenced THP-1 cells revealed a loss of MLL-AF9-directed leukemic signature and an increase of the differentiation program. Finally, we determined that both MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL fusion proteins directly interacted with ZNF521 promoter activating its transcription. In conclusion, our findings identify ZNF521 as a critical effector of MLL fusion proteins in blocking myeloid differentiation and highlight ZNF521 as a potential therapeutic target for this subtype of leukemia.","['Germano, Giuseppe', 'Morello, Giulia', 'Aveic, Sanja', 'Pinazza, Marica', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Frasson, Chiara', 'Persano, Luca', 'Bonvini, Paolo', 'Viola, Giampietro', 'Bresolin, Silvia', 'Tregnago, Claudia', 'Paganin, Maddalena', 'Pigazzi, Martina', 'Indraccolo, Stefano', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Germano G', 'Morello G', 'Aveic S', 'Pinazza M', 'Minuzzo S', 'Frasson C', 'Persano L', 'Bonvini P', 'Viola G', 'Bresolin S', 'Tregnago C', 'Paganin M', 'Pigazzi M', 'Indraccolo S', 'Basso G']","['Foundation Institute of Pediatric Research Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy.', 'Foundation Institute of Pediatric Research Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy.', 'Foundation Institute of Pediatric Research Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Italy.', 'Foundation Institute of Pediatric Research Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy.', 'Foundation Institute of Pediatric Research Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5432245,['NOTNLM'],"['ZNF521', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'myeloid differentiation', 'transcription']",,2017/04/17 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/17 06:00'],"['2016/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['15387 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15387 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 18;8(16):26129-26141. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15387.,,20180305,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (zinc finger protein 521, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heterografts', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spatial resolution of karyotyping is limited and vital tumor cells are required for metaphase preparation. To overcome these limitations, DNA hybridization techniques were developed. In situ hybridization of radioactively or fluorescence labeled RNA probes onto tumor samples allowed the identification of specific genomic regions, translocations and copy number alterations. However, it is only suited for a limited number of candidate genes or regions. Genome-wide copy number analysis was made possible by the development of comparative genomic hybridization. It compares an entire cancer genome to a normal genome by differential fluorescence labeling and hybridization onto normal metaphase chromosomes. Replacing the metaphase chromosomes with arrays of oligonucleotides significantly increased the resolution. Karyotypic analysis of melanomas could demonstrate chromosomal aberrations decades ago. However, only CGH allowed understanding the complex melanoma genomes.

Of these genes, HOXA9 has been shown to be critical for leukemia cell survival, while MEIS1 has been identified as an essential regulator for leukemia stem cell (LSC) maintenance. Although significantly high expression of PBX3 was observed in clinical acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, the individual role of PBX3 in leukemia development is still largely unknown. In this study, we explored the specific role of PBX3 and its associated regulatory network in leukemia progression. By analyzing the clinical database, we found that the high expression of PBX3 is significantly correlated with a poor prognosis in AML patients. ChIP-Seq/qPCR analysis in MLL-r mouse models revealed aberrant epigenetic modifications with increased H3K79me2, and decreased H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 levels in LSCs, which may account for the high expression levels of Pbx3. To further examine the role of Pbx3 in AML maintenance and progression, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete Pbx3 in leukemic cells in the MLL-AF9 induced AML mouse model. We found that Pbx3 deletion significantly prolonged the survival of leukemic mice and decreased the leukemia burden by decreasing the capacity of LSCs and promoting LSC apoptosis. In conclusion, we found that PBX3 is epigenetically aberrant in the LSCs of MLL-r AML and is essential for leukemia development. Significantly, the differential expression of PBX3 in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells suggests PBX3 as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for MLL-r leukemia.","['Guo, Huidong', 'Chu, Yajing', 'Wang, Le', 'Chen, Xing', 'Chen, Yangpeng', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Zhou, Yuan', 'Yang, Feng-Chun', 'Cheng, Tao', 'Xu, Mingjiang', 'Zhang, Xiaobing', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Yuan, Weiping']","['Guo H', 'Chu Y', 'Wang L', 'Chen X', 'Chen Y', 'Cheng H', 'Zhang L', 'Zhou Y', 'Yang FC', 'Cheng T', 'Xu M', 'Zhang X', 'Zhou J', 'Yuan W']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170508,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,['NOTNLM'],"['*MLL', '*PBX3', '*epigenetic modification', '*leukemia stem cell']",,2017/04/16 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2017/04/16 06:00'],"['2016/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.30739 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2017 Jul 15;141(2):324-335. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30739.

In the current study, the authors evaluated the feasibility, safety, immunogenicity, and therapeutic potential of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-expressing autologous dendritic cells (hTERT-DCs) in adult patients with AML. METHODS: hTERT-DCs were produced from patient-specific leukapheresis, electroporated with an mRNA-encoding hTERT and a lysosomal-targeting sequence, and cryopreserved. A total of 22 patients with a median age of 58 years (range, 30-75 years) with intermediate-risk or high-risk AML in first or second complete remission (CR) were enrolled. hTERT-DCs were generated for 24 patients (73%). A median of 17 intradermal vaccinations (range, 6-32 intradermal vaccinations) containing 1x10(7) cells were administered as 6 weekly injections followed by 6 biweekly injections. A total of 21 patients (16 in first CR, 3 in second CR, and 2 with early disease recurrence) received hTERT-DCs. RESULTS: hTERT-DCs were well tolerated with no severe toxicities reported, with the exception of 1 patient who developed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Of the 19 patients receiving hTERT-DCs in CR, 11 patients (58%) developed hTERT-specific T-cell responses that primarily were targeted toward hTERT peptides with predicted low human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-binding affinities. With a median follow-up of 52 months, 58% of patients in CR (11 of 19 patients) were free of disease recurrence at the time of their last follow-up visit; 57% of the patients who were aged >/=60 years (4 of 7 patients) also were found to be free of disease recurrence at a median follow-up of 54 months. CONCLUSIONS: The generation of hTERT-DCs is feasible and vaccination with hTERT-DCs appears to be safe and may be associated with favorable recurrence-free survival. Cancer 2017;123:3061-72.

Approximately 50% of patients have disease relapse, and novel prognostic markers are needed to improve risk stratification. We performed genome-wide genotyping in 446 pediatric patients with de novo AML enrolled in Children's Oncology Group (COG) studies AAML0531, AAML03P1, and CCG2961. Affymetrix and Illumina Omni 2.5 platforms were used to evaluate copy-number alterations (CNAs) and determine their associations with treatment outcome. Data from Affymetrix and Illumina studies were jointly analyzed with ASCAT and GISTIC software. An average of 1.14 somatically acquired CNAs per patient were observed. Novel reoccurring altered genomic regions were identified, and the presence of CNAs was found to be associated with decreased 3-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and relapse risk from the end of induction 1 (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.4; HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8; and HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-2.0, respectively).

We found the ectopic activation of UNCX in a leukemia patient harboring a t(7;10)(p22;p14) translocation, in 22 of 61 of additional cases [a total of 23 positive patients out of 62 (37.1%)], and in 6 of 75 (8%) of AML cell lines. UNCX is embedded within a low-methylation region (canyon) and encodes for a transcription factor involved in somitogenesis and neurogenesis, with specific expression in the eye, brain, and kidney. UNCX expression turned out to be associated, and significantly correlated, with DNA methylation increase at its canyon borders based on data in our patients and in archived data of patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. UNCX-positive and -negative patients displayed significant differences in their gene expression profiles. An enrichment of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, such as MAP2K1 and CCNA1, was revealed. Similar results were obtained in UNCX-transduced CD34(+) cells, associated with low proliferation and differentiation arrest. Accordingly, we showed that UNCX expression characterizes leukemia cells at their early stage of differentiation, mainly M2 and M3 subtypes carrying wild-type NPM1 We also observed that UNCX expression significantly associates with an increased frequency of acute promyelocytic leukemia with PML-RARA and AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22.1); RUNX1-RUNX1T1 classes, according to the World Health Organization disease classification. In summary, our findings suggest a novel leukemogenic role of UNCX, associated with epigenetic modifications and with impaired cell proliferation and differentiation in AML.","['Daniele, Giulia', 'Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Fusilli, Caterina', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Lonoce, Angelo', 'Palazzo, Antonio', 'Lomiento, Mariana', 'Mammoli, Fabiana', 'Marsano, Rene Massimiliano', 'Marasco, Elena', 'Mantovani, Vilma', 'Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'Ding, Jie', 'Palumbo, Orazio', 'Carella, Massimo', 'Nadarajah, Niroshan', 'Perricone, Margherita', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Baldazzi, Carmen', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Ferrari, Sergio', 'Mazza, Tommaso', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Storlazzi, Clelia Tiziana']","['Daniele G', 'Simonetti G', 'Fusilli C', 'Iacobucci I', 'Lonoce A', 'Palazzo A', 'Lomiento M', 'Mammoli F', 'Marsano RM', 'Marasco E', 'Mantovani V', 'Quentmeier H', 'Drexler HG', 'Ding J', 'Palumbo O', 'Carella M', 'Nadarajah N', 'Perricone M', 'Ottaviani E', 'Baldazzi C', 'Testoni N', 'Papayannidis C', 'Ferrari S', 'Mazza T', 'Martinelli G', 'Storlazzi CT']","['Department of Biology, University of Bari ""A.

This process is regulated by proapoptotic and prosurvival members of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein family. To counter premature death of a virus-infected cell, poxviruses use a range of different molecular strategies including the mimicry of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins. One such viral prosurvival protein is the fowlpox virus protein FPV039, which is a potent apoptosis inhibitor, but the precise molecular mechanism by which FPV039 inhibits apoptosis is unknown. To understand how fowlpox virus inhibits apoptosis, we examined FPV039 using isothermal titration calorimetry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and X-ray crystallography. Here, we report that the fowlpox virus prosurvival protein FPV039 promiscuously binds to cellular proapoptotic Bcl-2 and engages all major proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Unlike other identified viral Bcl-2 proteins to date, FPV039 engaged with cellular proapoptotic Bcl-2 with affinities comparable with those of Bcl-2's endogenous cellular counterparts. Structural studies revealed that FPV039 adopts the conserved Bcl-2 fold observed in cellular prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins and closely mimics the structure of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1. Our findings suggest that FPV039 is a pan-Bcl-2 protein inhibitor that can engage all host BH3-only proteins, as well as Bcl-2-associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax) and Bcl-2 antagonist/killer (Bak) proteins to inhibit premature apoptosis of an infected host cell. This work therefore provides a mechanistic platform to better understand FPV039-mediated apoptosis inhibition.","['Anasir, Mohd Ishtiaq', 'Caria, Sofia', 'Skinner, Michael A', 'Kvansakul, Marc']","['Anasir MI', 'Caria S', 'Skinner MA', 'Kvansakul M']","['From the Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Victoria 3086, Australia and.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Victoria 3086, Australia and.', 'Section of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London W2 1PZ, United Kingdom.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Victoria 3086, Australia and m.kvansakul@latrobe.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170414,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC5454088,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family', '*X-ray crystallography', '*apoptosis', '*isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)', '*poxvirus', '*small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)']",,2017/04/16 06:00,2017/06/10 06:00,['2017/04/16 06:00'],"['2016/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)42704-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.768879 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2017 Jun 2;292(22):9010-9021. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.768879.

Recent studies have reported key roles for individual miRNA editing events, but a comprehensive picture of miRNA editing in human cancers remains largely unexplored. Here, we systematically characterized the miRNA editing profiles of 8595 samples across 20 cancer types from miRNA sequencing data of The Cancer Genome Atlas and identified 19 adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing hotspots. We independently validated 15 of them by perturbation experiments in several cancer cell lines. These miRNA editing events show extensive correlations with key clinical variables (e.g., tumor subtype, disease stage, and patient survival time) and other molecular drivers. Focusing on the RNA editing hotspot in miR-200b, a key tumor metastasis suppressor, we found that the miR-200b editing level correlates with patient prognosis opposite to the pattern observed for the wild-type miR-200b expression. We further experimentally showed that, in contrast to wild-type miRNA, the edited miR-200b can promote cell invasion and migration through its impaired ability to inhibit ZEB1/ZEB2 and acquired concomitant ability to repress new targets, including LIFR, a well-characterized metastasis suppressor. Our study highlights the importance of miRNA editing in gene regulation and suggests its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and therapy.","['Wang, Yumeng', 'Xu, Xiaoyan', 'Yu, Shuangxing', 'Jeong, Kang Jin', 'Zhou, Zhicheng', 'Han, Leng', 'Tsang, Yiu Huen', 'Li, Jun', 'Chen, Hu', 'Mangala, Lingegowda S', 'Yuan, Yuan', 'Eterovic, A Karina', 'Lu, Yiling', 'Sood, Anil K', 'Scott, Kenneth L', 'Mills, Gordon B', 'Liang, Han']","['Wang Y', 'Xu X', 'Yu S', 'Jeong KJ', 'Zhou Z', 'Han L', 'Tsang YH', 'Li J', 'Chen H', 'Mangala LS', 'Yuan Y', 'Eterovic AK', 'Lu Y', 'Sood AK', 'Scott KL', 'Mills GB', 'Liang H']","['Graduate Program in Structural and Computational Biology and Molecular Biophysics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, College of Basic Medicine Science, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province 110122, China.', 'Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston McGovern Medical School, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Graduate Program in Structural and Computational Biology and Molecular Biophysics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Center for RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNAs, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Center for RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNAs, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Graduate Program in Structural and Computational Biology and Molecular Biophysics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170414,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,PMC5495064,,,,2017/04/16 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/16 06:00'],"['2016/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['gr.219741.116 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.219741.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2017 Jul;27(7):1112-1125. doi: 10.1101/gr.219741.116.

The risk of CNS tumors after HCT in pediatric HCT recipients is not known. We evaluated the incidence and risk factors for CNS tumors in pediatric recipients of allogeneic HCT reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research between 1976 and 2008. A case control design was used. There were no CNS tumors in the nonmalignant cohort (n = 4543) or in those undergoing HCT for solid tumors (n = 26). There were 59 CNS tumors in 8720 patients transplanted for hematologic malignancies. In comparison with the general population, pediatric HCT recipients with hematologic malignancies had a 33 times higher than expected rate of CNS tumors (95% confidence interval, 22.98 to 45.77; P < .0001). The cumulative incidence of subsequent CNS tumors was 1.29% (95% confidence interval .87 to 1.87) at 20 years after HCT. Significant risk factors in the entire cohort were having an unrelated donor (HR, 3.35; P = .0002) and CNS disease before HCT for both acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR, 8.21; P = .0003) and acute myeloid leukemia (HR, 6.21; P = .0174). Analysis of the matched cohort showed having an unrelated donor transplant (HR, 4.79; P = .0037), CNS disease before HCT (HR, 7.67; P = .0064), and radiotherapy exposure before conditioning (HR, 3.7; P = .0234) to be significant risk factors. Chronic graft-versus-host disease was associated with a lower risk (HR, .29; P = .0143).

The CONCORD programme was designed to assess worldwide differences and trends in population-based cancer survival. In this population-based study, we aimed to estimate survival inequalities globally for several subtypes of childhood leukaemia. METHODS: Cancer registries participating in CONCORD were asked to submit tumour registrations for all children aged 0-14 years who were diagnosed with leukaemia between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2009, and followed up until Dec 31, 2009. Haematological malignancies were defined by morphology codes in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third revision. We excluded data from registries from which the data were judged to be less reliable, or included only lymphomas, and data from countries in which data for fewer than ten children were available for analysis. We also excluded records because of a missing date of birth, diagnosis, or last known vital status. We estimated 5-year net survival (ie, the probability of surviving at least 5 years after diagnosis, after controlling for deaths from other causes [background mortality]) for children by calendar period of diagnosis (1995-99, 2000-04, and 2005-09), sex, and age at diagnosis (<1, 1-4, 5-9, and 10-14 years, inclusive) using appropriate life tables. We estimated age-standardised net survival for international comparison of survival trends for precursor-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). FINDINGS: We analysed data from 89 828 children from 198 registries in 53 countries. During 1995-99, 5-year age-standardised net survival for all lymphoid leukaemias combined ranged from 10.6% (95% CI 3.1-18.2) in the Chinese registries to 86.8% (81.6-92.0) in Austria. International differences in 5-year survival for childhood leukaemia were still large as recently as 2005-09, when age-standardised survival for lymphoid leukaemias ranged from 52.4% (95% CI 42.8-61.9) in Cali, Colombia, to 91.6% (89.5-93.6) in the German registries, and for AML ranged from 33.3% (18.9-47.7) in Bulgaria to 78.2% (72.0-84.3) in German registries. Survival from precursor-cell ALL was very close to that of all lymphoid leukaemias combined, with similar variation. In most countries, survival from AML improved more than survival from ALL between 2000-04 and 2005-09. Survival for each type of leukaemia varied markedly with age: survival was highest for children aged 1-4 and 5-9 years, and lowest for infants (younger than 1 year). There was no systematic difference in survival between boys and girls. INTERPRETATION: Global inequalities in survival from childhood leukaemia have narrowed with time but remain very wide for both ALL and AML. These results provide useful information for health policy makers on the effectiveness of health-care systems and for cancer policy makers to reduce inequalities in childhood cancer survival.

Internationally comparable data on childhood cancer incidence in the past two decades are scarce. This study aimed to provide internationally comparable local data on the incidence of childhood cancer to promote research of causes and implementation of childhood cancer control. METHODS: This population-based registry study, devised by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in collaboration with the International Association of Cancer Registries, collected data on all malignancies and non-malignant neoplasms of the CNS diagnosed before age 20 years in populations covered by high-quality cancer registries with complete data for 2001-10. Incidence rates per million person-years for the 0-14 years and 0-19 years age groups were age-adjusted using the world standard population to provide age-standardised incidence rates (WSRs), using the age-specific incidence rates (ASR) for individual age groups (0-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, and 15-19 years). All rates were reported for 19 geographical areas or ethnicities by sex, age group, and cancer type. The regional WSRs for children aged 0-14 years were compared with comparable data obtained in the 1980s. FINDINGS: Of 532 invited cancer registries, 153 registries from 62 countries, departments, and territories met quality standards, and contributed data for the entire decade of 2001-10. 385 509 incident cases in children aged 0-19 years occurring in 2.64 billion person-years were included. The overall WSR was 140.6 per million person-years in children aged 0-14 years (based on 284 649 cases), and the most common cancers were leukaemia (WSR 46.4), followed by CNS tumours (WSR 28.2), and lymphomas (WSR 15.2). In children aged 15-19 years (based on 100 860 cases), the ASR was 185.3 per million person-years, the most common being lymphomas (ASR 41.8) and the group of epithelial tumours and melanoma (ASR 39.5). Incidence varied considerably between and within the described regions, and by cancer type, sex, age, and racial and ethnic group. Since the 1980s, the global WSR of registered cancers in children aged 0-14 years has increased from 124.0 (95% CI 123.3-124.7) to 140.6 (140.1-141.1) per million person-years. INTERPRETATION: This unique global source of childhood cancer incidence will be used for aetiological research and to inform public health policy, potentially contributing towards attaining several targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. The observed geographical, racial and ethnic, age, sex, and temporal variations require constant monitoring and research.

To investigate how Epo modulates the erythroid epigenome, we performed epigenetic profiling using an ex vivo murine cell system that undergoes synchronous erythroid maturation in response to Epo stimulation. Our findings define the repertoire of Epo-modulated enhancers, illuminating a new facet of Epo signaling. First, a large number of enhancers rapidly responded to Epo stimulation, revealing a cis-regulatory network of Epo-responsive enhancers. In contrast, most of the other identified enhancers remained in an active acetylated state during Epo signaling, suggesting that most erythroid enhancers are established at an earlier precursor stage. Second, we identified several hundred super-enhancers that were linked to key erythroid genes, such as Tal1, Bcl11a, and Mir144/451. Third, experimental and computational validation revealed that many predicted enhancer regions were occupied by TAL1 and enriched with DNA-binding motifs for GATA1, KLF1, TAL1/E-box, and STAT5. Additionally, many of these cis-regulatory regions were conserved evolutionarily and displayed correlated enhancer:promoter acetylation. Together, these findings define a cis-regulatory enhancer network for Epo signaling during erythropoiesis, and provide the framework for future studies involving the interplay of epigenetics and Epo signaling.","['Perreault, Andrea A', 'Benton, Mary Lauren', 'Koury, Mark J', 'Brandt, Stephen J', 'Venters, Bryan J']","['Perreault AA', 'Benton ML', 'Koury MJ', 'Brandt SJ', 'Venters BJ']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Chemical and Physical Biology Program, Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Chemical and Physical Biology Program, Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.

Pathologically, the malignancy occurs in two forms, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type; and aggressive NK-cell leukaemia. Lymphoma occur most commonly (80%) in the nose and upper aerodigestive tract, less commonly (20%) in non-nasal areas (skin, gastrointestinal tract, testis, salivary gland), and rarely as disseminated disease with a leukemic phase. Genetic analysis showed mutations of genes involved in the JAK/STAT pathway, RNA assembly, epigenetic regulation, and tumor suppression. In initial clinical evaluation, positron emission tomography computed tomography, and quantification of plasma EBV DNA are mandatory as they are useful for response monitoring and prognostication. In stage I/II diseases, combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy (sequentially or concurrently) is the best approach. Conventional anthracycline-containing regimens are ineffective and should be replaced by non-anthracycline-containing regimens, preferably including L-asparaginase. Radiotherapy alone is associated with high systemic relapse rates and should be avoided. In stage III/IV diseases, non-anthracycline-regimens-containing L-asparaginase are the standard. In relapsed/refractory cases, blockade of the programmed death protein 1 has recently shown promising results with high response rates. In the era of effective non-anthracycline-containing regimens, autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has not been shown to be beneficial. However, allogeneic HSCT may be considered for high-risk or advanced-stage patients in remission or relapsed/refractory patients responding to salvage therapy. Prognostic models taking into account presentation, interim, and end-of-treatment parameters are useful in triaging patients to different treatment strategies.","['Tse, Eric', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam']","['Tse E', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Medicine, Professorial Block, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Professorial Block, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China. ylkwong@hkucc.hku.hk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170414,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC5391564,['NOTNLM'],"['*EBV DNA quantification', '*Extranodal', '*Immunotherapy', '*L-asparaginase', '*NK/T-cell lymphoma', '*Nasal', '*Non-nasal', '*PD1', '*Prognostication']",,2017/04/16 06:00,2017/07/05 06:00,['2017/04/16 06:00'],"['2017/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-017-0452-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-017-0452-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2017 Apr 14;10(1):85. doi: 10.1186/s13045-017-0452-9.,,20170704,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8156-6978'],"['0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Radiotherapy', 'Salvage Therapy/methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Bcl-6/p53 pathway has been shown to regulate the sensitivity of tumor cells to antitumor drugs. We tested whether HHT blocked the Bcl-6/p53 pathway in order to promote the apoptosis of IM-resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and IM-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells showed high expression of Bcl-6 protein. Bcl-6 mediated the upregulation of p53, and and Bcl-6 induced growth inhibition of IM-resistant cells as well as its apoptosis by targeting p53. In addition, Bcl-6 was downregulated moderately after HHT treatment in different cells. The Bcl-6 expression was significantly increased in patients with CML when compared with healthy subjects. Furthermore, the expression of Bcl-6 was higher in patients with CML-blastic phase (CML-BP) than in those with CML-chronic phase (CML-CP). METHODS: The inhibitory effect of drugs on cell growth was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), The apoptosis rate and the cell cycle were investigated by flow cytometry. The expression of Bcl-6, p53, Bcl-2, caspase9, and caspase3 proteins was assayed by western blot, Real- Time PCR (qPCR) detect Bcl-6 and p53 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: HHT can suppress the growth and induce apoptosis of IM-resistant cells, the mechanism of which is associated with blocking of the Bcl-6/p53 pathway.

In order to identify new targets for ALL, we performed whole-exome sequencing on four adults with B-ALL and discovered a somatic JAK1 S646P mutation. Sanger sequencing of JAK1 was conducted on 53 ALL patients, and two cases exhibited A639G and P960S mutations separately. Functional studies demonstrated that only JAK1 S646P mutation could activate multiple signaling pathways, drive cytokine-independent cell growth, and promote proliferation of malignant cells in nude mice. Moreover, a high sensitivity to the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was observed in S646P mutant model. Exploration in a total of 209 ALL cases showed that JAK1 mutations occur at a frequency of 10.5% in T-ALL (2/19) and 1.6% in B-ALL (3/190). Collectively, our results suggested that JAK1 S646P is an activating mutation in vitro and in vivo.

The rapid and disseminated growth pattern remains the primary cause of poor clinical prognosis in patients with SCLC. However, the molecular factors that drive rapid progression of SCLC remain unclear. Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1), an Ets transcription factor family member, has been previously reported to act as a major driver of hematological malignancies. In this study, we explored the potential role of FLI1 in SCLC. Using immunohistochemical staining, we found that FLI1 was significantly upregulated in SCLC tissues, compared to that in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and normal lung tissues (p < 0.01). The expression score of FLI1 oncoprotein was associated with the extensive stage of SCLC and the overexpressed Ki67. Knockdown of FLI1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) promoted apoptosis and induced repression of cell proliferation, tumor colony formation and in vivo tumorigenicity in highly aggressive SCLC cell lines. Importantly, we discovered that FLI1 promoted tumorigenesis by activating the miR-17-92 cluster family. This study uncovers FLI1 as an important driving factor that promotes tumor growth in SCLC through the miR-17-92 pathway. FLI1 may serve as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention of SCLC.","['Li, Lingyu', 'Song, Wei', 'Yan, Xu', 'Li, Ailing', 'Zhang, Xiaoying', 'Li, Wei', 'Wen, Xue', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Yu, Dehai', 'Hu, Ji-Fan', 'Cui, Jiuwei']","['Li L', 'Song W', 'Yan X', 'Li A', 'Zhang X', 'Li W', 'Wen X', 'Zhou L', 'Yu D', 'Hu JF', 'Cui J']","['Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research, Palo Alto, USA.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5522042,['NOTNLM'],"['FLI1', 'apoptosis', 'lung cancer', 'miR-17-92', 'tumor']",,2017/04/15 06:00,2018/04/07 06:00,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['16715 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16715 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 27;8(26):41975-41987. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16715.,,20180406,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*genetics', 'Small Cell Lung Carcinoma/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to obtain feedback on weight management in pediatric ALL survivors and on the content and implementation of a Web-based weight management program. METHODS: Study participants included 54 parent survey respondents and 19 pediatric oncology professionals in 4 focus groups. Survey questions included report of child weight status and interest in participating in weight management programming at various time points. Pediatric oncology professionals were asked about the preferred topics and timing, as well as their role. Focus group data were analyzed by a multidisciplinary research team for common themes. RESULTS: The mean age of survivors was 6.5 years. By parent report, 19% of children were overweight and 25% were obese. Preferred timing for weight management program participation was within 3 months of starting maintenance chemotherapy (23/53, 43%) or within 12 months after completion of all cancer treatments (18/53, 34%). Pediatric oncology professionals likewise considered the maintenance phase appropriate. They considered parenting to be an important topic to include and indicated that their most appropriate roles would be promotion and support. CONCLUSIONS: Parents and pediatric oncology professionals are interested in and supportive of early weight management in pediatric ALL survivors. Future research needs to identify strategies to integrate this into pediatric cancer care and to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of these strategies.","['Folta, Sara', 'Chang, Winnie', 'Hill, Rachel', 'Kelly, Michael', 'Meagher, Susan', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Zhang, Fang Fang']","['Folta S', 'Chang W', 'Hill R', 'Kelly M', 'Meagher S', 'Bowman WP', 'Zhang FF']","['Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Smith College, Northampton, MA, United States.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Tufts University, Boston, MA, United States.', 'The Floating Hospital for Children, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Tufts University, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Tufts University, Boston, MA, United States.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX, United States."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, United States.', 'Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, MA, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170209,Canada,JMIR Cancer,JMIR cancer,101666844,PMC5392209,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood cancer survivors', 'mixed methods', 'weight management']",,2017/04/15 06:00,2017/04/15 06:01,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/15 06:01 [medline]']","['v3i1e2 [pii]', '10.2196/cancer.6680 [doi]']",epublish,JMIR Cancer. 2017 Feb 9;3(1):e2. doi: 10.2196/cancer.6680.,,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-5622', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1120-5805', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1221-4332', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4552-7546', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6489-5729', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3130-0087']",,,,,,"['(c)Sara Folta, Winnie Chang, Rachel Hill, Michael Kelly, Susan Meagher, W Paul', 'Bowman, Fang Fang Zhang.

A phase 1 trial of plerixafor in combination with intensive chemotherapy in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was performed to determine a tolerable and biologically active dose. PROCEDURE: Plerixafor was administered daily for 5 days at four dose levels (6, 9, 12, and 15 mg/m(2) /dose) followed 4 hr later by high-dose cytarabine (every 12 hr) and etoposide (daily). RESULTS: Nineteen patients (13 with AML, 5 with ALL, 1 with MDS) were treated. The most common grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicities attributable to plerixafor were febrile neutropenia and hypokalemia. There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Plerixafor exposure increased with increasing dose levels and clearance was similar on days 1 and 5. Eighteen patients were evaluable for response. Two patients achieved complete remission (CR) and one patient achieved CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi): all three had AML. No responses were seen in patients with ALL or MDS. Plerixafor mobilized leukemic blasts into the peripheral blood in 14 of 16 evaluable patients (median 3.4-fold increase), and the degree of mobilization correlated with surface CXCR4 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Plerixafor, in combination with high-dose cytarabine and etoposide, was well tolerated in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias and MDS.

Curcumin (CUR), a natural anti-inflammatory substance, suppresses diabetes-associated inflammation and cell death. However, very high doses need to be used because of poor oral bioavailability, making it difficult to translate the anti-inflammatory actions to clinical situations. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We have prepared biodegradable nanosystems encapsulating curcumin (nCUR), resulting in at least nine-fold improvement in oral bioavailability. Here, we tested the ability of nCUR to prevent streptozotocin (STZ)-induced inflammation and apoptosis in pancreatic islets and beta cells, in rats. KEY RESULTS: Non-fasted rats pretreated with 10 or 50 mg.kg(-1) nCUR 6 h prior to STZ challenge had up to 37% reduction in the glucose levels, while plain CUR (50 mg.kg(-1) ) results in 12% reduction. This treatment with nCUR was accompanied by decreased islet or beta cell death, as shown by TUNEL assay and H&E staining. Both CUR and nCUR significantly decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines in pancreatic tissue homogenates that correlated well with minimal histiocytic infiltration. Pre-treatment with nCUR, but not CUR, decreased 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, a sensitive biomarker of ROS-induced DNA damage, in pancreas. In normal rodents, daily dosing for 28 days, with nCUR (25-100 mg.kg(-1) ) did not cause any deleterious health issues by the carrier. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Together, these data indicate a potentially translatable dose of nCUR that is safe and efficacious in improving beta cell function, which could prevent T1DM.","['Ganugula, Raghu', 'Arora, Meenakshi', 'Jaisamut, Patcharawalai', 'Wiwattanapatapee, Ruedeekorn', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Venkatpurwar, Vinod P', 'Zhou, Beiyan', 'Rodrigues Hoffmann, Aline', 'Basu, Rita', 'Guo, Shaodong', 'Majeti, Naga Venkata Ravi Kumar']","['Ganugula R', 'Arora M', 'Jaisamut P', 'Wiwattanapatapee R', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Venkatpurwar VP', 'Zhou B', 'Rodrigues Hoffmann A', 'Basu R', 'Guo S', 'Majeti NVRK']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Faculty of Traditional Thai Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat-Yai, Songkhla, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University, Hat-Yai, Songkhla, Thailand.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", 'Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'The Integrated Carbohydrate Physiology and Translation Laboratory, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Nutrition and Food Science, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170530,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,PMC5466524,,,,2017/04/15 06:00,2018/01/27 06:00,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bph.13816 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2017 Jul;174(13):2074-2084. doi: 10.1111/bph.13816.

METHODS: The effect of Les-3833 or doxorubicin on the viability of 9 cell lines was studied using MTT assay, while human melanoma cells of WM793 line were additionally examined using light and fluorescent microscopies for evaluating cytomorphological changes. The Western-blot and flow cytometric analyses were carried out to study signaling pathways of melanoma cell cycling and death. RESULTS: Les-3833 was the most efficient against melanoma cells. Its half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.22 mug/mL for WM793 cells and 0.3 mug/mL for SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells. For human lung A549, breast MCF-7, colon HCT116, and ovarian SKOV3 carcinoma cell lines IC50 was in between 2.5 to >5.0 mug/mL. Les-3833 was relatively not toxic (IC50 > 5 mug/mL) for human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. Results of Annexin V/PI staining of melanoma cells and activation of caspase 3, PARP, MAPK, and EndoG protein suggest apoptosis in Les-3833-treated cells. Les-3833 also induced ROS production in melanoma cells and their arrest in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle. CONCLUSION: Novel 4-thiazolidinone derivative Les-3833 is effective against human melanoma cells in vitro, and such effect is tumor specific since it is much less pronounced in human carcinoma and leukemia cells. In melanoma cells Les-3833 induces apoptosis (morphological changes and increased pro-apoptotic proteins), ROS production, and arrest in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle.","['Finiuk, Nataliya', 'Boiko, Nataliya', 'Klyuchivska, Olga', 'capital KA, Cyrillicsmall o, Cyrillicbylinska, Lesya', 'Kril, Iryna', 'Zimenkovsky, Borys', 'Lesyk, Roman', 'Stoika, Rostyslav']","['Finiuk N', 'Boiko N', 'Klyuchivska O', 'capital KA, Cyrillicsmall o, Cyrillicbylinska L', 'Kril I', 'Zimenkovsky B', 'Lesyk R', 'Stoika R']","['Rostyslav Stoika, Institute of Cell Biology, NAS of Ukraine, Drahomanov Street 14/16, 79005, Lviv, Ukraine, stoika@cellbiol.lviv.ua.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Croatia,Croat Med J,Croatian medical journal,9424324,PMC5410740,,,,2017/04/15 06:00,2017/06/01 06:00,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3325/cmj.2017.58.129 [doi]'],ppublish,Croat Med J. 2017 Apr 14;58(2):129-139. doi: 10.3325/cmj.2017.58.129.,,20170531,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Les-3288)', '0 (Thiazolidines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thiazolidines/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The roles of miR-192 as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in solid tumors have been previously reported. However, little is known about the role of miR-192 in human acute myeloid leukemia. The results of the present study indicate that miR-192 is significantly downregulated in specimens from acute myeloid leukemia patients. Functional assays demonstrated that overexpression of miR-192 in NB4 and HL-60 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation compared with that in control cells, and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation, and apoptosis in vitro. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assays showed that miR-192 significantly suppressed the activity of a reporter gene containing the wild type 3'-UTR of CCNT2, but it did not suppress the activity of a reporter gene containing mutated 3'-UTR of CCNT2. QRT-PCR and Western blot assays showed that miR-192 significantly downregulated the expression of CCNT2 in human leukemia cells. Exogenous expression of CCNT2 attenuated the cell cycle arrest induced by miR-192 in NB4 and HL-60 cells. Collectively, miR-192 inhibits cell proliferation and induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in AML by regulating the expression of CCNT2.","['Ke, Shun', 'Li, Rui-Chao', 'Lu, Jun', 'Meng, Fan-Kai', 'Feng, Yi-Kuan', 'Fang, Ming-Hao']","['Ke S', 'Li RC', 'Lu J', 'Meng FK', 'Feng YK', 'Fang MH']","['Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of General Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China. fangmh@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170413,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CCNT2', 'Cell cycle', 'miR-192']",,2017/04/15 06:00,2017/10/06 06:00,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2232-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2232-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Aug;106(2):258-265. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2232-2.

However, in the case of a small proportion of leukemic blast cells, such as AML associated with Down syndrome (AML-DS), it is not possible to examine prognostic factors precisely due to the large proportion of normal cells. Here, we present a novel method for examining prognostic factors by making a smear on a membrane slide glass from a small amount of diagnostic specimen and collecting highly pure leukemic blast cells by laser microdissection (LMD). We verified the effectiveness of this method using 10% KPAM1 cell line suspension and peripheral blood containing 20% blast cells obtained from a patient with transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM). After making blood smears, approximately 100 cells were collected and analyzed by direct sequencing. Frameshift mutations (2 bp deletion and 17 bp duplication, respectively) in GATA-1 were detected in each sample, suggesting KPAM1 and TAM blast cells were accurately purified. This novel method enables us to precisely examine prognostic factors in many cases, even in cases with a small proportion of leukemic blast cells or small specimens to preserve.","['Matsuo, Hidemasa', 'Shiga, Shuichi', 'Imai, Tsuyoshi', 'Kamikubo, Yasuhiko', 'Toki, Tsutomu', 'Terui, Kiminori', 'Ito, Etsuro', 'Adachi, Souichi']","['Matsuo H', 'Shiga S', 'Imai T', 'Kamikubo Y', 'Toki T', 'Terui K', 'Ito E', 'Adachi S']","['Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Syogoin, Sakyoku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kurashiki Central Hospital, Kurashiki, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Syogoin, Sakyoku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Syogoin, Sakyoku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. adachiso@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170413,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Microdissection', 'Prognostic factor']",,2017/04/15 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2227-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2227-z [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Jul;106(1):55-59. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2227-z.

Although successful implementation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of CML remain a traditional choice for molecularly targeted therapy, some patients present primary or secondary resistance to such therapy. Therefore, alternative therapeutic strategies are required to treat resistant CML cells. Accordingly, new anti-proliferative and/or pro-apoptotic compounds would be needed for clinical treatment. In the present investigation, we demonstrate that TPEN (e.g. 3 muM), a lipid-soluble metal chelator, induces apoptosis in K562 cells via a molecular cascade involving H2O2 >> JNK, NF-kappaB > c-JUN, P73 > PUMA, BAX > loss of DeltaPsim > CASPASE-3 > nuclei/DNA fragmentation. Fragmentation of the nuclei and DNA are indicative of cell death by apoptosis. Remarkably, the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, and inhibitors of the transcription factors CASPASE 3 and (JNK) kinase, decreased oxidative stress (OS) and cell death in these cells. This is evidenced by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry for OS markers (e.g. generation of H2O2 and DJ 1 oxidation) and nuclear expression of apoptotic markers (e.g. activated caspase 3 and JNK kinase). In addition, TPEN causes no detectable damage in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cells (hPBLCs). We conclude that TPEN selectively induces apoptosis in K562 cells via an OS-mechanism. Our findings may provide insight into more effective CML anticancer therapies.","['Rojas-Valencia, Luisa', 'Velez-Pardo, Carlos', 'Jimenez-Del-Rio, Marlene']","['Rojas-Valencia L', 'Velez-Pardo C', 'Jimenez-Del-Rio M']","['Neuroscience Research Group, Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of Antioquia (UdeA), SIU, Calle 70 No. 52-21, and Calle 62 # 52-59, Building 1, Room 412, Medellin, Colombia.', 'Neuroscience Research Group, Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of Antioquia (UdeA), SIU, Calle 70 No. 52-21, and Calle 62 # 52-59, Building 1, Room 412, Medellin, Colombia. calberto.velez@udea.edu.co.', 'Neuroscience Research Group, Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of Antioquia (UdeA), SIU, Calle 70 No. 52-21, and Calle 62 # 52-59, Building 1, Room 412, Medellin, Colombia. marlene.jimenez@udea.edu.co.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170413,Netherlands,Biometals,"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine",9208478,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Antileukemic', '*Apoptosis', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*K562', '*Oxidative stress', '*TPEN']",,2017/04/15 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10534-017-0015-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s10534-017-0015-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Biometals. 2017 Jun;30(3):405-421. doi: 10.1007/s10534-017-0015-0.

KV1.3 K(+) channels are membrane proteins involved in the maintenance of K(+) homeostasis and the resting potential of the cell, thus controlling signaling events, proliferation and apoptosis in lymphocytes. Here we show that F-ara-A inhibits KV currents in human B lymphocytes. Our data indicate that KV1.3 is expressed in both BL2 and Dana B cell lines, although total KV1.3 levels were higher in BL2 than in Dana cells. However, KV currents in the plasma membrane were similar in both cell lines and were abrogated by the specific KV1.3 channel inhibitor PAP-1, indicating that KV1.3 accounts for most of the KV currents in these cell lines. F-ara-A, at a concentration (3.5 muM) similar to that achieved in the plasma of fludarabine phosphate-treated patients (3 muM), inhibited KV1.3 currents by 61 +/- 6.3% and 52.3 +/- 6.3% in BL2 and Dana B cells, respectively. The inhibitory effect of F-ara-A was concentration-dependent and showed an IC50 value of 0.36 +/- 0.04 muM and a nH value of 1.07 +/- 0.15 in BL2 cells and 0.34 +/- 0.13 muM (IC50 ) and 0.77 +/- 0.11 (nH ) in Dana cells. F-ara-A inhibition of plasma membrane KV1.3 was observed irrespective of its cytotoxic effect on the cells, BL2 cells being sensitive and Dana cells resistant to F-ara-A cytotoxicity. Interestingly, PAP-1, at concentrations as high as 10 muM, did not affect the viability of BL2 and Dana cells, indicating that blockage of KV1.3 in these cells is not toxic. Finally, F-ara-A had no effect on ectopically expressed KV1.3 channels, suggesting an indirect mechanism of current inhibition. In summary, our results describe the inhibitory effect of F-ara-A on the activity of KV1.3 channel. Although KV1.3 inhibition is not sufficient to induce cell death, further research is needed to determine whether it might still contribute to F-ara-A cytotoxicity in sensitive cells or be accountable for some of the clinical side effects of the drug.","['de la Cruz, Alicia', 'Vera-Zambrano, Alba', 'Peraza, Diego A', 'Valenzuela, Carmen', 'Zapata, Juan M', 'Perez-Chacon, Gema', 'Gonzalez, Teresa']","['de la Cruz A', 'Vera-Zambrano A', 'Peraza DA', 'Valenzuela C', 'Zapata JM', 'Perez-Chacon G', 'Gonzalez T']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas - Universidad Autonoma de MadridMadrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas - Universidad Autonoma de MadridMadrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidad Autonoma de MadridMadrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas - Universidad Autonoma de MadridMadrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas - Universidad Autonoma de MadridMadrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas - Universidad Autonoma de MadridMadrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Hospital Universitario La Paz (IdiPaz)Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas - Universidad Autonoma de MadridMadrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Hospital Universitario La Paz (IdiPaz)Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"", Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas - Universidad Autonoma de MadridMadrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidad Autonoma de MadridMadrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Hospital Universitario La Paz (IdiPaz)Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170331,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC5374215,['NOTNLM'],"['B lymphocyte', 'F-ara-A', 'KV1.3', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'fludarabine']",,2017/04/15 06:00,2017/04/15 06:01,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2017.00177 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2017 Mar 31;8:177. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2017.00177. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The enrolled AL patients were divided into three groups (newly diagnosed, relapsed, and complete remission [CR]). Healthy donors were also included as a control group in this study. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to measure messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of SHP-1 and SOCS6. Statistical analysis was conducted to analyze the correlation between mRNA levels of SHP-1 and SOCS6 with patient outcomes. RESULTS: mRNA expression of SHP-1 was significantly lower in AL patients than that in healthy donors. The newly diagnosed or relapsed AL patients had lower mRNA levels of SHP-1 than the patients in CR. In contrast, SOCS6 mRNA expression was significantly higher in newly diagnosed or relapsed patients than that in patients in CR as well as healthy donors. However, mRNA levels of both SHP-1 and SOCS6 were positively correlated with the patient remission. The chemotherapy-induced remission rate was higher in patients with detectable SHP-1 or SOCS6 expression than in patients with undetectable SHP-1 or SOCS6 expression. Furthermore, the AL patients with detectable SHP-1 mRNA expression had lower incidence rate of invasive fungal infection. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that expression patterns of SHP-1 and SOCS6 differ in AL patients. Despite the difference, expression of SHP-1 and SOCS6 is associated with favorable outcomes, suggesting an anticancer property of these two genes in AL.","['Liu, Jinmei', 'Zheng, Yurong', 'Gao, Ju', 'Zhu, Guimei', 'Gao, Kun', 'Zhang, Wenzhen', 'Shi, Fangyan', 'Zhang, Qing']","['Liu J', 'Zheng Y', 'Gao J', 'Zhu G', 'Gao K', 'Zhang W', 'Shi F', 'Zhang Q']","['Department of Hematology, Kailuan General Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Kailuan General Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Kailuan General Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Kailuan General Hospital.', 'Department of Emergency, Tangshan Union Medical College Hospital.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tangshan People's Hospital."", 'Department of Blood Dialysis, Linxi Hospital.', ""Department of Ultrasonography, Tangshan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170329,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC5384700,['NOTNLM'],"['SHP-1', 'SOCS6', 'invasive fungal infection', 'leukemia', 'prognosis']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2017/04/15 06:00,2017/04/15 06:01,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S131537 [doi]', 'ott-10-1915 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Mar 29;10:1915-1920. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S131537. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current efforts are focused on better understanding the intricate pathophysiology of the disease to develop successful targeted therapies. Ibrutinib is emerging as an important agent in this new age of targeted treatment for CLL. As a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, it blocks the signaling pathway that malignant B-lymphocytes need for growth and maturation. Ibrutinib's role in therapy was further expanded recently when the US Food and Drug Administration approved its use in both frontline and salvage treatment for patients with CLL.

In this study, we established a permanent ALL cell strain CHH-1 with the long arm of chromosome 11 aberration and without MLL rearrangement, hoping that it could be used for the research of ALL with such genetic abnormality. CHH-1 cell strain was certified through morphology, immunophenotype, genetics and immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement analysis. Cell characteristics including tumorigenic ability, semisolid colony forming ability, telomerase activity, autocrine and invasion were further detected. Cells were with an add(11)(q23) structural abnormality without MLL rearrangement, and were consistent with the genetic abnormality of the patient. In addition, these cells had features of tumor-forming ability, high colony forming capacity, unique cytokine autocrine mode, high telomerase activity, and high invasion ability. CHH-1 may prove to be a useful cell model for the research of human leukemia with genetic aberration in chromosome 11, and help explore the role of such genetic abnormality in the pathogenesis, progression and prognosis of ALL, and in developing new target drugs.","['Wang, Qian', 'Zhuang, Lin', 'Li, Pei', 'Niu, Qiang', 'Zhu, Ping', 'He, Miao-Xia', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Liu, Chang-Cheng', 'Wang, Min-Jun', 'Chen, Li', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Ma, Yan', 'Hu, Xiao-Xia', 'Hu, Yi-Ping', 'Xu, Xiao-Ping']","['Wang Q', 'Zhuang L', 'Li P', 'Niu Q', 'Zhu P', 'He MX', 'Jiang H', 'Liu CC', 'Wang MJ', 'Chen L', 'Cheng H', 'Ma Y', 'Hu XX', 'Hu YP', 'Xu XP']","['Department of Hematology, HuaShan Hospital Affiliated of FuDan University, No. 12 Middle WuLumuqi Road, Shanghai, 200040, P.R.

Here we report that stimulation of epithelial or fibroblastic cells with G protein-coupled receptor agonists, including angiotensin II or bombesin, induced rapid and persistent PKD1 phosphorylation at Ser(203), a highly conserved residue located within the PKD1 N-terminal domain. Exposure to PKD or PKC family inhibitors did not prevent PKD1 phosphorylation at Ser(203), indicating that it is not mediated by autophosphorylation. In contrast, several lines of evidence indicated that the phosphorylation of PKD1 at Ser(203) is mediated by kinases of the class I PAK subfamily, specifically 1) exposing cells to four structurally unrelated PAK inhibitors (PF-3758309, FRAX486, FRAX597, and IPA-3) that act via different mechanisms abrogated PKD1 phosphorylation at Ser(203), 2) siRNA-mediated knockdown of PAK1 and PAK2 in IEC-18 and Swiss 3T3 cells blunted PKD1 phosphorylation at Ser(203), 3) phosphorylation of Ser(203) markedly increased in vitro when recombinant PKD1 was incubated with either PAK1 or PAK2 in the presence of ATP. PAK inhibitors did not interfere with G protein-coupled receptor activation-induced rapid translocation of PKD1 to the plasma membrane but strikingly prevented the dissociation of PKD1 from the plasma membrane and blunted the phosphorylation of nuclear targets, including class IIa histone deacetylases. We conclude that PAK-mediated phosphorylation of PKD1 at Ser(203) triggers its membrane dissociation and subsequent entry into the nucleus, thereby regulating the phosphorylation of PKD1 nuclear targets, including class IIa histone deacetylases.","['Chang, Jen-Kuan', 'Ni, Yang', 'Han, Liang', 'Sinnett-Smith, James', 'Jacamo, Rodrigo', 'Rey, Osvaldo', 'Young, Steven H', 'Rozengurt, Enrique']","['Chang JK', 'Ni Y', 'Han L', 'Sinnett-Smith J', 'Jacamo R', 'Rey O', 'Young SH', 'Rozengurt E']","['From the Division of Digestive Diseases, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine.', 'From the Division of Digestive Diseases, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine.', 'From the Division of Digestive Diseases, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine.', 'From the Division of Digestive Diseases, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine.', 'CURE: Digestive Diseases Research Center, and.', 'Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Health Care System and.', 'the Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030-4017, and.', 'the Institute of Immunology, Genetics, and Metabolism, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires C1120AAR, Argentina.', 'From the Division of Digestive Diseases, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine.', 'CURE: Digestive Diseases Research Center, and.', 'Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Health Care System and.', 'From the Division of Digestive Diseases, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, erozengurt@mednet.ucla.edu.', 'CURE: Digestive Diseases Research Center, and.', 'Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Health Care System and.', 'the Molecular Biology Institute, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095-1786.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20170413,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC5465480,['NOTNLM'],"['*G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)', '*angiotensin II', '*protein kinase C (PKC)', '*protein kinase D (PKD)', '*serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK 1 (PAK1)']",,2017/04/15 06:00,2017/06/15 06:00,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2016/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)32142-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.771394 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2017 Jun 9;292(23):9523-9539. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.771394.

Owing to mutations in their canonical motifs required for proper kinase activity, RORs are classified as pseudokinases lacking detectable catalytic activity. ROR1 stands out for its selective and high expression in numerous blood and solid malignancies compared with a minimal expression in healthy adult tissues, suggesting high potential for this molecule as a drug target for cancer therapy. Current understanding attributes a survival role for ROR1 in cancer cells; however, its oncogenic function is cancer-type-specific and involves various signaling pathways. High interest in ROR1-targeted therapies resulted in the development of ROR1 monoclonal antibodies such as cirmtuzumab, currently in a phase I clinical trial for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Despite these advances in translational studies, the molecular mechanism employed by ROR1 in different cancers is not yet fully understood; therefore, more insights into the oncogenic role of ROR1 signaling are crucial in order to optimize the use of targeted drugs. Recent studies provided evidence that targeting ROR1 simultaneously with inhibition of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is more effective in killing ROR1-positive leukemia cells, suggesting a synergistic correlation between co-targeting ROR1 and BCR pathways. Although this synergy has been previously reported for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the molecular mechanism appears rather different. These results provide more insights into ROR1-BCR combinatorial treatment strategies in hematological malignancies, which could benefit in tailoring more effective targeted therapies in other ROR1-positive cancers.","['Karvonen, Hanna', 'Niininen, Wilhelmiina', 'Murumagi, Astrid', 'Ungureanu, Daniela']","['Karvonen H', 'Niininen W', 'Murumagi A', 'Ungureanu D']","['BioMediTech, BMT, University of Tampere, Tampere 33014, Finland.', 'BioMediTech, BMT, University of Tampere, Tampere 33014, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, FIMM, University of Helsinki, Helsinki 00290, Finland.', 'BioMediTech, BMT, University of Tampere, Tampere 33014, Finland daniela.ungureanu@uta.fi.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ROR1', '*cancer', '*drug testing', '*lymphoma']",,2017/04/15 06:00,2017/05/04 06:00,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['BST20160272 [pii]', '10.1042/BST20160272 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2017 Apr 15;45(2):457-464. doi: 10.1042/BST20160272.,,20170502,,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Translational Research, Biomedical', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,"['(c) 2017 The Author(s); published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the', 'Biochemical Society.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the frequency and spectrum of targetable genetic lesions in a retrospective cohort of 1389 consecutively diagnosed patients with childhood B-lineage ALL with high-risk clinical features and/or elevated minimal residual disease at the end of remission induction therapy. The Ph-like gene expression profile was identified in 341 of 1389 patients, 57 of whom were excluded from additional analyses because of the presence of BCR-ABL1 (n = 46) or ETV6-RUNX1 (n = 11). Among the remaining 284 patients (20.4%), overexpression and rearrangement of CRLF2 (IGH-CRLF2 or P2RY8-CRLF2) were identified in 124 (43.7%), with concomitant genomic alterations activating the JAK-STAT pathway (JAK1, JAK2, IL7R) identified in 63 patients (50.8% of those with CRLF2 rearrangement). Among the remaining patients, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or transcriptome sequencing, we identified targetable ABL-class fusions (ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, and PDGFRB) in 14.1%, EPOR rearrangements or JAK2 fusions in 8.8%, alterations activating other JAK-STAT signaling genes (IL7R, SH2B3, JAK1) in 6.3% or other kinases (FLT3, NTRK3, LYN) in 4.6%, and mutations involving the Ras pathway (KRAS, NRAS, NF1, PTPN11) in 6% of those with Ph-like ALL. We identified 8 new rearrangement partners for 4 kinase genes previously reported to be rearranged in Ph-like ALL.

A phase 1 trial of 45 children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia was conducted using a CD19 CAR product of defined CD4/CD8 composition, uniform CAR expression, and limited effector differentiation. Products meeting all defined specifications occurred in 93% of enrolled patients. The maximum tolerated dose was 10(6) CAR T cells per kg, and there were no deaths or instances of cerebral edema attributable to product toxicity. The overall intent-to-treat minimal residual disease-negative (MRD(-)) remission rate for this phase 1 study was 89%. The MRD(-) remission rate was 93% in patients who received a CAR T-cell product and 100% in the subset of patients who received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion. Twenty-three percent of patients developed reversible severe cytokine release syndrome and/or reversible severe neurotoxicity.

The figure quoted was 30%, which appeared higher than our experience. To assess cyclin D1 expression in PC of SLL/CLL cases, we performed a review of SLL/CLL cases diagnosed at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 1996 and 2009. Of 105 SLL/CLL cases, 16.2% showed expression of cyclin D1 in PC with none carrying the translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32). Our study and a review of the published literature suggest that this phenomenon occurs with a significantly lower prevalence than that described in the recent review of the updated WHO classification. We confirm that cyclin D1 expression is confined to PC with the typical small lymphocytes being negative. This finding is apparently unrelated to the translocation involving CCND1 and IGH genes.","['Teixeira Mendes, Larissa Sena', 'Peters, Natalie', 'Attygalle, Ayoma D', 'Wotherspoon, Andrew']","['Teixeira Mendes LS', 'Peters N', 'Attygalle AD', 'Wotherspoon A']","['Histopathology Department, The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.', 'Histopathology Department, The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.', 'Histopathology Department, The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.', 'Histopathology Department, The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170413,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,['NOTNLM'],"['HAEMATO-ONCOLOGY', 'HEMATOPATHOLOGY', 'IMMUNOPHENOTYPING OF LEUKAEMIAS/LYMPHOMAS']",['Competing interests: None declared.'],2017/04/15 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2017/04/15 06:00'],"['2017/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2017-204364 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2017-204364 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2017 Oct;70(10):899-902. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2017-204364.

Enhancers displayed stronger differential methylation than promoters, consisting predominantly of hypomethylation. AMLs with dominant hypermethylation featured greater epigenetic disruption of promoters, whereas those with dominant hypomethylation displayed greater disruption of distal and intronic regions. Mutations in IDH and DNMT3A had opposing and mutually exclusive effects on the epigenome. Notably, co-occurrence of both mutations resulted in epigenetic antagonism, with most CpGs affected by either mutation alone no longer affected in double-mutant AMLs. Importantly, this epigenetic antagonism precedes malignant transformation and can be observed in preleukemic LSK cells from Idh2(R140Q) or Dnmt3a(R882H) single-mutant and Idh2(R140Q)/Dnmt3a(R882H) double-mutant mice. Notably, IDH/DNMT3A double-mutant AMLs manifested upregulation of a RAS signaling signature and displayed unique sensitivity to MEK inhibition ex vivo as compared with AMLs with either single mutation.Significance: AML is biologically heterogeneous with subtypes characterized by specific genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. Comprehensive DNA methylation profiling revealed that differential methylation of nonpromoter regulatory elements is a driver of epigenetic identity, that gene mutations can be context-dependent, and that co-occurrence of mutations in epigenetic modifiers can result in epigenetic antagonism.

This review addresses the structural and functional features of EMPs, detailing their tissue distribution and functions in the human body, their expression pattern in a variety of tumors, and highlighting the underlying mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis. The implications in cancer biology, patient prognosis prediction, and potential application in disease therapy are discussed. For example, EMP1 was reported to be a biomarker of gefitinib resistance in lung cancer and contributes to prednisolone resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. EMP2 functions as an oncogene in human endometrial and ovarian cancers; however, characteristics of EMP2 in urothelial cancer fulfill the criteria of a suppressor gene. Of particular interest, EMP3 overexpression in breast cancer is significantly related to strong HER-2 expression. Co-expression of HER-2 and EMP3 is the most important indicator of progression-free and metastasis-free survival for patients with urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract. Altogether, discovery of pharmacological inhibitors and/or regulators of EMP protein activity could open novel strategies for enhanced therapy against EMP-mediated human diseases.","['Wang, Yi-Wen', 'Cheng, Hong-Ling', 'Ding, Ya-Rou', 'Chou, Lien-Hsuan', 'Chow, Nan-Haw']","['Wang YW', 'Cheng HL', 'Ding YR', 'Chou LH', 'Chow NH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan.', 'National Cheng Kung University, College of Medicine, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan; Institute of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.

Previous studies have shown that Bu at a fixed dose of 3.2mg/kg/day (FBD) given intravenously decreases variability in drug pharmacokinetics and this decreases the dependency on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of Bu. We compared the Bu dose given using TDM with the FBD of 3.2mg/kg/day. Seventy-three patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplasia, chronic myeloid leukemia, thalassemia major, and sickle cell disease were included. The mean age at transplant was 15years (range 2-55years) with 57% adults. Indication for transplantation was leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome in 46% of the patients, while the remaining 54% were transplanted for inherited blood disorders. We found that the median FBD was lower than the median TDM dose by 39mg/day with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) even after adjusting for the weight (median total FBD of 349mg, median TDM dose of 494mg, p<0.0001). Age and underlying condition (malignant vs. nonmalignant) were the main factors affecting Bu clearance (p<0.001 and p<0.07, respectively). TDM remains an important tool for the appropriate dosing of Bu in preparative regimens of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially in populations with genetic admixture.","['Salman, Bushra', ""Al-Za'abi, Mohammed"", 'Al-Huneini, Mohammed', 'Dennison, David', 'Al-Rawas, Abdulhakeem', 'Al-Kindi, Salam', 'Al-Farsi, Khalil', 'Tauro, Melanie', 'Al-Khabori, Murtadha']","['Salman B', ""Al-Za'abi M"", 'Al-Huneini M', 'Dennison D', 'Al-Rawas A', 'Al-Kindi S', 'Al-Farsi K', 'Tauro M', 'Al-Khabori M']","['Pharmacy Department, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Pharmacy Department, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Child Health, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.', 'Department of Hematology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman.

Additionally, the Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 gene (TET2) is frequently inactivated, which can lead to impaired DNA methylation and promote AML development. We examined the association between TET2 and MEG3 promoter hypermethylation in Hainan patients with AML. The expression of MEG3, TET2, miR-22-3p, and miR-22-5p was assessed in bone marrow samples from AML patients and healthy controls using real-time quantitative PCR. Using Sequenom MassARRAY technology, we compared MEG3 promoter methylation in AML patients and healthy controls. MEG3 expression was lower in AML patients than in the controls (P = 0.136). Moreover, there was greater methylation of MEG3 promoter in the AML patients than the controls (P < 0.05). Methylation of the MEG3 promoter correlated negatively with TET2 expression (P < 0.05, r < 0). Likewise there was a negative correlation between TET2 activity and MEG3 promoter methylation (P < 0.05, r < 0). These results suggest that hypermethylation of the MEG3 promoter in AML may result from decreased TET2 activity. These data provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AML development and progression.","['Yao, Hongxia', 'Duan, Mengling', 'Lin, Lie', 'Wu, Congming', 'Fu, Xiangjun', 'Wang, Hua', 'Guo, Li', 'Chen, Wenting', 'Huang, Li', 'Liu, Dan', 'Rao, Ruo', 'Wang, Shuwen', 'Ding, Yipeng']","['Yao H', 'Duan M', 'Lin L', 'Wu C', 'Fu X', 'Wang H', 'Guo L', 'Chen W', 'Huang L', 'Liu D', 'Rao R', 'Wang S', 'Ding Y']","['Department of Hematology, Hainan General Hospital, Haikou, Hainan, 570311, R.R.

Therefore, novel compounds with increased intracellular effects against SRPK activity were obtained, contributing to medicinal chemistry efforts towards the development of new anticancer agents.","['Siqueira, Raoni Pais', 'Barros, Marcus Vinicius de Andrade', 'Barbosa, Everton de Almeida Alves', 'Onofre, Thiago Souza', 'Goncalves, Victor Hugo Sousa', 'Pereira, Higor Sette', 'Silva Junior, Abelardo', 'de Oliveira, Leandro Licursi', 'Almeida, Marcia Rogeria', 'Fietto, Juliana Lopes Rangel', 'Teixeira, Robson Ricardo', 'Bressan, Gustavo Costa']","['Siqueira RP', 'Barros MVA', 'Barbosa EAA', 'Onofre TS', 'Goncalves VHS', 'Pereira HS', 'Silva Junior A', 'de Oliveira LL', 'Almeida MR', 'Fietto JLR', 'Teixeira RR', 'Bressan GC']","['Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Quimica, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Veterinaria, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Biologia Geral, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Departamento de Quimica, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.

Chromosomal abnormalities have already been described to accumulate preferably in the PCs as opposed to the intervening small cell areas. To further characterize the pathogenic role of PCs, the expression levels of 17 selected miRs known to be involved in the development of CLL/SLL were compared in the PCs and the intervening small cell areas in lymph nodes of 15 patients with CLL/SLL. The miR expression levels were also compared to the cytogenetic alterations defined by FISH analysis. Our results show that two known oncomiRs, miR-155 and -92a were upregulated and the tumour suppressor miR-150 was downregulated in the PCs. Low expression of miR-150 was also associated with loss of 11q. In summary we found significantly higher expression of oncomiRs and lower expression of a tumour suppressor miR in PCs of CLL/SLL lymph nodes, which support the hypothesis that the PCs may drive the disease and play a role in progression.","['Szurian, Kinga', 'Csala, Iren', 'Piurko, Violetta', 'Deak, Linda', 'Matolcsy, Andras', 'Reiniger, Lilla']","['Szurian K', 'Csala I', 'Piurko V', 'Deak L', 'Matolcsy A', 'Reiniger L']","['1 st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Institute of Behavioural Sciences, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pathology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '1 st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '1 st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '1 st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary; MTA-SE NAP, Brain Metastasis Research Group, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 2nd Department of Pathology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.

As few data are available in the subset of cytogenetically-normal (CN) AML, we retrospectively evaluated the correlations between CD200 expression and response to therapy in a series of 139 adults with CN-AML. CD200 was expressed in 67/139 (48%) cases; 18 of them (28%) expressed CD200 at high intensity. No differences in CD200 expression rate were observed according to age, WBC count, type of leukemia, FLT3 or NMP1 mutation, and CD56 expression. A higher incidence of CD200 expression was observed in CD34+ cases (P<0.0001) and in BCL2+ patients (P=0.04). Complete remission (CR) was evaluable achieved in 98 patients (70%): 56/71 (79%) in CD200- and 47/67 (63%) in CD200+ patients (P=0.03), with a lower CR rate in patients with high CD200 intensity (9/18, 50%). CD200 expression had a negative impact on long-term outcome. CD200 expression, per se, did not impact on disease-free survival (DFS), but cases with high CD200 expression had a lower 3-year DFS compared to CD200-negative and low-expressing ones (0% vs 65% vs 68%, P=0.019). Three-year overall survival (OS) was 51% in CD200- and 27% in CD200+ patients (P=0.01), with a significant difference among cases with low or high CD200 expression (35% vs 0%, P=0.001). CD200 high expression defined a group with very poor DFS and OS also among the 37 FLT3-/NPM1+: 3-year DFS and OS were 88% and 60% in CD200-, 50% and 32% in CD200 low and 0% and 0% in CD200 high patients, respectively (P=0.01 for DFS and P=0.05 for OS).

However, to the authors' knowledge, data regarding the cancer burden in this group are lacking, which would inform targeted cancer prevention and control. METHODS: The authors calculated age-standardized proportional incidence ratios (PIRs) comparing the frequency of the top 15 cancers in ABs with that of US-born non-Hispanic blacks (USBs) by sex and region of birth using incidence data for 2000 through 2012 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER 17) program. RESULTS: Compared with USBs, ABs had significantly higher PIRs of infection-related cancers (liver, stomach, and Kaposi sarcoma), blood cancers (leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), prostate cancer, and thyroid cancers (females only). For example, the PIR for Kaposi sarcoma in AB versus USB women was 12.06 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.23-18.90). In contrast, ABs had lower PIRs for smoking-related and colorectal cancers (eg, for lung cancer among men, the PIR was 0.30 [95% CI, 0.27-0.34]). Furthermore, cancer occurrence in ABs versus USBs varied by region of birth. For example, the higher PIRs for liver cancer noted among male ABs (PIR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.79-5.35) and for thyroid cancer in female ABs (PIR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.03-4.02) were confined to Eastern African-born blacks, whereas the higher PIR for prostate cancer (PIR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.78, 2.02) was confined to Western African-born blacks. CONCLUSIONS: The cancer incidence profile of ABs is different from that of USBs and varies by region of birth, suggesting differences in environmental, cultural, social, and genetic factors.

Nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) comprise all STS except rhabdomyosarcoma. In people with advanced local or metastatic disease, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) applied after high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) is a planned rescue therapy for HDCT-related severe hematologic toxicity. The rationale for this update is to determine whether any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted and to clarify whether HDCT followed by autologous HSCT has a survival advantage. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for all stages of nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) in children and adults. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we revised the search strategy to improve the precision and reduce the number of irrelevant hits. We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8), PubMed from 2012 to 6 September 2016, and Embase from 2012 to 26 September 2016. We searched online trial registries and congress proceedings from 2012 to 26 September 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Terms representing STS and autologous HSCT were required in the title or abstract. We restricted the study design to RCTs. We included studies if at least 80% of participants had a diagnosis listed in any version of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and classified as malignant. The search included children and adults with no age limits. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were overall survival and treatment-related mortality. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 1549 records; 85 items from electronic databases, 45 from study registries, and 1419 from congress proceedings. The revised search strategy did not identify any additional RCTs. In the previous version of the review, we identified one RCT comparing HDCT followed by autologous HSCT versus standard-dose chemotherapy (SDCT). The trial randomized 87 participants who were considerably heterogeneous with respect to 19 different tumor entities. The data from 83 participants were available for analysis.In the single included trial, overall survival at three years was 32.7% in the HDCT arm versus 49.4% in the SDCT arm and there was no difference between the treatment groups (hazard ratio (HR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 2.29, P = 0.44; 1 study, 83 participants; high quality evidence). In a subgroup of participants who had a complete response before HDCT, overall survival was higher in both treatment groups and overall survival at three years was 42.8% in the HDCT arm versus 83.9% in the SDCT arm and favored the SDCT group (HR 2.92, 95% CI 1.1 to 7.6, P = 0.028; 1 study, 39 participants).In the single included trial, the authors reported one treatment-related leukemia death two years after HDCT. They also evaluated severe adverse events WHO grade 3 to 4 in 22 participants in the HDCT arm and in 51 participants in the SDCT arm. The authors reported 11 events concerning digestive-, infection-, pain-, or asthenia-related toxicity in the HDCT arm and one event in the SDCT arm (moderate quality evidence). The development of secondary neoplasia was not addressed. We judged the study to have an overall unclear risk of bias as three of seven items had unclear and four items had low risk of bias. For GRADE, we judged three items as high quality and three items were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The limited data of a single RCT with an unclear risk of bias and moderate to high quality evidence showed no survival advantage for HDCT. If this treatment is offered it should only be given after careful consideration on an individual person basis and possibly only as part of a well-designed RCT.","['Peinemann, Frank', 'Enk, Heike', 'Smith, Lesley A']","['Peinemann F', 'Enk H', 'Smith LA']","[""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, University of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, Cologne, Germany, 50937."", 'c/o Cochrane Childhood Cancer, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychology, Social Work and Public Health, Oxford Brookes University, Jack Straws Lane, Marston, Oxford, UK, OX3 0FL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20170413,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,PMC6478255,,,,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/08/03 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD008216.pub5 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017 Apr 13;4:CD008216. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008216.pub5.,,20170802,,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods/mortality', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Aug 07;(8):CD008216.

We collected peripheral blood serum samples from 62 AML patients and 15 healthy controls. After removing high-abundance proteins, low-abundance serum proteins were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to identify differences between AML patients and healthy people. We investigated the different protein dots by mass fingerprint analysis, and evaluated the results using the Masort retrieval program provided by the MSDB protein bank. To further investigate the relationship between standard chemotherapy treatment efficacy and differences in protein patterns, we divided 21 patients into two groups (A and B) according to the efficacy of standard chemotherapy. Compared with the healthy cases, the AML patients demonstrated significant abnormal expression in 14 proteins (P < 0.05); alpha1-trypsin inhibitor (P < 0.01), prealbumin (P < 0.01), apolipoprotein E (P < 0.010), and apolipoprotein A-IV (P < 0.01) expression decreased, whereas haptoglobin HP2 (P < 0.05), serum exogenous lectin (P < 0.05), H factor homologue protein (P < 0.05), and serum amyloid A1 (P < 0.01) expression increased. Further stratified analysis revealed that patients with high serum lectin expression had poor outcomes.

Clinically, the disease is heterogeneous, most patients being largely asymptomatic, although neutropenia, fatigue and B symptoms and underlying diseases such as autoimmune diseases or malignancies are also often observed. The etiology of TCRgammadelta+ T-LGL proliferations is largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms of these rare proliferations by performing gene expression profiling of TCRgammadelta+ T-LGL versus normal TCRgammadelta+ T cell subsets. From our initial microarray dataset we observed that TCRgammadelta+ T-LGL leukemia forms a separate group when compared with different healthy control TCRgammadelta+ T cell subsets, correlating best with the healthy TemRA subset. The lowest correlation was seen with the naive subset. Based on specific comparison between healthy control cells and TCRgammadelta+ T-LGL leukemia cells we observed up-regulation of survival, proliferation and hematopoietic system related genes, with a remarkable down-regulation of apoptotic pathway genes. RQ-PCR validation of important genes representative for the dataset, including apoptosis (XIAP, CASP1, BCLAF1 and CFLAR), proliferation/development (ID3) and inflammation (CD28, CCR7, CX3CR1 and IFNG) processes largely confirmed the dysregulation in proliferation and apoptosis. Based on these expression data we conclude that TCRgammadelta+ T-LGL leukemia is likely the result of an underlying aberrant molecular mechanisms leading to increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis.","['Kallemeijn, Martine J', 'de Ridder, Dick', 'Schilperoord-Vermeulen, Joyce', 'van der Klift, Michele Y', 'Sandberg, Yorick', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Langerak, Anton W']","['Kallemeijn MJ', 'de Ridder D', 'Schilperoord-Vermeulen J', 'van der Klift MY', 'Sandberg Y', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Langerak AW']","['Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Wageningen University, Wageningen, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Department of Immunology, Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170413,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5391076,,,,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/04/22 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0175670 [doi]', 'PONE-D-17-01722 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Apr 13;12(4):e0175670. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0175670. eCollection 2017.,,20170421,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2078-3220'],"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute leukemia, the incidence of venous thromboembolism or disseminated intravascular coagulation is associated with induction chemotherapy. Procoagulant effects of IDR, AraC, and Am80 were investigated in a vascular endothelial cell line EAhy926 and AML cell lines HL60 (AML M2), NB4 (AML M3, APL), and U937 (AML M5), focusing on tissue factor (TF), phosphatidylserine (PS), and thrombomodulin (TM). IDR induced procoagulant activity on the surface of vascular endothelial and AML cell lines. Expression of TF antigen, TM antigen, and PS were induced by IDR on the surface of each cell line, whereas expression of TF and TM mRNAs were unchanged. Conversely, Am80 decreased TF exposure and procoagulant activity, and increased TM exposure on NB4 cells. In NB4 cells, we observed downregulation of TF mRNA and upregulation of TM mRNA. These data suggest IDR may induce procoagulant activity in vessels by apoptosis through PS exposure and/or TF expression on vascular endothelial and AML cell lines. Am80 may suppress blood coagulation through downregulation of TF expression and induction of TM expression.

RECENT FINDINGS: The distribution of lymphoma types/subtypes among East Asian countries is very similar, with a lower proportion of B-cell malignancies and a higher proportion of T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphomas as compared to Western populations. Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is more frequently observed in East Asia, whereas follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are proportionally lower. The incidence rate of lymphoma subtypes in Asians living in the US was generally intermediate to the general rate in US and Asia, suggesting that both genetic and environmental factors may underlie the geographical variations observed.Key cancer driver mutations have been identified in Asian patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma through genome sequencing. A distinct somatic mutation profile has also been observed in Chinese diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients. SUMMARY: The incidence and distribution of lymphoma subtypes differed significantly between patients from East Asia and Western countries, suggesting subtype-specific etiologic mechanisms. Further studies on the mechanism underlying these geographical variations may give new insights into our understanding of lymphomagenesis.","['Ren, Weicheng', 'Li, Wei', 'Ye, Xiaofei', 'Liu, Hui', 'Pan-Hammarstrom, Qiang']","['Ren W', 'Li W', 'Ye X', 'Liu H', 'Pan-Hammarstrom Q']","['aDivision of Clinical Immunology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden bKey Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Department of Lymphoma, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,,,,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000355 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Jul;24(4):367-376. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000355.,,20171024,,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Asia/epidemiology', 'Biomarkers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Mutation Rate', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examine chromatin structure following differentiation of the human myeloid leukemia cell line (HL-60/S4) into granulocytes with retinoic acid (RA) or into macrophage with phorbol ester (TPA). We performed ChIP-seq of histone H3 and its modifications, analyzing changes in nucleosome occupancy, nucleosome repeat length, eu-/heterochromatin redistribution and properties of epichromatin (surface chromatin adjacent to the nuclear envelope). Nucleosome positions changed genome-wide, exhibiting a specific class of alterations involving nucleosome loss in extended ( approximately 1kb) regions, pronounced in enhancers and promoters. Genes that lost nucleosomes at their promoters showed a tendency to be upregulated. On the other hand, nucleosome gain did not show simple effects on transcript levels. The average genome-wide nucleosome repeat length (NRL) did not change significantly with differentiation. However, we detected an approximate 10 bp NRL decrease around the haematopoietic transcription factor (TF) PU.1 and the architectural protein CTCF, suggesting an effect on NRL proximal to TF binding sites. Nucleosome occupancy changed in regions associated with active promoters in differentiated cells, compared with untreated HL-60/S4 cells. Epichromatin regions revealed an increased GC content and high nucleosome density compared with surrounding chromatin. Epichromatin showed depletion of major histone modifications and revealed enrichment with PML body-associated genes. In general, chromatin changes during HL-60/S4 differentiation appeared to be more localized to regulatory regions, compared with genome-wide changes among diverse cell types studied elsewhere.","['Teif, Vladimir B', 'Mallm, Jan-Philipp', 'Sharma, Tanvi', 'Mark Welch, David B', 'Rippe, Karsten', 'Eils, Roland', 'Langowski, Jorg', 'Olins, Ada L', 'Olins, Donald E']","['Teif VB', 'Mallm JP', 'Sharma T', 'Mark Welch DB', 'Rippe K', 'Eils R', 'Langowski J', 'Olins AL', 'Olins DE']","['a School of Biological Sciences , University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park , Colchester , UK.', 'b German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a School of Biological Sciences , University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park , Colchester , UK.', 'c Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution , Marine Biological Laboratory , Woods Hole , MA , USA.', 'b German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'b German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'b German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'd Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , College of Pharmacy, University of New England , Portland , ME , USA.', 'd Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , College of Pharmacy, University of New England , Portland , ME , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Nucleus,"Nucleus (Austin, Tex.)",101518322,PMC5403151,['NOTNLM'],"['*CTCF: Epichromatin', '*histone modifications', '*nucleosome positioning', '*nucleosome repeat length', '*transcription factor binding']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/04/27 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/19491034.2017.1295201 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleus. 2017 Mar 4;8(2):188-204. doi: 10.1080/19491034.2017.1295201.,,20170426,,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics']",['200733/Z/16/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified patients aged >/=18 years and hospitalized between 2005 and 2015 for Ph-negative R/R B-cell ALL. Data were collected from the index date (first diagnosis of R/R ALL) until death or loss to follow-up. The salvage chemotherapy period was defined as the first chemotherapy hospitalization after the index date to the earliest of death, loss to follow-up, last chemotherapy dose plus 30 days, or initiation of hematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The primary endpoint was the percent of time in the hospital during the salvage chemotherapy period. Hospitalization costs were reported from the public health care payer perspective. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included, with median age of 37 years. The average proportion of time patients spent in the hospital during the salvage chemotherapy period was 50.5%. From the index date to death, patients received a mean of 1.8 lines of chemotherapy, most commonly hyper-CVAD (31%). There was a mean of 5.5 inpatient hospitalizations and 40.1 outpatient visits with 40.8 outpatient lab tests. Mean costs per patient were euro79,973 for hospitalization (excluding HSCT), euro26,337 for HSCT, euro21,007 for chemotherapy drugs, and euro6,341 for outpatient management, resulting in a total cost from the payer's perspective of euro133,965 per patient. CONCLUSION: Adults with Ph-negative R/R ALL spend half the time receiving salvage chemotherapy in the hospital. Their treatment is associated with large reimbursement costs in Belgium.","['Maertens, Johan', 'Graux, Carlos', 'Breems, Dimitri', 'Havelange, Violaine', 'Wittnebel, Sebastian', 'Strens, Danielle', 'Hoefkens, Caroline']","['Maertens J', 'Graux C', 'Breems D', 'Havelange V', 'Wittnebel S', 'Strens D', 'Hoefkens C']","['a Department of Hematology , UZ Leuven , Leuven , Belgium.', 'b Department of Hematology , CHU UCL Namur (Godinne) , Yvoir , Belgium.', 'c Department of Hematology , Ziekenhuis Netwerk Antwerpen , Antwerp , Belgium.', 'd Department of Hematology , Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc , Brussels , Belgium.', 'e Department of Hematology , Institut Jules Bordet , Brussels , Belgium.', 'f Realidad bvba , Grimbergen , Belgium.', 'g Amgen sa , Brussels , Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170413,England,Acta Clin Belg,Acta clinica Belgica,0370306,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Chemotherapy', 'Hospitalization', 'Reimbursement', 'Transplant']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17843286.2017.1314091 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Clin Belg. 2017 Dec;72(6):429-433. doi: 10.1080/17843286.2017.1314091.

We herein review the past and recent evidence on the impact of early response. RECENT FINDINGS: In the recent years, the achievement of an early molecular response (EMR, defined as 3-month BCR-ABL1 transcript <10% IS) has emerged as a useful tool to identify poor-risk patients. Although several groups have reported the importance of such milestone, clinical intervention based on it remains controversial partly due to its low specificity to predict progression, which may be partially improved by using the rate of decline in BCR-ABL1 transcript level (halving time or velocity of ratio reduction). Standardization of halving time or velocity of ratio reduction will likely help establishing more stringent recommendation and modify current clinical practices.","['Harrington, Patrick', 'Kizilors, Aytug', 'de Lavallade, Hugues']","['Harrington P', 'Kizilors A', 'de Lavallade H']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."", ""Haematology Department, King's College London, London, UK."", ""Haematology Department, King's College London, London, UK."", ""Laboratory for Molecular Haemato-Oncology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust/King's College London, London, UK."", ""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. h.delavallade@nhs.net."", ""Haematology Department, King's College London, London, UK. h.delavallade@nhs.net.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,PMC5410202,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*Chronic myeloid leukemias', '*Early molecular response', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-017-0375-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-017-0375-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2017 Apr;12(2):79-84. doi: 10.1007/s11899-017-0375-0.,,20171019,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retreatment', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-four cases of MDS and six cases of AML transformed from MDS (MDS/AML) were included. HSPCs and NK cells were isolated by magnetic absorption cell sorting. We used flow cytometry to detect the levels of ROS and intracellular JNK and P38 in NK cells and HSPCs. Total RNA and protein were extracted from NK cells and CD34(+) cells to examine the expression of JNK and p38MAPK using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Intracellular iron concentration was detected. Data were analyzed by SPSS 21 statistical software. Intracellular iron concentration and ROS were increased in both NK cells and HSPCs in MDS patients with iron overload (P < 0.05). MDS patients with iron overload had higher JNK expression and lower p38 expression in NK cells, and higher p38 expression in HSPCs compared with non-iron overload group. IOL may cause alterations in NK cells and HSPCs through the JNK and p38 pathways, and play a role in the transformation to AML from MDS.","['Hua, Yanni', 'Wang, Chaomeng', 'Jiang, Huijuan', 'Wang, Yihao', 'Liu, Chunyan', 'Li, Lijuan', 'Liu, Hui', 'Shao, Zonghong', 'Fu, Rong']","['Hua Y', 'Wang C', 'Jiang H', 'Wang Y', 'Liu C', 'Li L', 'Liu H', 'Shao Z', 'Fu R']","[""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, No. 154 Anshan West Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, No. 154 Anshan West Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, No. 154 Anshan West Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, No. 154 Anshan West Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, No. 154 Anshan West Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, No. 154 Anshan West Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, No. 154 Anshan West Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, No. 154 Anshan West Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, No. 154 Anshan West Street, Heping District, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China. florai@sina.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170412,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['Iron overload', 'JNK', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'P38MAPK']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/10/06 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2237-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2237-x [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Aug;106(2):248-257. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2237-x.

Hypomethylation agent, decitabine (5-Aza-dC), is an experimental agent in MDR therapy, while the mechanism is not very clear. In the present study, we demonstrated 5-Aza-dC may reverse MDR induced by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) coded by mdr1 gene in both hematologic K562/ADR cells and solid tumor MCF-7/ADR cells with time and dose-dependent manner. 5-Aza-dC significantly increased drug sensitivity in patients' leukemic cells which had higher expression of mdr1 gene. Both total protein and membrane P-gp expression were up-regulated with 5-Aza-dC treatment in K562/ADR and MCF-7/ADR cells. However, accumulation of adriamycin and rhodamine 123 were increased which suggested the depression of P-gp activity. Gene expression profiling was performed and activation of MAPK signaling pathway was identified as the most significant change affected by 5-Aza-dC. Inhibition of MAPK pathway could increase P-gp activity. Our data suggested that hypomethylation agent decitabine restores drug sensitivity in the P-gp-induced MDR phenotype by depressing of P-gp activity as drug pump partly through MAPK signaling pathway.","['Wang, Huihan', 'Wang, Xiaobin', 'Liao, Aijun', 'Liu, Zhuogang']","['Wang H', 'Wang X', 'Liao A', 'Liu Z']","['Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, No. 39 Huaxiang Street, Shenyang, 110021, China.', 'Department of Urology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, No. 39 Huaxiang Street, Shenyang, 110021, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, No. 39 Huaxiang Street, Shenyang, 110021, China.

Although somatic mutations in JAK2, MPL, and CALR have been identified in the pathogenesis of these diseases, inhibitors of the Jak2 pathway have not demonstrated efficacy in ameliorating MF in patients. TGF-beta family members are profibrotic cytokines and we observed significant TGF-beta1 isoform overexpression in a large cohort of primary MF patient samples. Significant overexpression of TGF-beta1 was also observed in murine clonal MPL(W515L) megakaryocytic cells. TGF-beta1 stimulated the deposition of excessive collagen by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) by activating the TGF-beta receptor I kinase (ALK5)/Smad3 pathway. MSCs derived from MPL(W515L) mice demonstrated sustained overproduction of both collagen I and collagen III, effects that were abrogated by ALK5 inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, use of galunisertib, a clinically active ALK5 inhibitor, significantly improved MF in both MPL(W515L) and JAK2(V617F) mouse models. These data demonstrate the role of malignant hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)/TGF-beta/MSC axis in the pathogenesis of MF, and provide a preclinical rationale for ALK5 blockade as a therapeutic strategy in MF.","['Yue, Lanzhu', 'Bartenstein, Matthias', 'Zhao, Wanke', 'Ho, Wanting Tina', 'Han, Ying', 'Murdun, Cem', 'Mailloux, Adam W', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Wang, Xuefeng', 'Budhathoki, Anjali', 'Pradhan, Kith', 'Rapaport, Franck', 'Wang, Huaquan', 'Shao, Zonghong', 'Ren, Xiubao', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Zhao, Zhizhuang Joe', 'Verma, Amit', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie K']","['Yue L', 'Bartenstein M', 'Zhao W', 'Ho WT', 'Han Y', 'Murdun C', 'Mailloux AW', 'Zhang L', 'Wang X', 'Budhathoki A', 'Pradhan K', 'Rapaport F', 'Wang H', 'Shao Z', 'Ren X', 'Steidl U', 'Levine RL', 'Zhao ZJ', 'Verma A', 'Epling-Burnette PK']","['Department of Immunology, H.

The most common underlying malignancy in patients with LMC are leukemia, breast cancer, lymphoma, and lung cancer. We report a case of gastric adenocarcinoma that presented with LMC in the absence of overt gastrointestinal signs or symptoms. A 56-year-old Hispanic woman presented to the hospital with a three-week history of intermittent headaches and visual blurring. An initial brain imaging showed infarction in the distribution of right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) along with communicating hydrocephalus. She underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement with improvement in her symptoms. Two months later she presented again with deterioration in her mental status. Imaging studies and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis confirmed the diagnosis of LMC. Further studies determined the primary tumor to be signet ring cell gastric adenocarcinoma. However, she did not have any preceding gastrointestinal symptoms. In light of the poor prognosis, the patient's family proceeded with comfort care measures. Our case portrays a rare presentation of gastric adenocarcinoma with LMC without other distant organ metastatic involvement. It also illustrates the occult nature of gastric carcinoma and signifies the importance of neurologic assessment of patients, with or at risk of gastric carcinoma. It also raises a theoretical concern for VP shunt as a potential conduit of malignant cells from the abdomen to the central nervous system, which may serve as an important susbtrate for future research.","['Ali, Saeed', 'Khan, Muhammad Talha', 'Idrisov, Evgeny A', 'Maqsood, Aadil', 'Asad-Ur-Rahman, Fnu', 'Abusaada, Khalid']","['Ali S', 'Khan MT', 'Idrisov EA', 'Maqsood A', 'Asad-Ur-Rahman F', 'Abusaada K']","['Internal Medicine Residency, Florida Hospital Orlando.', 'Internal Medicine, Khyber Medical College.', 'Internal Medicine Residency, Florida Hospital Orlando.', 'Internal Medicine Residency, Florida Hospital Orlando.', 'Internal Medicine Residency, Florida Hospital Orlando.', 'Graduate Medical Education, Florida Hospital Orlando.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20170307,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,PMC5384845,['NOTNLM'],"['leptomeningeal carcinomatosis', 'signet ring cell cancer']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2017/04/14 06:00,2017/04/14 06:01,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.1085 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2017 Mar 7;9(3):e1085. doi: 10.7759/cureus.1085.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are currently investigated in several clinical trials of cancer immunotherapy but so far, their tumor infiltration has not been systematically explored across human cancers. Novel algorithms allowing the deconvolution of bulk tumor transcriptomes to find the relative proportions of infiltrating leucocytes, such as CIBERSORT, should be appropriate for this aim but in practice they fail to accurately recognize gammadelta T lymphocytes. Here, by implementing machine learning from microarray data, we first improved the computational identification of blood-derived TCRVgamma9Vdelta2(+) gammadelta lymphocytes and then applied this strategy to assess their abundance as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (gammadelta TIL) in approximately 10,000 cancer biopsies from 50 types of hematological and solid malignancies. We observed considerable inter-individual variation of TCRVgamma9Vdelta2(+)gammadelta TIL abundance both within each type and across the spectrum of cancers tested. We report their prominence in B cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3-AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as well as in inflammatory breast, prostate, esophagus, pancreas and lung carcinoma. Across all cancers, the abundance of alphabeta TILs and TCRVgamma9Vdelta2(+) gammadelta TILs did not correlate. alphabeta TIL abundance paralleled the mutational load of tumors and positively correlated with inflammation, infiltration of monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DC), antigen processing and presentation, and cytolytic activity, in line with an association with a favorable outcome. In contrast, the abundance of TCRVgamma9Vdelta2(+) gammadelta TILs did not correlate with these hallmarks and was variably associated with outcome, suggesting that distinct contexts underlie TCRVgamma9Vdelta2(+) gammadelta TIL and alphabeta TIL mobilizations in cancer.","['Tosolini, Marie', 'Pont, Frederic', 'Poupot, Mary', 'Vergez, Francois', 'Nicolau-Travers, Marie-Laure', 'Vermijlen, David', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Dieli, Francesco', 'Fournie, Jean-Jacques']","['Tosolini M', 'Pont F', 'Poupot M', 'Vergez F', 'Nicolau-Travers ML', 'Vermijlen D', 'Sarry JE', 'Dieli F', 'Fournie JJ']","[""Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), Toulouse, France; INSERM U1037-Universite Paul Sabatier-CNRS ERL5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France; Laboratoire d'Excellence TOUCAN, Toulouse, France; Programme Hospitalo-Universitaire en Cancerologie CAPTOR, Toulouse, France; Pole Technologique du Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), Toulouse, France; Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse (IUCT), Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), Toulouse, France; INSERM U1037-Universite Paul Sabatier-CNRS ERL5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France; Pole Technologique du Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), Toulouse, France.', ""Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), Toulouse, France; INSERM U1037-Universite Paul Sabatier-CNRS ERL5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France; Laboratoire d'Excellence TOUCAN, Toulouse, France; Programme Hospitalo-Universitaire en Cancerologie CAPTOR, Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), Toulouse, France; INSERM U1037-Universite Paul Sabatier-CNRS ERL5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France; Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse (IUCT), Toulouse, France.', 'Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse (IUCT) , Toulouse, France.', 'Central Laboratory for Advanced Diagnostics and Biomedical Research (CLADIBIOR), University of Palermo , Palermo, Italy.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), Toulouse, France; INSERM U1037-Universite Paul Sabatier-CNRS ERL5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France; Programme Hospitalo-Universitaire en Cancerologie CAPTOR, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Biopharmacy - Institute for Medical Immunology (IMI), Universite Libre de Bruxelles , Bruxelles, Belgium.', ""Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), Toulouse, France; INSERM U1037-Universite Paul Sabatier-CNRS ERL5294, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France; Laboratoire d'Excellence TOUCAN, Toulouse, France; Programme Hospitalo-Universitaire en Cancerologie CAPTOR, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170206,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,PMC5384348,['NOTNLM'],"['*Artificial intelligence', '*cancer', '*data mining', '*deconvolution', '*gamma delta lymphocyte', '*machine learning', '*microarray', '*transcriptome']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/04/14 06:01,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2017.1284723 [doi]', '1284723 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2017 Feb 6;6(3):e1284723. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1284723. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the acute GVHD mouse model, co-transplantation of Bregs prevents onset through inhibiting Th1 and Th17 differentiation and expanding regulatory T cells. In the GVL mouse model, Bregs contributed to the suppression of acute GVHD but had no adverse effect on GVL activity. In the clinical cohort study, a higher dose of Bregs in allografts was associated with a lower cumulative incidence of acute GVHD but not with increased risk of relapse.

In contrast, the more NK cell-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is difficult to treat with NK-cell-based therapies, and we hypothesized that pre-activation of NK cells could overcome this resistance. We show in pediatric and adult patients with T-cell ALL (T-ALL) perturbed NK cell effector functions at diagnosis. Using an in vivo rat model for T-ALL, Roser leukemia (RL), suppressed NK cell effector functions were observed. NK cells from T-ALL patients had reduced expression of the activating receptors NKp46 and DNAM-1, but not NKG2D. In contrast to T-ALL patients, NKG2D but not NKp46 was downregulated on NK cells during rat RL. Decreased frequencies of terminally differentiated NKG2A(+)CD57(-)CD56(dim) NK cells in human T-ALL was paralleled in the rat by reduced frequencies of bone marrow NK cells expressing the maturation marker CD11b, possibly indicating impairment of differentiation during leukemia. RL was highly resistant to autologous NK cells, but this resistance was overcome upon pre-activation of NK cells with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18, with concomitant upregulation of activation markers and activating receptors. Importantly, adoptive transfers of IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 pre-activated NK cells significantly slowed progression of RL in vivo. The data thus shows that T-ALL blasts normally resistant to NK cells may be targeted by cytokine pre-activated autologous NK cells, and this approach could have potential implications for immunotherapeutic protocols using NK cells to more efficiently target leukemia.","['Boieri, Margherita', 'Ulvmoen, Aina', 'Sudworth, Amanda', 'Lendrem, Clare', 'Collin, Matthew', 'Dickinson, Anne M', 'Kveberg, Lise', 'Inngjerdingen, Marit']","['Boieri M', 'Ulvmoen A', 'Sudworth A', 'Lendrem C', 'Collin M', 'Dickinson AM', 'Kveberg L', 'Inngjerdingen M']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital , Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital , Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Cellular Medicine, Medical School, Newcastle University , Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Institute of Cellular Medicine, Medical School, Newcastle University , Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Institute of Cellular Medicine, Medical School, Newcastle University , Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo , Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital , Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170117,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,PMC5384344,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNAM-1', '*IL-12', '*IL-15', '*IL-18', '*NK cells', '*T-ALL']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/04/14 06:01,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2016.1274478 [doi]', '1274478 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2017 Jan 17;6(3):e1274478. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2016.1274478. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Years later, this phenomenon that we called ""Chemical Xenogenization"" (CX) and more recently, ""Drug-Induced Xenogenization"" (DIX), was reproduced by Thierry Boon with a mutagenic/carcinogenic compound (i.e. N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine). In both cases, the molecular bases of DIX rely on mutagenesis induced by methyl adducts to oxygen-6 of DNA guanine. In the present review we illustrate the main DIX-related immune-pharmacodynamic properties of triazene compounds of clinical use (i.e. dacarbazine and temozolomide).In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has come back to the stage with the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICpI) that show an extraordinary immune-enhancing activity. Here we illustrate the salient biochemical features of some of the most interesting ICpI and the up-to-day status of their clinical use. Moreover, we illustrate the literature showing the direct relationship between somatic mutation burden and susceptibility of cancer cells to host's immune responses.When DIX was discovered, we were not able to satisfactorily exploit the possible presence of triazene-induced neoantigens in malignant cells since no device was available to adequately enhance host's immune responses in clinical settings. Today, ICpI show unprecedented efficacy in terms of survival times, especially when elevated mutation load is associated with cancer cells. Therefore, in the future, mutation-dependent neoantigens obtained by appropriate pharmacological intervention appear to disclose a novel approach for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of ICpI in cancer patients.","['Franzese, Ornella', 'Torino, Francesco', 'Fuggetta, Maria Pia', 'Aquino, Angelo', 'Roselli, Mario', 'Bonmassar, Enzo', 'Giuliani, Anna', ""D'Atri, Stefania""]","['Franzese O', 'Torino F', 'Fuggetta MP', 'Aquino A', 'Roselli M', 'Bonmassar E', 'Giuliani A', ""D'Atri S""]","['Department of Systems Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Systems Medicine, Medical Oncology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology, National Council of Research, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Systems Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Systems Medicine, Medical Oncology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Systems Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology, National Council of Research, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology, National Council of Research, Rome, Italy.', ""Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata-IRCCS, Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5522228,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA repair', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'drug-induced neoantigens', 'immune checkpoints', 'triazene compounds']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2018/04/26 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['16335 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16335 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 20;8(25):41641-41669. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16335.,,20180425,,['0 (Triazenes)'],IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Triazenes/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to understand the approach to hematologic diseases, common standards of care and best practices, issues that remain controversial or debated, and educational or resource gaps that warrant attention. We used mobile application to disseminate and distribute questionnaires to delegates during the 6th international hematologic malignancies conference hosted by the APAC Hematology Consortium at Beijing, China. User responses were collected in an anonymous fashion. We report survey results in two ways: the overall responses, and responses as stratified between Chinese physicians and ""Other"" represented nationalities. Overall geographical concordance in survey responses was positive and strong. Perhaps more interesting than instances of absolute agreement, these data provide a unique opportunity to identify topics in which physician knowledge or opinions diverge. We assigned questions from all modules to broad categories of: patient information; diagnosis; treatment preference; transplantation; and general knowledge/opinion.

We investigated CDK9 protein expression in EAC and Barrett's esophagus and role of CDK9 in oncogenic processes of EAC in vitro and in murine xenografts. The CDK9 expression was significantly higher in EAC as compared to Barrett's esophagus in patient samples. Stable shCDK9 in SKGT4 reduced proliferation by 37% at day 4, increased apoptosis at 48 hours and induced G1 cell cycle arrest at 48 hours (58.4% vs. 45.8%) compared to controls SKGT4 cells. SKGT4-shCDK9 cell-derived tumors were significantly smaller than control SKGT4-derived tumors in xenografts (72.89mm3 vs. 270mm3). Pharmaceutical inhibition of CDK9 by Flavopiridol (0.1microm for 48 hours) and CAN508 (20 and 40microm for 72 hours) induced significant reduction in proliferation and 2-fold increase in apoptosis in SKGT4, FLO1 and OE33 cells. In xenograft models, CAN508 (60 mg/kg/dayx10 days) and Flavopiridol (4mg/kg/dayx10 days) caused 50.8% and 63.1% reduction in xenograft tumors as compared to control on post-treatment day 21. Reduction of MCL-1 and phosphorylated RNA polymerase II was observed with transient shCDK9 in SKGT4 cells but not with stable shCDK9. CAN508 (20 and 40 microm) and Flavopiridol (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 microm) for 4 hours showed reduction in MCL-1 mRNA (84% and 96%) and protein. Mcl-1 overexpression conferred resistance to Flavopiridol (0.2 microm or 0.4 microm for 48 hours) and CAN 508 (20 or 40microm for 72 hours). Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated significant reduction of binding of transcriptional factor HIF-1alpha to MCL-1 promoter in FLO-1 cells by CDK9 inhibitors.","['Tong, Zhimin', 'Chatterjee, Devkumar', 'Deng, Defeng', 'Veeranki, Omkara', 'Mejia, Alicia', 'Ajani, Jaffer A', 'Hofstetter, Wayne', 'Lin, Steven', 'Guha, Sushovan', 'Kopetz, Scott', 'Krishnan, Sunil', 'Maru, Dipen']","['Tong Z', 'Chatterjee D', 'Deng D', 'Veeranki O', 'Mejia A', 'Ajani JA', 'Hofstetter W', 'Lin S', 'Guha S', 'Kopetz S', 'Krishnan S', 'Maru D']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of System Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Thoracic & Cardiovascular Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5438684,['NOTNLM'],"['HIF-1 alpha', 'MCL-1', 'adenocarcinoma', 'cyclin dependent kinase 9', 'esophagus']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2018/03/21 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['15645 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15645 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 25;8(17):28696-28710. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15645.,,20180320,,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Barrett Esophagus/*drug therapy', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Piperidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the role of HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1) in DS using both in vitro and in vivo models. HMGB1 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were gradually released from NB4 and HL-60 cells treated with ATRA and/or ATO. Similarly, higher serum HMGB1 levels positively correlated with the clinical status of DS patients. Exogenous HMGB1 promoted rapid release of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha as well as elevated expression of ICAM-1, without altering cell differentiation. Exogenous HMGB1 also enhanced pulmonary infiltration and up-regulated ICAM-1 expression in the ATRA-treated DS mouse. Pharmacological inhibition or depletion of MEK1/2 reduced the cytokine levels and suppressed expression of ICAM-1 and the adhesion of HMGB1-treated NB4 cells to endothelial cells, implicating MEK/ERK signaling in the response to HMGB1 during DS. Treatment with a HMGB1-neutralizing antibody reduced secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, arrested the elevation of ICAM-1 and blunted the activation of ERK1/2 in ATRA-induced NB4 cells. The HMGB1-neutralizing antibody also decreased ICAM-1 expression and reduced mortality in ATRA-treated DS model mice. These findings demonstrate that released HMGB1 is central to DS, and that targeting HMGB1 may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of DS.","['Tang, Lanlan', 'Chai, Wenwen', 'Ye, Fanghua', 'Yu, Yan', 'Cao, Lizhi', 'Yang, Minghua', 'Xie, Min', 'Yang, Liangchun']","['Tang L', 'Chai W', 'Ye F', 'Yu Y', 'Cao L', 'Yang M', 'Xie M', 'Yang L']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hunan Cancer Hospital and The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5432337,['NOTNLM'],"['HMGB1', 'MEK/ERK', 'adhesive molecule', 'cytokines', 'differentiation syndrome']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['15432 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15432 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 18;8(16):27314-27327. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15432.,,20180305,,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HMGB1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Remission Induction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two mechanisms have been proposed about the occurrence of this rearrangement: the first one is a cryptic insertion between chromosomes 9 and 22; the second one involves two sequential translocations: a classic t(9;22) followed by a reverse translocation, which reconstitutes the normal morphology of the partner chromosomes. Out of 398 newly diagnosed CML patients, we selected 12 Ph-negative cases. Six Ph-negative patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were characterized, in order to study the mechanisms leading to the rearrangement and the eventual correlation with prognosis in treatment with TKIs. FISH analysis revealed cryptic insertion in 5 patients and classic translocation in the last one. In more detail, we observed 4 different patterns of rearrangement, suggesting high genetic heterogeneity of these patients. In our cases, the BCR/ABL rearrangement mapped more frequently on 9q34 region than on 22q11 region, in contrast to previous reports. Four patients, with low Sokal risk, achieved Complete Cytogenetic Response and/or Major Molecular Response after TKIs therapy. Therapy resistance was observed in one patient with duplication of BCR/ABL rearrangement and in another one with high risk. Even if the number patient is inevitably low, we can confirm that the rare Ph-negative CML patients do not constitute a ""warning"" category, meanwhile the presence of further cytogenetic abnormalities remains an adverse prognostic factor even in TKI era.","['Luatti, Simona', 'Baldazzi, Carmen', 'Marzocchi, Giulia', 'Ameli, Gaia', 'Bochicchio, Maria Teresa', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Testoni, Nicoletta']","['Luatti S', 'Baldazzi C', 'Marzocchi G', 'Ameli G', 'Bochicchio MT', 'Soverini S', 'Castagnetti F', 'Tiribelli M', 'Gugliotta G', 'Martinelli G', 'Baccarani M', 'Cavo M', 'Rosti G', 'Testoni N']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

The hypomethylating agents azacitidine (Vidaza(R), AZA) and decitabine (Dacogen(R), DAC) have been approved for the treatment of AML patients, but their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in the recognition of AML blasts through the interaction of the activating NKG2D receptor with its ligands (NKG2DL: MICA/B and ULBPs1-3). However, soluble NKG2DL (sNKG2DL) can be released from the cell surface, impairing immune recognition. Here, we examined whether hypomethylating agents modulate the release of sNKG2DL from AML cells. Results demonstrated that AZA- and DAC-treated AML cells reduce the release of sNKG2DL, preventing downregulation of NKG2D receptor on the cell surface and promoting immune recognition mediated by NKG2D-NKG2DL engagement. We show that the shedding of MICA, MICB and ULBP2 is inhibited by the increased expression of TIMP3, an ADAM17 inhibitor, after DAC treatment. The TIMP3 gene is highly methylated in AML cells lines and in AML patients (25.5%), in which it is significantly associated with an adverse cytogenetic prognosis of the disease.

Herein, we identified a novel LSD1 inhibitor, JL1037, via Computer Aided Drug Design technology. JL1037 is a potent, selective and reversible LSD1 inhibitor with IC50s of 0.1 muM and >1.5 muM for LSD1 and monoamine oxidases A/B (MAO-A/B), respectively. Treatment of THP-1 and Kasumi-1 cell lines with JL1037 resulted in dose dependent accumulation of H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, the major substrates of LSD1, as well as inhibition of cell proliferation, blockade of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. Further investigations demonstrated that JL1037 could upregulate cell cycle-related proteins P21, P57, pro-apoptotic protein Bax and downregulate anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. JL1037 appeared to activate autophage response in AML cell lines as well as primary cells from AML patients by increasing LC3-II expression and the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in cytoplasm. Co-treatment with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) enhanced JL1037-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, daily intravenous administration of JL1037 tended to reduce tumor burden and prolong the survival of t(8;21) leukemia mice. In conclusion, JL1037 exhibited potent anti-leukemia effect and could be a potential therapeutic agent for AML treatment.","['Liu, Shuang', 'Lu, Wenting', 'Li, Shouyun', 'Li, Saisai', 'Liu, Jia', 'Xing, Yuanyuan', 'Zhang, Shuzu', 'Zhou, Joe Zhongxiang', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Xu, Yingxi', 'Rao, Qing', 'Deng, Chengjun', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Liu S', 'Lu W', 'Li S', 'Li S', 'Liu J', 'Xing Y', 'Zhang S', 'Zhou JZ', 'Xing H', 'Xu Y', 'Rao Q', 'Deng C', 'Wang M', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Fujian Jinler Pharmaceuticals, Jiangle County, Fujian 353300, China.', 'Fujian Jinler Pharmaceuticals, Jiangle County, Fujian 353300, China.', 'Fujian Jinler Pharmaceuticals, Jiangle County, Fujian 353300, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Fujian Jinler Pharmaceuticals, Jiangle County, Fujian 353300, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5458257,['NOTNLM'],"['LSD1 inhibitor', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'leukemia', 'proliferation inhibition']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['16650 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16650 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 9;8(19):31901-31914. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16650.,,20180305,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histone Demethylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppresses plasma viremia to undetectable levels that rebound upon cART treatment interruption. Following cART withdrawal, the memory component of the virus-specific adaptive immune response may improve viral control compared to primary infection. Here, using primary infection and treatment interruption data from macaques infected with simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), we observe a lower peak viral load but an unchanged viral set point during viral rebound. The addition of an autologous stem cell transplant before cART withdrawal alters viral dynamics: we found a higher rebound set point but similar peak viral loads compared to the primary infection. Mathematical modeling of the data that accounts for fundamental immune parameters achieves excellent fit to heterogeneous viral loads. Analysis of model output suggests that the rapid memory immune response following treatment interruption does not ultimately lead to better viral containment. Transplantation decreases the durability of the adaptive immune response following cART withdrawal and viral rebound. Our model's results highlight the impact of the endogenous adaptive immune response during primary SHIV infection. Moreover, because we capture adaptive immune memory and the impact of transplantation, this model will provide insight into further studies of cure strategies inspired by the Berlin patient.IMPORTANCE HIV patients who interrupt combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) eventually experience viral rebound, the return of viral loads to pretreatment levels. However, the ""Berlin patient"" remained free of HIV rebound over a decade after stopping cART. His cure is attributed to leukemia treatment that included an HIV-resistant stem cell transplant. Inspired by this case, we studied the impact of stem cell transplantation in a macaque simian/HIV (SHIV) system. Using a mechanistic mathematical model, we found that while primary infection generates an adaptive immune memory response, stem cell transplantation disrupts this learned immunity. The results have implications for HIV cure regimens based on stem cell transplantation.","['Reeves, Daniel B', 'Peterson, Christopher W', 'Kiem, Hans-Peter', 'Schiffer, Joshua T']","['Reeves DB', 'Peterson CW', 'Kiem HP', 'Schiffer JT']","['Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA jschiffe@fredhutch.org.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170609,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC5469274,['NOTNLM'],"['*Berlin patient', '*SHIV', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplant', '*human immunodeficiency virus', '*macaque model', '*mathematical modeling']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00095-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00095-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Jun 9;91(13). pii: JVI.00095-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00095-17.

METHODS: Human cartilage cells (C28/I2) were transfected with miR-320a or antisense oligonucleotides (ASO)-miR-320a, and treated with IL-1beta. Subsequently the expression of collagen type II alpha 1 (Col2alpha1) and aggrecan (ACAN), and the concentrations of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) and matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP-13), were assessed. Luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot were performed to explore whether pre-B-cell leukemia Homeobox 3 (PBX3) was a target of miR-320a. Furthermore, cells were co-transfected with miR-320a and PBX3 expressing vector, or cells were transfected with miR-320a and treated with a nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) antagonist MG132. The changes in Col2alpha1 and ACAN expression, and in sGAG and MMP-13 concentrations, were measured again. Statistical comparisons were made between two groups by using the two-tailed paired t-test. RESULTS: Expression of miR-320a was elevated in OA cartilage tissues and chondrocytes, and in IL-1beta-stimulated C28/I2 cells (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). MiR-320a overexpression enhanced IL-1beta-induced down-regulation of Col2alpha1 and ACAN and sGAG, and increased the IL-1beta-induced overexpression of MMP-13 (p < 0.01). PBX3 was a direct target of miR-320a. PBX3 and MG132 co-transfection attenuated the effects of miR-320a on the expression of Col2alpha1, ACAN, sGAG and MMP-13(p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Overexpression of miR-320a might enhance IL-1beta-induced cartilage degradation factors. These effects might be via targeting PBX3 and regulating NF-kappaB.Cite this article: Y. Jin, X.

Other than brain tumor or hematologic malignancies, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCC) is a well-known solid tumor with IDH1 mutation (6.8-20%). Histologically, poor differentiation and clear cell change are associated with IDH1 mutation in iCC. Since hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shares histologic features with iCC, some specific subtypes of HCC might show a higher IDH1 mutation rate than reported before (0.5-1.5%). METHODS: Forty-six cases of iCC and 48 cases of HCC (including 20 cases of clear cell type and 13 cases of pseudoglandular pattern) were tested for IDH1 mutation by pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Three cases in iCC (6.5%) and five cases in HCC (10.4%) had IDH1 mutation, all of which were Arg132Cys. IDH1 mutant HCCs were all clear cell type. Although the IDH1 mutation rate between iCC and HCC demonstrated no significant difference, clear cell HCC revealed statistically increased mutation rate compared to that of HCC without clear cell change (P = 0.009). Presence of IDH1 mutation was related with poor survival in clear cell HCC patients (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Clear cell HCC showed higher frequency of IDH1 mutation rate than other variants of HCC. This result consolidates the assumption that morphological features of tumors reflect molecular alterations.","['Lee, Jung Hee', 'Shin, Dong Hoon', 'Park, Won Young', 'Shin, Nari', 'Kim, Ahrong', 'Lee, Hyun Jung', 'Kim, Young Keum', 'Choi, Kyung Un', 'Kim, Jee Yeon', 'Yang, Young Il', 'Lee, Chang Hun', 'Sol, Mee Young']","['Lee JH', 'Shin DH', 'Park WY', 'Shin N', 'Kim A', 'Lee HJ', 'Kim YK', 'Choi KU', 'Kim JY', 'Yang YI', 'Lee CH', 'Sol MY']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Research Institute for Convergence of Biomedical Science and Technology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Research Institute for Convergence of Biomedical Science and Technology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Paik Institute for Clinical Research, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, 47392, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, 50612, South Korea. mysol@pusan.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170412,England,World J Surg Oncol,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,PMC5389153,['NOTNLM'],"['Clear cell carcinoma', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'IDH', 'Pyrosequencing']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12957-017-1144-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12957-017-1144-1 [pii]']",epublish,World J Surg Oncol. 2017 Apr 12;15(1):82. doi: 10.1186/s12957-017-1144-1.,,20170926,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

OBJECTIVE: The latest investigation was on synthesis, characterization of novel 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives for their anti-angiogenic effect. METHOD: A series of novel 4-anilino-6,7-dimethoxy quinazoline derivatives were synthesized and characterized using 1H, 13C NMR, FT-IR and LC-MS techniques. Cytotoxicity assays were performed for all compounds against different cell lines such as Human colon carcinoma (HCT116), Human chronic myeloid leukemia (K562) and Human breast cancer (SKBR3) cell lines using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyl tetrazolium Bromide (MTT), Trypan blue and Lactose dehydrogenase release assay. The selected compounds were evaluated for their anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effect on EAC tumor model. The molecular docking studies were drawn using maestro 2D sketcher and energy minimize was compounded by OPLS 2005. RESULTS: Among all compounds, RB4 and RB7 showed moderate activity whereas RB1 showed most potent activity comparable with that of the standard drug cisplatin against all three cell lines. RB1 also inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells in three different cell lines. Further, in-vivo studies revealed that RB1 significantly reduced secretion of ascites, tumor cell proliferation and increased the life span of tumor bearing mice. The antiangiogenic effect of RB1 was revealed from the reduced vessel sprouting in the peritoneum region of treated mice and induced avascular zone in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. The insilco molecular docking studies clearly demonstrate the dual inhibitory potential of RB1 against VEGFR-2 and EGFR from binding to the active site of its receptors. CONCLUSION: However these studies clearly show that RB1 might be a potent antitumor and anti-angiogenic agent representing a promising lead for further optimization and elucidation of the mechanism of action.","['Devegowda, Preethi Saligrama', 'Balaji, Kyathegowdanadoddi Srinivasa', 'Prasanna, Doddakunche Shivaramu', 'Swaroop, Toreshettahally Ramesh', 'Kameshwar, Vivek Hamse', 'Jayarama, Shankar', 'Siddalingaiah, Lokesh', 'Rangappa, Kanchugarakoppal Subbegowda']","['Devegowda PS', 'Balaji KS', 'Prasanna DS', 'Swaroop TR', 'Kameshwar VH', 'Jayarama S', 'Siddalingaiah L', 'Rangappa KS']","['Department of Studies in Biotechnology, University of Mysore, Manasagangotri, Mysore-570 006, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Teresian College, Siddarthanagar, Mysore-570011, India.', 'Department of Nanotechnology, Visvesvaraya Technological University, Center for Postgraduate Studies, Bengaluru Region, Muddenahalli, Chikkaballapur District -562 101, India.', 'Department of Studies in Organic Chemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangotri, Mysore-570 006, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Sri Jayachamarajendra college of engineering, Manasagangotri, Mysore-570 006, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Teresian College, Siddarthanagar, Mysore-570011, India.', 'Department of Studies in Biotechnology, University of Mysore, Manasagangotri, Mysore-570 006, India.', 'Department of Studies in Chemistry, University of Mysore, Manasagangotri, Mysore-570 006, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAM', '*Quinazolines', '*angiogenesis', '*anti-angiogenic', '*antitumor', '*derivatives.']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-82766 [pii]', '10.2174/1871521409666170412120837 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2018 Feb 7;17(14):1931-1941. doi: 10.2174/1871521409666170412120837.,,20190627,,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KDR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Quinazolines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, the naphthalene ring system is present in many current drug molecules that are utilized for anti-tumor, anti-arrhythmia and antioxidant therapy. OBJECTIVE: In our continuing quest to improve the potencies of naturally occurring anti-cancer molecules through chemical modification, we have now synthesized a small library of 2-naphthaleno trans- stilbenes and cyanostilbenes that are structurally related to both resveratrol and DMU-212, and have evaluated these novel analogs against a panel of 54 human tumor cell lines. METHOD: A series of 2-naphthaleno-containing trans-stilbenes 3a-3h (Scheme 1) were synthesized by Wittig reaction of a variety of aromatic substituted benzyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide reactants with 2- naphthaldehyde using n-BuLi as a base in THF. A second series of 2-naphthaleno trans-cyanostilbenes analogs 5a-5h was synthesized by reaction of 2-naphthaldehyde (2; 1 mmol) with an appropriately substituted 2- phenylacrylonitrile 4a-4h; 1 mmol) in 5% sodium methoxide/methanol. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2-3 hours and the reaction allowed to go to completion (TLC monitoring), during which time the desired product precipitated out of the solution as a solid. The resulting precipitate was filtered off, washed with water and dried to yield the desired compound in yields ranging from 70-95% (Scheme 2). RESULTS: The percentage growth inhibition of 54 human cancer cell lines in a primary NCI screen after exposure to compounds 3a, 3d, 5b and 5c was carried out. The results showed that only compounds 5b and 5c met the criteria for subsequent testing to determine growth inhibition values (GI50) in dose-response studies. At 10-5 M concentration, compounds 5b and 5c exhibited cytotoxic activity against leukemia cell lines HL-60(TB) and SR, lung cancer cell line NCI-H522, colon cancer cell lines COLO 205 and HCT-116, CNS-cancer cell line SF-539, melanoma cell line MDA-MB-435, and breast cancer cell line BT-549. The naphthalene trans-stilbene analogue 3a, exhibited significant growth inhibition against only one cell line, melanoma cell line MDA-MB-435 (96 % growth inhibition). Compound 3d was inactive in the 10-5 M single dose screen. CONCLUSION: We have synthesized a small set of novel 2-naphthaleno stilbenes and cyanostilbenes and evaluated several of these compounds for their anticancer properties against a panel of 54 human tumor cell lines. The most active analogs, 5b and 5c, showed significantly improved growth inhibition against the human cancer cells in the NCI panel when compared to DMU-212. Of these compounds, analog 5c was found to be the most potent anticancer agent and exhibited significant growth inhibitory effects against COLO 205, CNS SF 539 and melanoma SK-MEL 5 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines with GI50 values </= 25 nM. Analog 5b also exhibited GI50 values in the range 25-41 nM against CNS SF 295 and melanoma MDA-MB-435 and UACC-62 cell lines. Compounds 5b and 5c were also cytotoxic towards the MV4-11 leukemia cell line with LD50 value of 450 nM and 200 nM, respectively, and demonstrated >50% inhibition of tubulin polymerization at concentrations below their LD50 values in these cells. In silico docking studies suggest that compounds 5b and 5c bind favorably at the colchicine- binding pocket of the tubulin dimer, indicating that both 5b and 5c may inhibit tubulin polymerization through a mechanism similar to that exhibited by colchicine. Derivative 5c demonstrated more favorable binding based on the docking score and buried surface area, as compared to compound 5b, in agreement with the higher observed potency of 5c against a broader range of tumor cell lines. Based on these results, analog 5c is considered to be a lead compound for further optimization as a clinical candidate for treating a variety of cancers.","['Madadi, Nikhil R', 'Penthala, Narsimha R', 'Ketkar, Amit', 'Eoff, Robert L', 'Trujullo-Alonso, Vicenta', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Crooks, Peter A']","['Madadi NR', 'Penthala NR', 'Ketkar A', 'Eoff RL', 'Trujullo-Alonso V', 'Guzman ML', 'Crooks PA']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, United States.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10021, United States.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10021, United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,PMC7584397,['NOTNLM'],"['*DMU-212', '*Resveratrol', '*cytotoxicity', '*growth inhibition', '*naphthalene', '*tubulin inhibition.']",,2017/04/14 06:00,2019/07/16 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-82764 [pii]', '10.2174/1871521409666170412115703 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2018;18(4):556-564. doi: 10.2174/1871521409666170412115703.,,20190715,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '2166IN72UN (naphthalene)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Naphthalenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Stilbenes/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",['R01 CA140409/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS1636559'],"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, resistance to this drug usually develops over time. Triptolide, a diterpenoid triepoxide, has been shown active against CML cells resistant to imatinib, acting mainly on the level of Bcr-Abl transcription inhibition. OBJECTIVE: Here, we used the triterpene betulinic acid, a known proteasome inhibitor with potential antileukemic activity, as a scaffold for the generation of analogues with predicted triptolide biological activity. METHOD: Betulinic acid derivatives were designed based on the structure-activity relationship of triptolide and evaluated for their cytotoxic effects in CML cells, lymphocytes and human keratinocytes (HaCaT), as well as against the proteasome complex. The main modification performed on betulinic acid was fluorination at C-28 and epoxidation, both of which are responsible for enhancing activity of triptolide. A total of 10 compounds were obtained: 6 previously described and 4 novel compounds. The cytotoxic activity over a CML cell line (K562) was assessed using flow cytometry and compared to lymphocytes and HaCaT. RESULT: The results show that betulinic acid was the most cytotoxic compound against CML cells, showing a good selectivity index for cancer over normal cells. The most important trend for the activity in betulinic acid derivatives is the presence of a free hydroxyl group at C-3 and a carboxyl group at C-28. Results also indicated that the epoxide is important for enhancing the activity, while modification at C-28 worsens the activity. CONCLUSION: Proteasome inhibition assays suggest that proteasome is the main target for betulinic acid and its derivatives.","['Waechter, Fernanda', 'da Silva, Gloria N S', 'Willig, Julia B', 'de Oliveira, Cristiane B', 'Vieira, Bruna D', 'Trivella, Daniela B B', 'Zimmer, Aline R', 'Buffon, Andreia', 'Pilger, Diogo A', 'Gnoatto, Simone C B']","['Waechter F', 'da Silva GNS', 'Willig JB', 'de Oliveira CB', 'Vieira BD', 'Trivella DBB', 'Zimmer AR', 'Buffon A', 'Pilger DA', 'Gnoatto SCB']","['Laboratorio de Fitoquimica e Sintese Organica, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Avenida Ipiranga, 2752, Porto Alegre, 90610-000.

After an acute urinary retention episode which was managed with a suprapubic catheter due to urethral catheter insertion failure, the patient was submitted to a transurethral prostatectomy. Histological examination revealed lymphocytic infiltration of the prostatic parenchyma by mostly small B cells. B-lymphocytic infiltration of the prostate gland, causes symptoms similar to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Acute urinary retention due to B-lymphocytic infiltration of the prostate is rare and the diagnosis is always histological and an oncological re-evaluation is necessary.

METHODS: Cohort study in AL patients >15 years starting induction chemotherapy at a Mexican oncological center (2013-2014). Onset of oral lesions (OLs) was assessed during follow-up, and saliva was obtained at baseline, at visit 2 (days 4-12), and at visit 3 (days 13-21) after chemotherapy, treated with a protease inhibitor and stored at -70 degrees C. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed. Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed to estimate hazard ratios and its 95% CI (HR, 95% CI) for OL development. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were followed up, and 17 (41.5%) developed OLs. OL patients had higher baseline salivary IL-1alpha than those without lesions (p = 0.040).

The drug imatinib, a selective inhibitor of Kit, is used for treatment of mutant Kit-positive cancers. However, mutations in the Kit kinase domain, which are frequently found in neoplastic mast cells, confer an imatinib resistance, and cancers expressing the mutants can proliferate in the presence of imatinib. Recently, we showed that in neoplastic mast cells that endogenously express an imatinib-resistant Kit mutant, Kit causes oncogenic activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt) pathway and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) but only on endolysosomes and on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), respectively. Here, we show a strategy for inhibition of the Kit-PI3K-Akt pathway in neoplastic mast cells by M-COPA (2-methylcoprophilinamide), an inhibitor of this secretory pathway. In M-COPA-treated cells, Kit localization in the ER is significantly increased, whereas endolysosomal Kit disappears, indicating that M-COPA blocks the biosynthetic transport of Kit from the ER. The drug greatly inhibits oncogenic Akt activation without affecting the association of Kit with PI3K, indicating that ER-localized Kit-PI3K complex is unable to activate Akt. Importantly, M-COPA but not imatinib suppresses neoplastic mast cell proliferation through inhibiting anti-apoptotic Akt activation. Results of our M-COPA treatment assay show that Kit can activate Erk not only on the ER but also on other compartments. Furthermore, Tyr568/570, Tyr703, Tyr721, and Tyr936 in Kit are phosphorylated on the ER, indicating that these five tyrosine residues are all phosphorylated before mutant Kit reaches the plasma membrane (PM). Our study provides evidence that Kit is tyrosine-phosphorylated soon after synthesis on the ER but is unable to activate Akt and also demonstrates that M-COPA is efficacious for growth suppression of neoplastic mast cells.","['Hara, Yasushi', 'Obata, Yuuki', 'Horikawa, Keita', 'Tasaki, Yasutaka', 'Suzuki, Kyohei', 'Murata, Takatsugu', 'Shiina, Isamu', 'Abe, Ryo']","['Hara Y', 'Obata Y', 'Horikawa K', 'Tasaki Y', 'Suzuki K', 'Murata T', 'Shiina I', 'Abe R']","['Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Immunobiology, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170412,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5389679,,,,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/04/22 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2016/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0175514 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-49303 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Apr 12;12(4):e0175514. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0175514. eCollection 2017.,,20170421,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0', '(N-(pyridine-3-ylmethyl)-5-(7-hydroxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro', 'naphthalene-1-yl)-2-methylpenta-2,4-dienamide)', '0 (Naphthols)', '0 (Pyridines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Endosomes/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Naphthols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Secretory Pathway/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, it presents selected prooxidative therapeutic strategies against B-cell neoplasms. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent reports have shown that the disturbed redox homeostasis in B-cell malignancies is regulated by cancer-specific signaling pathways and therefore varies between the individual subtypes. For instance, in a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with increased oxidative phosphorylation, elevated reactive oxygen species are accompanied by higher levels of thioredoxin and glutathione and inhibition of either of these systems is selectively toxic to this subtype. In addition, growing number of small molecule inhibitors targeting antioxidant enzymes, such as auranofin, SK053, adenanthin, or decreasing glutathione level, such as imexon, buthionine sulfoximine, and L-cysteinase, trigger specific cytotoxic effects against B-cell malignancies. Lastly, attention is drawn to recent reports of effective treatment modalities involving prooxidative agents and interfering with redox homeostasis provided by stromal cells. SUMMARY: Recent findings reveal important differences in redox homeostasis within the distinct subsets of B-cell-derived malignancies that can be therapeutically exploited to improve existing treatment and to overcome drug resistance.","['Graczyk-Jarzynka, Agnieszka', 'Zagozdzon, Radoslaw', 'Muchowicz, Angelika', 'Siernicka, Marta', 'Juszczynski, Przemyslaw', 'Firczuk, Malgorzata']","['Graczyk-Jarzynka A', 'Zagozdzon R', 'Muchowicz A', 'Siernicka M', 'Juszczynski P', 'Firczuk M']","['aDepartment of Immunology, Center for Biostructure Research, Medical University of Warsaw bDepartment of Clinical Immunology, Transplantation Institute, Medical University of Warsaw cDepartment of Bioinformatics, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences dPostgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw eInstitute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,PMC5470855,,,,2017/04/14 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/04/14 06:00'],"['2017/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000351 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Jul;24(4):393-401. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000351.,,20171024,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Clinical Studies as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', '*Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) in relapsed and/or refractory CLL in a phase I/II study. A standard phase I design was used with cohorts of three plus three patients to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-2206 in combination with BR in relapsed CLL. Single-agent MK-2206 (weekly dosed) was administered one-week in advance before BR on cycle 1 and subsequently was given with BR at the same time for cycle 2-6. Phase II employed the MTD of MK-2206 with BR to evaluate safety and efficacy of this study combination. Thirteen relapsed/refractory CLL were treated for maximal 6-cycle of therapy. The maximum tolerated dose of MK-2206 was 90 mg by mouth once weekly. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (46%), febrile neutropenia (23%), rash (15%), diarrhea (15%), and thrombocytopenia (15%). Overall response rate was 92% with a median progression free survival and treatment free survival of 16 and 24 months, respectively. Five patients (38%) achieved complete remission or complete remission with incomplete count recovery, two of whom were MRD negative. The efficacy and tolerability of this combination indicates that Akt inhibition combined with chemoimmunotherapy is a promising novel treatment combination in CLL and deserves further prospective clinical trial.","['Larsen, Jeremy T', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Leis, Jose F', 'LaPlant, Betsy', 'Call, Tim', 'Pettinger, Adam', 'Hanson, Curtis', 'Erlichman, Charles', 'Habermann, Thomas Matthew', 'Reeder, Craig', 'Nikcevich, Daniel', 'Bowen, Deborah', 'Conte, Michael', 'Boysen, Justin', 'Secreto, Charla', 'Lesnick, Connie', 'Tschumper, Renee', 'Jelinek, Diane', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Ding, Wei']","['Larsen JT', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Leis JF', 'LaPlant B', 'Call T', 'Pettinger A', 'Hanson C', 'Erlichman C', 'Habermann TM', 'Reeder C', 'Nikcevich D', 'Bowen D', 'Conte M', 'Boysen J', 'Secreto C', 'Lesnick C', 'Tschumper R', 'Jelinek D', 'Kay NE', 'Ding W']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Alliance Statistics, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Alliance Statistics, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Essentia Health-Duluth, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20170601,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,PMC5507724,,,,2017/04/13 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2017/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24762 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Aug;92(8):759-763. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24762.

In order to clarify its mechanism, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed and FHL2 was identified for the first time as one of the binding proteins of iASPP. FHL2 was highly expressed in K562 and Kasumi-1 cells. FHL2 and iASPP interacted with each other and co-localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Either FHL2 or iASPP silenced could reduce cell proliferation, induce cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and increase cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that the level of p21 and p27 increased, CDK4, E2F1, Cyclin E and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL reduced. Interestingly, when FHL2 was knocked down, the protein expression level of iASPP also decreased. Similarly, the expression of FHL2 would reduce when iASPP was silenced.

However, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is deregulated in many hematologic malignancies, and as such is co-opted by malignant cells to promote their survival and proliferation. It has recently come to light that an alternative mechanism, wherein nuclear JAKs epigenetically modify the chromatin to increase gene expression independent of STATs, also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many hematologic malignancies.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that leads to the production of NADPH, required to destroy microorganisms in the respiratory burst reaction of white blood cells. We evaluated the role of G6PD deficiency in susceptibility of IFD in 108 AML patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. In all, 28 patients harbored G6PD deficiency (G6PD-), whereas 80 were normal (G6PD +). Incidence of IFD was significantly higher in G6PD- patients compared to G6PD + patients (35.7% vs. 5%, p = .0002, OR = 10, 95% CI = 2.96-37.5). Higher risk of mold infections (17.9% vs. 5%, p = .048, OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.0-16.6) and Candida sepsis (17.9% vs. 0%, p = .0009, OR = 37.68, 95% CI =2.0-707.1) was observed in G6PD - patients. The evaluation of G6PD activity may help to identify AML patients at higher risk of IFD, allowing to design more intensive surveillance and therapeutic strategies.","['Sanna, Marco', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'Ledda, Antonio', 'Orru, Federica', 'Fozza, Claudio', 'Deias, Paola', 'Tidore, Gianni', 'Dore, Fausto', 'La Nasa, Giorgio']","['Sanna M', 'Caocci G', 'Ledda A', 'Orru F', 'Fozza C', 'Deias P', 'Tidore G', 'Dore F', 'La Nasa G']","['a Hematology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health , Bone Marrow Transplant Center, R.

The ability to expand SSCs by in vitro culture is a crucial premise for their use in assisted reproduction. Because SSCs represent a small proportion of the germ cells in the adult testis, culture success is aided by pre-enrichment through sorting techniques based on cell surface-specific markers. Given the importance of the domestic cat as a model for conservation of endangered wild felids, herein we sought to examine culture conditions as well as molecular markers for cat SSCs. Using a cell culture medium for mouse SSCs supplemented with glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), germ cells from prepuberal cat testes remained viable in culture for up to 43 days. Immunohistochemistry for promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein on foetal, prepuberal and adult testis sections revealed a pattern of expression consistent with the labelling of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with an antibody against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) was used to sort live cells. Then, the gene expression profile of EPCAM-sorted cells was investigated through RT-qPCR. Notably, EPCAM (+) cells expressed relatively high levels of CKIT (CD117), a surface protein typically expressed in differentiating germ cells but not SSCs. Conversely, EPCAM (-) cells expressed relatively high levels of POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1 (POU1F5 or OCT4), clearly a germ line stem cell marker. These results suggest that cat SSCs would probably be found within the population of EPCAM (-) cells. Future studies should identify additional surface markers that alone or in combination can be used to further enrich SSCs from cat germ cells.","['Bedford-Guaus, S J', 'Kim, S', 'Mulero, L', 'Vaquero, J M', 'Morera, C', 'Adan-Milanes, R', 'Veiga, A', 'Raya, A']","['Bedford-Guaus SJ', 'Kim S', 'Mulero L', 'Vaquero JM', 'Morera C', 'Adan-Milanes R', 'Veiga A', 'Raya A']","['Center for Regenerative Medicine (CMRB), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for Networked Biomedical Research on Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Chemistry, Korea University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine (CMRB), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine (CMRB), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine (CMRB), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centre Veterinari La Sagrera, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine (CMRB), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Reproductive Medicine Service, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Hospital Universitari Quiron-Dexeus, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine (CMRB), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for Networked Biomedical Research on Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN), Madrid, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20161106,Germany,Reprod Domest Anim,Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene,9015668,,['NOTNLM'],"['Felis catus', 'epithelial cell adhesion molecule', 'promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger protein', 'spermatogonial stem cells']",,2017/04/13 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/rda.12819 [doi]'],ppublish,Reprod Domest Anim. 2017 Apr;52 Suppl 2:177-186. doi: 10.1111/rda.12819.

When the system is linear or can be approximated sufficiently well by a linear model, methods exist to identify the number and connectivity of a minimum set of external inputs (constituting a so-called minimal control topology, or MCT). In general, many MCTs exist for a given network; here we characterize a broad ensemble of empirical networks in terms of the fraction of nodes and edges that are always, sometimes, or never a part of an MCT. We study the relationships between the measures, and apply the methodology to the T-LGL leukemia signaling network as a case study.

Besides the established roles in the regulation of inflammation and autoimmune disease, studies have shown that iNKT cells have important roles in tumor surveillance and the control of tumor metastasis. Here we found that the absence of iNKT cells markedly decreased the total number of intestinal polyps in APC(Min/+) mice, a model for colorectal cancer. Polyp iNKT cells were enriched for interleukin-10 (IL-10)- and IL-17-producing cells, showed a distinct phenotype being CD4(+), NK1.1(-) CD44(int), and PD-1(lo), and they were negative for the NKT cell transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger. The absence of iNKT cells was associated with a reduced frequency of regulatory T (Tregs) cells and lower expression levels of FoxP3 protein and transcript uniquely in the polyps, and a switch to an inflammatory macrophage phenotype. Moreover, in iNKT cell-deficient APC(Min/+) mice, expression of T-helper (TH) 1-associated genes, such as IFN-gamma and Nos2, was increased in polyps, concomitantly with elevated frequencies of conventional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in this tissue. The results suggest that a population of regulatory iNKT cells locally promote intestinal polyp formation by enhancing Treg cells and immunosuppression of antitumor TH1 immunity.","['Wang, Y', 'Sedimbi, S', 'Lofbom, L', 'Singh, A K', 'Porcelli, S A', 'Cardell, S L']","['Wang Y', 'Sedimbi S', 'Lofbom L', 'Singh AK', 'Porcelli SA', 'Cardell SL']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170412,United States,Mucosal Immunol,Mucosal immunology,101299742,PMC5638666,,,,2017/04/13 06:00,2018/08/14 06:00,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['mi201734 [pii]', '10.1038/mi.2017.34 [doi]']",ppublish,Mucosal Immunol. 2018 Jan;11(1):131-143. doi: 10.1038/mi.2017.34.

Because tumorigenesis is a complex mechanism, the regulatory architecture of the immune system is likely to include the added dimensions of modulation by miRNAs and long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA). To characterize the response to ALV challenge, we developed a novel methodology that combines four datasets: mRNA expression and the associated regulatory factors of miRNA and lncRNA, and ALV gene expression. Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) layer chickens were infected with ALV-J or maintained as non-injected controls. Spleen samples were collected at 40 days post injection (dpi), and sequenced. There were 864 genes, 7 miRNAs and 17 lncRNAs differentially expressed between infected and non-infected birds. The combined analysis of the 4 RNA expression datasets revealed that ALV infection is detected by pattern-recognition receptors (TLR9 and TLR3) leading to a type-I IFN mediated innate immune response that is modulated by IRF7 and IRF1. Co-expression network analysis of mRNA with miRNA, lncRNA and virus genes identified key elements within the complex networks utilized during ALV response. The integration of information from the host transcriptomic, epigenetic and virus response also has the potential to provide deeper insights into other host-pathogen interactions.","['Lan, Xi', 'Wang, Yan', 'Tian, Kai', 'Ye, Fei', 'Yin, Huadong', 'Zhao, Xiaoling', 'Xu, Hengyong', 'Huang, Yong', 'Liu, Haibo', 'Hsieh, John C F', 'Lamont, Susan J', 'Zhu, Qing']","['Lan X', 'Wang Y', 'Tian K', 'Ye F', 'Yin H', 'Zhao X', 'Xu H', 'Huang Y', 'Liu H', 'Hsieh JC', 'Lamont SJ', 'Zhu Q']","['Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Campus, 611130, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, 50010, Iowa, USA.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Campus, 611130, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Campus, 611130, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Campus, 611130, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Campus, 611130, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Campus, 611130, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Campus, 611130, Sichuan Province, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Campus, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, 50010, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, 50010, Iowa, USA.', 'Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames, 50010, Iowa, USA.', 'Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu Campus, 611130, Sichuan Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170412,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5388866,,,,2017/04/13 06:00,2018/11/18 06:00,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['srep46156 [pii]', '10.1038/srep46156 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Apr 12;7:46156. doi: 10.1038/srep46156.,,20181116,,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Chickens/*genetics/*virology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genes, Viral', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/*genetics', 'Inflammation/*genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Spleen/pathology/virology', 'Transcriptome/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, FOXM1 interacts with beta-catenin promoting its nuclear import and transcriptional activation. Here, we show that FOXM1 is involved in the advantage of chronic myeloid leukemia hematopoiesis over the normal counterpart. FOXM1 hyper-activation associated with BCR-ABL1 results from phosphorylation by the fusion protein kinase-dependent activation of Polo-like kinase 1. FOXM1 phosphorylation lets its binding with beta-catenin and beta-catenin transcriptional activation, a key event for persistence of the leukemic stem cell compartment under tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Polo-like kinase 1 inhibitor BI6727, already advanced for clinical use, breaks beta-catenin interaction with FOXM1, hence hampering FOXM1 phosphorylation, beta-catenin binding, nuclear import, and downstream signaling. In conclusion, our results support Polo-like kinase 1/FOXM1 axis as a complementary target to eradicate leukemic early progenitor/stem cell compartment in chronic myeloid leukemia. J. Cell.

The individual plasma bortezomib concentration-time profiles were not related to toxicity and efficacy. Five patients were evaluable for response, and four patients achieved complete response (CR) or CR without platelet recovery (80%). In conclusion, four-dose bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2)/dose) combined with standard re-induction chemotherapy was associated with a high risk of infectious complications induced by prolonged neutropenia, although high efficacy has been achieved for Japanese pediatric patients with refractory ALL.

We examined gene copy number abnormalities (CNA) in 101 Indian HR B cell ALL patients and their correlation with clinicopathological features by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Overall, CNA were detected in 59 (59%) cases, with 26, 10 and 23% of cases harboring 1, 2 or +3 CNA. CNA were more prevalent in BCR-ABL1 (60%), pediatric (64%) and high WCC (WBC count) (63%) patients. Frequent genes deletions included CDNK2A/B (26%), IKZF1 (25%), PAX5 (14%), JAK2 (7%), BTG1 (6%), RB1 (5%), EBF1 (4%), ETV6 (4%), while PAR1 region genes were predominantly duplicated (20%). EBF1 deletions selectively associated with adults, IKZF1 deletions occurred frequently in high WCC and BCR-ABL1 cases, while PAR1 region gains significantly associated with MLL-AF4 cases. IKZF1 haploinsufficiency group was predominant, especially in adults (65%), high WCC (60%) patients and BCR-ABL1-negative (78%) patients. Most cases harbored multiple concurrent CNA, with IKZF1 concomitantly occurring with CDNK2A/B, PAX5 and BTG1, while JAK2 occurred with CDNK2A/B and PAX5. Mutually exclusive CNA included ETV6 and IKZF1/RB1, and EBF1 and JAK2. Our results corroborate with global reports, aggregating molecular markers in Indian HR B-ALL cases.

A quantitative synthesis of the inconclusive literature by leukemia subtype was therefore conducted. METHODS: Eligible studies (N = 32) were identified through the screening of over 3500 publications. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted on the association of miscarriage/stillbirth history with overall (AL; 18,868 cases/35,685 controls), acute lymphoblastic (ALL; 16,150 cases/38,655 controls), and myeloid (AML; 3042 cases/32,997 controls) leukemia. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses by age and ALL subtype, as well as meta-regression were undertaken. RESULTS: Fetal loss history was associated with increased AL risk [Odds Ratio (OR) 1.10, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.04-1.18]. The positive association was seen for ALL (OR 1.12, 95%CI 1.05-1.19) and for AML (OR 1.13, 95%CI 0.91-1.41); for the latter the OR increased in sensitivity analyses. Notably, stillbirth history was significantly linked to ALL risk (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.02-1.74), but not AML. By contrast, the association of ALL and AML with previous miscarriage reached marginal significance. The association of miscarriage history was strongest in infant ALL (OR 2.34, 95%CI 1.19-4.60). CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis involving >50,000 children, we found noteworthy associations by indices of fetal loss, age at diagnosis, and leukemia type; namely, of stillbirth with ALL and miscarriage history with infant ALL. Elucidation of plausible underlying mechanisms may provide insight into leukemia pathogenesis and indicate monitoring interventions prior to and during pregnancy.","['Karalexi, M A', 'Dessypris, N', 'Skalkidou, A', 'Biniaris-Georgallis, S -I', 'Kalogirou, Epsilon Iota', 'Thomopoulos, T P', 'Herlenius, E', 'Spector, L G', 'Loutradis, D', 'Chrousos, G P', 'Petridou, E Th']","['Karalexi MA', 'Dessypris N', 'Skalkidou A', 'Biniaris-Georgallis S-', 'Kalogirou EpsilonIota', 'Thomopoulos TP', 'Herlenius E', 'Spector LG', 'Loutradis D', 'Chrousos GP', 'Petridou ET']","['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, 75 Mikras Asias Str, 11527, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, 75 Mikras Asias Str, 11527, Athens, Greece.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, 75 Mikras Asias Str, 11527, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, 75 Mikras Asias Str, 11527, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, 75 Mikras Asias Str, 11527, Athens, Greece.', ""Department of Women's and Childrens Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, 17176, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'First Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Athens, Alexandra Hospital, Athens, Greece.', ""First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens, Medical School, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece."", 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, 75 Mikras Asias Str, 11527, Athens, Greece. epetrid@med.uoa.gr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20170411,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Childhood acute myeloid leukemia', 'Meta-analysis', 'Meta-regression', 'Miscarriage', 'Stillbirth']",,2017/04/13 06:00,2017/06/09 06:00,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10552-017-0890-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-017-0890-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2017 Jun;28(6):599-624. doi: 10.1007/s10552-017-0890-2.

Previously, we have shown that polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated AgNPs have an anti-leukemia effect against human myeloid leukemia cells; however, whether AgNPs are able to trigger autophagy in normal hematopoietic cells and the role of autophagy in AgNP-induced cytotoxicity remain unclear. In the current study, we observed that AgNPs were taken up by murine pro-B cells (Ba/F3), and then promoted accumulation of autophagosomes, which resulted from the induction of autophagy rather than the blockade of autophagic flux. AgNPs induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner accompanied by apoptosis and DNA damage through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of silver ions. The ROS-mediated mTOR signaling pathway was responsible for the induction of autophagy. More importantly, the inhibition of autophagy with the addition of 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or silencing of Atg5 significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity of AgNPs in Ba/F3. These findings suggest that autophagy is involved in the cytotoxicity of PVP-coated AgNPs in normal hematopoietic cells, and the inhibition of autophagy is a novel and potent strategy to protect normal hematopoietic cells upon treatment with AgNPs.","['Zhu, Lingying', 'Guo, Dawei', 'Sun, Lili', 'Huang, Zhihai', 'Zhang, Xiuyan', 'Ma, Wenjuan', 'Wu, Jie', 'Xiao, Lun', 'Zhao, Yun', 'Gu, Ning']","['Zhu L', 'Guo D', 'Sun L', 'Huang Z', 'Zhang X', 'Ma W', 'Wu J', 'Xiao L', 'Zhao Y', 'Gu N']","['State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, PR China. guning@seu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,,,,,2017/04/13 06:00,2018/11/15 06:00,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c6nr08188f [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2017 May 4;9(17):5489-5498. doi: 10.1039/c6nr08188f.,,20181114,,"['0 (Ions)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)', 'FZ989GH94E (Povidone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagosomes', '*Autophagy', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ions', '*Metal Nanoparticles', 'Mice', 'Povidone/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver/*chemistry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: IGH rearrangements were studied in 50 precursor B-ALL cases (common ALL=37, pre-B ALL=10, pro-B ALL=3) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) heteroduplex analysis. Twenty randomly selected clonal IGH rearrangement sequences were analyzed using the IMGT/V-QUEST tool. RESULTS: Clonal IGH rearrangements were detected in 41 (82%) precursor B-ALL cases. Among the IGHV1-IGHV7 subgroups, IGHV3 was used in 25 (50%) cases. Among the IGHD1-IGHD7 genes, IGHD2 and IGHD3 were used in 8 (40%) and 5 (25%) clones, respectively. Among the IGHJ1-IGHJ6 genes, IGHJ6 and IGHJ4 were used in 9 (45%) and 6 (30%) clones, respectively. In 6 out of 20 (30%) IGH rearranged sequences, CDR3 was in frame whereas 14 (70%) had rearranged sequences and CDR3 was out of frame. A somatic mutation in Vmut/Dmut/Jmut was detected in 14 of 20 IGH sequences. On average, Vmut/Dmut/Jmut were detected in 0.1 nt, 1.1 nt, and 0.2 nt, respectively. CONCLUSION: The IGHV3 gene was frequently used whereas lower frequencies of IGHV5 and IGHV6 and a higher frequency of IGHV4 were detected in children compared with young adults. The IGHD2 and IGHD3 genes were over-represented, and the IGHJ6 gene was predominantly used in precursor-B-ALL. However, the IGH gene rearrangements in precursor-B-ALL did not show any significant age-associated genotype pattern attributed to our population.","['Sudhakar, Natarajan', 'Rajkumar, Thangarajan', 'Rajalekshmy, Kamalalayam Raghavan', 'Nancy, Nirmala Karunakaran']","['Sudhakar N', 'Rajkumar T', 'Rajalekshmy KR', 'Nancy NK']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, India.; Department of Biotechnology, Dr. M.G.R.

We assessed physicians' perspectives on allo-HSCT donor selection when a matched domestic donor is not available. METHODS: We administered a questionnaire survey to 55 hematologists (response rate: 28%) who attended the annual spring conference of the Korean Society of Haematology in 2015. The questionnaire contained four clinical allo-HSCT scenarios and the respondents were asked to choose the most preferred donor among the given options. RESULTS: In all four scenarios, the hematologists preferred a matched international donor over partially mismatched unrelated domestic or haplo-matched family donors. The numbers of hematologists who chose a matched international donor (HLA 8/8) in cases of acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and aplastic anemia were 37 (67.3%), 41 (74.6%), 33 (60.0%), and 36 (65.5%), respectively. The important factors that affected donor selection included ""expecting better clinical outcomes (40.5%)"" and ""lower risk of side effects (23.4%)."" The majority of participants (80%) responded that allo-HSCT guidelines for donor selection customized for the Korean setting are necessary. CONCLUSION: Although hematologists still prefer perfectly matched foreign donors when a fully matched domestic allo-HSCT donor is not available, we confirmed that there was variation in their responses. For evidence-based clinical practice, it is necessary to provide further comparative clinical evidence on allo-HSCT from haplo-matched family donors and fully matched unrelated international donors.","['Shin, Min Kyung', 'Shin, Sangjin', 'Lee, Ja Youn', 'Koh, Youngil']","['Shin MK', 'Shin S', 'Lee JY', 'Koh Y']","['National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, Seoul, Korea.', 'National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, Seoul, Korea.', 'National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, Seoul, Korea.', 'National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170327,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,PMC5383585,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Surveys and questionnaires', 'Unrelated donor']","[""Authors' Disclosures of Potential Conflicts of Interest: No potential conflicts"", 'of interest relevant to this article were reported.']",2017/04/13 06:00,2017/04/13 06:01,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2017.52.1.31 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2017 Mar;52(1):31-36. doi: 10.5045/br.2017.52.1.31.

However, MSCs that are expanded in traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture systems eventually lose their differentiation abilities. Therefore, we investigated whether azacitidine (AZA) supplementation and three-dimensional culture (3D) could improve the differentiation properties of MSCs. METHODS: 2D- or 3D-cultured MSCs which were prepared according to the conventional or hanging-drop culture method respectively, were treated with or without AZA (1 microM for 72 h), and their osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential were determined and compared. RESULTS: AZA treatment did not affect the cell apoptosis or viability in both 2D- and 3D-cultured MSCs. However, compared to conventionally cultured 2D-MSCs, AZA-treated 2D-MSCs showed marginally increased differentiation abilities. In contrast, 3D-MSCs showed significantly increased osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation ability. When 3D culture was performed in the presence of AZA, the osteogenic differentiation ability was further increased, whereas adipogenic differentiation was not affected. CONCLUSION: 3D culture efficiently promoted the multilineage differentiation of MSCs, and in combination with AZA, it could help MSCs to acquire greater osteogenic differentiation ability. This optimized culture method can enhance the therapeutic potential of MSCs.","['Bae, Yoo-Jin', 'Kwon, Yong-Rim', 'Kim, Hye Joung', 'Lee, Seok', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin']","['Bae YJ', 'Kwon YR', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee S', 'Kim YJ']","[""Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Hematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.; Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.; Department of Hematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170327,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,PMC5383582,['NOTNLM'],"['5-azacytidine', 'Adipogenesis', 'Mesenchymal stromal cells', 'Osteogenesis', 'Three-dimensional culture']","[""Authors' Disclosures of Potential Conflicts of Interest: No potential conflicts"", 'of interest relevant to this article were reported.']",2017/04/13 06:00,2017/04/13 06:01,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2017.52.1.18 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2017 Mar;52(1):18-24. doi: 10.5045/br.2017.52.1.18.

Transcription factors (TFs) are major cell fate regulators frequently involved in cancer, particularly in leukemia. The GFI1B gene, coding a TF, was identified by sequence homology with the oncogene growth factor independence 1 (GFI1). Both GFI1 and GFI1B have six C-terminal C2H2 zinc fingers and an N-terminal SNAG (SNAIL/GFI1) transcriptional repression domain. Gfi1 is essential for neutrophil differentiation in mice. In humans, GFI1 mutations are associated with severe congenital neutropenia. Gfi1 is also required for B and T lymphopoiesis. However, knockout mice have demonstrated that Gfi1b is required for development of both erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. Consistent with this, human mutations of GFI1B produce bleeding disorders with low platelet count and abnormal function. Loss of Gfi1b in adult mice increases the absolute numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are less quiescent than wild-type HSCs. In keeping with this key role in cell fate, GFI1B is emerging as a gene involved in cancer, which also includes solid tumors. In fact, abnormal activation of GFI1B and GFI1 has been related to human medulloblastoma and is also likely to be relevant in blood malignancies. Several pieces of evidence supporting this statement will be detailed in this mini review.","['Anguita, Eduardo', 'Candel, Francisco J', 'Chaparro, Alberto', 'Roldan-Etcheverry, Juan J']","['Anguita E', 'Candel FJ', 'Chaparro A', 'Roldan-Etcheverry JJ']","['Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria San Carlos (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain; Department of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria San Carlos (IdISSC) , Madrid , Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria San Carlos (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain; Department of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria San Carlos (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain; Department of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170328,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,PMC5368270,['NOTNLM'],"['GFI1B', 'cancer', 'hematopoiesis', 'leukemia', 'platelets disease']",,2017/04/13 06:00,2017/04/13 06:01,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2017.00054 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2017 Mar 28;7:54. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2017.00054. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 34-year old man presenting with hypercalcemia and symptomatic osteolytic bone lesions of vertebrae and ribs who was initially suspected as having a solid malignancy. Diagnostic work-up including peripheral blood examination, radiographic and nuclear studies could, however, not detect a primary tumor. Because of a mild thrombocytopenia and the lack of a primary focus, a bone marrow biopsy was performed leading to the diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome positive precursor B-ALL. After correction of the hypercalcemia with intravenous fluid administration, corticoids and bisphosphonates, the patient was treated according to the HOVON 100 protocol achieving complete molecular remission after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Hypercalcemia and osteolytic bone lesions are rare complications of adult B-ALL and can occur in the absence of peripheral blastosis. With this case report we would like to emphasize the importance of clinical awareness. Immediate treatment of hypercalcemia and initiation of antileukemic treatment is mandatory as a delay of diagnosis might pose a real and possible life-threatening risk in these patients.","['Granacher, Nikki Charlotta Paul', 'Berneman, Zwi N', 'Schroyens, Wilfried', 'Van de Velde, Ann L R', 'Verlinden, Anke', 'Gadisseur, Alain P A']","['Granacher NCP', 'Berneman ZN', 'Schroyens W', 'Van de Velde ALR', 'Verlinden A', 'Gadisseur APA']","['Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.grid.411414.5', 'Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.grid.411414.5', 'Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.grid.411414.5', 'Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.grid.411414.5', 'Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.grid.411414.5', 'Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, Wilrijkstraat 10, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.grid.411414.5']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20170411,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,PMC5387187,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Case report', 'Hypercalcemia', 'Osteolysis', 'Philadelphia chromosome']",,2017/04/13 06:00,2017/04/13 06:01,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2017/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-017-0071-8 [doi]', '71 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2017 Apr 11;6:9. doi: 10.1186/s40164-017-0071-8. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of monoclonal antibodies is a new hope for the treatment of these diseases. Alemtuzumab (Campath) is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody specific for CD52, an antigen expressed by most T and B lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab may frequently induce long-term remissions in patients with Sezary syndrome but high-dose treatments lead to severe cytopenia, immune depletion, and opportunistic infections. This treatment is less efficient in mycosis fungoides (MF). Brentuximab vedotin is a chimeric anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E, a cytotoxic antitubulin agent. Brentuximab vedotin is a very interesting new treatment for advanced tumor MF, Sezary syndrome, and primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders. The main limiting adverse event is neurosensitive peripheral neuropathy. Mogamulizumab is a humanized anti-C-C chemokine receptor Type 4 monoclonal antibody with a defucosylated Fc region leading to increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Mogamulizumab is very efficient on aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphomas, particularly adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and CTCLs, especially on the blood component of tumor cells. The main limiting events are related to the concomitant depletion of regulatory T-cells. IPH4102 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the immune receptor KIR3DL2/CD158k.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common malignant myeloid disorder in adults, and TP53 mutations or loss are frequently detected in patients with therapy-related AML or AML with complex karyotype. Here, we reveal that MEG3 is significantly downregulated in AML and suppresses leukemogenesis not only in a p53-dependent, but also a p53-independent manner. In addition, MEG3 is proven to be transcriptionally activated by Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1), dysregulation of which by epigenetic silencing or mutations is causally involved in AML. Therefore MEG3 is identified as a novel target of the WT1 molecule. Ten-eleven translocation-2 (TET2) mutations frequently occur in AML and significantly promote leukemogenesis of this disorder. In our study, TET2, acting as a cofactor of WT1, increases MEG3 expression. Taken together, our work demonstrates that TET2 dysregulated WT1-MEG3 axis significantly promotes AML leukemogenesis, paving a new avenue for diagnosis and treatment of AML patients.","['Lyu, Y',

We recently reported catechol bisphosphate and derivatives such as Stafib-1 as the first selective inhibitors of the STAT5b SH2 domain. Here, we demonstrate STAT5b binding of catechol bisphosphate by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and report on rational optimization of Stafib-1 (Ki = 44 nM) to Stafib-2 (Ki = 9 nM). The binding site of Stafib-2 was validated using combined isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and protein point mutant analysis, representing the first time that functional comparison of wild-type versus mutant protein by ITC has been used to characterize the binding site of a small-molecule ligand of a STAT protein with amino acid resolution. The prodrug Pomstafib-2 selectively inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5b in human leukaemia cells and induces apoptosis in a STAT5-dependent manner. We propose Pomstafib-2, which currently represents the most active, selective inhibitor of STAT5b activation available, as a chemical tool for addressing the fundamental question of which roles the different STAT5 proteins play in various cell processes.","['Elumalai, Nagarajan', 'Berg, Angela', 'Rubner, Stefan', 'Blechschmidt, Linda', 'Song, Chen', 'Natarajan, Kalaiselvi', 'Matysik, Jorg', 'Berg, Thorsten']","['Elumalai N', 'Berg A', 'Rubner S', 'Blechschmidt L', 'Song C', 'Natarajan K', 'Matysik J', 'Berg T']","['Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Analytical Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Leids Instituut voor Chemisch Onderzoek, Universiteit Leiden, 2300 RA, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Analytical Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Leipzig University, Johannisallee 29, 04103, Leipzig, Germany. tberg@uni-leipzig.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170411,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5429769,,,,2017/04/13 06:00,2018/09/19 06:00,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2017/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-00920-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-00920-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Apr 11;7(1):819. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-00920-3.,,20180918,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1034-5881'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Stafib-2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Catechols/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the outcome of 170 pediatric patients with ML-DS enrolled in the prospective, multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized ML-DS 2006 trial by Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO), Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), and Acute Myeloid Leukemia-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (AML-BFM) study group. Compared with the historical control arm (reduced-intensity protocol for ML-DS patients from the AML-BFM 98 trial), treatment intensity was reduced by lowering the cumulative dose of etoposide (950 to 450 mg/m(2)) and intrathecal central nervous system prophylaxis while omitting maintenance therapy. Still, 5-year overall survival (89% +/- 3% vs 90% +/- 4%; Plog-rank = .64), event-free survival (EFS; 87% +/- 3% vs 89% +/- 4%; Plog-rank = .71), and cumulative incidence of relapse/nonresponse (CIR/NR; 6% +/- 3% vs 6% +/- 2%; PGray = .03) did not significantly differ between the ML-DS 2006 trial and the historical control arm. Poor early treatment response (5-year EFS, 58% +/- 16% vs 88% +/- 3%; Plog rank = .0008) and gain of chromosome 8 (CIR/NR, 16% +/- 7% vs 3% +/- 2%, PGray = .02; 5-year EFS, 73% +/- 8% vs 91% +/- 4%, Plog rank = .018) were identified as independent prognostic factors predicting a worse EFS. Five of 7 relapsed patients (71%) with cytogenetic data had trisomy 8.

Most epidemiological evidence on the association between cigarette smoking and leukemia risk is from studies conducted in Western populations, however, and evidence from Asian populations is scarce. METHODS: We conducted a large-scale population-based cohort study of 96,992 Japanese subjects (46,493 men and 50,499 women; age 40-69 years at baseline) with an average 18.3 years of follow-up, during which we identified 90 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 19 of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 28 of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a Cox regression model adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: When we adjusted for age, sex, and study area, our findings showed no significant association or increasing dose-response relationship between risk of AML and cigarette smoking overall. However, after further adjustment for body mass index and occupation, current smokers with more than 30 pack-years of cigarette smoking had a significantly increased risk of AML compared to never smokers among men (HR 2.21; 95% CI, 1.01-4.83). This increased risk was not clear among women. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cigarette smoking increases the risk of AML in Japanese men. The associations of smoking with AML among women, and with CML and ALL among men and women, should be assessed in future studies.","['Ugai, Tomotaka', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Sawada, Norie', 'Iwasaki, Motoki', 'Yamaji, Taiki', 'Shimazu, Taichi', 'Sasazuki, Shizuka', 'Inoue, Manami', 'Tsugane, Shoichiro']","['Ugai T', 'Matsuo K', 'Sawada N', 'Iwasaki M', 'Yamaji T', 'Shimazu T', 'Sasazuki S', 'Inoue M', 'Tsugane S']","['Division of Molecular and Clinical Epidemiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan; Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Omiya, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular and Clinical Epidemiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Epidemiology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.

Although CLL has been traditionally considered as a mature B cell leukemia, few independent studies have shown that the genetic alterations may appear in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. However, the presence of both chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations in CD34+ cells from the same patients has not been explored. METHODS: Amplicon-based deep next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies were carried out in magnetically activated-cell-sorting separated CD19+ mature B lymphocytes and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors (n = 56) to study the mutational status of TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1, FBXW7, MYD88, and XPO1 genes. In addition, ultra-deep NGS was performed in a subset of seven patients to determine the presence of mutations in flow-sorted CD34+CD19- early hematopoietic progenitors. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies were performed in the CD34+ cells from nine patients of the cohort to examine the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities. RESULTS: NGS studies revealed a total of 28 mutations in 24 CLL patients. Interestingly, 15 of them also showed the same mutations in their corresponding whole population of CD34+ progenitors. The majority of NOTCH1 (7/9) and XPO1 (4/4) mutations presented a similar mutational burden in both cell fractions; by contrast, mutations of TP53 (2/2), FBXW7 (2/2), and SF3B1 (3/4) showed lower mutational allele frequencies, or even none, in the CD34+ cells compared with the CD19+ population. Ultra-deep NGS confirmed the presence of FBXW7, MYD88, NOTCH1, and XPO1 mutations in the subpopulation of CD34+CD19- early hematopoietic progenitors (6/7). Furthermore, FISH studies showed the presence of 11q and 13q deletions (2/2 and 3/5, respectively) in CD34+ progenitors but the absence of IGH cytogenetic alterations (0/2) in the CD34+ cells. Combining all the results from NGS and FISH, a model of the appearance and expansion of genetic alterations in CLL was derived, suggesting that most of the genetic events appear on the hematopoietic progenitors, although these mutations could induce the beginning of tumoral cell expansion at different stage of B cell differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the presence of both gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities in early hematopoietic progenitor cells from CLL patients.","['Quijada-Alamo, Miguel', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Maria', 'Robledo, Cristina', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Jesus-Maria', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Montano, Adrian', 'Rodriguez-Vicente, Ana E', 'Quwaider, Dalia', 'Martin, Ana-Africa', 'Garcia-Alvarez, Maria', 'Vidal-Mancenido, Maria Jesus', 'Ferrer-Garrido, Gonzalo', 'Delgado-Beltran, Maria-Pilar', 'Galende, Josefina', 'Rodriguez, Juan-Nicolas', 'Martin-Nunez, Guillermo', 'Alonso, Jose-Maria', 'Garcia de Coca, Alfonso', 'Queizan, Jose A', 'Sierra, Magdalena', 'Aguilar, Carlos', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Hernandez, Jose-Angel', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria']","['Quijada-Alamo M', 'Hernandez-Sanchez M', 'Robledo C', 'Hernandez-Sanchez JM', 'Benito R', 'Montano A', 'Rodriguez-Vicente AE', 'Quwaider D', 'Martin AA', 'Garcia-Alvarez M', 'Vidal-Mancenido MJ', 'Ferrer-Garrido G', 'Delgado-Beltran MP', 'Galende J', 'Rodriguez JN', 'Martin-Nunez G', 'Alonso JM', 'Garcia de Coca A', 'Queizan JA', 'Sierra M', 'Aguilar C', 'Kohlmann A', 'Hernandez JA', 'Gonzalez M', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']","['Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Virgen Blanca, Leon, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital del Bierzo, Ponferrada, Leon, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez, Huelva, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Virgen del Puerto, Plasencia, Caceres, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Rio Carrion, Palencia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico, Valladolid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Segovia, Segovia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Virgen de la Concha, Zamora, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Santa Barbara, Soria, Spain.', 'MLL Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'AstraZeneca, Personalized Healthcare and Biomarkers, Innovative Medicines, Cambridge, UK.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia & IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain. jmhr@usal.es.', 'IBMCC, CIC Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Paseo de San Vicente s/n, 37007, Salamanca, Spain. jmhr@usal.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170411,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,PMC5387353,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chromosomal abnormality', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*FISH', '*Hematopoietic progenitors', '*Mutation', '*Next-generation sequencing']",,2017/04/13 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2017/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-017-0450-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-017-0450-y [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2017 Apr 11;10(1):83. doi: 10.1186/s13045-017-0450-y.,,20171201,,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, CD34', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', '*Mutation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case study in acute myeloid leukemia.,210,10.1186/s12859-017-1619-7 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Aggregating gene expression data across experiments via meta-analysis is expected to increase the precision of the effect estimates and to increase the statistical power to detect a certain fold change. This study evaluates the potential benefit of using a meta-analysis approach as a gene selection method prior to predictive modeling in gene expression data. RESULTS: Six raw datasets from different gene expression experiments in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 11 different classification methods were used to build classification models to classify samples as either AML or healthy control. First, the classification models were trained on gene expression data from single experiments using conventional supervised variable selection and externally validated with the other five gene expression datasets (referred to as the individual-classification approach). Next, gene selection was performed through meta-analysis on four datasets, and predictive models were trained with the selected genes on the fifth dataset and validated on the sixth dataset. For some datasets, gene selection through meta-analysis helped classification models to achieve higher performance as compared to predictive modeling based on a single dataset; but for others, there was no major improvement. Synthetic datasets were generated from nine simulation scenarios. The effect of sample size, fold change and pairwise correlation between differentially expressed (DE) genes on the difference between MA- and individual-classification model was evaluated. The fold change and pairwise correlation significantly contributed to the difference in performance between the two methods. The gene selection via meta-analysis approach was more effective when it was conducted using a set of data with low fold change and high pairwise correlation on the DE genes. CONCLUSION: Gene selection through meta-analysis on previously published studies potentially improves the performance of a predictive model on a given gene expression data.","['Novianti, Putri W', 'Jong, Victor L', 'Roes, Kit C B', 'Eijkemans, Marinus J C']","['Novianti PW', 'Jong VL', 'Roes KC', 'Eijkemans MJ']","['Biostatistics & Research Support, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, 3508, GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands. p.novianti@vumc.nl.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University medical center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. p.novianti@vumc.nl.', 'Department of Pathology, VU University medical center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. p.novianti@vumc.nl.', 'Biostatistics & Research Support, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, 3508, GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Viroscience Laboratory, Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, 3015, CE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Biostatistics & Research Support, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, 3508, GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Biostatistics & Research Support, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, 3508, GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170411,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,PMC5387259,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Gene expression', 'Meta-analysis', 'Predictive modeling']",,2017/04/13 06:00,2017/08/26 06:00,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2016/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-017-1619-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-017-1619-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2017 Apr 11;18(1):210. doi: 10.1186/s12859-017-1619-7.,,20170825,,,IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Models, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated the efficacy and safety of HT in POI patients with malignant hematologic diseases who have received myeloablative chemotherapy and hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: Patients who had POI after myeloablative chemotherapy and HSCT for malignant hematologic diseases were enrolled. Questionnaires with information about characteristics, menstrual status, sex hormone levels and menopausal symptoms were used to evaluate the relief from menopausal symptoms and safety of HT. RESULTS: Among 130 cases, 103 (79.2%) patients had perimenopausal symptoms. The mean total Kupperman menopausal index score changed significantly from 13.50 +/- 7.128 to 6.13 +/- 5.97 after HT for 24 months. Among the 118 patients who received estrogen/progestin cyclic sequential therapy, 89 (75.4%) had withdrawal bleeding. CONCLUSION: Myeloablative chemotherapy against leukemia may cause POI. HT may relieve perimenopausal symptoms after myeloablative chemotherapy and HSCT. HT was safe and no excessive recurrences or mortality were seen in the hormone-treated group for patients who survived from malignant hematologic diseases and who received HSCT.","['Yang, X', 'Wang, C', 'He, X', 'Wei, J', 'Wang, Y', 'Li, X', 'Xu, L-P']","['Yang X', 'Wang C', 'He X', 'Wei J', 'Wang Y', 'Li X', 'Xu LP']","[""a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Peking University People's Hospital , Beijing , China."", ""a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Peking University People's Hospital , Beijing , China."", 'b Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University , Shijiazhuang , Hebei Province , China.', 'b Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University , Shijiazhuang , Hebei Province , China.', 'c Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Peking University Third Hospital , Beijing , China.', 'b Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University , Shijiazhuang , Hebei Province , China.', ""d Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation , Peking University Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital , Beijing , China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20170411,England,Climacteric,Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,9810959,,['NOTNLM'],"['Premature ovarian failure', 'hemopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'hormone therapy', 'leukemia', 'myeloablative chemotherapy']",,2017/04/13 06:00,2018/02/01 06:00,['2017/04/13 06:00'],"['2017/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13697137.2017.1309382 [doi]'],ppublish,Climacteric. 2017 Jun;20(3):268-273. doi: 10.1080/13697137.2017.1309382.

We therefore investigated whether myeloid progenitor cells transformed by Hoxa9 and Meis1 become addicted to targetable signaling pathways. A comprehensive (phospho)proteomic analysis revealed that Meis1 increased Syk protein expression and activity. Syk upregulation occurs through a Meis1-dependent feedback loop. By dissecting this loop, we show that Syk is a direct target of miR-146a, whose expression is indirectly regulated by Meis1 through the transcription factor PU.1. In the context of Hoxa9 overexpression, Syk signaling induces Meis1, recapitulating several leukemogenic features of Hoxa9/Meis1-driven leukemia. Finally, Syk inhibition disrupts the identified regulatory loop, prolonging survival of mice with Hoxa9/Meis1-driven leukemia.","['Mohr, Sebastian', 'Doebele, Carmen', 'Comoglio, Federico', 'Berg, Tobias', 'Beck, Julia', 'Bohnenberger, Hanibal', 'Alexe, Gabriela', 'Corso, Jasmin', 'Strobel, Philipp', 'Wachter, Astrid', 'Beissbarth, Tim', 'Schnutgen, Frank', 'Cremer, Anjali', 'Haetscher, Nadine', 'Gollner, Stefanie', 'Rouhi, Arefeh', 'Palmqvist, Lars', 'Rieger, Michael A', 'Schroeder, Timm', 'Bonig, Halvard', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Kuchenbauer, Florian', 'Schutz, Ekkehard', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Urlaub, Henning', 'Stegmaier, Kimberly', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Oellerich, Thomas']","['Mohr S', 'Doebele C', 'Comoglio F', 'Berg T', 'Beck J', 'Bohnenberger H', 'Alexe G', 'Corso J', 'Strobel P', 'Wachter A', 'Beissbarth T', 'Schnutgen F', 'Cremer A', 'Haetscher N', 'Gollner S', 'Rouhi A', 'Palmqvist L', 'Rieger MA', 'Schroeder T', 'Bonig H', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Kuchenbauer F', 'Schutz E', 'Green AR', 'Urlaub H', 'Stegmaier K', 'Humphries RK', 'Serve H', 'Oellerich T']","['Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK;

However, their roles in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have not been fully elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy human tongue OSCC samples were analyzed in the present study. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the correlations between the densities of CD68-, CD163-, and CD204-positive TAMs and clinicopathologic parameters. Lymphatic vessel density (LVD) was estimated using the D2-40 antibody. In vitro studies also were conducted to investigate the effect of conditioned medium (CM) derived from OSCC cell lines on cytokine and chemokine expression in RAW264.7 mouse monocytic leukemia cells. RESULTS: Increased densities of CD68-, CD163-, and CD204-positive TAMs were significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = .035, .0082, and .038, respectively). Higher LVD occurred considerably more frequently in patients with nodal metastasis than in those without such metastasis. Moreover, LVD was considerably increased in patients with higher CD163-positive TAM densities. Studies using immunofluorescence showed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C was expressed in 52 of 70 patients with CD163-positive TAMs (74.2%). Moreover, CM derived from OSCC cell lines stimulated the expression of Il-10, Ccl22, Vegf-a, and Vegf-c in RAW264.7 cells; however, Il-12p35 expression levels were not changed. CONCLUSION: CD163-positive TAMs promote lymphangiogenesis through VEGF-C expression, which contributes to regional lymph node metastasis in OSCC.","['Yamagata, Yuko', 'Tomioka, Hirofumi', 'Sakamoto, Kei', 'Sato, Kiyoshi', 'Harada, Hiroyuki', 'Ikeda, Tohru', 'Kayamori, Kou']","['Yamagata Y', 'Tomioka H', 'Sakamoto K', 'Sato K', 'Harada H', 'Ikeda T', 'Kayamori K']","['Graduate School Student, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Assistant Professor, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Junior Associate Professor, Department of Oral Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Resident, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Professor, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Professor, Department of Oral Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Assistant Professor, Department of Oral Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.

The molecular mechanism of action of flubendazole is based on its specific binding to tubulin, which results in disruption of microtubule structure and function, and in the interference with the microtubule-mediated transport of secretory vesicles in absorptive tissues of helminths. The microtubule-disrupting properties of benzimidazole derivatives raised recently interest in these compounds as possible anti-cancer agents. In this minireview flubendazole effects towards selected human malignant cells including myeloma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma are discussed along with basic data on its pharmacokinetics, metabolism and toxicity.","['Canova, Kristyna', 'Rozkydalova, Lucie', 'Rudolf, Emil']","['Canova K', 'Rozkydalova L', 'Rudolf E']","['Charles University, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Department of Pharmacology, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Charles University, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. rudolf@lfhk.cuni.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170411,Czech Republic,Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove),Acta medica (Hradec Kralove),9705947,,['NOTNLM'],"['anti-cancer treatment', 'benzimidazole carbamate', 'flubendazole', 'melanoma', 'microtubules', 'mitotic catastrophe']",,2017/04/12 06:00,2017/08/18 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.14712/18059694.2017.44 [doi]', '18059694.2017.44 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove). 2017;60(1):5-11. doi: 10.14712/18059694.2017.44.

Hence, the presence of wild terrestrial carnivores in urban and peri-urban sites has increased considerably over the years implying an increased risk of interspecies spillover of infectious diseases and the transmission of zoonoses. The present study provides a detailed characterisation of the health status of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), stone marten (Martes foina) and raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in their natural rural and peri-urban habitats in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany between November 2013 and January 2016 with focus on zoonoses and infectious diseases that are potentially threatening to other wildlife or domestic animal species. 79 red foxes, 17 stone martens and 10 raccoon dogs were collected from traps or hunts. In order to detect morphological changes and potential infectious diseases, necropsy and pathohistological work-up was performed. Additionally, in selected animals immunohistochemistry (influenza A virus, parvovirus, feline leukemia virus, Borna disease virus, tick-borne encephalitis, canine adenovirus, Neospora caninum, Toxoplasma gondii and Listeria monocytogenes), next-generation sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (fox circovirus) and serum-neutralisation analysis (canine distemper virus) were performed. Furthermore, all animals were screened for fox rabies virus (immunofluorescence), canine distemper virus (immunohistochemistry) and Aujeszky's disease (virus cultivation). The most important findings included encephalitis (n = 16) and pneumonia (n = 20). None of the investigations revealed a specific cause for the observed morphological alterations except for one animal with an elevated serum titer of 1:160 for canine distemper. Animals displayed macroscopically and/or histopathologically detectable infections with parasites, including Taenia sp., Toxocara sp. and Alaria alata. In summary, wildlife predators carry zoonotic parasitic disease and suffer from inflammatory diseases of yet unknown etiology, possibly bearing infectious potential for other animal species and humans. This study highlights the value of monitoring terrestrial wildlife following the ""One Health"" notion, to estimate the incidence and the possible spread of zoonotic pathogens and to avoid animal to animal spillover as well as transmission to humans.","['Lempp, Charlotte', 'Jungwirth, Nicole', 'Grilo, Miguel L', 'Reckendorf, Anja', 'Ulrich, Arlena', 'van Neer, Abbo', 'Bodewes, Rogier', 'Pfankuche, Vanessa M', 'Bauer, Christian', 'Osterhaus, Albert D M E', 'Baumgartner, Wolfgang', 'Siebert, Ursula']","['Lempp C', 'Jungwirth N', 'Grilo ML', 'Reckendorf A', 'Ulrich A', 'van Neer A', 'Bodewes R', 'Pfankuche VM', 'Bauer C', 'Osterhaus AD', 'Baumgartner W', 'Siebert U']","['Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany.', 'Center for Systems Neuroscience, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Busum, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.', 'Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Busum, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.', 'Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Busum, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.', 'Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Busum, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.', 'Department of Viroscience, The Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany.', 'Center for Systems Neuroscience, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Parasitology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, Giessen, Germany.', 'Research Center for Emerging Infections and Zoonoses, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany.', 'Center for Systems Neuroscience, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Busum, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170411,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5388480,,,,2017/04/12 06:00,2017/09/13 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2016/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0175469 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-47753 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Apr 11;12(4):e0175469. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0175469. eCollection 2017.,,20170912,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3534-1257'],,IM,"['Animals', 'Cardiovascular System/pathology', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Foxes/*microbiology', 'Gastrointestinal Tract/pathology', 'Germany', 'Musculoskeletal System/pathology', 'Mustelidae/*microbiology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Raccoon Dogs/*microbiology', 'Respiratory System/pathology', 'Urogenital System/pathology', '*Zoonoses/immunology/microbiology/transmission']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to identify the rates and correlates of adherence in patients with diverse malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or metastatic renal cell carcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, or breast cancer enrolled in this prospective, single-group, observational study of medication-taking behaviors. Adherence was measured via self-report and with an electronic pill cap (Medication Event Monitoring System cap). Patients completed surveys regarding symptom distress, mood, quality of life, cancer-specific distress, and satisfaction with clinician communication and treatment at baseline and 12-week follow-up. RESULTS: As measured by the Medication Event Monitoring System, patients took, on average, 89.3% of their prescribed oral chemotherapy over the 12 weeks. One quarter of the sample was less than 90% adherent, and women were more adherent than men (mean difference, 9.59%; SE difference, 4.50%; 95% CI, -18.65 to -0.52; P = .039). Improvements in patient symptom distress (B = -0.79; 95% CI, -1.41 to -0.18), depressive symptoms (B = -1.57; 95% CI, -2.86 to -0.29), quality of life (B = 0.38; 95% CI ,0.07 to 0.68), satisfaction with clinician communication and treatment (B = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.98), and perceived burden to others (B = -1.28; 95% CI, -2.20 to -0.37) were associated with better adherence. In a multivariate model, improved treatment satisfaction (B = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.94) and reduced perceived burden (B = -0.92; 95% CI, -1.76 to -0.09) were the strongest indicators of better adherence. CONCLUSION: Women and patients who reported increased treatment satisfaction and reduced burden to others were more adherent to oral chemotherapy. Interventions that help patients improve communication with clinicians and reduce burden may optimize oral chemotherapy adherence.","['Jacobs, Jamie M', 'Pensak, Nicole A', 'Sporn, Nora J', 'MacDonald, James J', 'Lennes, Inga T', 'Safren, Steven A', 'Pirl, William F', 'Temel, Jennifer S', 'Greer, Joseph A']","['Jacobs JM', 'Pensak NA', 'Sporn NJ', 'MacDonald JJ', 'Lennes IT', 'Safren SA', 'Pirl WF', 'Temel JS', 'Greer JA']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School; Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA; University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Miami, Coral Gables; and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School; Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA; University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Miami, Coral Gables; and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School; Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA; University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Miami, Coral Gables; and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School; Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA; University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Miami, Coral Gables; and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School; Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA; University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Miami, Coral Gables; and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School; Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA; University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Miami, Coral Gables; and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School; Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA; University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Miami, Coral Gables; and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School; Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA; University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Miami, Coral Gables; and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School; Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA; University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO; University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; University of Miami, Coral Gables; and University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170411,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,,,,,2017/04/12 06:00,2017/11/04 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JOP.2016.019729 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2017 May;13(5):e474-e485. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2016.019729.

METHODS: A total of 28 patients with ATL (indolent, 9; aggressive, 19) were enrolled; all patients with aggressive ATL underwent FDG-PET/CT before chemotherapy. Patients with indolent ATL underwent FDG-PET/CT at the time of suspected disease progression and/or transformation; some received lymph node biopsy. The quantitative parameters maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax), and mean and peak SUV, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and volume-based total lesion glycolysis were calculated with the margin threshold as 25%, and 50% of the SUVmax for all lesions. RESULTS: All parameters except for MTV-25% showed significant differences (P </= 0.05) in differentiating the aggressive type from the indolent type of ATL. Areas under the curve for receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis regarding the series of parameters investigated ranged from 0.75 to 0.92; this indicated relatively high accuracy in distinguishing the aggressive type from the indolent type. No malignant findings were detected in lymph node biopsies in indolent ATL patients with lymphadenopathy. DISCUSSION: We performed evaluation of a line of parameters of FDG-PET, thereby demonstrating their significantly high accuracy for grading malignancy in ATL patients. In particular, low accumulation of FDG in indolent ATL patients with lymphadenopathy might predict that it is not a sign of disease transformation, but rather a reactive manifestation. CONCLUSION: FDG-PET/CT findings could be useful for clinically grading ATL.","['Nakachi, Sawako', 'Okada, Masahiro', 'Morishima, Satoko', 'Agarie, Yurika', 'Kitamura, Sakiko', 'Uchibori, Sachie', 'Tomori, Shouhei', 'Hanashiro, Taeko', 'Shimabukuro, Natsuki', 'Tamaki, Keita', 'Tedokon, Iori', 'Morichika, Kazuho', 'Nishi, Yukiko', 'Tomoyose, Takeaki', 'Karube, Kennosuke', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Murayama, Sadayuki', 'Masuzaki, Hiroaki']","['Nakachi S', 'Okada M', 'Morishima S', 'Agarie Y', 'Kitamura S', 'Uchibori S', 'Tomori S', 'Hanashiro T', 'Shimabukuro N', 'Tamaki K', 'Tedokon I', 'Morichika K', 'Nishi Y', 'Tomoyose T', 'Karube K', 'Fukushima T', 'Murayama S', 'Masuzaki H']","['a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'b Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medical Science , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'b Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medical Science , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'c Internal Medicine , Heart-Life Hospital , Nakagusuku , Japan.', 'd Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'e Laboratory of Immunohematology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'b Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medical Science , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.', 'a Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology and Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine , University of the Ryukyus , Nishihara , Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170411,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia', 'aggressive type', 'indolent type', 'metabolic tumor volume', 'positron emission tomography', 'standardized uptake value', 'total lesion glycolysis', 'volume-based parameter']",,2017/04/12 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1312088 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2017 Oct;22(9):536-543. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1312088.

Abnormal miRNA expression has been identified in various types of cancer. However, the aberrant expression of miR-1244 has not been reported in acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: First, the expression of miR-144-3p was explored in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of AML patients and healthy control. Then, we also evaluated the level of miR-144-3p in HL-60 cells. The possible target gene of miR-144-3p was predicted using TargetScan. Dual luciferase reporter assay was applied to validate the target gene of miR-144-3p. Cell viability and apoptosis on miR-144-3p was explored. Western blot analysis was applied to identify the downstream signaling of miR-144-3p. RESULTS: Our data showed that miR-144-3p was markedly increased in both the peripheral blood and bone marrow of AML patients compared with healthy controls. Moreover, we also found an increased expression of miR144-3p in HL-60 cells. In comparison, NRF2 protein expression was significantly decreased in HL-60 cells. Dual luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-144-3p significantly suppressed the relative luciferase reporter activity of a pmirGLO-NRF2-3'UTR. In accordance with the downstream effects of NRF2 overexpression, inhibition of miR-144-3p reduced cell viability and prompted apoptosis. More importantly, we found that the inhibition of miR-144-3p in HL-60 cells could not enhance Caspase-3 activation when NRF2 protein expression was silenced. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential oncogenic function of miR-144-3p in HL-60 cells, which is mainly achieved by targeting NRF2.","['Sun, Xuelin', 'Liu, Dejun', 'Xue, Yuan', 'Hu, Xin']","['Sun X', 'Liu D', 'Xue Y', 'Hu X']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,,,,,2017/04/12 06:00,2017/09/09 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2016.161116 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2017 Apr 1;63(4):679-687. doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2016.161116.,,20170908,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'MicroRNAs', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rituximab biosimilar CT-P10 has recently been approved in Europe in all indications held by reference rituximab (RTX), including rheumatoid arthritis, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We analyzed the budgetary impact of the introduction of CT-P10 into the European Union (EU) for use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and cancer diagnoses, using a budget impact analysis model. METHODS: The model used a base case scenario in which the 1-year uptake of CT-P10 was estimated at 30%, and the cost of CT-P10 was assumed to be 70% of the cost of RTX. A second 1-year scenario was also modeled, in which the market share of CT-P10 was assumed to be 50% (scenario 2). Finally, 3-year time horizon outcomes were calculated, in which the market share of CT-P10 was assumed to be 30%, 40%, and 50% in the first, second, and third years, respectively. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, the introduction of CT-P10 was associated with projected savings of euro90.04 million in the first year, which would allow 7531 additional patients to access rituximab treatment. This was equivalent to a 6.4% increase in the number of rituximab-treated patients. In scenario 2, budget savings were euro150.10 million, with a total of 12,551 additional patients able to access rituximab, equivalent to a 10.7% increase. Over a 3-year time horizon, projected budget savings were approximately euro570 million, equating to 47,695 additional patients able to access rituximab. CONCLUSIONS: The model predicted that the introduction of CT-P10 in the EU will be associated with significant budget savings, the reallocation of which will enable many more patients to access rituximab treatment. This is likely to have a significant impact on health gains at patient and societal levels.

Despite decades of trials trying to improve short- and long-term responses, outcomes have been stubbornly stable. Thus, the problem of chemotherapy resistance remains unsolved. Indeed, the use of novel targeted agents has uncovered new mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance. In this review, we will cover past work of primary treatment resistance, new resistance mechanisms in de novo AML, functional mechanism of resistance inherent to the leukemic blasts, and resistance mechanisms attributed to host factors and also review acquired mechanisms of resistance.","['Yeung, Cecilia C S', 'Radich, Jerald']","['Yeung CCS', 'Radich J']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave North, G7-910, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA. cyeung@fredhutch.org.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave North, G7-910, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Chemotherapy resistance', '*Minimal residual disease', '*Molecular diagnostics', '*Tumor heterogeneity']",,2017/04/12 06:00,2018/07/10 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-017-0378-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-017-0378-x [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2017 Dec;12(6):530-536. doi: 10.1007/s11899-017-0378-x.,,20180709,,,IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The existence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) is responsible for drug resistance and leukemia relapse. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CD34(+)CD38(-) fraction is the most enriched compartment for LSCs. We found that LKB1 was upregulated in CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cells. LKB1 downregulation suppressed the long-term proliferation of CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cells, induced CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cells into G2/M phase, and enhanced the sensitivity of CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cells to chemotherapy. Furthermore, LKB1 downregulation in CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cells inhibited tumor formation in NOD-SCID mice. Downregulation of LKB1 gene makes LSCs partly loose the characters as stem cells. Gene expression microarray showed that MAPK/ERK pathway was implicated in the regulation of CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cell proliferation by LKB1. Together, these findings demonstrate that LKB1 plays an important role in the maintenance of LSCs, which may be responsible for drug resistance and AML relapse.","['Wang, Huihan', 'Wang, Xiaobin', 'Xin, Na', 'Qi, Lin', 'Liao, Aijun', 'Yang, Wei', 'Liu, Zhuogang', 'Zhao, Chenghai']","['Wang H', 'Wang X', 'Xin N', 'Qi L', 'Liao A', 'Yang W', 'Liu Z', 'Zhao C']","['Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110039, China.', 'Department of Urology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110004, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, College of Basic Medical Science, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110122, China.', ""Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA."", 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110039, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110039, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110039, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, College of Basic Medical Science, China Medical University, Shenyang, 110122, China. zhaochenghai1@sina.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170410,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Leukemia stem cells', 'Live kinase B1']",,2017/04/12 06:00,2018/08/07 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-017-3032-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-017-3032-y [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2017 Oct;434(1-2):25-32. doi: 10.1007/s11010-017-3032-y.

In the context of HCT, NKG2D-bearing cells can kill both tumor and healthy cells expressing NKG2DL.

Among the burgeoning family of unconventional T cells, innate-like CD8(+) T cells in the mouse were discovered in the early 2000s. This subset of CD8(+) T cells bears a memory phenotype without having encountered a foreign antigen and can respond to innate-like IL-12 + IL-18 stimulation. Although the concept of innate memory CD8(+) T cells is now well established in mice, whether an equivalent memory NK-like T-cell population exists in humans remains under debate. We recently reported that CD8(+) T cells responding to innate-like IL-12 + IL-18 stimulation and co-expressing the transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) and KIR/NKG2A membrane receptors with a memory/EMRA phenotype may represent a new, functionally distinct innate T cell subset in humans. In this review, after a summary on the known innate CD8(+) T-cell features in the mouse, we propose Eomes together with KIR/NKG2A and CD49d as a signature to standardize the identification of this innate CD8(+) T-cell subset in humans. Next, we discuss IL-4 and IL-15 involvement in the generation of innate CD8(+) T cells and particularly its possible dependency on the promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger factor expressing iNKT cells, an innate T cell subset well documented for its susceptibility to tumor immune subversion. After that, focusing on cancer diseases, we provide new insights into the potential role of these innate CD8(+) T cells in a physiopathological context in humans. Based on empirical data obtained in cases of chronic myeloid leukemia, a myeloproliferative syndrome controlled by the immune system, and in solid tumors, we observe both the possible contribution of innate CD8(+) T cells to cancer disease control and their susceptibility to tumor immune subversion. Finally, we note that during tumor progression, innate CD8(+) T lymphocytes could be controlled by immune checkpoints. This study significantly contributes to understanding of the role of NK-like CD8(+) T cells and raises the question of the possible involvement of an iNKT/innate CD8(+) T cell axis in cancer.","['Barbarin, Alice', 'Cayssials, Emilie', 'Jacomet, Florence', 'Nunez, Nicolas Gonzalo', 'Basbous, Sara', 'Lefevre, Lucie', 'Abdallah, Myriam', 'Piccirilli, Nathalie', 'Morin, Benjamin', 'Lavoue, Vincent', 'Catros, Veronique', 'Piaggio, Eliane', 'Herbelin, Andre', 'Gombert, Jean-Marc']","['Barbarin A', 'Cayssials E', 'Jacomet F', 'Nunez NG', 'Basbous S', 'Lefevre L', 'Abdallah M', 'Piccirilli N', 'Morin B', 'Lavoue V', 'Catros V', 'Piaggio E', 'Herbelin A', 'Gombert JM']","['INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Service d'Hematologie et d'Oncologie Biologique, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", ""INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Service d'Immunologie et Inflammation, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", ""Institut Curie, PSL Research University, INSERM U932, Paris, France; SiRIC Translational Immunotherapy Team, Translational Research Department, Research Center, Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Paris, France; Centre d'Investigation Clinique Biotherapie CICBT 1428, Institut Curie, Paris, France."", 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM 1082 , Poitiers , France.', 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM 1082 , Poitiers , France.', 'INSERM U1242, Rennes, France; CHU de Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'CHU de Rennes, Rennes, France; INSERM U991, Rennes, France; CRB Sante de Rennes, Rennes, France.', ""Institut Curie, PSL Research University, INSERM U932, Paris, France; SiRIC Translational Immunotherapy Team, Translational Research Department, Research Center, Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Paris, France; Centre d'Investigation Clinique Biotherapie CICBT 1428, Institut Curie, Paris, France."", 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Service d'Immunologie et Inflammation, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170327,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,PMC5366313,['NOTNLM'],"['CD49d', 'Eomesodermin', 'NK-like T cells', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'iNKT cells', 'innate memory CD8(+) T cells', 'natural killer receptors', 'solid cancers']",,2017/04/12 06:00,2017/04/12 06:01,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2016/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00316 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Mar 27;8:316. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00316. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, quantitative trait loci influencing blood pressure, left ventricular mass, and heart interstitial fibrosis were genetically isolated within a minimal congenic subline that contains only 7 genes, including mutant Plzf (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger) candidate gene. To identify Plzf as a quantitative trait gene, we targeted Plzf in the SHR using the transcription activator-like effector nuclease technique and obtained SHR line harboring targeted Plzf gene with a premature stop codon. Because the Plzf targeted allele is semilethal, morphologically normal heterozygous rats were used for metabolic and hemodynamic analyses. SHR-Plzf(+/-) heterozygotes versus SHR wild-type controls exhibited reduced body weight and relative weight of epididymal fat, lower serum and liver triglycerides and cholesterol, and better glucose tolerance. In addition, SHR-Plzf(+/-) rats exhibited significantly increased sensitivity of adipose and muscle tissue to insulin action when compared with wild-type controls. Blood pressure was comparable in SHR versus SHR-Plzf(+/-); however, there was significant amelioration of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis in SHR-Plzf(+/-) rats. Gene expression profiles in the liver and expression of selected genes in the heart revealed differentially expressed genes that play a role in metabolic pathways, PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) signaling, and cell cycle regulation. These results provide evidence for an important role of Plzf in regulation of metabolic and cardiac traits in the rat and suggest a cross talk between cell cycle regulators, metabolism, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis.","['Liska, Frantisek', 'Landa, Vladimir', 'Zidek, Vaclav', 'Mlejnek, Petr', 'Silhavy, Jan', 'Simakova, Miroslava', 'Strnad, Hynek', 'Trnovska, Jaroslava', 'Skop, Vojtech', 'Kazdova, Ludmila', 'Starker, Colby G', 'Voytas, Daniel F', 'Izsvak, Zsuzsanna', 'Mancini, Massimiliano', 'Seda, Ondrej', 'Kren, Vladimir', 'Pravenec, Michal']","['Liska F', 'Landa V', 'Zidek V', 'Mlejnek P', 'Silhavy J', 'Simakova M', 'Strnad H', 'Trnovska J', 'Skop V', 'Kazdova L', 'Starker CG', 'Voytas DF', 'Izsvak Z', 'Mancini M', 'Seda O', 'Kren V', 'Pravenec M']","['From the Institute of Biology and Medical Genetics, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic (F.L., O.S., V.K., M.P.);

Accordingly, the modified bases 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) have been observed in DNA of genomic regulatory regions such as enhancers, and oxidation of 5mC into 5hmC by Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins correlates with enhancer activation. However, the functional relationship between cytosine modifications and the chromatin architecture of enhancers remains elusive. To gain insights into their function, 5mC and 5hmC levels were perturbed by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases and TETs during differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma cells into neural progenitors, and chromatin characteristics of enhancers bound by the pioneer transcription factors FOXA1, MEIS1, and PBX1 were interrogated. In a large fraction of the tested enhancers, inhibition of DNA methylation was associated with a significant increase in monomethylation of H3K4, a characteristic mark of enhancer priming. In addition, at some specific enhancers, 5mC oxidation by TETs facilitated chromatin opening, a process that may stabilize MEIS1 binding to these genomic regions.","['Mahe, Elise A', 'Madigou, Thierry', 'Serandour, Aurelien A', 'Bizot, Maud', 'Avner, Stephane', 'Chalmel, Frederic', 'Palierne, Gaelle', 'Metivier, Raphael', 'Salbert, Gilles']","['Mahe EA', 'Madigou T', 'Serandour AA', 'Bizot M', 'Avner S', 'Chalmel F', 'Palierne G', 'Metivier R', 'Salbert G']","['CNRS UMR6290, Equipe SP@RTE, Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'Universite de Rennes 1, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'CNRS UMR6290, Equipe SP@RTE, Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'Universite de Rennes 1, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'EMBL, Heidelberg 69117, Germany.', 'CNRS UMR6290, Equipe SP@RTE, Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'Universite de Rennes 1, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'CNRS UMR6290, Equipe SP@RTE, Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'Universite de Rennes 1, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'Inserm U1085-IRSET, Universite de Rennes 1, F-35042 Rennes, France.', 'CNRS UMR6290, Equipe SP@RTE, Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'Universite de Rennes 1, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'CNRS UMR6290, Equipe SP@RTE, Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'Universite de Rennes 1, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'CNRS UMR6290, Equipe SP@RTE, Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.', 'Universite de Rennes 1, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170410,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,PMC5453328,,,,2017/04/12 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2016/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['gr.211466.116 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.211466.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2017 Jun;27(6):947-958. doi: 10.1101/gr.211466.116.

However, the lack of markers that uniquely identify individual leukemia clones precludes high-resolution tracing of their clonal dynamics. Here, we use cellular barcoding to analyze the clonal behavior of patient-derived leukemia-propagating cells (LPCs) in murine xenografts. Using a leukemic cell line and diagnostic bone marrow cells from 6 patients with B-progenitor cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we demonstrate that patient-derived xenografts were highly polyclonal, consisting of tens to hundreds of LPC clones. The number of clones was stable within xenografts but strongly reduced upon serial transplantation. In contrast to primary recipients, in which clonal composition was highly diverse, clonal composition in serial xenografts was highly similar between recipients of the same donor and reflected donor clonality, supporting a deterministic, clone-size-based model for clonal selection. Quantitative analysis of clonal abundance in several anatomic sites identified 2 types of anatomic asymmetry. First, clones were asymmetrically distributed between different bones. Second, clonal composition in the skeleton significantly differed from extramedullary sites, showing similar numbers but different clone sizes. Altogether, this study shows that cellular barcoding and xenotransplantation providea useful model to study the behavior of patient-derived LPC clones, which provides insights relevant for experimental studies on cancer stem cells and for clinical protocols for the diagnosis and treatment of leukemia.","['Belderbos, Mirjam E', 'Koster, Taco', 'Ausema, Bertien', 'Jacobs, Sabrina', 'Sowdagar, Sharlaine', 'Zwart, Erik', 'de Bont, Eveline', 'de Haan, Gerald', 'Bystrykh, Leonid V']","['Belderbos ME', 'Koster T', 'Ausema B', 'Jacobs S', 'Sowdagar S', 'Zwart E', 'de Bont E', 'de Haan G', 'Bystrykh LV']","['Department of Stem Cell Biology and Ageing, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands; and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Ageing, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Ageing, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Ageing, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Ageing, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Ageing, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Ageing, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Ageing, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170410,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,,2017/04/12 06:00,2017/08/18 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2016/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33302-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-12-758250 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jun 15;129(24):3210-3220. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-12-758250.

Augmentation of irradiation, especially to sites of disease (ie, bone marrow) is one potential strategy for overcoming this risk. We studied the feasibility of radiation dose escalation in high-risk patients using total marrow irradiation (TMI) in a phase I dose-escalation trial. Four pediatric and 8 adult patients received conditioning with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine in conjunction with image-guided radiation to the bone marrow at 15 Gy and 18 Gy (in 3-Gy fractions), while maintaining the total body irradiation (TBI) dose to the vital organs (lungs, hearts, eyes, liver, and kidneys) at <13.2 Gy. The biologically effective dose of TMI delivered to the bone marrow was increased by 62% at 15 Gy and by 96% at 18 Gy compared with standard TBI. Although excessive dose-limiting toxicity, defined by graft failure or excessive specific organ toxicity, was not encountered, 3 of 6 patients experienced treatment-related mortality at 18 Gy. Thus, we halted enrollment at this dose level and treated an additional 4 patients at 15 Gy. The 1- year overall survival was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15%-67%) and disease-free survival was 22% (95% CI, 4%-49%). The rate of relapse was 36% (95% CI, 10%-62%), and nonrelapse mortality was 42% (95% CI, 14%-70%). This study shows that TMI dose escalation to 15 Gy is feasible with acceptable toxicity in pediatric and adult patients with high-risk leukemia undergoing umbilical cord blood and sibling donor transplantation.","['Hui, Susanta', 'Brunstein, Claudio', 'Takahashi, Yutaka', 'DeFor, Todd', 'Holtan, Shernan G', 'Bachanova, Veronika', 'Wilke, Christopher', 'Zuro, Darren', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'Weisdorf, Daniel', 'Dusenbery, Kathryn', 'Verneris, Michael R']","['Hui S', 'Brunstein C', 'Takahashi Y', 'DeFor T', 'Holtan SG', 'Bachanova V', 'Wilke C', 'Zuro D', 'Ustun C', 'Weisdorf D', 'Dusenbery K', 'Verneris MR']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Therapeutic Radiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Therapeutic Radiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

We performed a prospective phase I study of clofarabine combined with 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) as a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in pediatric patients who were considered at high risk of mortality from standard myeloablative regimens. The main goal of the study was to delineate the maximum feasible dose (MFD) of clofarabine in combination with 2 Gy TBI. Eighteen patients, 1 to 21 years of age and in complete remission, were enrolled in 2 strata (matched related donor and unrelated donor) and evaluated for day100 dose-limiting events (DLE) (nonengraftment, nonrelapse mortality [NRM], and severe renal insufficiency) after receiving clofarabine at the starting dose level of 40 mg/m(2). All 6 patients (3 in each stratum) engrafted with no day 100 DLE seen in the first cohort. The dose was increased to 52 mg/m(2) in the next and an expanded cohort (total of 12 patients) and no DLE were observed at day 100 and at the 1-year study endpoint. The regimen was well tolerated with transient transaminitis and gastrointestinal and skin reactions as the common reversible toxicities observed with clofarabine. The dose of 52 mg/m(2) of clofarabine was deemed the MFD. Disease relapse led to mortality in 6 (33%) patients during follow-up with 1-year event-free survival and overall survival of 60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34 to 79) and 71% (95% CI, 44 to 87), respectively. This regimen leads to successful engraftment using both related and unrelated donors with exceptionally low rates of NRM.","['Soni, Sandeep', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'McManus, Meghann', 'Nemecek, Eneida', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Woolfrey, Ann', 'Frangoul, Haydar']","['Soni S', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'McManus M', 'Nemecek E', 'Sposto R', 'Woolfrey A', 'Frangoul H']","[""Division of Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant and Regenerative Medicine, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.

However, recurrent disease is the major cause of treatment failure. Isolated extramedullary relapse (iEMR) after SCT is relatively rare and not well characterized. We performed a retrospective analysis of 566 consecutive patients with acute myeloid leukemia (n = 446) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 120) after SCT to study the incidence, risk factors, treatment options, and outcome of iEMR. The 5-year cumulative incidence of bone marrow relapse (BMR) and iEMR was 41.0% and 5.8%, respectively. iEMR occurred significantly later than BMR at 10 and 4 months, respectively (P < .001). Diagnosis of ALL (HR, 2.6; P = .05), poor cytogenetics (HR, 2.1; P = .06), and prior extramedullary disease (HR, 3.8; P = .002) were independent factors predicting iEMR. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) reduced the risk of BMR but did not protect against iEMR. Most patients with iEMR received systemic treatment combined with local radiation and donor lymphocyte infusions when feasible. The 3-year survival after relapse was 8.5% and 30.1% after BMR and iEMR, respectively (P = .002). Patients with a first iEMR continued to have recurrent EMRs, and only a minority progressed to BMR. Second iEMR was also common after first BMR and associated with longer survival than second BMR. iEMR is more frequent in patients with ALL and prior extramedullary disease. It occurs later than BMR and more commonly in patients with chronic GVHD, suggesting less effective graft-versus-leukemia effect in extramedullary sites. Second iEMR is common after a first iEMR but also after a first BMR. Long-term survival is feasible with aggressive treatment.","['Shem-Tov, Noga', 'Saraceni, Francesco', 'Danylesko, Ivetta', 'Shouval, Roni', 'Yerushalmi, Ronit', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Shimoni, Avichai']","['Shem-Tov N', 'Saraceni F', 'Danylesko I', 'Shouval R', 'Yerushalmi R', 'Nagler A', 'Shimoni A']","['The Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.

Given its relative rarity, data on outcomes of HCT for T-ALL are limited. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study using data from 208 adult patients who underwent HCT between 2000 and 2014 to describe outcomes of allogeneic HCT for T-ALL in the contemporary era. The median age at HCT was 37 years, and the majority of patients underwent HCT in CR, using total body irradiation (TBI)-based myeloablative conditioning regimens. One-quarter of the patients underwent alternative donor HCT using a mismatched, umbilical cord blood, or haploidentical donor. With a median follow up of 38 months, overall survival at 5 years was 34%. The corresponding cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality and relapse was 26% and 41%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, factors significantly associated with overall survival were the use of TBI (HR, 0.57; P = .021), age >35 years (HR, 1.55; P = .025), and disease status at HCT (HR, 1.98; P = .005 for relapsed/refractory disease compared with CR). Relapse was the most common cause of death (58% of patients).

Nevertheless, some patients treated with low doses of tyrosine kinase inhibitor have achieved good molecular responses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of low-dose dasatinib treatment of elderly CML patients. The study enrolled 21 patients with newly diagnosed, imatinib-resistant, or imatinib-intolerant chronic phase CML. All the patients were aged >/= 65 years and received dasatinib at a dose of < 100 mg/day. Of these 21 patients, 77% had newly diagnosed CML. RESULTS: Overall, 91% and 72% of patients received a mean dasatinib dose of </= 50 mg and </= 20 mg, respectively. A molecular response of MR(3) (major molecular response, indicating > 3 log reduction in the number of leukemic cells), MR(4), and MR(4.5) were achieved in 96%, 77%, and 62% of the patients, respectively. Of the 15 patients who received a mean dose of </= 20 mg, 94% achieved a major molecular response, and 74% achieved MR(4). The most common nonhematologic AE was plural effusion (29%), which was controlled by diuretics and regulating the drug dose. CONCLUSION: Low-dose (eg, </= 20 mg) dasatinib therapy generates an adequate molecular response in most elderly patients with chronic phase CML without causing severe AEs.","['Itamura, Hidekazu', 'Kubota, Yasushi', 'Shindo, Takero', 'Ando, Toshihiko', 'Kojima, Kensuke', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Itamura H', 'Kubota Y', 'Shindo T', 'Ando T', 'Kojima K', 'Kimura S']","['Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.

We recently developed a novel drug screening system using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells that maintained the primary cell phenotype better than cell lines. This screening is expected to discover anti-tumor drugs that have been overlooked by conventional screening using cell lines. We herein performed this screening to identify new therapeutic agents for PEL. We screened 3518 compounds with known pharmaceutical activities based on cytotoxic effects on PDX cells of PEL and selected YM155, a possible survivin inhibitor. It exerted strong anti-tumor effects in PDX cells and three cell lines of PEL; the GI50 of YM155 was 1.2-7.9nM. We found that YM155 reduced myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) protein levels prior to decreasing survivin levels, and this was inhibited by a proteasome inhibitor. The knockdown of MCL-1 by siRNA induced cell death in a PEL cell line, suggesting the involvement of decreased MCL-1 levels in YM155-induced cell death. YM155 also induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MCL-1, and a MEK1 inhibitor inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, degradation of MCL-1, and YM155-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that YM155 induces the proteasome-dependent degradation of MCL-1 through its phosphorylation by ERK1/2 and causes apoptosis in PEL cells. Furthermore, a treatment with YM155 significantly inhibited the development of ascites in PEL PDX mice.

To optimize TCD in HLA-matched siblings with hematologic malignancies, we explored varying the transplant CD3+ T-cell dose between 2 and 50 x 10(4)/kg (corresponding to 3-4 log depletion) and studied the impact of 0-6 x 10(7)/kg CD3+ donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) ""add-back"" on immune recovery post-SCT. METHODS: Two hundred seventeen consecutive patients (age range, 10-75 years) with hematologic malignancy (excluding chronic leukemias) underwent ex vivo TCD SCT from HLA-identical sibling donors from 1994-2015. Ninety-four patients had standard-risk disease (first remission acute leukemia [AL] and early stage myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS]) and 123 had high-risk disease (AL beyond first complete remission, advanced MDS or refractory B-cell malignancy). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 8.5 years. At 20 years post-SCT, overall survival (OS) was 40%, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 27% and relapse incidence was 39%. Factors affecting outcome in multivariate analysis were transplantation era, with OS increasing from 38% in the period 1994-2000 to 58% in 2011-2015, disease risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.68 for high risk) and increasing age (HR, 1.19 per decade). Neither the T-cell dose or the add back of T cells in the first 100 days had any effect on OS, NRM and relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes for TCD SCT have greatly improved. However, our data do not support the need to precisely manipulate transplant CD3+ T-cell dose provided at least 3-log depletion is achieved or the use of T-cell add-back. Future improvements for TCD SCT await better strategies to prevent relapse, especially in high-risk recipients.","['Anandi, Prathima', 'Tian, Xin', 'Ito, Sawa', 'Muranski, Pawel', 'Chokshi, Puja D', 'Watters, Noelle', 'Chawla, Upneet', 'Hensel, Nancy', 'Stroncek, David F', 'Battiwalla, Minoo', 'Barrett, A John']","['Anandi P', 'Tian X', 'Ito S', 'Muranski P', 'Chokshi PD', 'Watters N', 'Chawla U', 'Hensel N', 'Stroncek DF', 'Battiwalla M', 'Barrett AJ']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Office of Biostatistics Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Office of Biostatistics Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

Most genetic variants of beta3 also affect the widely expressed alphavbeta3 integrin. With brief mention of mouse models, I now look at the consequences of disease-causing ITGA2B and ITGB3 mutations on the non-hemostatic functions of platelets and other cells. Reports of arterial thrombosis in GT patients are rare, but other aspects of cardiovascular disease do occur including deep vein thrombosis and congenital heart defects. Thrombophilic and other risk factors for thrombosis and lessons from heterozygotes and variant forms of GT are discussed. Assessed for GT patients are reports of leukemia and cancer, loss of fertility, bone pathology, inflammation and wound repair, infections, kidney disease, autism and respiratory disease. This survey shows an urgent need for a concerted international effort to better determine how loss of alphaIIbbeta3 and alphavbeta3 influences health and disease.","['Nurden, Alan T']",['Nurden AT'],"[""Institut de Rhythmologie et de Modelisation Cardiaque, Plateforme Technologique d'Innovation Biomedicale, Hopital Xavier Arnozan, Pessac, France.

A systematic literature review was performed and 2 studies published before June 2016 were taken into analysis. Treatment with ibrutinib significantly improves PFS determined by investigator (HR of 0.3; P = .01) and OS (HR of 0.21; P < .001.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of prognostic factors on 237 adult patients with B-ALL treated at our institution. RESULTS: Older age (older than 60 years), higher white blood cell count (> 30), and abnl 17 were associated with shorter overall survival in univariate analysis, but multivariable analysis only identified older age as an independent poor prognostic actor. There was a significant correlation between abnl 17 and older age.

However, site-directed mutagenesis analyses failed to identify caspase-3-targeted sites in WT1 protein, indicating that caspase-3 cleaved uncommon sites but not classical motifs (DXXD) and non-classical motifs (XXXD). Finally, Eto decreased c-Myc and Bcl-2 expression via reducing the binding of WT1 to the promoter and Eto-induced apoptosis was partially prevented by overexpression of WT1. Collectively, we identify a new substrate for caspase-3 and shed new light on understanding the complicated biology of WT1 in leukemia.","['Ruan, Jichen', 'Gao, Shenmeng', 'Yang, Junjun', 'Li, Haiying', 'Huang, He', 'Zheng, Xiaoqun']","['Ruan J', 'Gao S', 'Yang J', 'Li H', 'Huang H', 'Zheng X']","[""a Department of Hematology , the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , Zhejiang Province , China."", 'b Laboratory of Internal Medicine , the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , Zhejiang Province , China.', ""c Department of Laboratory Medicine , the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , Zhejiang Province , China."", 'b Laboratory of Internal Medicine , the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , Zhejiang Province , China.', ""a Department of Hematology , the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , Zhejiang Province , China."", ""c Department of Laboratory Medicine , the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Wenzhou , Zhejiang Province , China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170410,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,['NOTNLM'],"['*WT1', '*caspase-3', '*cleavage']",,2017/04/12 06:00,2018/08/01 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1312368 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2018 Jan;59(1):162-170. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1312368.

Pharmacovigilance data have been collected since bendamustine's approval to enhance understanding of its long-term safety profile. Here we provide an overview of the pharmacovigilance data for bendamustine that have led to label updates related to safety and administration since its approval. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adverse events (AEs) captured from 12 quarterly postmarketing periodic adverse drug experience reports spanning 2008-2015 were included and summarized. AEs were classified as serious or nonserious and expected or unexpected. RESULTS: Adverse events that resulted in label updates included Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, extravasation, secondary neoplasm, and drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Preventive measures for tumor lysis syndrome were revised. Although this review may be limited by voluntary reporting, the adverse events reported for bendamustine in a large, heterogeneous population with a long follow-up relative to recently approved treatments provide a much broader understanding of its safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these observational data, bendamustine appears to have a favorable risk-benefit profile and remains a useful option when considering a management strategy in patients with CLL and NHL.","['Martin, Peter', 'Barr, Paul M', 'James, Leonard', 'Pathak, Ashutosh', 'Kahl, Brad']","['Martin P', 'Barr PM', 'James L', 'Pathak A', 'Kahl B']","['a Division of Hematology/Oncology , New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medicine , New York , NY , USA.', 'b James P.

Methods: The clinical features and RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels of 55 pediatric t (8;21) AML patients, newly diagnosed from Jan. 2010 to Apr. 2016, were analyzed retrospectively. The relationship between the minimal residual disease (MRD) and prognosis was analysed by dynamic monitoring of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels using real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) technology. Results: The RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels in bone marrow cells at diagnosis was not related to relapse. After one course of induction therapy, patients with a more than 2 Log reduction of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels (>2 Log) had lower 5 years cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) [ (24.3+/-8.4) % vs (52.6+/-9.7) %, chi(2)=9.046, P=0.003], relapse-free survival (RFS) [ (71.6+/-12.7) % vs (48.1+/-13.2) %, chi(2)=5.814, P=0.016], and better overall survival (OS) [ (76.9+/-12.5) % vs (48.9+/-14.7) %, chi(2)=6.346, P=0.012], compared to patients with a less than 2 Log reduction (a<2 Log) . Multivariate Cox survival analysis suggested that a>2 Log reduction in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels after a course of induction therapy was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (HR=0.263, 95%CI 0.081-0.851, P=0.026) and OS (HR=0.214, 95% CI 0.057-0.808, P=0.023) . During consolidation therapy and follow-up period, molecular relapse of 16 cases and hematologic relapse of 13 cases were identified by continuous dynamic monitoring of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels, with a median interval of 4.0 (1.5-5.8) months from the molecular relapse to hematologic relapse. 2 cases of molecular relapse who received timely allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation did not experience hematologic relapse. Conclusion: Dynamic monitoring RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels by RQ-PCR technique can subdivide patients into relatively low and high risk group, early screen patients at high risk of relapse and provide a scientific basis for precision stratification and risk-adapted therapy for pediatric t (8;21) AML children.","['Gao, H T', 'Zhang, Y', 'Sun, K', 'Guo, J M', 'Chen, Y Q', 'Chen, X L', 'Shi, J', 'Niu, X N', 'Wang, F', 'Huo, L']","['Gao HT', 'Zhang Y', 'Sun K', 'Guo JM', 'Chen YQ', 'Chen XL', 'Shi J', 'Niu XN', 'Wang F', 'Huo L']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC7348373,['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'Gene fusion, RUNX1-RUNX1T1', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Neoplasm, residual', 'Prognosis']",,2017/04/12 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2017.03.007 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2017 Mar 14;38(3):210-215. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2017.03.007.,,20181105,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Retrospective analysis of clinical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetics, molecular characteristics and prognosis of 80 newly diagnosed Ph(+) ALL patients with p16 deletion. Results: Of 80 adult Ph(+) ALL, the prevalence of p16 gene deletion was 31.3%. p16 gene deletion carriers frequently accompanied with high WBC counts (WBC>/=30x10(9)/L) and CD20 expression. The incidence of complex chromosome abnormality in p16 gene deletion group was higher than that in non-deletion group, with alternations in chromosome 7, 8, 19 and der (22) more frequently observed. There was no difference occurred between patients with or without p16 gene deletion in complete remission (CR) rate following induction chemotherapy combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) . However, after three cycles of chemotherapy, the MMR and CMR rate in the p16 gene deletion group was lower than patients with wild-type p16 gene (P=0.034, P=0.036) . The p16 gene deletion patients showed no significant differences in MMR, CMR and relapse rate between Imatinib or Dasatinib plus chemotherapy (P>0.05) . Deletion of p16 gene was significantly associated with poor outcomes including worse overall survival (OS) (37.1% vs 54.1%, P=0.037) , lower disease free-survival (DFS) (12.4% vs 45.9%, P=0.026) , and increased cumulative incidence of relapse (P=0.033) . Among the 25 patients with p16 deletion, 14 underwent allo-HSCT and the median survival was 21 months, better than that of patients received chemotherapy alone (12 months) (P=0.030) . Conclusion: This study indicated that deletion of p16 was associated with poor prognosis in adult Ph(+) ALL, and the utility of second-generation TKI (Dasatinib) does not necessarily have an edge on efficacy over Imatinib, but allo-HSCT has the potential of elongating life expectancy. It is an important significance to define the status of p16 in Ph(+) ALL for predicting prognosis and guiding therapy decision-making.","['He, B L', 'Xu, N', 'Li, Y L', 'Pan, C Y', 'Cao, R', 'Liao, L B', 'Yin, C X', 'Lan, Y Q', 'Lu, Z Y', 'Huang, J X', 'Zhou, H S', 'Liu, Q F', 'Liu, X L']","['He BL', 'Xu N', 'Li YL', 'Pan CY', 'Cao R', 'Liao LB', 'Yin CX', 'Lan YQ', 'Lu ZY', 'Huang JX', 'Zhou HS', 'Liu QF', 'Liu XL']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,PMC7348375,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Leukemia, lymphoid, acute', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor', 'p16 gene deletion']",,2017/04/12 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2017/04/12 06:00'],"['2017/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2017.03.006 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2017 Mar 14;38(3):204-209. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2017.03.006.,,20181105,,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Deletion', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Induction Chemotherapy', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During diagnostic immunophenotyping of 573 childhood B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL), we identified eight cases with this immunophenotype among ""B-other ALL"" (BCP-ALL cases negative for routinely tested chromosomal/genetic aberrations). We aimed to elucidate whether these cases belong to the recently described ETV6/RUNX1-like ALL defined by the ETV6/RUNX1-specific gene expression profile (GEP), harboring concurrent ETV6 and IKZF1 lesions. We performed comprehensive genomic analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, whole exome and transcriptome sequencing and GEP on microarrays. In unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on GEP, five out of seven analyzed CD27(pos) /CD44(low-neg) B-other cases clustered with ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL and were thus classified as ETV6/RUNX1-like ALL. The two cases clustering outside ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL harbored a P2RY8/CRLF2 fusion with activating JAK2 mutations and a TCF3/ZNF384 fusion, respectively, assigning them to other ALL subtypes. All five ETV6/RUNX1-like cases harbored ETV6 deletions; uniform intragenic ARPP21 deletions and various IKZF1 lesions were each found in three ETV6/RUNX1-like cases. The frequency of ETV6 and ARPP21 deletions was significantly higher in ETV6/RUNX1-like ALL compared with a reference cohort of 42 B-other ALL. In conclusion, we show that ETV6/RUNX1-like ALL is associated with CD27(pos) /CD44(low-neg) immunophenotype and identify ARPP21 deletions to contribute to its specific genomic profile enriched for ETV6 and IKZF1 lesions. In conjunction with previously published data, our study identifies the ETV6 lesion as the only common genetic aberration and thus the most likely key driver of ETV6/RUNX1-like ALL.","['Zaliova, Marketa', 'Kotrova, Michaela', 'Bresolin, Silvia', 'Stuchly, Jan', 'Stary, Jan', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Trka, Jan', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Vaskova, Martina']","['Zaliova M', 'Kotrova M', 'Bresolin S', 'Stuchly J', 'Stary J', 'Hrusak O', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Trka J', 'Zuna J', 'Vaskova M']","['CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Italy."", 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Italy."", 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170505,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,,,,2017/04/11 06:00,2017/10/07 06:00,['2017/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22464 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2017 Aug;56(8):608-616. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22464.

Yet, it is not still being widely used in a diagnostic setting. In this study, we document the experience with LEF1 immunohistochemistry during routine diagnostics. Methods: In total, 191 B-cell lymphoma cases from Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust (London, UK) were investigated by immunohistochemistry for LEF1 during routine diagnostic workup. These cases included both bone marrow trephines and lymph node biopsy specimens. The monoclonal antibody clone EPR2029Y was used. Results: LEF1 expression was strong and diffuse (>70% of cells) in most cases. Few CLL cases showed a staining in proliferation centers only. Seventy-seven of 80 CLL cases expressed LEF1. Other entities expressing LEF1 included one of 38 follicular lymphomas, two of 33 marginal zone lymphomas, and one diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with a background of follicular lymphoma grade 3B. Sensitivity for LEF1 for the diagnosis of CLL was 0.96, and specificity was 0.93. Conclusions: In this study, we could demonstrate the diagnostic utility of LEF1. LEF1 is a sensitive and specific marker for CLL and is helpful in the diagnosis of diagnostically challenging small B-cell lymphomas.","['Menter, Thomas', 'Trivedi, Pritesh', 'Ahmad, Raida', 'Flora, Rashpal', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan', 'Tzankov, Alexandar', 'Naresh, Kikkeri N']","['Menter T', 'Trivedi P', 'Ahmad R', 'Flora R', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Tzankov A', 'Naresh KN']","['From the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK; and.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'From the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK; and.', 'From the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK; and.', 'From the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK; and.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'From the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK; and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'LEF1', 'Routine diagnostics']",,2017/04/11 06:00,2017/04/15 06:00,['2017/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['3063263 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqw208 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2017 Mar 1;147(3):292-300. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqw208.,,20170414,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

Given the recent recognition of altered DNA methylation patterns in relapsed AML, we considered whether araC, which acts by incorporation into DNA, could itself perturb methylation dynamics. To explore this possibility, we examined several DNA methyltransferases and find that araC embedded in DNA is consistently methylated with an efficiency diminished relative to that of deoxycytidine. Importantly, with the human maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1, the extent of araC methylation is reduced by more than approximately 200-fold. These observations support a model whereby araC treatment may itself contribute to locus-specific, passive DNA demethylation in relapsed AML.","['Nabel, Christopher S', 'DeNizio, Jamie E', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Kohli, Rahul M']","['Nabel CS', 'DeNizio JE', 'Carroll M', 'Kohli RM']","['Department of Medicine and double daggerDepartment of Biochemistry & Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Department of Medicine and double daggerDepartment of Biochemistry & Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Department of Medicine and double daggerDepartment of Biochemistry & Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.', 'Department of Medicine and double daggerDepartment of Biochemistry & Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20170412,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,PMC5638661,,,,2017/04/11 06:00,2017/06/07 06:00,['2017/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00208 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2017 Apr 25;56(16):2166-2169. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00208.

Each complex associates with chromatin via distinct mechanisms, conferring different transcriptional properties including activation, maintenance, and repression. The mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene often fuses with ENL and AF10 family genes in leukemia. However, the functional interrelationship among those 3 complexes in leukemic transformation remains largely elusive. Here, we have shown that MLL-ENL and MLL-AF10 constitutively activate transcription by aberrantly inducing both AEP-dependent transcriptional activation and DOT1L-dependent transcriptional maintenance, mostly in the absence of PRC1, to fully transform hematopoietic progenitors. These results reveal a cooperative transcriptional activation mechanism of AEP and DOT1L and suggest a molecular rationale for the simultaneous inhibition of the MLL fusion-AF4 complex and DOT1L for more effective treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemia.","['Okuda, Hiroshi', 'Stanojevic, Boban', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Kawamura, Takeshi', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Yokoyama, Akihiko']","['Okuda H', 'Stanojevic B', 'Kanai A', 'Kawamura T', 'Takahashi S', 'Matsui H', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Yokoyama A']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170410,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC5409830,,,,2017/04/11 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2017/04/11 06:00'],"['2016/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['91406 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI91406 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2017 May 1;127(5):1918-1931. doi: 10.1172/JCI91406.

In acute leukemias, it is not clear whether MSC alterations contribute to the development of the malignant clone or whether they are simply the effect of tumor expansion on the microenvironment. We extensively investigated the characteristics of MSCs isolated from the BM of patients with de novo AML at diagnosis (L-MSCs) in terms of phenotype (gene and protein expression, apoptosis and senescence levels, DNA double-strand break formation) and functions (proliferation and clonogenic potentials, normal and leukemic hematopoiesis-supporting activity). We found that L-MSCs show reduced proliferation capacity and increased apoptosis levels compared with MSCs from healthy controls. Longer population doubling time in L-MSCs was not related to the AML characteristics at diagnosis (French-American-British type, cytogenetics, or tumor burden), but was related to patient age and independently associated with poorer patient outcome, as was cytogenetic prognostic feature. Analyzing, among others, the expression of 93 genes, we found that proliferative deficiency of L-MSCs was associated with a perivascular feature at the expense of the osteo-chondroblastic lineage with lower expression of several niche factors, such as KITLG, THPO, and ANGPT1 genes, the cell adhesion molecule VCAM1, and the developmental/embryonic genes, BMI1 and DICER1. L-MSC proliferative capacity was correlated positively with CXCL12, THPO, and ANGPT1 expression and negatively with JAG1 expression. Anyway, these changes did not affect their in vitro capacity to support normal hematopoiesis and to modify leukemic cell behavior (protection from apoptosis and quiescence induction). Our findings indicate that BM-derived MSCs from patients with newly diagnosed AML display phenotypic and functional alterations such as proliferative deficiency that could be attributed to tumor progression, but does not seem to play a special role in the leukemic process.","['Desbourdes, Laura', 'Javary, Joaquim', 'Charbonnier, Thomas', 'Ishac, Nicole', 'Bourgeais, Jerome', 'Iltis, Aurore', 'Chomel, Jean-Claude', 'Turhan, Ali', 'Guilloton, Fabien', 'Tarte, Karin', 'Demattei, Marie-Veronique', 'Ducrocq, Elfi', 'Rouleux-Bonnin, Florence', 'Gyan, Emmanuel', 'Herault, Olivier', 'Domenech, Jorge']","['Desbourdes L', 'Javary J', 'Charbonnier T', 'Ishac N', 'Bourgeais J', 'Iltis A', 'Chomel JC', 'Turhan A', 'Guilloton F', 'Tarte K', 'Demattei MV', 'Ducrocq E', 'Rouleux-Bonnin F', 'Gyan E', 'Herault O', 'Domenech J']","['1 CNRS UMR 7292, LNOx Team, Francois Rabelais University , Tours, France .', '1 CNRS UMR 7292, LNOx Team, Francois Rabelais University , Tours, France .', '2 Department of Biological Hematology, University Hospital of Tours , Tours, France .', '1 CNRS UMR 7292, LNOx Team, Francois Rabelais University , Tours, France .', '1 CNRS UMR 7292, LNOx Team, Francois Rabelais University , Tours, France .', '2 Department of Biological Hematology, University Hospital of Tours , Tours, France .', '3 Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, University Hospital of Tours , Tours, France .', '4 INSERM U935, University of Poitiers , Poitiers, France .', '5 Department of Biological Oncology, University Hospital of Poitiers , Poitiers, France .', '6 INSERM U935, University of Paris-Sud 11 , Paris, France .', '7 Department of Hematology, University Hospitals of Paris-Sud , Le Kremlin Bicetre, France .', '8 INSERM U917, University of Rennes 1 , Rennes, France .', '8 INSERM U917, University of Rennes 1 , Rennes, France .', '9 Department of Immunology, Cellular Therapy and Hematopoiesis, University Hospital of Rennes , Rennes, France .', '10 CNRS GDR 3697, MicroNiT National Network, Tours , France .', '11 CNRS UMR 7292, Telomeres and Genome Stability Team, Francois Rabelais University , Tours, France .', '1 CNRS UMR 7292, LNOx Team, Francois Rabelais University , Tours, France .', '1 CNRS UMR 7292, LNOx Team, Francois Rabelais University , Tours, France .', '1 CNRS UMR 7292, LNOx Team, Francois Rabelais University , Tours, France .', '3 Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, University Hospital of Tours , Tours, France .', '1 CNRS UMR 7292, LNOx Team, Francois Rabelais University , Tours, France .', '2 Department of Biological Hematology, University Hospital of Tours , Tours, France .', '10 CNRS GDR 3697, MicroNiT National Network, Tours , France .', '1 CNRS UMR 7292, LNOx Team, Francois Rabelais University , Tours, France .', '2 Department of Biological Hematology, University Hospital of Tours , Tours, France .', '10 CNRS GDR 3697, MicroNiT National Network, Tours , France .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170410,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*hematopoiesis', '*mesenchymal stromal cells', '*microenvironment', '*niche']",,2017/04/11 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2017/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2016.0295 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2017 May 15;26(10):709-722. doi: 10.1089/scd.2016.0295.

The synergistic cytotoxicity of the four-drug combination may be attributed to activation of the DNA-damage response, inhibition of PARP activity and DNA repair, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased production of reactive oxygen species, and activation of the SAPK/JNK stress signaling pathway, all of which may enhance apoptosis.

The presence of high level language deficits in older children who received CNS-directed ITC for ALL in early childhood is yet to be elucidated, with previous research suggesting that high level language deficits may appear later in ALL survivors' development at an age when these skills typically emerge. METHOD: A test battery covering foundational language skills and higher-order language skills was administered to five participants (aged 10-15 years) with a history of ITC for ALL. Conversion of each child's language performance scores to z scores allowed for clinical interpretation of data across the language areas tested. RESULT: Foundational language skills were, in general, of no clinical concern. Three of the five children presented with clinically impaired language skills in areas including resolving ambiguity, making inferences and composing novel sentences. Performance variation between the participants and within the individual participants was noted. CONCLUSION: Given the importance of early adolescent language abilities to academic and social development in late primary and secondary schooling, these preliminary findings suggest further research into emerging adolescent language abilities following ITC for ALL is warranted.","['Lewis, Fiona M', 'Bohan, Jaycie K']","['Lewis FM', 'Bohan JK']","['a School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences , The University of Queensland , Brisbane , Australia.', 'a School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences , The University of Queensland , Brisbane , Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170410,England,Int J Speech Lang Pathol,International journal of speech-language pathology,101320232,,['NOTNLM'],"['*chemotherapy late effects', '*childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*cognitive-linguistic', '*early adolescent language abilities', '*intrathecal chemotherapy']",,2017/04/11 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2017/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17549507.2017.1309066 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Speech Lang Pathol. 2018 Oct;20(5):485-493. doi: 10.1080/17549507.2017.1309066.

Naturally occurring mutations of the telomeric POT1-TPP1 complex are implicated in familial glioma, melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Here we report the atomic structure of the interacting portion of the human telomeric POT1-TPP1 complex and suggest how several of these mutations contribute to malignant cancer. The POT1 C-terminus (POT1C) forms a bilobal structure consisting of an OB-fold and a holiday junction resolvase domain. TPP1 consists of several loops and helices involved in extensive interactions with POT1C. Biochemical data shows that several of the cancer-associated mutations, partially disrupt the POT1-TPP1 complex, which affects its ability to bind telomeric DNA efficiently. A defective POT1-TPP1 complex leads to longer and fragile telomeres, which in turn promotes genomic instability and cancer.","['Rice, Cory', 'Shastrula, Prashanth Krishna', 'Kossenkov, Andrew V', 'Hills, Robert', 'Baird, Duncan M', 'Showe, Louise C', 'Doukov, Tzanko', 'Janicki, Susan', 'Skordalakes, Emmanuel']","['Rice C', 'Shastrula PK', 'Kossenkov AV', 'Hills R', 'Baird DM', 'Showe LC', 'Doukov T', 'Janicki S', 'Skordalakes E']","['The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff CF10 3AT, UK.', 'The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA.', 'The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce St, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20170410,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,PMC5394233,,,,2017/04/11 06:00,2018/11/10 06:00,['2017/04/11 06:00'],"['2016/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms14928 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms14928 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2017 Apr 10;8:14928. doi: 10.1038/ncomms14928.,,20181109,,"['0 (ACD protein, human)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (POT1 protein, human)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tripeptidyl-Peptidase 1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.14.9 (TPP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Calorimetry', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tripeptidyl-Peptidase 1']","['R01 CA201312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA211199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM088332/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 GM103393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until now there are no other studies on this topic available in Hungary. AIM: Detailed analysis of epidemiologic features of patients with Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders was carried out. METHOD: During a 33-year period (between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 2015) 4523 adult patients with hematologic malignancies were recorded in the leukaemia/lymphoma registry of Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county. Among them, 255 patients with polycytaemia vera, 102 with primary myelofibrosis, and 331 with essential thrombocytaemia were registered. RESULTS: The incidence of polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county showed an increasing tendency, with an overall incidence rate of 1.35 and 1.75/100 000 inhabitants/year, respectively; while the incidence of primary myelofibrosis decreased in the course of years (0.54/100 000 inhabitants/year). In cases of polycythaemia vera and primary myelofibrosis the male:female ratio was found to be equal, however essential thrombocythaemia showed a female dominance. The mean age of patients with polycythaemia vera was 65 (21-95) years, similar to essential thrombocythaemia with 65 (19-85) years, and to primary myelofibrosis with 65.5 (33-84) years. There were only two villages found in this county where the occurrence of patients with Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders per one thousand inhabitants was significantly higher, than the average (1.22). In every familial cases of these, the manifestation of the disease in the second and the third generations became earlier than in the first genetration. The perceived average degree of the anteposition (anticipation) was found to be 22 years. CONCLUSION: The epidemiologic features of Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county are essentially similar to data published in the literature. Orv.

The cells of origin of these small B-cell lymphomas are distinct, as are the characteristic chromosomal lesions and clinical courses. One shared feature is retention of expression of surface immunoglobulin. Analysis of this critical receptor reveals the point of differentiation reached by the cell of origin. Additionally, the sequence patterns of the immunoglobulin-variable domains can indicate a role for stimulants of the B-cell receptor before, during and after malignant transformation. The pathways driven via the B-cell receptor are now being targeted by specific kinase inhibitors with exciting clinical effects. To consider routes to pathogenesis, potentially offering earlier intervention, or to identify causative factors, genetic tools are being used to track pretransformation events and the early phases in lymphomagenesis. These methods are revealing that chromosomal changes are only one of the many steps involved, and that the influence of surrounding cells, probably multiple and variable according to tissue location, is required, both to establish tumours and to maintain growth and survival. Similarly, the influence of the tumour microenvironment may protect malignant cells from eradication by treatment, and the resulting minimal residual disease will eventually give rise to relapse. The common and different features of the four lymphomas will be summarized to show how normal B lymphocytes can be subverted to generate tumours, how these tumours evolve and how their weaknesses can be attacked by targeted therapies.","['Ghia, P', 'Nadel, B', 'Sander, B', 'Stamatopoulos, K', 'Stevenson, F K']","['Ghia P', 'Nadel B', 'Sander B', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Stevenson FK']","['Division of Experimental Oncology, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Pathology, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170410,England,J Intern Med,Journal of internal medicine,8904841,,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*follicular lymphoma', '*lymphomagenesis', '*mantle cell lymphoma', '*microenvironment', '*splenic marginal zone lymphoma']",,2017/04/11 06:00,2017/11/07 06:00,['2017/04/11 06:00'],"['2017/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/joim.12608 [doi]'],ppublish,J Intern Med. 2017 Nov;282(5):395-414. doi: 10.1111/joim.12608.

This study investigated the role of SIRT6 in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Data of 391 PTC patients was extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to investigate the expression of SIRTs (SIRT17) and their relationship with clinicopathological parameters. Additional 45 pairs of PTC tumor tissues and corresponding nontumor tissues were studied using microarray analysis for SIRT6 expression. Surgically resected, pathologically diagnosed tissues from 130 inhouse PTC patients were used for confirmation of SIRT6 expression. SIRT6 silenced K1 and TPC1 cells were generated to explore the influence of SIRT6 on cancer cell aggressiveness in vitro. SIRT6 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in PTC tumor tissues and its overexpression was an independent biomarker for nodal metastasis (odds ratio=1.794, 95% confidence interval: 1.2561.920, p=0.012). SIRT6 expression was related to poor recurrencefree survival, however, not significantly. Silencing SIRT6 downregulated PTC cell aggressiveness in vitro by suppressing ERK and Mcl1. In conclusion, these results suggest that SIRT6 enhances cell aggressiveness in PTC via BRAF/ERK/Mcl1 pathway, and thus may be a promising target in the treatment of the disease.","['Qu, Ning', 'Hu, Jia-Qian', 'Liu, Liang', 'Zhang, Ting-Ting', 'Sun, Guo-Hua', 'Shi, Rong-Liang', 'Ji, Qing-Hai']","['Qu N', 'Hu JQ', 'Liu L', 'Zhang TT', 'Sun GH', 'Shi RL', 'Ji QH']","['Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, P.R.

The application of iPS in these fields requires the development of suitable animal models. Of the suitable species, guinea pigs are particularly important and offer significant advantages. Successful iPS generation has been accomplished in a number of species; however, it has not been reported in the guinea pig. The present study successfully generated iPS from guinea pigs (giPS) using single polycistronic virus transduction with mouse octamerbinding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), sex determining region Ybox 2 (Sox2), Kruppellike factor 4 and cMyc. The giPS cell lines were cultured in media containing leukemia inhibitory factor and guinea pig fibroblast cells were used as feeder cells. These cultures were expanded under feederfree culture conditions using ESGRO Complete Plus Clonal Grade medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum on gelatincoated dishes. The resultant cells had a normal karyotype, exhibited alkaline phosphatase activity and expressed the pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. The cells differentiated in vivo to form teratomas that contained all three germ layers of the tissue cells. The generation of giPS may facilitate future studies investigating the mechanisms underlying innate immunity, particularly for tuberculosis. These experiments provide proof of principle that iPS technology may be adapted to use the guinea pig as a model of human diseases.","['Wu, Yuehong', 'Li, Ouyang', 'He, Chengwen', 'Li, Yong', 'Li, Min', 'Liu, Xiaoming Liu', 'Wang, Yujiong', 'He, Yulong']","['Wu Y', 'Li O', 'He C', 'Li Y', 'Li M', 'Liu XL', 'Wang Y', 'He Y']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Science, Zhejiang SciTech University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310018, P.R.

However, this body of preclinical work has not been translated into clinical use. Key issues around this failure can be related to narrow dose effects, the cell model used and incomplete efficacy. A model of acute lymphoblastic disease, the Jurkat T cell line, has been used extensively to study the cannabinoid system in the immune system and cannabinoid-induced apoptosis. Using these cells, this study sought to investigate the outcome of those remaining viable cells post-treatment with cannabidiol, both in terms of cell size and tracking any subsequent recovery. The phosphorylation status of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and the downstream target ribosomal protein S6, were measured. The ability of cannabidiol to exert its effect on cell viability was also evaluated in physiological oxygen conditions. Cannabidiol reduced cell viability incompletely, and slowed the cell cycle with fewer cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Cannabidiol reduced phosphorylation of mTOR, PKB and S6 pathways related to survival and cell size. The remaining population of viable cells that were cultured in nutrient rich conditions post-treatment were able to proliferate, but did not recover to control cell numbers. However, the proportion of viable cells that were gated as small, increased in response to cannabidiol and normally sized cells decreased. This proportion of small cells persisted in the recovery period and did not return to basal levels. Finally, cells grown in 12% oxygen (physiological normoxia) were more resistant to cannabidiol. In conclusion, these results indicate that cannabidiol causes a reduction in cell size, which persists post-treatment. However, resistance to cannabidiol under physiological normoxia for these cells would imply that cannabidiol may not be useful in the clinic as an anti-leukemic agent.","['Kalenderoglou, Nikoletta', 'Macpherson, Tara', 'Wright, Karen L']","['Kalenderoglou N', 'Macpherson T', 'Wright KL']","['Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medicine Lancaster University Lancaster, UK.', 'Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medicine Lancaster University Lancaster, UK.', 'Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medicine Lancaster University Lancaster, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170324,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,PMC5364234,['NOTNLM'],"['Jurkat', 'cannabidiol', 'cell size', 'leukaemia', 'physiological normoxia', 'protein kinase B', 'ribosomal protein S6']",,2017/04/11 06:00,2017/04/11 06:01,['2017/04/11 06:00'],"['2016/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2017.00144 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2017 Mar 24;8:144. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2017.00144. eCollection 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploring the host-HTLV-1 interactions and the molecular mechanisms underlying HTLV-1-mediated tumorigenesis is critical for developing efficient therapies against the viral infection and associated leukemia/lymphoma. It has been demonstrated to date that several HTLV-1 proteins play key roles in the cellular transformation and immortalization of infected T lymphocytes. Of note, the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax inhibits the innate IFN response through interaction with MAVS, STING and RIP1, causing the suppression of TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of IRF3/IRF7. The HTLV-1 protein HBZ disrupts genomic integrity and inhibits apoptosis and autophagy of the target cells. Furthermore, it is revealed that HBZ enhances the proliferation of ATL cells and facilitates evasion of the infected cells from immunosurveillance. These studies provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which HTLV-1 mediates the formation of cancer as well as useful strategies for the development of new therapeutic interventions against ATL. In this article, we review the recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis, the underlying mechanisms, clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease caused by HTLV-1 infection.

However, little is known about its functions in embryonic stem cells (ESC). Here, we report that PML contributes to ESC self-renewal maintenance by controlling cell-cycle progression and sustaining the expression of crucial pluripotency factors. Transcriptomic analysis and gain- or loss-of-function approaches showed that PML-deficient ESC exhibit morphological, metabolic, and growth properties distinct to naive and closer to the primed pluripotent state. During differentiation of embryoid bodies, PML influences cell-fate decisions between mesoderm and endoderm by controlling the expression of Tbx3. PML loss compromises the reprogramming ability of embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells by inhibiting the transforming growth factor beta pathway at the very early stages. Collectively, these results designate PML as a member of the regulatory network for ESC naive pluripotency and somatic cell reprogramming.","['Hadjimichael, Christiana', 'Chanoumidou, Konstantina', 'Nikolaou, Christoforos', 'Klonizakis, Antonios', 'Theodosi, Gesthimani-Ioanna', 'Makatounakis, Takis', 'Papamatheakis, Joseph', 'Kretsovali, Androniki']","['Hadjimichael C', 'Chanoumidou K', 'Nikolaou C', 'Klonizakis A', 'Theodosi GI', 'Makatounakis T', 'Papamatheakis J', 'Kretsovali A']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Crete 70013, Greece.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Crete 70013, Greece; Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Democritus University of Thrace, Dragana, Alexandroupolis, Evros 68100, Greece.', 'Department of Biology, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete 71409, Greece.', 'Department of Biology, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete 71409, Greece.', 'Department of Biology, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete 71409, Greece.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Crete 70013, Greece.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Crete 70013, Greece.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Crete 70013, Greece.

In order to test its effects on the immune system, human and mouse macrophage-like cell lines were treated with nontoxic doses of NaN3 and the changes in LPS-induced inflammatory activation was measured. Interestingly, the LPS-induced expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 was suppressed by NaN3 without affecting the expression of IL-8 and TNF-alpha. Further analysis of cellular signaling mediators involved in the expression of these cytokines revealed that NaN3 suppressed the LPS-induced activation of signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) varsigma, which are involved in the LPS-induced expression of MCP-1, while the LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) was not affected. The LPS-induced expression of MCP-2 and CXCL10, which are also regulated by STAT1, was suppressed by NaN3. Similarly, the LPS-induced expression of IL-6, which is regulated by IkappaBzeta, was suppressed by NaN3. These results demonstrate that NaN3 selectively suppresses the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators through the suppression of STAT1 and IkappaBzeta activation. These new findings about the activity of NaN3 may contribute to the development of specific regulators of macrophage activity during acute and chronic inflammation.","['Park, Cho-Yi', 'Heo, Jae-Nyoung', 'Suk, Kyoungho', 'Lee, Won-Ha']","['Park CY', 'Heo JN', 'Suk K', 'Lee WH']","['School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Brain Science & Engineering Institute, BK21 Plus KNU Biomedical Convergence Program, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu 41944, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea.

This study explored LSC-related antigens expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its prognosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 156 cases of AML patients were enrolled in the experiment. The expression of CD33, CD96, and DAPK in CD34+CD38-CD123+ LSC were tested by flow cytometry. The survival curve was established using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Among different subtypes of AML, the positive rate of CD33 was M3> M5> M1> M2> M4; for CD96 it was M5> M4> M2> M3> M1; and for DAPK it was M3> M2> M5> M4> M1. After chemotherapy, the response rate in CD33 and CD96 high expression groups, and DAPK low expression group was significantly lower than the groups with CD33 low expression, CD96 low expression, and DAPK high expression. The median survival time in the CD33 high expression group was markedly lower than the CD33 low expression group (36.5 months). The CD96 high expression group exhibited obviously shorter median survival time than the CD96 low expression group. The DAPK high expression group exhibited longer median survival time than the DAPK low expression group. CONCLUSIONS CD33 and CD96 overexpression, and DAPK downregulation in the LSC of AML patients were associated with poor chemotherapy effect and prognosis, and higher recurrence rate.","['Jiang, Yongfang', 'Xu, Ping', 'Yao, Dandan', 'Chen, Xi', 'Dai, Haibin']","['Jiang Y', 'Xu P', 'Yao D', 'Chen X', 'Dai H']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170409,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,PMC5395139,,,,2017/04/10 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2017/04/10 06:00'],"['2017/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['900305 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.900305 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2017 Apr 9;23:1725-1732. doi: 10.12659/msm.900305.,,20170630,,"['0 (ADGRE5 protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism of EVI1-mediated leukemogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Previously, by characterizing the EVI1 promoter, we have shown that RUNX1 and ELK1 directly regulate EVI1 transcription. Intriguingly, bioinformatic analysis of the EVI1 promoter region identified the presence of several EVI1 potential binding sites. Thus, we hypothesized that EVI1 could bind to these sites regulating its own transcription. In this study, we show that there is a functional interaction between EVI1 and its promoter, and that the different EVI1 isoforms (EVI1-145kDa, EVI1-Delta324 and MDS1-EVI1) regulate the transcription of EVI1 transcripts through distinct promoter regions. Moreover, we determine that the EVI1-145kDa isoform activates EVI1 transcription, whereas EVI1-Delta324 and MDS1-EVI1 act as repressors. Finally, we demonstrate that these EVI1 isoforms are involved in cell transformation; functional experiments show that EVI1-145kDa prolongs the maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells; conversely, MDS1-EVI1 repressed hematopoietic stem and progenitor colony replating capacity. We demonstrate for the first time that EVI1 acts as a regulator of its own expression, highlighting the complex regulation of EVI1, and open new directions to better understand the mechanisms of EVI1 overexpressing leukemias.","['Maicas, Miren', 'Vazquez, Iria', 'Alis, Rafael', 'Marcotegui, Nerea', 'Urquiza, Leire', 'Cortes-Lavaud, Xabier', 'Cristobal, Ion', 'Garcia-Sanchez, Maria A', 'Odero, Maria D']","['Maicas M', 'Vazquez I', 'Alis R', 'Marcotegui N', 'Urquiza L', 'Cortes-Lavaud X', 'Cristobal I', 'Garcia-Sanchez MA', 'Odero MD']","['Program of Hematology-Oncology, CIMA, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.

Different profiles of the lncRNAs were assayed and validated in overexpressing p63 SiHa cells (SiHa/DeltaNp63alpha) and the control cell lines (SiHa/pCon). ENST00000422259, ENST00000447565 (Lnc-LIF-AS) and ENST00000469965, together with their related antisense mRNA DPYD (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, a pyrimidine catabolic pathway gene), LIF (leukemia inhibitor factor) and FLNC (filamin C) were all notably differentially expressed in both DeltaNp63alpha overexpression cells and knockdown cells. Here, we illustrated that DeltaNp63alpha can inhibit the levels of LIF mRNA by direct transcription regulation and decrease LIF mRNA stability by suppressing the expression of Lnc-LIF-AS.

While the primary drugs used in the maintenance phase, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and methotrexate (MTX), are necessary for decreasing risk of relapse, they also have potentially serious toxicities, including myelosuppression, which may be life-threatening, and gastrointestinal toxicity. For both drugs, pharmacogenomic factors have been identified that could explain a large amount of the variance in toxicity between patients, and may serve as effective predictors of toxicity during the maintenance phase of ALL treatment. 6-MP toxicity is associated with polymorphisms in the genes encoding thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15), and potentially inosine triphosphatase (ITPA), which vary between ethnic groups. Moreover, MTX toxicity is associated with polymorphisms in genes encoding solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Additional polymorphisms potentially associated with toxicities for MTX have also been identified, including those in the genes encoding solute carrier family 19 member 1 (SLC19A1) and thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), but their contributions have not yet been well quantified. It is clear that pharmacogenomics should be incorporated as a dosage-calibrating tool in pediatric ALL treatment in order to predict and minimize the occurrence of serious toxicities for these patients.","['Rudin, Shoshana', 'Marable, Marcus', 'Huang, R Stephanie']","['Rudin S', 'Marable M', 'Huang RS']","['Biological Sciences Division, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Biological Sciences Division, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.

A largely unexplained role in these regulatory mechanisms is played by the spatial organization of the genome in the cell nucleus which has far-reaching functional consequences for gene regulation. Until recently, it appeared to be impossible to study this problem on the nanoscale by light microscopy. However, novel developments in optical imaging technology have radically surpassed the limited resolution of conventional far-field fluorescence microscopy (ca. 200nm). After a brief review of available super-resolution microscopy (SRM) methods, we focus on a specific SRM approach to study nuclear genome structure at the single cell/single molecule level, Spectral Precision Distance/Position Determination Microscopy (SPDM). SPDM, a variant of localization microscopy, makes use of conventional fluorescent proteins or single standard organic fluorophores in combination with standard (or only slightly modified) specimen preparation conditions; in its actual realization mode, the same laser frequency can be used for both photoswitching and fluorescence read out. Presently, the SPDM method allows us to image nuclear genome organization in individual cells down to few tens of nanometer (nm) of structural resolution, and to perform quantitative analyses of individual small chromatin domains; of the nanoscale distribution of histones, chromatin remodeling proteins, and transcription, splicing and repair related factors. As a biomedical research application, using dual-color SPDM, it became possible to monitor in mouse cardiomyocyte cells quantitatively the effects of ischemia conditions on the chromatin nanostructure (DNA). These novel ""molecular optics"" approaches open an avenue to study the nuclear landscape directly in individual cells down to the single molecule level and thus to test models of functional genome architecture at unprecedented resolution.","['Cremer, Christoph', 'Szczurek, Aleksander', 'Schock, Florian', 'Gourram, Amine', 'Birk, Udo']","['Cremer C', 'Szczurek A', 'Schock F', 'Gourram A', 'Birk U']","['Superresolution Microscopy, Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz, Germany; Department of Physics, University of Mainz (JGU), Mainz, Germany; Institute for Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology (IPMB), and Kirchhoff Institute for Physics (KIP), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

Here we developed a strategy based on isotope labeling combined with liquid chromatography-double precursor ion scan-mass spectrometry (IL-LC-DPIS-MS) analysis for comprehensive profiling and relative quantitation of carbonyl compounds in human serum. First, we chose labeling reagents (2-(2-hydrazinyl-2-oxoethyl)isoquinolin-2-ium bromide, HIQB; N,N,N-triethyl-2-hydrazinyl-2-oxoethanaminium bromide, THB; Girard reagent T, GT; Girard reagent P, GP), all of which contain reactive group, isotopically labeled moiety and ionizable group to selectively label carbonyl compounds. Since HIQB labeling offered the best detection sensitivities for carbonyl compounds among these labeling reagents, we used HIQB and the corresponding isotope-labeled reagent of d7-HIQB as the optimal isotope-labeled reagent. The HIQB and d7-HIQB labeled carbonyl compounds can generate two characteristic product ions of m/z 130.1/137.1 under collision-induced dissociation (CID), which contain an isotope tag and therefore were used for double precursor ion scans in mass spectrometry analysis. Using this strategy, 156 carbonyl compounds candidates were detected in human serum, 12 of which were further identified by commercial standards. Subsequently, a targeted method using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection mode was developed for relative quantification of carbonyl compounds in human serum from myelogenous leukemia (ML) patients and healthy controls. As a result, 44 carbonyl compounds were found to have significant difference between ML patients and healthy controls, suggesting that these carbonyl compounds may play certain roles in ML and also can serve as indicators for ML. Taken together, the isotope labeling combined with tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated to be a powerful strategy for identification and quantification of carbonyl compounds in serum samples.","['Guo, Ning', 'Peng, Chun-Yan', 'Zhu, Quan-Fei', 'Yuan, Bi-Feng', 'Feng, Yu-Qi']","['Guo N', 'Peng CY', 'Zhu QF', 'Yuan BF', 'Feng YQ']","['Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, PR China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taihe Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan 442000, Hubei, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (Ministry of Education), Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, PR China.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We correlated the cytogenetic, molecular and clinico-pathological findings of patients with 8q24 translocations seen in the Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, from January 2003 to December 2015. RESULTS: There were 34 patients with 8q24 translocations (31, ALL and three myeloma). The t(8;14) was seen in 25 patients, t(8;22) in seven and t(2;8) in two. The salient findings were as follows: 85% males; 79% adults, median age 37 years; L3 morphology in 61%; mature B immunophenotype in 77%; extra-medullary disease in 41%; additional abnormalities in 28 (85%), notably, structural abnormalities of chromosome 1q (41%) and 13q (9%) and monosomy 13 (15%); complex karyotypes in 68%. There were two double-hit lymphoma/leukemia, one with a t(14;18)(q32;q21) and the other with a t(3;14)(q27;q11.2), associated with nodal high grade B cell lymphoma and dermal leukemic infiltrates respectively. Only 13 samples were processed for DNA PCR and all these samples were positive for MYC-IgH (c-gamma type) rearrangement. Only in one patient, in addition to c-gamma, c-alpha rearrangement was also detected.

Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) B-ALL is a subtype that expresses the Bcr-Abl fusion protein which represents a negative prognostic factor. Constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) network is a common feature of B-ALL, influencing cell growth and survival. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of PI3K isoform inhibition in B-ALL cell lines harboring the Bcr-Abl fusion protein.We studied the effects of anti Bcr-Abl drugs Imatinib, Nilotinib and GZD824 associated with PI3K isoform inhibitors. We used a panel of six compounds which specifically target PI3K isoforms including the pan-PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474, p110alpha BYL719 inhibitor and the dual p110gamma/p110delta inhibitor IPI145. The effects of single drugs and of several drug combinations were analyzed to assess cytotoxicity by MTS assays, apoptosis and autophagy by flow cytometry and Western blot, as well as the phosphorylation status of the pathway.ZSTK474, BYL719 and IPI145 administered in combination with imatinib, nilotinib and GZD824 for 48 h, decreased cell viability, induced apoptosis and autophagy in a marked synergistic manner.These findings suggest that selected PI3K isoform inhibitors used in combination with anti Bcr-Abl drugs may be an attractive novel therapeutic intervention in Ph+ B-ALL.","['Ultimo, Simona', 'Simioni, Carolina', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Celeghini, Claudio', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Marisi, Giorgia', 'Ulivi, Paola', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Neri, Luca M']","['Ultimo S', 'Simioni C', 'Martelli AM', 'Zauli G', 'Evangelisti C', 'Celeghini C', 'McCubrey JA', 'Marisi G', 'Ulivi P', 'Capitani S', 'Neri LM']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, National Research Council, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'LTTA Center, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5410298,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'PI3K isoforms', 'Ph+ B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'autophagy', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,2017/04/09 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2017/04/09 06:00'],"['2016/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['15542 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15542 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 4;8(14):23213-23227. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15542.,,20180112,,"['0', '(3-((1H-pyrazolo(3,4-b)pyridin-5-yl)ethynyl)-4-methyl-N-(4-((4-methylpiperazin-1-', 'yl)methyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)benzamide)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Triazines)', '0 (ZSTK474)', '08W5N2C97Q (Alpelisib)', '610V23S0JI (duvelisib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Isoquinolines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Purines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Triazines/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, Stat5 deletion surprisingly amplified FLT3/ITD+ myeloid expansion or Myc-driven lymphoid expansion. Here we show that Stat5 deficiency has a strong impact upon transcriptional heterogeneity in single sorted c-Kit+Lin-Sca-1+ (KLS) cells or CD150+CD48- KLS long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC). Single cell polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on selected regulators of multi-lineage hematopoiesis. At least two dominant sub-populations were identified by increased expression of cell cycle regulatory and leukemia-associated genes. Furthermore, in the top expressing quartile of cells, the majority of genes were proportionally overrepresented. In wild-type KLS cells, Stat5 mRNA levels were also strongly correlated with several genes. Since heterogeneity decreases with age or inflammatory or oncogenic stress, these results provide a potential mechanistic linkage to Stat5 expression.","['Wang, Zhengqi', 'Bunting, Kevin D']","['Wang Z', 'Bunting KD']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5410237,['NOTNLM'],"['hematopoiesis', 'leukemogenesis', 'single-cell gene expression analysis', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptional heterogeneity']",,2017/04/09 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2017/04/09 06:00'],"['2017/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['15236 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15236 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 4;8(14):22477-22482. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15236.,,20180112,,['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",['R01 DK059380/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the role of miR-1193 in the proliferation and invasion of T-cell leukemia cells was explored. First, we found that miR-1193 was sharply downregulated in T-cell leukemia cells when compared with normal T cells. miR-1193 markedly decreased the proliferation and invasion in Jurkat human T-cell leukemia cells. Transmembrane 9 superfamily 3 (TM9SF3) was then predicted to be a potential target gene of miR-1193, the levels of which displayed a strongly negative correlation with miR-1193 levels in T-cell leukemia patients. We confirmed that TM9SF3 was a target gene of miR-1193 by luciferase reporter gene assay. Finally, gene overexpression and knockdown experiments in Jurkat cells revealed that TM9SF3 positively regulated cell proliferation and invasion.","['Shen, Liyun', 'Du, Xingjun', 'Ma, Hongyan', 'Mei, Shunxi']","['Shen L', 'Du X', 'Ma H', 'Mei S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170330,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,PMC7841265,,,,2017/04/09 06:00,2018/03/02 06:00,['2017/04/09 06:00'],"['2017/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/096504017X14908284471361 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2017 Nov 2;25(9):1643-1651. doi: 10.3727/096504017X14908284471361.

However, most treated patients will relapse and require subsequent therapy. This review focuses on recent advances in the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL. Until recently, treatment options for relapsed CLL were of limited efficacy. Retreatment with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) was recommended for patients with a durable response to first-line FCR, although acquired genetic aberrations, impaired marrow reserve, and comorbidities often made this suboptimal therapy for many patients. New options include two agents targeting B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways (ibrutinib and idelalisib) and a B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor (venetoclax). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains a potentially curative option for younger patients with a suitable donor.","['Shustik, C', 'Bence-Bruckler, I', 'Delage, R', 'Owen, C J', 'Toze, C L', 'Coutre, S']","['Shustik C', 'Bence-Bruckler I', 'Delage R', 'Owen CJ', 'Toze CL', 'Coutre S']","['McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. chaim.shustik@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Hematology, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, BC Cancer Agency and The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170407,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,PMC5486803,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'HSCT', 'Ibrutinib', 'Idelalisib', 'Venetoclax']",,2017/04/09 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2017/04/09 06:00'],"['2016/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-017-2982-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-017-2982-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Jul;96(7):1185-1196. doi: 10.1007/s00277-017-2982-1.

ML-DS blast cells ex vivo have increased sensitivity to cytarabine (araC) and daunorubicin, suggesting that optimizing drug dosing may improve outcomes while reducing toxicity. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) AAML0431 trial consisted of 4 cycles of induction and 2 cycles of intensification therapy based on the treatment schema of the previous COG A2971 trial with several modifications. High-dose araC (HD-araC) was used in the second induction cycle instead of the intensification cycle, and 1 of 4 daunorubicin-containing induction cycles was eliminated. For 204 eligible patients, 5-year EFS was 89.9% and overall survival (OS) was 93.0%. The 5-year OS for 17 patients with refractory/relapsed leukemia was 34.3%. We determined the clinical significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) levels as measured by flow cytometry on day 28 of induction I. MRD measurements, available for 146 of the 204 patients, were highly predictive of treatment outcome; 5-year disease-free survival for MRD-negative patients (n = 125) was 92.7% vs 76.2% for MRD-positive patients (n = 21) (log-rank P = .011). Our results indicated that earlier use of HD-araC led to better EFS and OS in AAML0431 than in past COG studies. A 25% reduction in the cumulative daunorubicin dose did not impact outcome. MRD, identified as a new prognostic factor for ML-DS patients, can be used for risk stratification in future clinical trials.

A few studies reported good correlations between signals from tumor tissues and CTCs or cfDNAs, making it possible to detect cancers using CTCs and cfDNAs. However, the detection cannot tell which cancer types the person has. To meet these challenges, we developed an algorithm, eTumorType, to identify cancer types based on copy number variations (CNVs) of the cancer founding clone. eTumorType integrates cancer hallmark concepts and a few computational techniques such as stochastic gradient boosting, voting, centroid, and leading patterns. eTumorType has been trained and validated on a large dataset including 18 common cancer types and 5327 tumor samples. eTumorType produced high accuracies (0.86-0.96) and high recall rates (0.79-0.92) for predicting colon, brain, prostate, and kidney cancers. In addition, relatively high accuracies (0.78-0.92) and recall rates (0.58-0.95) have also been achieved for predicting ovarian, breast luminal, lung, endometrial, stomach, head and neck, leukemia, and skin cancers. These results suggest that eTumorType could be used for non-invasive diagnosis to determine cancer types based on CNVs of CTCs and cfDNAs.","['Zou, Jinfeng', 'Wang, Edwin']","['Zou J', 'Wang E']","['National Research Council Canada, Montreal, QC H4P 2R2, Canada.', ""National Research Council Canada, Montreal, QC H4P 2R2, Canada; Department of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 2B2, Canada; Center for Bioinformatics, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3G 0B1, Canada; Center for Health Genomics and Informatics, University of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, University of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; Department of Medical Genetics, University of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; Department of Oncology, University of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Research Institute, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; O'Brien Institute for Public Health, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada.

In this study, it was shown that miR-125b expression level decreased in response to 1alpha, 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (1,25D3) in a dose- and time-dependent manner and miR-125b blocked 1,25D3-induced monocytic differentiation of U937 cells. In addition, miR-125b decreased mRNA expression of myelomonocytic differentiation markers, including CD11c, CD18 and CD64 and arrested the cell cycle at the S phase in U937 and HL60 cells. Fes was identified as a novel direct target of miR-125b and miR-125b could also reduce the expression levels of PU.1 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (MCSFR). Furthermore, Fes was found to be involved in monocytic differentiation via upregulation of PU.1 and MCSFR and Fes siRNA could also inhibit 1,25D3-induced monocytic differentiation of U937 and HL60 cells and decrease mRNA expression of CD11c, CD18 and CD64. Importantly, the inhibition of Fes siRNA on 1,25D3-induced monocytic differentiation could be rescued by transfection with miR-125b inhibitor. Our data highlights an important role of miR-125b in AML progression, implying the potential application of miR-125b in AML therapy.","['Hu, Jinhang', 'Zheng, Lufeng', 'Shen, Xiao', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Li, Cheng', 'Xi, Tao']","['Hu J', 'Zheng L', 'Shen X', 'Zhang Y', 'Li C', 'Xi T']","[""School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China.

Their potential as a predictive biomarker for outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in hematologic malignancies is still unclear. From the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research we randomly selected 536 acute leukemia patients from those who underwent myeloablative 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated donor HCT between 2005 and 2012 and who had an available pre-HCT blood sample in the repository. Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. We used Kaplan-Meier and competing risk estimators to calculate survival probability and cumulative incidence, respectively, across patient RTL tertiles. Cox proportional hazard regression was used for adjusted analyses. The study included 396 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 140 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Median age at HCT was 41 years (range, .5 to 66), and median follow-up for survivors was 5.1 years (range, .4 to 8.3). Significant inverse correlations between age and RTL were observed in patients with AML (r = -.44, P < .0001) and ALL (r = -.48, P < .0001). Patients with ALL had longer RTL than those with AML (.48 versus .43, respectively); the difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for patient age (P = .96). Pre-HCT RTL in acute leukemia patients was not statistically significantly associated with overall survival (HR for longest RTL compared with shortest, .91; 95% CI, .65 to 1.28), disease-free survival (HR, .90; 95% CI, .64 to 1.25), transplant-related mortality (HR, .97; 95% CI, .60 to 1.59), incidence of relapse (HR, .89; 95% CI, .56 to 1.40), neutrophil engraftment (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, .85 to 1.32), or grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, .81 to 1.53), grades III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (HR, .92; 95% CI, .54 to 1.59), and chronic graft-versus-host disease (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, .81 to 1.50).

In this study, we first expressed MLAA-34 protein in Escherichia coli (E.coli) BL21 (DE3) cells and purified it by nickel ion affinity chromatography with high purity (>90%). Then, MLAA-34 was used as antigen for biopanning anti-MLAA-34 single chain antibody fragment (ScFv) from a fully human ScFv library, and a high affinity ScFv named MA1 was selected by phage-ELISA. Finally, after expression of MA1, we found that MA1 can specifically bind with U937 MLAA-34 positive cells, and the binding affinity of MA1 was at the nanomolar level. Furthermore, inhibition of U937 cell proliferation indicated that the novel antibody MA1 has the potential to be used as a therapeutic agent for acute monocytic leukemia.","['Zhang, Yang', 'Zhang, Pengyu', 'He, Aili', 'Yang, Yun', 'Wang, Jianli', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Zhang, Wanggang']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhang P', 'He A', 'Yang Y', 'Wang J', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang W']","[""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710004, P.R.

The important roles of the PI3K/Akt pathway in modulating cell proliferation and MDR suggest that PI3K inhibitor might be effective for treatment of AML. In the present study, the antiproliferative effects of PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 on AML cell HL60 and the adriamycin (ADR)-resistant HL60/ADR cells were investigated. Our data indicated that ZSTK474 exhibited potent antiproliferative activity, induced G1 cell cycle arrest, but no obvious apoptosis in both cell lines. Moreover, ZSTK474 affected the protein levels of cell-cycle-related molecules including increased p27, decreased cyclin D1 and phosphorylated Rb in dose-dependent manner. The proteins downstream of PI3K including phosphorylated PDK1, Akt and GSK-3beta were reduced in a dose-dependent manner after ZSTK474 treatment. ZSTK474 reversed ADR resistance, increased the intracellular accumulation of ADR, and reduced the expression and function of multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins including both P-gp and MRP1 in HL60/ADR cells. The combination of ZSTK474 and chemotherapeutic drugs cytarabine or vincristine led to a synergistic effect in HL60 and HL60/ADR cells. In conclusion, ZSTK474 showed potent antiproliferative effect on HL60 and HL60/ADR cells; combination with cytarabine or vincristine resulted in synergistic effect. Our results suggest ZSTK474 has the potential to be applied in the treatment of AML patients, while further evidences particularly those about in vivo efficacy are needed.","['Zhou, Qianxiang', 'Chen, Yali', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Zhong, Yuxu', 'Zhang, Zhe', 'Wang, Ran', 'Jin, Meihua', 'Gong, Min', 'Qiu, Yuling', 'Kong, Dexin']","['Zhou Q', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang L', 'Zhong Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Wang R', 'Jin M', 'Gong M', 'Qiu Y', 'Kong D']","['Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Research Center of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5503595,['NOTNLM'],"['HL60/ADR', 'PI3K', 'ZSTK474', 'drug combination', 'resistance']",,2017/04/08 06:00,2018/04/19 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2016/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['16589 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16589 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 13;8(24):39064-39076. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16589.,,20180418,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Triazines)', '0 (ZSTK474)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Triazines/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nuclear transporter exportin-1 (XPO1) is highly expressed in MCL and is associated with its pathogenesis. mTOR signaling, a central regulator of cell metabolism, is frequently activated in MCL and is also an important therapeutic target in this cancer. This study investigated the antitumor effects and molecular/metabolic changes induced by the combination of the small-molecule selective inhibitor XPO1 inhibitor KPT-185 and the dual mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitor AZD-2014 on MCL cells. AZD-2014 enhanced the KPT-185-induced inhibition of cell growth and repression of cell viability. The combination of KPT-185 and AZD-2014 downregulated c-Myc and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) with its target heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). As a consequence, the combination caused repression of ribosomal biogenesis demonstrated by iTRAQ proteomic analyses. Metabolite assay by CETOF-MS showed that AZD-2014 enhanced the KPT-185-induced repression of MCL cellular energy metabolism through the TCA (Krebs) cycle, and further repressed KPT-185-caused upregulation of glycolysis.Thus the simultaneous inhibition of XPO1 and mTOR signaling is a novel and promising strategy targeting prosurvival metabolism in MCL.","['Sekihara, Kazumasa', 'Saitoh, Kaori', 'Han, Lina', 'Ciurea, Stefan', 'Yamamoto, Shinichi', 'Kikkawa, Mika', 'Kazuno, Saiko', 'Taka, Hikari', 'Kaga, Naoko', 'Arai, Hajime', 'Miida, Takashi', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Tabe, Yoko']","['Sekihara K', 'Saitoh K', 'Han L', 'Ciurea S', 'Yamamoto S', 'Kikkawa M', 'Kazuno S', 'Taka H', 'Kaga N', 'Arai H', 'Miida T', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M', 'Tabe Y']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Leading Center for the Development and Research of Cancer Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Leading Center for the Development and Research of Cancer Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Proteomics and Biomolecular Science, Research Support Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Proteomics and Biomolecular Science, Research Support Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Proteomics and Biomolecular Science, Research Support Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Proteomics and Biomolecular Science, Research Support Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Proteomics and Biomolecular Science, Research Support Center, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Next Genertion Hematology Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5470990,['NOTNLM'],"['XPO1', 'mTORC1/2', 'mantle cell lymphoma', 'metabolism', 'selective inhibitor of nuclear export']",,2017/04/08 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2016/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['16602 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16602 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 23;8(21):34552-34564. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16602.,,20180309,,"['0 (Acrylates)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (KPT-185)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '0BSC3P4H5X (vistusertib)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acrylates/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Proteome/*drug effects', 'Proteomics', 'Pyrimidines', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology']","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['Oncotarget. 2019 Nov 26;10(63):6842.

Treatment with both DFX or DAC promoted apoptosis, induced cell cycle arrest, and inhibited proliferation in all three of these cell lines. The combination of DFX and DAC was much greater than the effect of using either drug alone. DFX showed a synergistic effect with DAC on cell apoptosis in all three cell lines and on cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in K-562 cells. DFX decreased the ROS levels to varying degrees. In contrast, DAC increased ROS levels and an increase in ROS was also noted when the two drugs were used in combination. Treatment of cells with DAC induced re-expression of ABAT, APAF-1, FADD, HJV, and SMPD3, presumably through demethylation.

Here, we developed a culture medium with polar metabolite concentrations comparable to those of human plasma (human plasma-like medium [HPLM]). Culture in HPLM, relative to that in traditional media, had widespread effects on cellular metabolism, including on the metabolome, redox state, and glucose utilization. Among the most prominent was an inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis-an effect traced to uric acid, which is 10-fold higher in the blood of humans than of mice and other non-primates. We find that uric acid directly inhibits uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS) and consequently reduces the sensitivity of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil.

Further, prognostic factors, cytogenetic anomalies, and compensatory cellular signaling lead to therapy resistance or disease relapse. Therefore, for the past few years, development of targeted therapies is on the rise. PI3K is a major player in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling axis, which is critical for the survival and maintenance of B cells. Duvelisib, a PI3K delta/gamma dual isoform specific inhibitor that induces apoptosis and reduces cytokine and chemokine levels in vitro, holds promise for CLL. Areas covered: Herein, we review PI3K isoforms and their inhibitors in general, and duvelisib in particular; examine literature on preclinical investigations, pharmacokinetics and clinical studies of duvelisib either as single agent or in combination, for patients with CLL and other lymphoid malignancies. Expert opinion: Duvelisib targets the PI3K delta isoform, which is necessary for cell proliferation and survival, and gamma isoform, which is critical for cytokine signaling and pro-inflammatory responses from the microenvironment. In phase I clinical trials, duvelisib as a single agent showed promise for CLL and other lymphoid malignancies. Phase II and III trials of duvelisib alone or in combination with other agents are ongoing.","['Vangapandu, Hima V', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Vangapandu HV', 'Jain N', 'Gandhi V']","['a Department of Experimental Therapeutics , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'b Department of Leukemia , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Experimental Therapeutics , The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170413,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,PMC5584596,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*PI3K', '*duvelisib', '*leukemia', '*therapy']",,2017/04/08 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2017.1312338 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2017 May;26(5):625-632. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2017.1312338.

Cytogenetic lesions such as del13q14, del11q22.3, and del17p13 are identified in 50-60% of patients. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) plays a central role in somatic hyper mutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) and functions on Ig genes, but also target non-Ig genes, and over-expression of AID can lead to point mutations or translocations in non-Ig genes such as IgH/Myc translocation. Dicer and Drosha, which have a role in activation process of miRNA, also act in a double-strand DNA break (DSB) repair mechanism. In this study, whether the changes of AID, Dicer and Drosha expressions may be associated with both deletions and clinical outcomes in patients with CLL were investigated. AID expressions were increased in patients with CLL. However, cell lysate AID protein levels were only increased in patients with del17p or del11q who have poor prognosis. Decreased Dicer expressions were found in patients with deletion, whereas increased Drosha expressions were found in patients without deletion and with del13q. According to Rai and Binet staging systems, advanced-stage patients showed increased AID protein levels, decreased Dicer and Drosha expressions. Our findings may suggest that high AID expression and lower Dicer expression were observed in patients with CLL especially del17p and del11q and might associated with deletions such as del17p and del11q. AID, Dicer, and Drosha expressions might be used as an indicator of prognosis for CLL.","['Gelmez, Metin Yusuf', 'Coskunpinar, Ender', 'Saracoglu, Basak', 'Deniz, Gunnur', 'Aktan, Melih']","['Gelmez MY', 'Coskunpinar E', 'Saracoglu B', 'Deniz G', 'Aktan M']","['a Department of Immunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine (DETAE) , Istanbul University , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'b Division of Medical Genetic, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine , Istanbul University , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'c Division of Hematology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine , Istanbul University , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'a Department of Immunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine (DETAE) , Istanbul University , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'c Division of Hematology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine , Istanbul University , Istanbul , Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170407,England,Immunol Invest,Immunological investigations,8504629,,['NOTNLM'],"['AID', 'CLL', 'Dicer', 'Drosha', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",,2017/04/08 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08820139.2017.1288241 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Invest. 2017 Jul;46(5):433-446. doi: 10.1080/08820139.2017.1288241.

Because blood components originate in bone marrow, it is no surprise that bone marrow is a common location for both primary and metastatic hematologic neoplasms. Findings of hematologic malignancy can be seen with most imaging modalities including radiography, computed tomography (CT), technetium 99m ((99m)Tc) methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scanning, fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Because of the diversity of imaging appearances and clinical behavior of this spectrum of disease, diagnosis can be challenging, and profound understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic changes and current treatment modalities can be daunting. The appearance of normal bone marrow at MR imaging and FDG PET/CT is also varied due to dynamic compositional changes with normal aging and in response to hematologic demand or treatment, which can lead to false-positive interpretation of imaging studies. In this article, the authors review the normal maturation and imaging appearance of bone marrow. Focusing on lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma, they present the spectrum of imaging findings of hematologic malignancy affecting the musculoskeletal system and the current imaging tools available to the radiologist. They discuss the imaging findings of posttreatment bone marrow and review commonly used staging systems and consensus recommendations for appropriate imaging for staging, management, and assessment of clinical remission.

It is currently approved in multiple myeloma (MM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), yet is also clinically active in a host of lymphoproliferative diseases, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Due to its protean effects on the immune system, lenalidomide may be particularly appealing in CLL, which is distinct in its ability to evade immune recognition and cause immunosuppression. Areas covered: This review recaps the biological mechanisms of lenalidomide specific for CLL, and summarizes the clinical data in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL patients, with emphasis on toxicity. Moreover, lenalidomide treatment is put into the context of the highly effective targeted agents that are drastically changing the therapeutic approach in CLL. Expert opinion: Lenalidomide is a potent drug in CLL, both in first line and relapse. However, in comparison to other newly available agents, lenalidomide has slow onset of efficacy and notable toxicity profile that limits both its single agent use and combinations with chemotherapy. Future trials will hopefully direct our ability to harness lenalidomide MOA to best incorporate it in the rapidly evolving landscape of CLL treatment.","['Itchaki, Gilad', 'Brown, Jennifer R']","['Itchaki G', 'Brown JR']","['a Department of Medical Oncology , Dana Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA , USA.', 'a Department of Medical Oncology , Dana Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170417,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*immunomodulatory', '*lenalidomide', '*mode of action', '*treatment']",,2017/04/08 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2017.1313230 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2017 May;26(5):633-650. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2017.1313230.

Its role after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been reported in a few cases with encouraging results. METHODS: The authors describe the use of sorafenib as a maintenance agent after HSCT in 27 patients with FLT3-positive acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 46 years (range, 15-57 years). Sorafenib was introduced at a median of 70 days (range, 29-337 days) after HSCT. The median treatment duration was 8.4 months (range, 0.2-46 months). Eleven patients experienced treatment toxicities, mainly of grade 1 to 2 (graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 4.0]). Dose reduction or withdrawal was required in 4 patients and 4 patients, respectively. The persistence of toxicity prompted treatment withdrawal in 1 patient. Clinical improvement followed dose modifications. Thirteen patients experienced chronic graft-versus-host disease (limited in 9 patients and extensive in 4 patients), resulting in dose reduction in 5 patients followed by withdrawal in 1 of these individuals. At a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 4-48 months), 25 patients were alive (all of whom were in complete molecular remission) and 18 were still receiving treatment, with 1-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates of 92% +/- 6% and 92% +/- 5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib treatment after HSCT appears to be feasible and highly effective with dose individualization according to patient tolerability.

The objective of this study was to compare overall survival (OS) between patients with CML and those with Ph+ ALL who received treatment with ponatinib versus allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). METHODS: A post hoc, retrospective, indirect comparison of OS among patients who received single-agent ponatinib in the Ponatinib Ph+ ALL and CML Evaluation (PACE) trial with those who underwent allo-SCT as reported to the European Bone Marrow Transplant registry, stratified by CML disease phase and Ph+ ALL, was conducted. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models were used to compare OS between intervention groups, adjusting for time from diagnosis to intervention, age, sex, and geographic region; 24-month and 48-month OS rates and median OS were reported. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, 24-month and 48-month OS rates were significantly higher in patients with chronic-phase CML (CP-CML) who received ponatinib compared with those who underwent allo-SCT (24 months: 84% vs 60.5%, respectively; P = .004; 48 months: 72.7% vs 55.8%, respectively; P = .013), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.84; P = .017). In patients who had accelerated-phase CML, OS rates were not significantly different between the groups (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.20-4.10; P = .889). In patients who had blast-crisis CML and those with Ph+ ALL, ponatinib was associated with shorter OS compared with allo-SCT (blast-crisis CML: HR, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.08-4.82; P = .030]; Ph+ ALL: HR, 2.77 [95% CI, 0.73-10.56; P = .146]). CONCLUSIONS: Although allo-SCT remains an important treatment option for patients with T315I-positive advanced CML and Ph+ ALL, ponatinib represents a valuable alternative for patients with T315I-positive CP-CML.

Establishing baseline metrics for evaluating newer approaches is important. METHODS: s-AML was defined as 1 or more of the following: a history of an antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD), a diagnosis of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and AML with karyotype abnormalities characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome. Newly diagnosed s-AML patients aged 60 to 75 years were grouped into 5 treatment cohorts: 1) patients receiving high- or intermediate-dose cytarabine-based intensive chemotherapy (IC), 2) patients receiving a hypomethylating agent (HMA) or HMA combinations, 3) patients receiving low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) combinations, 4) patients receiving CPX-351, and 5) patients receiving investigational (INV) agents. Nine hundred thirty-one patients met the age and s-AML criteria. RESULTS: Complete remission rates were statistically lower in the HMA group (36%) versus the IC (46%), CPX-351 (45%), and LDAC groups (43%). Patients receiving less intensive regimens (the HMA and LDAC groups combined) had superior overall survival (OS) in comparison with patients receiving IC-based regimens (median 6.9 vs 5.4 months; P = .048). Only 4.3% of the IC patients proceeded to transplantation, whereas 10.3% of the patients on lower intensity regimens did (P = .001). There was no difference in median survival between patients treated with CPX-351 and patients treated with conventional lower intensity approaches (P = .75). Age > 70 years, an adverse karyotype, and a prior AHD were associated with decreased OS in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Lower intensity approaches are associated with lower early mortality rates and improved OS in comparison with intensive regimens. OS is poor with currently available therapies with a median OS of 6 months (5.4-7.6 months across regimens). Unsatisfactory outcomes with other INV agents underscore the need for more effective therapies. Cancer 2017;123:3050-60.

However, IL-7 and TCR signaling are both essential for lymphocyte survival. This study was undertaken to determine whether IM interferes with IL-7 or TCR signaling to explain lower T cell counts in patients. At diagnosis, CML patients have typically lower CD4(+) counts in their blood, yet CD8(+) counts are normal or even increased in some. Following the initiation of IM treatment, CD4(+) counts were further diminished and CD8(+) T lymphocytes were dramatically decreased. In vitro studies confirmed IM interference with TCR signaling through the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and we showed a similar effect on IL-7 signaling and STAT5 phosphorylation (STAT5-p). Importantly however, using an in vivo mouse model, we demonstrated that IM impaired T cell survival through the inhibition of IL-7 and STAT5-p but not TCR signaling which remained unaffected during IM therapy. Thus, off-target inhibitory effects of IM on IL-7 and STAT5-p explain how T cell lymphopenia occurs in patients treated with IM.","['Thiant, S', 'Moutuou, M M', 'Laflamme, P', 'Sidi Boumedine, R', 'Leboeuf, D M', 'Busque, L', 'Roy, J', 'Guimond, M']","['Thiant S', 'Moutuou MM', 'Laflamme P', 'Sidi Boumedine R', 'Leboeuf DM', 'Busque L', 'Roy J', 'Guimond M']","[""Division d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Department de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Division d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Department de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Division d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Department de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Division d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Department de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Division d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Department de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Division d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Department de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Division d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche de l'Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Department de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170407,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,PMC5436073,,,,2017/04/08 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2017/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201729 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2017.29 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2017 Apr 7;7(4):e551. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2017.29.,,20180213,,"['0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Interleukin-7/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphopenia/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,,,,['Blood Cancer J. 2020 Nov 4;10(11):112.

We found this phosphatase ensures the activated statuses of Src and Bcr-Abl. Since, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins represent a key post-translational regulation of several enzymes, we also explored the kinome. We hereby show that LMWPTP superactivation, together with kinome reprogramming, cooperate towards glucose addiction. Resistant leukemia cells present lower levels of oxidative metabolism, in part due to downexpression of the following mitochondrial proteins: pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit alpha 1, succinate dehydrogenase, and voltage-dependent anion channel. Those cells displayed higher expression levels of glucose transporter 1 and higher production of lactate. In addition, Lucena-1 siRNA LMWPTP cells showed lower expression levels of glucose transporter 1 and lower activity of lactate dehydrogenase.

ORs are expressed in and function in different types of cancers. Here, we identified that the H3K9me2 levels of several OR promoters decreased during differentiation in the HL-60, human myeloid leukaemia cell line, by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). We found that the differential OR promoters H3K9me2 levels were regulated by G9a and LSD1, resulting in the decrease of ORs transcription during HL-60 differentiation. G9a and LSD1 could regulate the expression of ORs in several non-olfactory cells via the methylation and demethylation of H3K9me2. In addition, we demonstrated that knockdown of OR significantly reduced cell proliferation. Therefore, the epigenetic regulation of ORs transcription is critical for carcinogenesis.","['Jung, Hyeonsoo', 'Chae, Yun-Cheol', 'Kim, Ji-Young', 'Jeong, Oh-Seok', 'Kook, Hoon', 'Seo, Sang-Beom']","['Jung H', 'Chae YC', 'Kim JY', 'Jeong OS', 'Kook H', 'Seo SB']","['Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, Republic of Korea.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukaemia and Cancer, Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun 519-809, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, College of Natural Sciences, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170407,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5384044,,,,2017/04/08 06:00,2018/11/18 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2016/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['srep46182 [pii]', '10.1038/srep46182 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Apr 7;7:46182. doi: 10.1038/srep46182.,,20181116,,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Receptors, Odorant)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EHMT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*metabolism', 'Histone Demethylases/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Odorant/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,['Sci Rep. 2018 Nov 19;8(1):17075.

New strategies are necessary in order to impede the formation of the viral reservoirs, responsible for the failure of the antiretroviral treatment to cure the infection. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to discuss the possibility of using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. These inhibitors are successfully used in patients with distinct cancers such as chronic myeloid leukemia. The most relevant papers have been selected and commented. Expert opinion: The family of TKIs are directed against the activation of tyrosine kinases from the Src family. Some of these kinases are essential for the activation of CD4 + T cells, the major target of HIV-1. During acute or primary infection the CD4 + T cells are massively activated, which is mostly responsible for the generation of the reservoirs, the spread of the infection and the destruction of activated CD4 + T cells, infected or not. Consequently, we discuss the possibility of using TKIs as adjuvant of the antiretroviral treatment against HIV-1 infection mostly, but not exclusively, during the acute/recent phase.","['Coiras, Mayte', 'Ambrosioni, Juan', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Miro, Jose M', 'Alcami, Jose']","['Coiras M', 'Ambrosioni J', 'Cervantes F', 'Miro JM', 'Alcami J']","['a AIDS Immunopathology Unit , National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III , Madrid , Spain.', 'b Infectious Diseases Service , AIDS Research Group, Institut d Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS) , Barcelona , Spain.', 'c Hematology Department , Hospital Clinic (IDIBAPS) , Barcelona , Spain.', 'b Infectious Diseases Service , AIDS Research Group, Institut d Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer (IDIBAPS) , Barcelona , Spain.', 'a AIDS Immunopathology Unit , National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III , Madrid , Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170426,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV/AIDS', '*T-cell activation', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitors', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*immunomodulation', '*viral reservoirs']",,2017/04/08 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14740338.2017.1313224 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2017 May;16(5):547-559. doi: 10.1080/14740338.2017.1313224.

Given its association with cell-cell adhesion and leucocyte trafficking, we hypothesized that patients with high CD49d expression would experience a clinical course dominated by lymphadenopathy. CD49d expression was measured by flow cytometry and considered positive if expressed by >/=30% of CLL cells. The study included 797 newly diagnosed CLL/small lymphocytic leukaemia patients; 279 (35%) were CD49d positive. CD49d-positive patients were more likely to present with lymphadenopathy (P < 0.001); a finding that persisted after adjusting for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and IGHV mutation status [odds ratio (OR) 2.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64-3.83; P < 0.001]. Among CLL Rai 0 patients, CD49d positivity was associated with shorter time to development of lymphadenopathy (3.2 years vs not reached, P < 0.01). This association was maintained after adjusting for either FISH [hazard ratio (HR) 2.18; 95% CI 1.25-3.81; P = 0.006) or IGHV status (HR 2.02; 95% CI 1.11-3.69; P = 0.02) individually, but was attenuated when adjusting by both (HR 1.72; 95% CI 0.88-3.38; P = 0.11).These data demonstrate that CD49d-positive CLL patients experience a disease course dominated by lymphadenopathy. These findings could have implications for therapy selection and disease monitoring.","['Strati, Paolo', 'Parikh, Sameer A', 'Chaffee, Kari G', 'Achenbach, Sara J', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Ding, Wei', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Shanafelt, Tait D']","['Strati P', 'Parikh SA', 'Chaffee KG', 'Achenbach SJ', 'Slager SL', 'Call TG', 'Ding W', 'Jelinek DF', 'Hanson CA', 'Kay NE', 'Shanafelt TD']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170407,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,PMC5549625,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD49d', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*lymphadenopathy', '*small lymphocytic lymphoma']",,2017/04/08 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2016/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14647 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Jul;178(1):99-105. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14647.

Primary ALL blasts and cell lines released heterogeneous anucleate vesicles <6 micron into extracellular fluids. Larger LEVs were enclosed in continuous membranes, contained intact organelles and demonstrated an organised cytoskeleton. An excess of circulating CD19-positive LEVs were observed in diagnostic samples and isolated from mice engrafted with BCP-ALL primary cells. LEVs exhibited dynamic shape change in vitro and were internalised by other leukaemic cell lines leading to phenotypic transformation analogous to the cell of origin. In patient-derived xenografts, LEVs were released by primary ALL cells into extracellular spaces and internalised by murine mesenchymal cells in vivo.

The most common DNMT3A R882 mutations inhibit methyltransferase activity of the remaining wild-type DNMT3A proteins at a heterozygous state due to their dominant-negative activity. Reports and COSMIC database analysis reveal significantly different frequencies of R882 mutations in myeloid versus T-cell malignancies, inspiring us to investigate whether downregulation of DNMT3A regulates malignancies of different lineages in a dose-dependent manner. In a competitive transplant setting, the survival of recipients with Kras(G12D/+) ; Dnmt3a(+/-) bone marrow (BM) cells was significantly shortened than that of recipients with Kras(G12D/+) cells. Moreover, all of the recipients with Kras(G12D/+) ; Dnmt3a(+/-) cells developed a lethal T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) without significant myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) phenotypes, while ~20% of recipients with Kras(G12D/+) cells developed MPN with or without T-ALL. This is in sharp contrast to the recipients with Kras(G12D/+) ; Dnmt3a(-/-) cells, in which ~60% developed a lethal myeloid malignancy (MPN or acute myeloid leukemia [AML]). Our data suggest that in the context of oncogenic Kras, loss of Dnmt3a promotes myeloid malignancies, while Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency induces T-ALL. This dose-dependent phenotype is highly consistent with the prevalence of DNMT3A R882 mutations in AML versus T-ALL in human.","['Chang, Yuan-I', 'Kong, Guangyao', 'Ranheim, Erik A', 'Tu, Po-Shu', 'Yu, Yi-Shan', 'Zhang, Jing']","['Chang YI', 'Kong G', 'Ranheim EA', 'Tu PS', 'Yu YS', 'Zhang J']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-MadisonMadison, WI 53706, USA; Department and Institute of Physiology, National Yang-Ming UniversityTaipei 11221, Taiwan.', ""McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-MadisonMadison, WI 53706, USA; National Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Biodiagnostics and Biotherapy, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong UniversityXi'an, P.

However, the extensive application of cisplatin inevitably causes drug resistance, which is a major obstacle to cancer chemotherapy. Oridonin is a diterpenoid isolated from Rabdosia rubescens with potent anticancer activity. The aim of our study is to investigate the role of oridonin to reverse the cisplatin-resistance in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The effect of oridonin on human AML cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, cell migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell migration and invasion assays in cisplatin-resistant human AML cells. Furthermore, cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. The inhibitive effect of oridonin in vivo was determined using xenografted nude mice. In addition, the expressions of MMP2 and MMP9 were detected by Western blot. There was a synergistic antitumor effect between cisplatin and oridonin on cisplatin-resistant human AML cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the combination of cisplatin and oridonin synergistically induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the combination treatment not only inhibited AML cell migration and invasion, but more significantly, decreased the expressions of MMP2 and MMP9 proteins. Our results suggest that the synergistic effect between both agents is likely to be driven by the inhibition of MMP expression and the resulting increased apoptosis.","['Zhang, Yuan', 'Wang, Lihua', 'Zi, Youmei', 'Zhang, Lingxiu', 'Guo, Yan', 'Huang, Yan']","['Zhang Y', 'Wang L', 'Zi Y', 'Zhang L', 'Guo Y', 'Huang Y']","['Department of Haemal Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Weihui 453100, China.', 'Department of Haemal Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Weihui 453100, China.', 'Department of Haemal Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Weihui 453100, China.', 'Department of Haemal Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Weihui 453100, China.', 'Department of Haemal Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Weihui 453100, China.', 'Department of Haemal Internal Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Weihui 453100, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170125,Saudi Arabia,Saudi J Biol Sci,Saudi journal of biological sciences,101543796,PMC5372424,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cell apoptosis', 'Cisplatin', 'Drug resistance', 'Oridonin']",,2017/04/08 06:00,2017/04/08 06:01,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2016/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.sjbs.2017.01.042 [doi]', 'S1319-562X(17)30051-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Saudi J Biol Sci. 2017 Mar;24(3):678-686. doi: 10.1016/j.sjbs.2017.01.042.

As with ABL, translocations that fuse ARG to ETV6/TEL have been identified in patients with leukemia. To assess the in vivo leukemogenic activity of constitutively active ABL and ARG, we generated a bone marrow (BM) transplantation model using the chimeric forms TEL/ABL and TEL/ARG, which have comparable kinase activities. TEL/ABL rapidly induced fatal myeloid leukemia in recipient mice, whereas recipients of TEL/ARG-transduced cells did not develop myeloid leukemia, instead, they succumbed to a long-latency infiltrative mastocytosis that could be adoptively transferred to secondary recipients. Swapping of the C termini of ABL and ARG altered disease latency and phenotypes. In a detailed in vitro study, TEL/ARG strongly promoted mast cell differentiation in response to stem cell factor or interleukin-3, whereas TEL/ABL preferentially induced myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. These results indicate that ABL and ARG kinase activate distinct differentiation pathways to induce specific diseases in vivo, that is, myeloid leukemia and mastocytosis, respectively. Further elucidation of the differences in their properties should provide important insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of oncogenes of the ABL kinase family.","['Yokota, A', 'Hirai, H', 'Shoji, T', 'Maekawa, T', 'Okuda, K']","['Yokota A', 'Hirai H', 'Shoji T', 'Maekawa T', 'Okuda K']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170407,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,2017/04/08 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017114 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.114 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2742-2751. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.114.

However, the underlying mechanism of MF still remains unknown. Recent studies have revealed that fibrocytes, the spindle-shaped fibroblast-like hematopoietic cells, and the thrombopoietin (TPO)/myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL; TPO receptor) signaling pathway play a certain role in the development of MF. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between fibrocytes and MPL activation. We showed that TPO or a TPO receptor agonist directly induces fibrocyte differentiation using murine fibrocyte cell lines and a murine MF model. Conversely, elimination of macrophages expressing MPL by clodronate liposomes reversed the MF phenotype of the murine model, suggesting that fibrocyte differentiation induced by MPL activation contributes to the progression of MF. Furthermore, we revealed that SLAMF7(high) MPL(high) monocytes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were possible fibrocyte precursors and that these cells increased in number in MF patients not treated with ruxolitinib. Our findings confirmed a link between fibrocytes and the TPO/MPL signaling pathway, which could result in a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of MF and lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions.","['Maekawa, T', 'Osawa, Y', 'Izumi, T', 'Nagao, S', 'Takano, K', 'Okada, Y', 'Tachi, N', 'Teramoto, M', 'Kawamura, T', 'Horiuchi, T', 'Saga, R', 'Kato, S', 'Yamamura, T', 'Watanabe, J', 'Kobayashi, A', 'Kobayashi, S', 'Sato, K', 'Hashimoto, M', 'Suzu, S', 'Kimura, F']","['Maekawa T', 'Osawa Y', 'Izumi T', 'Nagao S', 'Takano K', 'Okada Y', 'Tachi N', 'Teramoto M', 'Kawamura T', 'Horiuchi T', 'Saga R', 'Kato S', 'Yamamura T', 'Watanabe J', 'Kobayashi A', 'Kobayashi S', 'Sato K', 'Hashimoto M', 'Suzu S', 'Kimura F']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.', 'Suzu Project Laboratory, Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Suzu Project Laboratory, Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170403,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,2017/04/08 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2016/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017112 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.112 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2709-2716. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.112.

An important reason for AML MRD-testing is the possibility of estimating the likelihood (and timing) of leukaemia relapse. A perfect MRD-test would precisely quantify leukaemia cells biologically able and likely to cause leukaemia relapse within a defined interval. AML is genetically diverse and there is currently no uniform approach to detecting such cells. Several technologies focused on immune phenotype or cytogenetic and/or molecular abnormalities have been developed, each with advantages and disadvantages. Many studies report a positive MRD-test at diverse time points during AML therapy identifies persons with a higher risk of leukaemia relapse compared with those with a negative MRD-test even after adjusting for other prognostic and predictive variables. No MRD-test in AML has perfect sensitivity and specificity for relapse prediction at the cohort- or subject levels and there are substantial rates of false-positive and -negative tests. Despite these limitations, correlations between MRD-test results and relapse risk have generated interest in MRD-test result-directed therapy interventions. However, convincing proof that a specific intervention will reduce relapse risk in persons with a positive MRD-test is lacking and needs testing in randomized trials. Routine clinical use of MRD-testing requires further refinements and standardization/harmonization of assay platforms and results reporting. Such data are needed to determine whether results of MRD-testing can be used as a surrogate end point in AML therapy trials. This could make drug-testing more efficient and accelerate regulatory approvals. Although MRD-testing in AML has advanced substantially, much remains to be done.","['Hourigan, C S', 'Gale, R P', 'Gormley, N J', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Walter, R B']","['Hourigan CS', 'Gale RP', 'Gormley NJ', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Walter RB']","['Myeloid Malignancies Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Haematology Research Centre, Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Division of Hematology Products, Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20170407,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,,,,2017/04/08 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2017/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017113 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.113 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Jul;31(7):1482-1490. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.113.

A higher risk of infections has also been recently reported for high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, while no information is available in low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. Here, we evaluated the status of the humoral immune system in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=58), as well as in low- (n=71) and high- (n=29) count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis versus healthy donors (n=91). Total free plasma immunoglobulin titers and specific levels of antibodies against cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza and S.pneumoniae were measured by nephelometry and ELISA-based techniques, respectively. Overall, our results show that both CLL and high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis patients, but not low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis subjects, present with relatively high levels of antibodies specific for the latent viruses investigated, associated with progressively lower levels of S.pneumoniae-specific immunoglobulins. These findings probably reflect asymptomatic chronic reactivation of humoral immune responses against host viruses associated with expanded virus-specific antibody levels and progressively decreased protection against other micro-organisms, denoting a severe humoral immunodeficiency state not reflected by the overall plasma immunoglobulin levels. Alternatively, these results could reflect a potential role of ubiquitous viruses in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Here, we develop a high-throughput sequencing technology to define TOP2 cleavage sites at single-base precision, and use the technology to characterize TOP2A cleavage genome-wide in the human K562 leukemia cell line. We find that TOP2A cleavage has functionally conserved local sequence preferences, occurs in cleavage cluster regions (CCRs), and is enriched in introns and lincRNA loci. TOP2A CCRs are biased toward the distal regions of gene bodies, and TOP2 poisons cause a proximal shift in their distribution. We find high TOP2A cleavage levels in genes involved in translocations in TOP2 poison-related leukemia. In addition, we find that a large proportion of genes involved in oncogenic translocations overall contain TOP2A CCRs. The TOP2A cleavage of coding and lincRNA genes is independently associated with both length and transcript abundance. Comparisons to ENCODE data reveal distinct TOP2A CCR clusters that overlap with marks of transcription, open chromatin, and enhancers. Our findings implicate TOP2A cleavage as a broad DNA damage mechanism in oncogenic translocations as well as a functional role of TOP2A cleavage in regulating transcription elongation and gene activation.","['Yu, Xiang', 'Davenport, James W', 'Urtishak, Karen A', 'Carillo, Marie L', 'Gosai, Sager J', 'Kolaris, Christos P', 'Byl, Jo Ann W', 'Rappaport, Eric F', 'Osheroff, Neil', 'Gregory, Brian D', 'Felix, Carolyn A']","['Yu X', 'Davenport JW', 'Urtishak KA', 'Carillo ML', 'Gosai SJ', 'Kolaris CP', 'Byl JAW', 'Rappaport EF', 'Osheroff N', 'Gregory BD', 'Felix CA']","['Biology Department, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."", 'Biology Department, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."", 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.', ""NAPCore, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."", 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.', 'Department of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.', 'VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, Tennessee 37212, USA.', 'Biology Department, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170406,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,PMC5495075,,,,2017/04/08 06:00,2018/03/27 06:00,['2017/04/08 06:00'],"['2016/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['gr.211615.116 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.211615.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2017 Jul;27(7):1238-1249. doi: 10.1101/gr.211615.116.

This method provides novel, direct and flexible access to diverse substituted 4(3H)quinazolinimines. New compounds obtained following the proposed synthesis were fully characterized and, including the thirteen 4(3H)quinazolinimines synthesized by this method and previously reported by us, were used to study its cytotoxic effect on neoplastic cell lines. The mechanism involved in cell toxicity was also studied. Results showed that these compounds were highly cytotoxic, in particular on Human Promyelocytic Leukemia cells (HL60) and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia cells (K562) when compared with conventional antineoplastic drugs such as etoposide and cisplatin. The mechanism associated to cytotoxic effect was mainly apoptosis, which not was decreased by antioxidant addition, thereby suggesting that the compounds exert apoptotic death through a mechanism unrelated with oxidative stress.","['Becerra, Alexandra', 'Quintero, Celso', 'Morales, Valeria', 'Valderrama, Mauricio', 'Aguirre, Adam', 'Faundez, Mario A', 'Rojas, Rene S']","['Becerra A', 'Quintero C', 'Morales V', 'Valderrama M', 'Aguirre A', 'Faundez MA', 'Rojas RS']","['Departamento de Quimica Inorganica, Facultad de Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Casilla 306, Santiago 22, Chile.', 'Departamento de Quimica Inorganica, Facultad de Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Casilla 306, Santiago 22, Chile.', 'Departamento de Quimica Inorganica, Facultad de Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Casilla 306, Santiago 22, Chile.', 'Departamento de Quimica Inorganica, Facultad de Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Casilla 306, Santiago 22, Chile.', 'Departamento de Farmacia, Facultad de Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Casilla 306, Santiago 22, Chile.', 'Departamento de Farmacia, Facultad de Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Casilla 306, Santiago 22, Chile.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred nineteen children 2 to 16 years of age (mean age, 9.4 years; standard deviation [SD], 4.56 years) with glaucoma and their parents. METHODS: Completion of 3 validated instruments for children to assess (1) functional visual ability (FVA) with the Cardiff Visual Ability Questionnaire for Children (CVAQC), (2) VR QoL with the Impact of Vision Impairment for Children (IVI-C), and (3) HR QoL with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) version 4.0. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cardiff Visual Ability Questionnaire for Children, IVI-C, and PedsQL scores. RESULTS: Scores for FVA, VR QoL, and HR QoL were reduced in children with glaucoma: median CVAQC score, -1.24 (interquartile range [IQR], -2.2 to -0.11; range, -3.00 higher visual ability to +2.80 lower visual ability); mean IVI-C score, 67.3 (SD, 14.4; normal VR QoL, 96); median PedsQL self-report, 78.8 (IQR, 67.4-90.2); parent report, 71.2 (IQR, 55.7-85.8); and family impact score, 74.3 (IQR, 56.9-88.5; normal HR QoL, 100). Psychosocial subscores were lower than physical subscores on the PedsQL. Older children reported less impairment on CVAQC, IVI-C, and PedsQL than younger children.

It appears in both adult and pediatric patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia at an overall frequency of 3 to 5%. Most cases of pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying the translocation t(1;19) have a typical immunophenotype with homogeneous expression of CD19, CD10, CD9, complete absence of CD34, and at least diminished CD20. Moreover, the translocation t(1;19) correlates with known clinical high risk factors, such as elevated white blood cell count, high serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, and central nervous system involvement; early reports indicated that patients with translocation t(1;19) had a poor outcome under standard treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 15-year-old Syrian boy with pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with abnormal karyotype with a der(19)t(1;19)(q21.1;p13.3) and two yet unreported chromosomal aberrations: an interstitial deletion 6q12 to 6q26 and a der(13)t(1;13)(q21.1;p13). According to the literature, cases who are translocation t(1;19)-positive have a significantly higher incidence of central nervous system relapse than patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia without the translocation. Of interest, central nervous system involvement was also seen in our patient. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of childhood pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with an unbalanced translocation t(1;19) with two additional chromosomal aberrations, del(6)(q12q26) and t(1;13)(q21.3;p13), which seem to be recurrent and could influence clinical outcome. Also the present case confirms the impact of the translocation t(1;19) on central nervous system relapse, which should be studied for underlying mechanisms in future.","['Wafa, Abdulsamad', ""As'sad, Manar"", 'Liehr, Thomas', 'Aljapawe, Abdulmunim', 'Al Achkar, Walid']","['Wafa A', ""As'sad M"", 'Liehr T', 'Aljapawe A', 'Al Achkar W']","['Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Department, Human Genetics Div., Atomic Energy Commission of Syria, P.O.

To do causal inference in survival analysis, one needs to address right-censoring, and often, special techniques are required for that purpose. We will show how censoring can be dealt with 'once and for all' by means of so-called pseudo-observations when doing causal inference in survival analysis. The pseudo-observations can be used as a replacement of the outcomes without censoring when applying 'standard' causal inference methods, such as (1) or (2) earlier. We study this idea for estimating the average causal effect of a binary treatment on the survival probability, the restricted mean lifetime, and the cumulative incidence in a competing risks situation. The methods will be illustrated in a small simulation study and via a study of patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received either myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning before allogeneic hematopoetic cell transplantation. We will estimate the average causal effect of the conditioning regime on outcomes such as the 3-year overall survival probability and the 3-year risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease.

We analyzed the subcellular localization of three types of NPM with a C-terminal mutation (A, B and E). Genes for the individual NPM forms were fused with a gene for one of fluorescent protein variants in plasmids, which were transfected into three cell lines with different endogenous NPM expression. Subcellular localization of the fluorescent protein-labeled NPM was further correlated with the relative expression of all NPM forms. We confirmed a high cytoplasmic expression of NPMmutA and NPMmutB whereas a substantial fraction of NPMmutE was found to be localized in nucleoli.

In this study, we incorporate neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), marital status, and distance from transplant center with previously studied factors to provide a comprehensive analysis of sociodemographic factors influencing treatments for ALL and AML. METHODS: Using the California Cancer Registry, we performed a retrospective, population-based study of patients >/=15 years old with ALL (n = 3,221) or AML (n = 10,029) from 2003 through 2012. The effect of age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, nSES, and distance from nearest transplant center on receiving no treatment, chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy then HCT was analyzed. RESULTS: No treatment, chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy then HCT were received by 11%, 75%, and 14% of ALL patients and 36%, 53%, and 11% of AML patients, respectively. For ALL patients >/=60 years old, HCT utilization increased from 5% in 2005 to 9% in 2012 (p = 0.03). For AML patients >/=60 years old, chemotherapy utilization increased from 39% to 58% (p<0.001) and HCT utilization from 5% to 9% from 2005 to 2012 (p<0.001). Covariate-adjusted analysis revealed decreasing relative risk (RR) of chemotherapy with increasing age for both ALL and AML (trend p <0.001). Relative to non-Hispanic whites, lower HCT utilization occurred in Hispanic [ALL, RR = 0.80 (95% CI = 0.65-0.98); AML, RR = 0.86 (95% CI = 0.75-0.99)] and non-Hispanic black patients [ALL, RR = 0.40 (95% CI = 0.18-0.89); AML, RR = 0.60 (95% CI = 0.44-0.83)]. Compared to married patients, never married patients had a lower RR of receiving chemotherapy [ALL, RR = 0.96 (95% CI = 0.92-0.99); AML, RR = 0.94 (95% CI = 0.90-0.98)] or HCT [ALL, RR = 0.58 (95% CI = 0.47-0.71); AML, RR = 0.80 (95% CI = 0.70-0.90)]. Lower nSES quintiles predicted lower chemotherapy and HCT utilization for both ALL and AML (trend p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Older age, lower nSES, and being unmarried predicted lower utilization of chemotherapy and HCT among ALL and AML patients whereas having Hispanic or black race/ethnicity predicted lower rates of HCT. Addressing these disparities may increase utilization of curative therapies in underserved acute leukemia populations.","['Jabo, Brice', 'Morgan, John W', 'Martinez, Maria Elena', 'Ghamsary, Mark', 'Wieduwilt, Matthew J']","['Jabo B', 'Morgan JW', 'Martinez ME', 'Ghamsary M', 'Wieduwilt MJ']","['Loma Linda University School of Public Health, Loma Linda, California, United States of America.', 'Loma Linda University School of Public Health, Loma Linda, California, United States of America.', 'University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Loma Linda University School of Public Health, Loma Linda, California, United States of America.', 'University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170406,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC5383052,,,,2017/04/07 06:00,2017/09/08 06:00,['2017/04/07 06:00'],"['2016/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0174760 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-42246 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Apr 6;12(4):e0174760. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0174760. eCollection 2017.,,20170907,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5414-9228'],['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Demography', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', '*Social Class', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: Imatinib is effective for CML in pregnancy, but caution is warranted in light of potentially unrecognized fetal and neonatal effects.","['Burwick, Richard M', 'Kuo, Kelly', 'Brewer, Diana', 'Druker, Brian J']","['Burwick RM', 'Kuo K', 'Brewer D', 'Druker BJ']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Knight Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, Oregon.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Obstet Gynecol,Obstetrics and gynecology,0401101,,,,,2017/04/07 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2017/04/07 06:00'],"['2017/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/AOG.0000000000001972 [doi]', '00006250-201705000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Obstet Gynecol. 2017 May;129(5):831-834. doi: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000001972.,,20170710,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fetus/*metabolism', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prenatal Diagnosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During chronic use of imatinib, CYP2C8 becomes an important metabolizing enzyme because of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) autoinhibition. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP2C8 may affect imatinib trough levels. This study investigates the effect of common CYP2C8 polymorphisms [*1B (rs7909236), *1C (rs17110453), *3 (rs11572080 and rs10509681), and *4 (rs1058930)] on steady-state trough levels imatinib during chronic imatinib use in 43 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Standardized imatinib trough levels did not show a significant difference between wild-type and variant groups for any of the tested SNPs, but an association with age was found, with older patients having higher trough levels. This suggests that common CYP2C8 SNPs have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of imatinib.","['Verboom, Michiel C', 'Visser, Loes', 'Kouwen, Sander', 'Swen, Jesse J', 'Diepstraten, Jeroen', 'Posthuma, Ward F', 'Gelderblom, Hans', 'van Lammeren, Danielle', 'Wilms, Erik B']","['Verboom MC', 'Visser L', 'Kouwen S', 'Swen JJ', 'Diepstraten J', 'Posthuma WF', 'Gelderblom H', 'van Lammeren D', 'Wilms EB']","['Departments of aMedical Oncology bClinical Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden cCentral Hospital Pharmacy dDepartment of Hospital Pharmacy eDepartment of Hematology, Haga Teaching Hospital, The Hague fDepartment of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC - University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam gHospital Pharmacy hDepartment of Internal Medicine, Reinier de Graaf Group, Delft, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,,,,,2017/04/07 06:00,2018/07/17 06:00,['2017/04/07 06:00'],"['2017/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FPC.0000000000000278 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2017 Jun;27(6):223-226. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000278.,,20180716,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP2C8 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacogenomic Variants', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, in the present study, we have investigated the anti-tumor mechanism of auraptene mainly in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, because auraptene suppressed the viability of androgen-independent PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells better than androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. Also, auraptene notably increased sub-G1 cell population and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells as features of apoptosis in two prostate cancer cells compared with untreated control. Consistently, auraptene cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, suppressed the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2 and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), and also activated pro-apoptotic protein Bax in both prostate cancer cells. However, Mcl-1 overexpression reversed the apoptotic effect of auraptene to increase sub-G1 population and induce caspase-9/3 in both prostate cancer cells. Taken together, the results support scientific evidences that auraptene induces apoptosis in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells via Mcl-1-mediated activation of caspases as a potent chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer prevention and treatment.

This study aimed to subtype caprine lymphoma based on topographic and subgross distribution, immunophenotype, and cellular morphology following the World Health Organization classification system for hematopoietic tumors in domestic animals. Fifteen caprine lymphoma cases were assessed with 6 submitted as biopsy and 9 for postmortem examination. Goats were predominantly young adult (median 3 years) and dwarf breeds (Pygmy and Pygora). The sexes were similarly represented. Nuclear size was measured relative to red blood cells (RBCs) and then adjusted for species-specific differences and designated small (<3x RBCs), intermediate (3-4x RBCs), or large (>4x RBCs). Using immunohistochemistry, 11 of 15 (73%) goats had T-cell lymphoma (TCL; CD3 positive, CD79alpha negative) and 4 of 15 (27%) had B-cell lymphoma (BCL; CD79alpha positive, CD3 negative). A multicentric distribution was most common. TCL generally involved the thoracic cavity and/or neck, suggestive of thymic origin or homing. TCLs were further classified as lymphoblastic lymphomas (3/11; 27%), large granular lymphocyte lymphoma (1/11; 9%), diffuse small lymphocytic lymphomas (3/11; 27%), or peripheral/mature T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) not otherwise specified (4/11 [36%], of which 3 were high grade and 1 intermediate grade). In 1 goat with PTCL, lymph nodes had either paracortical expansion or diffuse infiltrates suggesting transition from nodular to diffuse PTLC. BCLs were classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (2/4; 50%) or B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma intermediate type (2/4; 50%). In contrast to dogs and horses, lymphomas in goats are predominantly TCL and frequently involve the mediastinum.","['Kiser, Patti K', 'Lohr, Christiane V']","['Kiser PK', 'Lohr CV']","['1 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA.', '1 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170406,United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD3', '*CD79alpha', '*goats', '*immunohistochemistry', '*lymphoma', '*lymphosarcoma', '*multicentric', '*thymus']",,2017/04/07 06:00,2017/12/19 06:00,['2017/04/07 06:00'],"['2017/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0300985817699859 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2017 Jul;54(4):611-619. doi: 10.1177/0300985817699859.

No longer the most dreaded form of acute leukemia, the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has ushered in a new era, as TKIs have become the backbone of any treatment regimen for Ph+ ALL. A greater number achieve a complete remission allowing for more patients to get the transplant, although probably less patients need a transplant. For the first time in decades, there is hope for older patients with Ph+ ALL. Defining residual disease at an increasingly lower level of disease burdens termed minimal residual disease (MRD) has allowed treatment algorithms to be designed based on deep molecular responses. The aggregate of recent data suggest that this is the most important endpoint to predict for long-term outcome and to decide on the optimal post-remission approach, including transplant. Novel agents, such as blinatumumab, are likely to be incorporated into therapy for relapse and as initial therapy in an attempt to increase the number of patients who may have deep molecular responses. Many more patients with Ph+ ALL are long-term survivors, and the future is looking brighter for this group of patients.","['Ronson, Aaron', 'Tvito, Ariella', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Ronson A', 'Tvito A', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, 12 Shmuel Bait St., P.O.B. 3235, 9103102, Jerusalem, IL, Israel. ronsonaaron@szmc.org.il.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, 12 Shmuel Bait St., P.O.B. 3235, 9103102, Jerusalem, IL, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, 12 Shmuel Bait St., P.O.B. 3235, 9103102, Jerusalem, IL, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Minimal residual disease', '*Ph-like ALL', '*Ph-positive ALL', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,2017/04/07 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/04/07 06:00'],"['2017/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-017-0455-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-017-0455-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2017 Mar;18(3):20. doi: 10.1007/s11864-017-0455-3.,,20170815,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Discovery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess [1] the clinical characteristics of methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci bacteremia and [2] the susceptibility of the isolated bacteria to glycopeptides. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 70 patients from whom methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci had been isolated at Osaka City University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2013. We evaluated the patients' background, severity and prognosis of the disease, and the susceptibility of the isolated methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci to glycopeptides. Results Out of the 70 patients tested, 28 (40.0%) had leukemia, and 36 (51.4%) had been treated for febrile neutropenia. Infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis accounted for 78.6% of patients. Thirty-nine cases (55.7%) were related to intravascular catheters, and 39 (55.7%) were treated using teicoplanin as a first-line therapy. The 30-day mortality rate was 4.3%. Regarding susceptibility, 20% of all isolates were non-susceptible to teicoplanin. According to multivariate analyses, it was observed that premedication using glycopeptides was independently associated with teicoplanin non-susceptibility (p=0.03; hazard ratio = 5.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-26.76). Conclusion Our results suggest that clinicians must use glycopeptides appropriately to prevent the development of further antibiotic resistance in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci.","['Yamada, Koichi', 'Namikawa, Hiroki', 'Fujimoto, Hiroki', 'Nakaie, Kiyotaka', 'Takizawa, Etsuko', 'Okada, Yasuyo', 'Fujita, Akiko', 'Kawaguchi, Hiroyoshi', 'Nakamura, Yasutaka', 'Abe, Junko', 'Kaneko, Yukihiro', 'Kakeya, Hiroshi']","['Yamada K', 'Namikawa H', 'Fujimoto H', 'Nakaie K', 'Takizawa E', 'Okada Y', 'Fujita A', 'Kawaguchi H', 'Nakamura Y', 'Abe J', 'Kaneko Y', 'Kakeya H']","['Department of Infection Control Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170401,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,PMC5457920,,,,2017/04/07 06:00,2017/06/03 06:00,['2017/04/07 06:00'],"['2017/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.56.7715 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med. 2017;56(7):781-785. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.56.7715.

Tetherin/Bst2 is an antiviral protein that blocks enveloped virion release into the extracellular milieu but may not inhibit cell-to-cell virus transmission. We developed live-cell imaging assays which show that tetherin does not affect Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) spread, and only minimally affects vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) spread, to adjacent cells in a monolayer. Conversely, cell-free MLV and VSV virion yields and VSV spread to distal cells were dramatically reduced by tetherin. To elucidate the roles of tetherin and cell-free virions during in vivo viral dissemination and pathogenesis, we developed mice carrying an inducible human tetherin (hTetherin) transgene. While ubiquitous hTetherin expression was detrimental to the growth and survival of mice, restriction of hTetherin expression to hematopoietic cells gave apparently healthy mice. The expression of hTetherin in hematopoietic cells had little or no effect on the number of MoMLV-infected splenocytes and thymocytes. However, hTetherin expression significantly reduced cell-free plasma viremia and also delayed MoMLV-induced disease. Overall, these results suggest that MoMLV spread within hematopoietic tissues and cell monolayers involves cell-to-cell transmission that is resistant to tetherin but that virion dissemination via plasma is inhibited by tetherin and is required for full MoMLV pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Retroviruses are thought to spread primarily via direct cell-to-cell transmission, yet many have evolved to counteract an antiviral protein called tetherin, which may selectively inhibit cell-free virus release. We generated a mouse model with an inducible tetherin transgene in order to study how tetherin affects retroviral dissemination and on which cell types its expression is required to do so. We first developed a novel in vitro live-cell imaging assay to demonstrate that while tetherin does indeed dramatically reduce cell-free virus spreading, it has little to no effect on direct cell-to-cell transmission of either vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or the retrovirus MoMLV. Using our transgenic mouse model, we found that tetherin expression on hematopoietic cells resulted in the specific reduction of MoMLV cell-free plasma viremia but not the number of infected hematopoietic cells. The delay in disease associated with this scenario suggests a role for cell-free virus in retroviral disease progression.","['Liberatore, Rachel A', 'Mastrocola, Emily J', 'Powell, Chelsea', 'Bieniasz, Paul D']","['Liberatore RA', 'Mastrocola EJ', 'Powell C', 'Bieniasz PD']","['Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA.', 'The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA pbieniasz@rockefeller.edu.', 'The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20170526,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC5446635,['NOTNLM'],"['*retroviruses', '*tetherin', '*vesicular stomatitis virus', '*viral pathogenesis']",,2017/04/07 06:00,2017/07/28 06:00,['2017/04/07 06:00'],"['2016/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02286-16 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02286-16 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 May 26;91(12). pii: JVI.02286-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02286-16.

Caspase-3, a key executor among its family, plays multiple roles in cellular processes, including hematopoietic development and leukemia progression. Caspase-3 was revealed to directly cleave AE in vitro, suggesting that AE may accumulate in a Caspase-3-compromised background and thereby accelerate leukemogenesis. Therefore, we developed a Caspase-3 knockout genetic mouse model of AML and found that loss of Caspase-3 actually delayed AML1-ETO9a (AE9a)-driven leukemogenesis, indicating that Caspase-3 may play distinct roles in the initiation and/or progression of AML. We report here that loss of Caspase-3 triggers a conserved, adaptive mechanism, namely autophagy (or macroautophagy), which acts to limit AE9a-driven leukemia. Furthermore, we identify ULK1 as a novel substrate of Caspase-3 and show that upregulation of ULK1 drives autophagy initiation in leukemia cells and that inhibition of ULK1 can rescue the phenotype induced by Caspase-3 deletion in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these data highlight Caspase-3 as an important regulator of autophagy in AML and demonstrate that the balance and selectivity between its substrates can dictate the pace of disease.","['Man, Na', 'Tan, Yurong', 'Sun, Xiao-Jian', 'Liu, Fan', 'Cheng, Guoyan', 'Greenblatt, Sarah M', 'Martinez, Camilo', 'Karl, Daniel L', 'Ando, Koji', 'Sun, Ming', 'Hou, Dan', 'Chen, Bingyi', 'Xu, Mingjiang', 'Yang, Feng-Chun', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Saijuan', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Wang, Lan']","['Man N', 'Tan Y', 'Sun XJ', 'Liu F', 'Cheng G', 'Greenblatt SM', 'Martinez C', 'Karl DL', 'Ando K', 'Sun M', 'Hou D', 'Chen B', 'Xu M', 'Yang FC', 'Chen Z', 'Chen S', 'Nimer SD', 'Wang L']","['Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170405,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC5437826,,,,2017/04/07 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2017/04/07 06:00'],"['2016/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33377-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-10-745034 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 May 18;129(20):2782-2792. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-10-745034.

However, less is known about the expression and association of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 with cancer stem cell markers in oral squamous cell carcinoma. This study aimed to investigate the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 and stem cell characteristic markers (lin28 homolog B, B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1) in oral squamous cell carcinoma and analyze their relations. Paraffin-embedded tissues of 78 oral squamous cell carcinomas, 39 normal oral mucosa, and 12 oral dysplasia tissues were employed in tissue microarrays, and the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1, B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, and lin28 homolog B was measured by immunohistostaining and digital pathological analysis. The expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 was higher in the oral squamous cell carcinoma group as compared with the expression in the oral mucosa (p < 0.01) and oral dysplasia (p < 0.001) groups. In addition, the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 was associated with those of B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, and lin28 homolog B (p = 0.032, r(2) = 0.109; p < 0.0001, r(2) = 0.64; and p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.16) in oral squamous cell carcinoma. The patient survival rate was lower in the highly expressed tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 group, although the difference was not significant. The clustering analysis showed that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 was most related to aldehyde dehydrogenase 1. These findings suggest that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 has potential direct/indirect regulations with the cancer stem cell markers in oral squamous cell carcinoma, which may help in further analysis of the cancer stem cell characteristics.","['Wu, Tian-Fu', 'Li, Yi-Cun', 'Ma, Si-Rui', 'Bing-Liu', 'Zhang, Wen-Feng', 'Sun, Zhi-Jun']","['Wu TF', 'Li YC', 'Ma SR', 'Bing-Liu', 'Zhang WF', 'Sun ZJ']","[""1 The State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Basic Science of Stomatology & Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""2 Department of Oral Maxillofacial-Head Neck Oncology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""1 The State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Basic Science of Stomatology & Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""1 The State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Basic Science of Stomatology & Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""2 Department of Oral Maxillofacial-Head Neck Oncology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""2 Department of Oral Maxillofacial-Head Neck Oncology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""1 The State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Basic Science of Stomatology & Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedicine Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""2 Department of Oral Maxillofacial-Head Neck Oncology, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,['NOTNLM'],"['Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1', 'cancer stem cell', 'head neck cancer', 'inflammation']",,2017/04/07 06:00,2017/04/19 06:00,['2017/04/07 06:00'],"['2017/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428317695930 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2017 Apr;39(4):1010428317695930. doi: 10.1177/1010428317695930.,,20170418,,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (LIN28B protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1)', 'EC 1.2.1 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (ALDH1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (Retinal Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Biomarkers', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*chemistry/mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*chemistry/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*analysis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase/*analysis', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1/*analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the association between ARID5B variants and acute lymphoblastic leukemia among the Arab population still needs to be studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ARID5B variants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children. A total of 14 ARID5B gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 289 Yemeni children, of whom 136 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 153 were controls, using the nanofluidic Dynamic Array (Fluidigm 192.24 Dynamic Array). Using logistic regression adjusted for age and gender, the risks of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We found that nine SNPs were associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under additive genetic models: rs7073837, rs10740055, rs7089424, rs10821936, rs4506592, rs10994982, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074. Furthermore, the recessive models revealed that six SNPs were risk factors for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: rs10740055, rs7089424, rs10994982, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074. The gender-specific impact of these SNPs under the recessive genetic model revealed that SNPs rs10740055, rs10994982, and rs6479779 in females, and rs10821938 and rs7923074 in males were significantly associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk. Under the dominant model, SNPs rs7073837, rs10821936, rs7896246, and rs6479778 in males only showed striking association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The additive model revealed that SNPs with significant association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were rs10821936 (both males and females); rs7073837, rs10740055, rs10994982, and rs4948487 (females only); and rs7089424, rs7896246, rs10821938, and rs7923074 (males only). In addition, the ARID5B haplotype block (CGAACACAA) showed a higher risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The haplotype (CCCGACTGC) was associated with protection against acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In conclusion, our study has shown that ARID5B variants are associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Yemeni children with several gender biases of ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms reported.","['Al-Absi, Boshra', 'Noor, Suzita M', 'Saif-Ali, Riyadh', 'Salem, Sameer D', 'Ahmed, Radwan H', 'Razif, Muhammad Fm', 'Muniandy, Sekaran']","['Al-Absi B', 'Noor SM', 'Saif-Ali R', 'Salem SD', 'Ahmed RH', 'Razif MF', 'Muniandy S']","['1 Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', '2 Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', ""3 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Sana'a University, Sana'a, Yemen."", ""3 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Sana'a University, Sana'a, Yemen."", '1 Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', '1 Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', '1 Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,['NOTNLM'],"['ARID5B', 'Childhood leukemia', 'genotyping', 'haplotype', 'single nucleotide polymorphism']",,2017/04/07 06:00,2017/04/19 06:00,['2017/04/07 06:00'],"['2017/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428317697573 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2017 Apr;39(4):1010428317697573. doi: 10.1177/1010428317697573.,,20170418,,"['0 (ARID5B protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Risk', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that CCL25/CCR9 promotes T-ALL metastasis. In the present study, we assessed the effects of CCL25 on Wnt expression and the effects of Wnt5a and CCL25 on PI3K/Akt and RhoA activation. Transwell assays and mouse xenograft experiments were utilized to assess the effects of Wnt5a and CCL25 on MOLT4 cell invasion, migration and metastasis. The effects of Wnt5a on MOLT4 cell actin polarization and pseudopodium formation were examined using laser scanning confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. CCL25 induced Wnt5a expression in MOLT4 cells by promoting protein kinase C (PKC) expression and activation. Wnt5a promoted MOLT4 cell migration, invasion, actin polarization, and lamellipodium and filopodia formation via PI3K/Akt-RhoA pathway activation. These effects were rescued by PI3K/Akt or RhoA knockdown or inhibition. Additionally, Wnt5a in cooperation with CCL25 promoted MOLT4 cell mouse liver metastasis and stimulated RhoA activation. These results show that CCL25/CCR9 upregulates Wnt5a by promoting PKC expression and activation in MOLT4 cells.

In this study, we investigated whether known biological subgroups of pediatric AML are reflected by a common microRNA (miRNA) expression pattern. We assayed 665 miRNAs on 165 pediatric AML samples. First, unsupervised clustering was performed to identify patient clusters with common miRNA expression profiles. Our analysis unraveled 14 clusters, seven of which had a known (cyto-)genetic denominator. Finally, a robust classifier was constructed to discriminate six molecular aberration groups: 11q23-rearrangements, t(8;21)(q22;q22), inv(16)(p13q22), t(15;17) (q21;q22), NPM1 and CEBPA mutations. The classifier achieved accuracies of 89%, 95%, 95%, 98%, 91% and 96%, respectively. Although lower sensitivities were obtained for the NPM1 and CEBPA (32% and 66%), relatively high sensitivities (84%-94%) were attained for the rest. Specificity was high in all groups (87%-100%). Due to a robust double-loop cross validation procedure employed, the classifier only employed 47 miRNAs to achieve the aforementioned accuracies. To validate the 47 miRNA signatures, we applied them to a publicly available adult AML dataset. Albeit partial overlap of the array platforms and molecular differences between pediatric and adult AML, the signatures performed reasonably well. This corroborates our claim that the identified miRNA signatures are not dominated by sample size bias in the pediatric AML dataset. In conclusion, cytogenetic subtypes of pediatric AML have distinct miRNA expression patterns. Reproducibility of the miRNA signatures in adult dataset suggests that the respective aberrations have a similar biology both in pediatric and adult AML.","['Obulkasim, Askar', 'Katsman-Kuipers, Jenny E', 'Verboon, Lonneke', 'Sanders, Mathijs', 'Touw, Ivo', 'Jongen-Lavrencic, Mojca', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Klusmann, Jan-Henning', 'Michel Zwaan, C', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Fornerod, Maarten']","['Obulkasim A', 'Katsman-Kuipers JE', 'Verboon L', 'Sanders M', 'Touw I', 'Jongen-Lavrencic M', 'Pieters R', 'Klusmann JH', 'Michel Zwaan C', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Fornerod M']","[""Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, The Netherlands."", ""Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, The Netherlands."", ""Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Hematology, ErasmusMC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, ErasmusMC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, ErasmusMC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, The Netherlands."", 'Prinses Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, German.', ""Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, The Netherlands."", ""Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, The Netherlands."", 'Prinses Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,PMC5464851,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'classification', 'cytogenetic aberration', 'microRNA', 'pediatric']",,2017/04/06 06:00,2018/03/14 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['16525 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.16525 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 May 16;8(20):33078-33085. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.16525.,,20180313,,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity of plant methanol and chloroform fractions was examined towards human acute myeloid leukemia (THP1) and human colon epithelial (Caco2) cancer cell lines, as well as CD 14 and IEC-6 normal cells by targeting various modulators of apoptosis or inflammation. Moreover, secondary metabolite pools (phenolic classes, alkaloids, terpenes, saponins) and antioxidant activities (DPPH, ABTS and O2- scavenging, as well as FRAP tests) were assessed in plant extracts. Both Euphorbia species appeared to be rich in phenolic compounds and terpenoids, Moreover, E. terracina polar and apolar fractions and E. paralias polar fraction were highly active against THP1 cells, with IC50 values of 2.08, 14.43 and 54.58mug/mL, respectively. However, no cytotoxicity was found against normal cells (CD14(+) monocytes). The results indicate that the three fractions induce apoptosis in THP1 cell line after 6h of exposure. Furthermore, apoptosis caused by apolar fraction was related to a caspase-dependent process, whereas other death pathways seemed to be involved with the polar fractions. An enhanced production of reactive oxygen species was detected upon cell treatment with plant extracts. Interestingly, they have no effect on cytokine TNF-alpha secretion in THP1 and normal cells compared to untreated cells, indicating that the three fractions caused no inflammation. Euphorbia terracina and E. paralias polar fractions showed strong antioxidant activity with potent scavenging capacity against DPPH, ABTS and superoxide radicals. Moreover, these fractions displayed a very high ferric reducing power. These findings confirm the strong antioxidant capacity of Euphorbia plants and suggest a targeted anti-cancer effect with a potent anti-proliferative property of E. terracina and E. paralias extracts, which induce programmed cell death in leukemia cell lines but not in normal monocytes cells.","['Ben Jannet, Soumaya', 'Hymery, Nolwenn', 'Bourgou, Soumaya', 'Jdey, Ahmed', 'Lachaal, Mokhtar', 'Magne, Christian', 'Ksouri, Riadh']","['Ben Jannet S', 'Hymery N', 'Bourgou S', 'Jdey A', 'Lachaal M', 'Magne C', 'Ksouri R']","['Laboratoire des Plantes Aromatiques et Medicinales, Centre de Biotechnologie de Borj-Cedria (CBBC), BP 901, 2050 Hammam-Lif, Tunisie; Universite de Tunis El Manar, Unite de Physiologie et Biochimie de la Reponse des Plantes aux Contraintes Abiotiques, Departement de Biologie, 1068 Tunis, Tunisie.

Currently, cytoreduction with medical therapy remains the mainstay of hyperthrombocytosis management. However, it offers a less-than-ideal option in situations where a rapid reduction in platelets is urgently needed, as in the presence of vital end-organ ischemia or to ameliorate of life-threatening hemorrhage. The role of thrombocytapheresis, or plateletpheresis, in hyperthrombocytosis has become increasingly obsolete given the proactive titration of cytoreductive therapies and early identification and correction of reversible causes of reactive thrombocytosis. Despite its narrowed indications, plateletpheresis continues to offer a valuable temporizing measure in platelet count reduction before cytoreductive agents exert their maximal effect. In this context, it is important for the treating physician to be aware of the symptoms and risks associated with hyperthrombocytosis to inform best clinical practices. In this review, we discuss the role of plateletpheresis in the modern-day management of hyperthrombocytosis in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms through a case based review of the literature. It becomes apparent throughout the discussion that the decision to perform plateletpheresis should be individualized based upon the clinical scenario, degree of thrombocytosis, available infrastructure and every patient's risk profile.","['Boddu, Prajwal', 'Falchi, Lorenzo', 'Hosing, Chitra', 'Newberry, Kate', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Boddu P', 'Falchi L', 'Hosing C', 'Newberry K', 'Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX, USA.

We hypothesized that lower treatment-related mortality (TRM) with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) would result in improved overall survival (OS) compared with myeloablative conditioning (MAC). To test this hypothesis, we performed a phase III randomized trial comparing MAC with RIC in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients and Methods Patients age 18 to 65 years with HCT comorbidity index </= 4 and < 5% marrow myeloblasts pre-HCT were randomly assigned to receive MAC (n = 135) or RIC (n = 137) followed by HCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors. The primary end point was OS 18 months post-random assignment based on an intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary end points included relapse-free survival (RFS) and TRM. Results Planned enrollment was 356 patients; accrual ceased at 272 because of high relapse incidence with RIC versus MAC (48.3%; 95% CI, 39.6% to 56.4% and 13.5%; 95% CI, 8.3% to 19.8%, respectively; P < .001). At 18 months, OS for patients in the RIC arm was 67.7% (95% CI, 59.1% to 74.9%) versus 77.5% (95% CI, 69.4% to 83.7%) for those in the MAC arm (difference, 9.8%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 20.3%; P = .07). TRM with RIC was 4.4% (95% CI, 1.8% to 8.9%) versus 15.8% (95% CI, 10.2% to 22.5%) with MAC ( P = .002). RFS with RIC was 47.3% (95% CI, 38.7% to 55.4%) versus 67.8% (95% CI, 59.1% to 75%) with MAC ( P < .01). Conclusion OS was higher with MAC, but this was not statistically significant. RIC resulted in lower TRM but higher relapse rates compared with MAC, with a statistically significant advantage in RFS with MAC. These data support the use of MAC as the standard of care for fit patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Scott, Bart L', 'Pasquini, Marcelo C', 'Logan, Brent R', 'Wu, Juan', 'Devine, Steven M', 'Porter, David L', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Warlick, Erica D', 'Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Hamadani, Mehdi', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Geller, Nancy L', 'Leifer, Eric', 'Le-Rademacher, Jennifer', 'Mendizabal, Adam M', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Deeg, H Joachim', 'Horwitz, Mitchell E']","['Scott BL', 'Pasquini MC', 'Logan BR', 'Wu J', 'Devine SM', 'Porter DL', 'Maziarz RT', 'Warlick ED', 'Fernandez HF', 'Alyea EP', 'Hamadani M', 'Bashey A', 'Giralt S', 'Geller NL', 'Leifer E', 'Le-Rademacher J', 'Mendizabal AM', 'Horowitz MM', 'Deeg HJ', 'Horwitz ME']","['Bart L.

We, therefore, aimed to systematically assess and quantitatively synthesize published data on the association of paternal consumption during preconception and maternal consumption during pregnancy with leukemia risk in childhood (0-14 years). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we searched PubMed (until February 2016) and the reference lists of the relevant studies. Observational studies examining the association between parental alcohol consumption and childhood leukemia were considered eligible. Data extracted from 39 case-control studies (over 16 000 leukemia cases and 30 000 controls) were pooled and summary-effect estimates were calculated. Subgroup analyses were carried out by main acute leukemia type [lymphoblastic or myeloid), cytogenetics/genetic polymorphisms, and specific alcohol beverages. We found a statistically significant dose-response association of any level of maternal alcohol consumption compared with nondrinking during pregnancy exclusively with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [odds ratio (OR)moderate consumption: 1.64, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.23-2.17 and ORhigh consumption: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.60-3.49]. In contrast, no association of paternal preconception consumption with any leukemia type was noted. In beverage-specific analyses, only a positive association of maternal wine drinking with childhood AML was found, which was more pronounced in analyses including only studies on infant leukemia (ORwine: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.16-3.90). The largest ever meta-analysis shows a sizeable, statistically significant dose-response association of maternal alcohol consumption during index pregnancy with AML risk. Future research exploring the role of genetic polymorphisms is anticipated to shed light on the underlying pathophysiology.","['Karalexi, Maria A', 'Dessypris, Nick', 'Thomopoulos, Thomas P', 'Ntouvelis, Evangelos', 'Kantzanou, Maria', 'Diamantaras, Andreas-Antonios', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Hatzipantelis, Emmanuel', 'Kourti, Maria', 'Polychronopoulou, Sophia', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia', 'Mora, Ana-M', 'Wunsch-Filho, Victor', 'Infante-Rivard, Claire', 'Loutradis, Dimitrios', 'Petridou, Eleni Th']","['Karalexi MA', 'Dessypris N', 'Thomopoulos TP', 'Ntouvelis E', 'Kantzanou M', 'Diamantaras AA', 'Moschovi M', 'Baka M', 'Hatzipantelis E', 'Kourti M', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Stiakaki E', 'Mora AM', 'Wunsch-Filho V', 'Infante-Rivard C', 'Loutradis D', 'Petridou ET']","[""aDepartment of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics bFirst Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, University of Athens cHaematology-Oncology Unit, First Department of Pediatrics, Athens University Medical School, 'Aghia Sophia' Children's Hospital dDepartment of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, 'Pan. & Agl.

The expression pattern and functional role of WDR5 during porcine preimplantation embryonic development, however, remain unknown. Our results showed that the transcripts and protein of WDR5 exhibited stage-specific expression pattern in porcine early embryos. Moreover, blastocyst rate and total cell number per blastocyst were reduced by RNAi-mediated silencing of WDR5 or pharmacological inhibition of WDR5. Knockdown of WDR5 also disturbed the expression of several pluripotency genes. Interestingly, tri-methylation of H3K4 (H3K4me3) level was dramatically increased by WDR5 depletion. Further analysis revealed that loss of MLL3 phenocopied WDR5 knockdown, triggering increased H3K4me3 level. Simultaneously, WDR5 depletion significantly decreased the levels of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) and its writer males absent on the first (MOF). Last but not least, WDR5 knockdown induced DNA damage and DNA repair defects during porcine preimplantation development. Taken together, results of described studies establish that WDR5 plays a significant role in porcine preimplantation embryos probably through regulating key epigenetic modifications and genome integrity.","['Ding, Biao', 'Cao, Zubing', 'Hong, Renyun', 'Li, Hui', 'Zuo, Xiaoyuan', 'Luo, Lei', 'Li, Yunsheng', 'Huang, Weiping', 'Li, Wenyong', 'Zhang, Kun', 'Zhang, Yunhai']","['Ding B', 'Cao Z', 'Hong R', 'Li H', 'Zuo X', 'Luo L', 'Li Y', 'Huang W', 'Li W', 'Zhang K', 'Zhang Y']","['Anhui Provincial Laboratory of Local Livestock and Poultry Genetical Resource Conservation and Breeding, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Embryo Development and Reproduction Regulation of Anhui Province, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Fuyang Normal University, Fuyang, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Laboratory of Local Livestock and Poultry Genetical Resource Conservation and Breeding, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Laboratory of Local Livestock and Poultry Genetical Resource Conservation and Breeding, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Laboratory of Local Livestock and Poultry Genetical Resource Conservation and Breeding, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Laboratory of Local Livestock and Poultry Genetical Resource Conservation and Breeding, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Laboratory of Local Livestock and Poultry Genetical Resource Conservation and Breeding, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Laboratory of Local Livestock and Poultry Genetical Resource Conservation and Breeding, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Laboratory of Local Livestock and Poultry Genetical Resource Conservation and Breeding, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Embryo Development and Reproduction Regulation of Anhui Province, College of Biological and Food Engineering, Fuyang Normal University, Fuyang, Anhui, China.', 'Laboratory of Mammalian Molecular Embryology, College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Laboratory of Local Livestock and Poultry Genetical Resource Conservation and Breeding, College of Animal Science and Technology, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'H3K4me3', 'H4K16ac', 'WDR5', 'embryo', 'pig']",,2017/04/06 06:00,2018/03/13 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['3096901 [pii]', '10.1093/biolre/iox020 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2017 Apr 1;96(4):758-771. doi: 10.1093/biolre/iox020.,,20180312,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Swine/*embryology', 'Transcriptome']",,,"['(c) The Authors 2017.

In this study, we report our experience from 119 patients with T-PLL. Patients and methods: We reviewed the clinico-pathologic records of 119 consecutive patients with T-PLL, who presented to our institution between 1990 and 2016. Results: One hundred and nineteen patients with T-PLL were analysed. Complex karyotype and aberrations in chromosome 14 were seen in 65% and 52% patients, respectively. Seventy-five patients (63%) were previously untreated and 43 (37%) were initially treated outside our institution. Sixty-three previously untreated patients (84%) received frontline therapies. Overall, 95 patients (80%) have died. Median overall survival (OS) from diagnosis was 19 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 16-26 months]. Using recursive partitioning (RP), we found that patients with hemoglobin < 9.3 g/dl, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >/= 1668 IU/l, white blood cell >/= 208 K/l and beta2M >/= 8 mg/l had significantly inferior OS and patients with hemoglobin < 9.3 g/dl had inferior progression-free survival (PFS). In multivariate analysis, we identified that presence of pleural effusion [hazard ratio (HR) 2.08 (95% CI 1.11-3.9); P = 0.02], high LDH (>/= 1668 IU/l) [HR 2.5 (95% CI 1.20-4.24); P < 0.001)], and low hemoglobin (< 9.3 g/dl) [HR 0.33 (95% CI 0.14-0.75); P = 0.008] were associated with shorter OS. Fifty-five previously untreated patients received treatment with an alemtuzumab-based regimen (42 monotherapy and 13 combination with pentostatin). Overall response rate, complete remission rate (CR) for single-agent alemtuzumab and alemtuzumab combined with pentostatin were 83%, 66% and 82%, 73% respectively. In patients who achieved initial CR, stem cell transplantation was not associated with longer PFS and OS. Conclusion: Outcomes in T-PLL remain poor.

Aspergillus spp infection is not the major cause of morbidity in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), mortality among patients treated for it is tremendous. Moreover, invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an independent risk factor of hospital costs and length of stay. The prevalence of this disease is inversely correlated with the immunocompetence of individuals; for instance, the incidence of IA among patients with leukemia is estimated as high as 12.7%. Although there is a significant improvement in the antifungal armamentarium, the appropriate treatment is still being given too late, mostly because of late diagnosis. As well as the diagnosis, the criteria for recognition of IA constitute a challenge. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review, based on a case report, is to introduce the problem of poor diagnosis and treatment of IA, especially in the critical care settings. The presented scenario is an example which assists in showing the evidence-based medicine (EBM) approach to the treatment of fungal infections. Furthermore, to demonstrate the appropriate approach to diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis, the guidelines of The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) are presented. CONCLUSIONS: According to presented literature, Galactomannan assay enables early diagnosis and remains a specific and sensitive tool to diagnose Asppergillosis, both in serum and BAL fluid. The guidelines recommend voriconazole as a first line treatment in IA. Failure to detect and implement proper antifungal treatment may lead to fatal consequences, as in the presented case.","['Borys, Michal', 'Piwowarczyk, Pawel', 'Sysiak, Justyna', 'Czuczwar, Miroslaw', 'Prystupa, Andrzej']","['Borys M', 'Piwowarczyk P', 'Sysiak J', 'Czuczwar M', 'Prystupa A']","['II Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'II Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'II Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'II Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Lublin.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Poland,Ann Agric Environ Med,Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,9500166,,,,,2017/04/06 06:00,2017/09/08 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1233966 [pii]', '10.5604/12321966.1233966 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Agric Environ Med. 2017 Mar 21;24(1):100-103. doi: 10.5604/12321966.1233966.,,20170907,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Mannans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Aspergillus/*isolation & purification', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/chemistry', 'Critical Care', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Mannans/analysis', 'Middle Aged']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects in rat were modeled and used to make clinical predictions for human populations with healthy baseline blood counts. At doses >10 mg, a dose-dependent effect on circulating platelets is expected, with similar predicted changes for both q.d. and b.i.d. dose schedules. These results suggest that at predicted efficacious doses, AZD5153 is likely to have some reductions in the clinical platelet counts, but within the normal range at projected efficacious doses. The model was then extended to incorporate preexisting myelosuppression where bone marrow function is inhibited by acute myeloid leukemia. Under these conditions, duration of platelet count recovery has the potential to be prolonged due to drug-induced myelosuppression.","['Collins, T A', 'Hattersley, M M', 'Yates, Jwt', 'Clark, E', 'Mondal, M', 'Mettetal, J T']","['Collins TA', 'Hattersley MM', 'Yates J', 'Clark E', 'Mondal M', 'Mettetal JT']","['Drug Safety and Metabolism, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK.', 'Oncology iMED, AstraZeneca, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Oncology iMED, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK.', 'Oncology iMED, AstraZeneca, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Drug Safety and Metabolism, AstraZeneca, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Drug Safety and Metabolism, AstraZeneca, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170527,United States,CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol,CPT: pharmacometrics & systems pharmacology,101580011,PMC5488126,,,,2017/04/06 06:00,2018/03/03 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/psp4.12194 [doi]'],ppublish,CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol. 2017 Jun;6(6):357-364. doi: 10.1002/psp4.12194.

We prospectively tested the predictive value of immature platelets, measured as immature platelet fraction (IPF) on the XE-5000 (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) or percentage of reticulated platelets (rPT) on the CD Sapphire (Abbott Diagnostics, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to separate immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) from BMF (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anaemia). We analysed 58 samples of patients with BMF, 47 samples of patients with ITP and 97 controls. Median rPT (CD Sapphire) was increased to 9.0% in ITP and to 10.9% in BMF, compared to 1.9% in controls. Median IPF (XE-5000) was 16.2% in ITP, 10.2% in BMF and 2.5% in controls. We found an inverse correlation between high fractions of immature platelets and low platelet counts in thrombocytopenic samples regardless of the diagnosis. In conclusion, we observed a broad overlap of immature platelets between ITP and BMF, which may be caused by an accelerated release of immature platelets in any thrombocytopenic state and decreased production in many patients with ITP. Despite this, IPF (XE-5000) had some power to discriminate ITP from BMF, whereas rPT (CD Sapphire) was of no predictive value.","['Cybulska, Annalina', 'Meintker, Lisa', 'Ringwald, Jurgen', 'Krause, Stefan W']","['Cybulska A', 'Meintker L', 'Ringwald J', 'Krause SW']","['University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 - Haematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Haemostaseology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 5 - Haematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20170405,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,['NOTNLM'],"['* AML', '* IPF', '* ITP', '* MDS', '*immature platelets']",,2017/04/06 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14628 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 May;177(4):612-619. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14628.

However, little is known regarding the function of PRDM1 in the progression of lung cancer. Here, we found that PRDM1 is expressed in normal human lung epithelium but is downregulated in lung cancer cells. Decreased expression of PRDM1 correlates with poor prognosis in lung cancer. Depletion of PRDM1 in lung cancer cells promotes cellular invasion and anoikis resistance in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. PRDM1 is silenced by an ectopically expressed lymphocyte-specific transcription factor Aiolos. The transcription of these two genes is negatively correlated in 206 lung epithelial cell lines. Our results indicate that PRDM1 functions as a tumour suppressor in lung cancer.","['Zhu, Zhiyan', 'Wang, Hao', 'Wei, Yiliang', 'Meng, Fanrong', 'Liu, Zhe', 'Zhang, Zhenfa']","['Zhu Z', 'Wang H', 'Wei Y', 'Meng F', 'Liu Z', 'Zhang Z']","['1 Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', '2 Tianjin Research Center of Basic Medical Science, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', '1 Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', '1 Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', '1 Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', '1 Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', '3 Department of Lung Cancer, Lung Cancer Center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,['NOTNLM'],"['PRDM1', 'gene silencing', 'lung cancer', 'metastasis', 'transcriptional regulation']",,2017/04/06 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428317695929 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2017 Apr;39(4):1010428317695929. doi: 10.1177/1010428317695929.,,20170410,,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (IKZF3 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anoikis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Prognosis', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional cytogenetic abnormalities are recognized as clonal evolution at the cytogenetic level. Fifty-nine patients (41%) acquired ACA at the first relapse. The incidences of ACA acquisition varied depending on cytogenetic abnormalities at initial diagnosis. Multivariate analysis identified t(8;21), complex karyotype, and a duration of fewer than 12 months of complete remission as independent predisposing factors for ACA acquisition. Notably, patients with ACA acquisition showed a significantly lower second complete remission rate compared with those without ACA acquisition (20.0% vs 72.5%, respectively, P < .001). Furthermore, the 3-year overall survival rates after the first relapse were significantly different between patients with and without ACA acquisition (8.5% vs 36.8%, respectively, P < .001). This prognostic significance was confirmed with multivariate analysis. The hazard ratio of ACA acquisition was similar or higher than reported prognostic factors for relapsed AML patients. These findings suggested that clonal evolution detected with conventional cytogenetic analysis at the first relapse induces severe chemo-refractory characteristics in AML cells and should be considered as a potent prognostic factor when evaluating accurate prognosis in relapsed AML patients.","['Shimizu, Hiroaki', 'Yokohama, Akihiko', 'Ishizaki, Takuma', 'Hatsumi, Nahoko', 'Takada, Satoru', 'Saitoh, Takayuki', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Nojima, Yoshihisa', 'Handa, Hiroshi']","['Shimizu H', 'Yokohama A', 'Ishizaki T', 'Hatsumi N', 'Takada S', 'Saitoh T', 'Sakura T', 'Nojima Y', 'Handa H']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Division of Blood Transfusion Service, Faculty of Medicine, Gunma University Hospital, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Gunma University School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Gunma University, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170404,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'clonal evolution', 'cytogenetic abnormality', 'relapse', 't(8;21)']",,2017/04/06 06:00,2018/03/13 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2393 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2018 Feb;36(1):252-257. doi: 10.1002/hon.2393.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 2015, we treated 41 pediatric patients (26 males, 15 females; age ranging from 3.3 to 15.7 years, median 9-year-old) of pediatric brain tumors [17 medulloblastomas, 7 primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), 3 pineoblastomas, 6 non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCT), 8 gliomas (including 4 ependymomas, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 1 oligodendroglioma, 1 pilocytic astrocytoma, 1 astroblastoma)] with high-dose craniospinal irradiation. Follow-up ranged from 14.0 to 189.2 months (median 86.0 months, mean 81.5 months), the irradiation dose to the whole neural axis ranged from 18 to 41.4 Gy, and the total local dose from 43.2 to 60.4 Gy. All patients underwent follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies at least once a year. Diagnosis of cystic malacia was based solely on MRI findings. Of the 41 patients, 31 were censored during their follow-up due to recurrence of the primary disease (n = 5), detection of secondary leukemia after development of cystic malacia (n = 1), or the absence of cystic malacia on the last follow-up MRI study (n = 25). We also evaluated the development of post-irradiation cavernous angioma and white matter changes. RESULTS: Following irradiation treatment, 11 patients developed 19 cystic malacia during a median course of 30.8 months (range 14.9 to 59.3 months). The site of predilection for cystic malacia was white matter around trigone of lateral ventricles with an incidence of 47.4% (9 of 19 lesions, 7 in 11 patients). Patients with supratentorial tumors developed cystic malacia statistically earlier than the patients with infratentorial tumors (P = 0.0178, log-rank test). Among the same patient group, incidence of post-irradiation cavernous angioma increased progressively, while the incidence of post-irradiation cystic malacia did not increase after 5 years. White matter degeneration developed earlier than cystic malacia or cavernous angioma, and these three clinical entities developed mutually exclusive of each other. CONCLUSION: We attribute the higher incidence of post-irradiation cystic malacia, in our long-term follow-up study, to the cranial irradiation for pediatric brain tumors, particularly supratentorial brain tumors, and recommend a regular, long-term follow-up of brain tumor patients treated with cranial irradiation.","['Yamasaki, Fumiyuki', 'Takayasu, Takeshi', 'Nosaka, Ryo', 'Nishibuchi, Ikuno', 'Kawaguchi, Hiroshi', 'Kolakshyapati, Manish', 'Onishi, Shumpei', 'Saito, Taiichi', 'Sugiyama, Kazuhiko', 'Kobayashi, Masao', 'Kurisu, Kaoru']","['Yamasaki F', 'Takayasu T', 'Nosaka R', 'Nishibuchi I', 'Kawaguchi H', 'Kolakshyapati M', 'Onishi S', 'Saito T', 'Sugiyama K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Kurisu K']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan. fyama@hiroshima-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology & Neuro-oncology Program, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170404,Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cavernous angioma', 'Cystic malacia', 'Irradiation', 'Leukoencephalopathy']",,2017/04/06 06:00,2018/03/21 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2017/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00381-017-3400-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00381-017-3400-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 2017 Jun;33(6):957-964. doi: 10.1007/s00381-017-3400-7.

Of 59 patients who discontinued treatment, 47 (80%) discontinued treatment due to AEs; 50% of the AEs causing drug discontinuation were of grade 2 severity. Compared to the second-line setting, discontinuation occurred more rapidly in the first-line setting (2.9 vs. 15.6 months, p = 0.015). Pleural effusion occurred in 35% (28/81) of the patients with dasatinib and led to dasatinib discontinuation in 14 patients (grade 2 of 79%).

In the present study, we examined the biological effects of EP300-ZNF384 expression induced by retrovirus-mediated gene transduction in an REH B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, and observed the acquisition of the HSC gene expression signature and an up-regulation of GATA3 gene expression, as assessed by microarray analysis. In contrast, the gene expression profile induced by wild-type ZNF384 in REH cells was significantly different from that by EP300-ZNF384 expression. Together with the results of reporter assays, which revealed the enhancement of GATA3-promoter activity by EP300-ZNF384 expression, these findings suggest that EP300-ZNF384 mediates GATA3 gene expression and may be involved in the acquisition of the HSC gene expression signature and characteristic immunophenotype in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.","['Yaguchi, Akinori', 'Ishibashi, Takeshi', 'Terada, Kazuki', 'Ueno-Yokohata, Hitomi', 'Saito, Yuya', 'Fujimura, Junya', 'Shimizu, Toshiaki', 'Ohki, Kentaro', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka']","['Yaguchi A', 'Ishibashi T', 'Terada K', 'Ueno-Yokohata H', 'Saito Y', 'Fujimura J', 'Shimizu T', 'Ohki K', 'Manabe A', 'Kiyokawa N']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-1-3 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8421, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-1-3 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8421, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-1-3 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8421, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-1-3 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8421, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1 Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-8560, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan. kiyokawa-n@ncchd.go.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170404,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD33', 'EP300', 'GATA3', 'Transcription', 'ZNF384']",,2017/04/06 06:00,2017/10/06 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2220-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2220-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Aug;106(2):269-281. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2220-6.

Current treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is directed against the constitutively active ABL1 domain of the fusion protein, and minimal residual disease (MRD) after therapy is monitored by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) of the fusion transcript. Here, we describe a novel approach to detect and enumerate cells positive for the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein by combining the in situ proximity ligation assay with flow cytometry as readout (PLA-flow). By targeting of the BCR and ABL1 parts of the fusion protein with one antibody each, and creating strong fluorescent signals through rolling circle amplification, PLA-flow allowed sensitive detection of cells positive for the BCR-ABL1 fusion at frequencies as low as one in 10,000. Importantly, the flow cytometric results correlated strongly to those of RQ-PCR, both in diagnostic testing and for MRD measurements over time. In summary, we believe this flow cytometry-based method can serve as an attractive approach for routine measurement of cells harboring BCR-ABL1 fusions, also allowing simultaneously assessment of other cell surface markers as well as sensitive longitudinal follow-up.","['Lof, Liza', 'Arngarden, Linda', 'Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla', 'Siart, Benjamin', 'Jansson, Mattias', 'Dahlin, Joakim S', 'Thorn, Ingrid', 'Christiansson, Lisa', 'Hermansson, Monica', 'Larsson, Anders', 'Ahlstrand, Erik', 'Walinder, Goran', 'Soderberg, Ola', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Landegren, Ulf', 'Kamali-Moghaddam, Masood']","['Lof L', 'Arngarden L', 'Olsson-Stromberg U', 'Siart B', 'Jansson M', 'Dahlin JS', 'Thorn I', 'Christiansson L', 'Hermansson M', 'Larsson A', 'Ahlstrand E', 'Walinder G', 'Soderberg O', 'Rosenquist R', 'Landegren U', 'Kamali-Moghaddam M']","['Dept. of Immunology, Genetics & Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Genetics & Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Medical Science and Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Genetics & Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Genetics & Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Genetics & Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Genetics & Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Medical Science and Division of Biochemical Structure and Function, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Orebro University Hospital, Orebro, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Orebro University Hospital, Orebro, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Genetics & Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Genetics & Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Immunology, Genetics & Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. masood.kamali@igp.uu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170404,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,PMC5429594,,,,2017/04/06 06:00,2018/08/31 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-017-00755-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-017-00755-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Apr 4;7(1):623. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-00755-y.,,20180830,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3007-9875', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2883-1925', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7820-1000']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The positivity rate of DAPK methylation was significantly higher in ALL patients (29.1%) than in AML patients group (5%) and normal subjects (0%) (P<0.01). No correlation was found between DAPK gene methylation and the clinical features in ALL patients (P>0.05). DAPK mRNA expression level differed significantly among the 3 groups (P=0.000), and was the highest in normal subjects and the lowest in ALL patients. In ALL patients, the expression level of DAPK mRNA showed a significant inverse correlation with DAPK promoter methylation (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The methylation rate of DAPK gene is higher in untreated ALL patients than in AML patients and normal subjects. DAPK gene methylation is not correlated with the clinical features of ALL patients but is probably related with the low gene expression level of DAPK in these patients.","['Zhao, Wei-Hua', 'Meng, Fan-Yi', 'Lai, Yong-Rong', 'Peng, Zhi-Gang', 'Ma, Jie']","['Zhao WH', 'Meng FY', 'Lai YR', 'Peng ZG', 'Ma J']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning 530021, China.E-mail: zhaowh21@163.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,PMC6780430,,,,2017/04/06 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2017 Mar 20;37(3):407-410.,,20181105,,['EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', '*DNA Methylation', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by the presence of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene encoding the BCR-ABL oncoprotein characterized by a deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. Targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, or ponatinib have profoundly changed the natural history of the disease with a major impact on survival. Indeed, most patients diagnosed today can enjoy a near normal life expectancy. The efficacy of TKI treatment can be accurately evaluated by a molecular monitoring based on the quantification of BCR-ABL1 mRNA transcripts and the detection of resistance mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. International recommendations for an optimal management of CML using biological parameters are regularly published. They were designed to evaluate the response to the treatment and to consider, if necessary, a switch to another TKI. A sustained and deep molecular response is obtained in a significant percentage of patients. Clinical trials of TKI discontinuation were performed in such a population, and half of patients do not relapse. In the remaining patients, a rapid appearance of the malignant clone was observed, undoubtedly the consequence of the persistence of residual leukemic stem cells (LSCs). How to discriminate patients who may safely stop TKI? How to target residual LSCs, and do we have to eradicate all these cells? Additional research investigation and clinical trials are needed to answer these questions in order to consider a potential cure of CML.","['Sorel, Nathalie', 'Cayssials, Emilie', 'Brizard, Francoise', 'Chomel, Jean-Claude']","['Sorel N', 'Cayssials E', 'Brizard F', 'Chomel JC']","['Service de cancerologie biologique, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""Service d'oncologie hematologique et therapie cellulaire, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", ""Service d'hematologie biologique, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", 'Service de cancerologie biologique, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),Annales de biologie clinique,2984690R,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'molecular monitoring', 'resistance', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,2017/04/06 06:00,2017/09/29 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['abc.2017.1233 [pii]', '10.1684/abc.2017.1233 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Biol Clin (Paris). 2017 Apr 1;75(2):129-145. doi: 10.1684/abc.2017.1233.,,20170928,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/physiology']",,,,,,,,,Actualisation des traitements et du suivi moleculaire dans la prise en charge de la leucemie myeloide chronique.,,,,,,

The study examined 93 cattle with a high proviral load and 266 with a low proviral load. Three SNPs showed a significant association with proviral load. One SNP was detected in the CNTN3 gene on chromosome 22, and two (which were not in linkage disequilibrium) were detected in the bovine major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 23. These results suggest that polymorphisms in the major histocompatibility complex region affect proviral load. This is the first report to detect SNPs associated with BLV proviral load in Japanese Black cattle using whole genome association study, and understanding host factors may provide important clues for controlling the spread of BLV in Japanese Black cattle.","['Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Sasaki, Shinji', 'Meripet, Polat', 'Sugimoto, Yoshikazu', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Takeshima SN', 'Sasaki S', 'Meripet P', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Aida Y']","['Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.', 'Shirakawa Institute of Animal Genetics, Japan Livestock Technology Association, Odakura, Nishigo, Fukushima, 961-8061, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.', 'Shirakawa Institute of Animal Genetics, Japan Livestock Technology Association, Odakura, Nishigo, Fukushima, 961-8061, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Diseases Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan. aida@riken.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20170404,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC5379713,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bovine leukemia virus', '*Major histocompatibility complex', '*Whole genome association study']",,2017/04/06 06:00,2017/05/11 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2017/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-017-0348-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-017-0348-3 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2017 Apr 4;14(1):24. doi: 10.1186/s12977-017-0348-3.,,20170510,,['0 (Contactins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Contactins/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*genetics/immunology/*virology', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Japan', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*growth & development', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proviruses/*growth & development', '*Viral Load']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant hGM-CSF is produced industrially using the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by large-scale fermentation. The methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, has emerged as an alternative host cell system due to its shorter and less immunogenic glycosylation pattern together with higher cell density growth and higher secreted protein yield than S. cerevisiae. In this study, we compared the pipeline from gene to recombinant protein in these two yeasts. RESULTS: Codon optimization in silico for both yeast species showed no difference in frequent codon usage. However, rhGM-CSF expressed from S. cerevisiae BY4742 showed a significant discrepancy in molecular weight from those of P. pastoris X33. Analysis showed purified rhGM-CSF species with molecular weights ranging from 30 to more than 60 kDa. Fed-batch fermentation over 72 h showed that rhGM-CSF was more highly secreted from P. pastoris than S. cerevisiae (285 and 64 mg total secreted protein/L, respectively). Ion exchange chromatography gave higher purity and recovery than hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purified rhGM-CSF from P. pastoris was 327 times more potent than rhGM-CSF from S. cerevisiae in terms of proliferative stimulating capacity on the hGM-CSF-dependent cell line, TF-1. CONCLUSION: Our data support a view that the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris is an effective recombinant host for heterologous rhGM-CSF production.","['Tran, Anh-Minh', 'Nguyen, Thanh-Thao', 'Nguyen, Cong-Thuan', 'Huynh-Thi, Xuan-Mai', 'Nguyen, Cao-Tri', 'Trinh, Minh-Thuong', 'Tran, Linh-Thuoc', 'Cartwright, Stephanie P', 'Bill, Roslyn M', 'Tran-Van, Hieu']","['Tran AM', 'Nguyen TT', 'Nguyen CT', 'Huynh-Thi XM', 'Nguyen CT', 'Trinh MT', 'Tran LT', 'Cartwright SP', 'Bill RM', 'Tran-Van H']","['Faculty of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Science, VNU-HCM, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Science, VNU-HCM, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Science, VNU-HCM, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Science, VNU-HCM, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Science, VNU-HCM, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Science, VNU-HCM, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Science, VNU-HCM, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.', 'School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.', 'Faculty of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Science, VNU-HCM, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. tvhieu@hcmus.edu.vn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170404,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,PMC5379694,['NOTNLM'],"['Bioactivity', 'Fermentation', 'P. pastoris', 'S. cerevisiae', 'TF-1 cell', 'rhGM-CSF']",,2017/04/06 06:00,2017/04/25 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13104-017-2471-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s13104-017-2471-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2017 Apr 4;10(1):148. doi: 10.1186/s13104-017-2471-6.,,20170424,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2782-5232'],"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fermentation', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Molecular Weight', 'Pichia/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics', 'Species Specificity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents a new method to probe and characterize cell mechanical properties through dielectrophoresis (DEP)-based cell stretching manipulation and actin cytoskeleton modeling. METHODS: Leukemia NB4 cells were used as cell line, and changes in their biological properties were examined after chemotherapy treatment with doxorubicin (DOX). DEP-integrated microfluidic chip was utilized as a low-cost and efficient tool to study the deformability of cells. DEP forces used in cell stretching were first evaluated through computer simulation, and the results were compared with modeling equations and with the results of optical stretching (OT) experiments. Structural parameters were then extracted by fitting the experimental data into the actin cytoskeleton model, and the underlying mechanical properties of the cells were subsequently characterized. RESULTS: The DEP forces generated under different voltage inputs were calculated and the results from different approaches demonstrate good approximations to the force estimation. Both DEP and OT stretching experiments confirmed that DOX-treated NB4 cells were stiffer than the untreated cells. The structural parameters extracted from the model and the confocal images indicated significant change in actin network after DOX treatment. CONCLUSION: The proposed DEP method combined with actin cytoskeleton modeling is a simple engineering tool to characterize the mechanical properties of cells.","['Bai, Guohua', 'Li, Ying', 'Chu, Henry K', 'Wang, Kaiqun', 'Tan, Qiulin', 'Xiong, Jijun', 'Sun, Dong']","['Bai G', 'Li Y', 'Chu HK', 'Wang K', 'Tan Q', 'Xiong J', 'Sun D']","['Key Laboratory of Instrumentation Science and Dynamic Measurement, Ministry of Education, North University of China, Room 418, Building No. 14, No. 3 Xueyuan Road, Taiyuan, 030051, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, 83 Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, SAR of China.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, SAR of China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Mechanics, Taiyuan University of Technology, No. 79, West Yingze Street, Taiyuan, 030024, Shanxi, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Instrumentation Science and Dynamic Measurement, Ministry of Education, North University of China, Room 418, Building No. 14, No. 3 Xueyuan Road, Taiyuan, 030051, Shanxi, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Instrumentation Science and Dynamic Measurement, Ministry of Education, North University of China, Room 418, Building No. 14, No. 3 Xueyuan Road, Taiyuan, 030051, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, 83 Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, SAR of China. medsun@cityu.edu.hk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170404,England,Biomed Eng Online,Biomedical engineering online,101147518,PMC5381122,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell stretching', 'Cytoskeleton model', 'Dielectrophoresis', 'Mechanical property', 'Optical tweezers']",,2017/04/06 06:00,2017/04/18 06:00,['2017/04/06 06:00'],"['2016/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12938-017-0329-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12938-017-0329-8 [pii]']",epublish,Biomed Eng Online. 2017 Apr 4;16(1):41. doi: 10.1186/s12938-017-0329-8.,,20170417,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3945-4037'],,IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Electrophoresis/economics/instrumentation/*methods', 'Humans', '*Mechanical Phenomena', 'Mechanotransduction, Cellular', '*Models, Biological', 'Stress, Mechanical']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, it is considered an extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) similar to myeloid sarcoma, also known as a chloroma. MLC often develops in patients with an established diagnosis of AML and is only rarely seen before the onset of systemic disease. Even more rarely, some patients are found to have an underlying nonleukemic bone marrow disease, such as a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It is in these latter settings that the somewhat perplexing terminology aleukemic leukemia cutis (ALC) has been used widely. As may be imagined, establishing a diagnosis of ALC can be problematic and typically requires a high index of suspicion with careful integration of clinical, histopathological, and laboratory data. Once a diagnosis of ALC is made, a complete hematologic workup, including assessment of the patient's bone marrow, is essential because a diagnosis of MLC (with or without systemic leukemia) generally indicates a poor prognosis. When discovered in a patient with MDS, MLC has been suggested to herald progression toward more advanced disease. We present a rare case of so-called aleukemic myeloid leukemia cutis in an 82-year-old man subsequently diagnosed as having MDS without progression to overt AML. This case also illustrates a seemingly rare Kikuchi disease-like inflammatory pattern that obscured the underlying leukemic infiltrate in the skin, delaying its recognition.","['Khieu, Michelle', 'Beauvais, Alexis', 'Matz, Rebecca', 'Bersabe, Adrian', 'Brown, Patrick', 'Brown, Alexander', 'Fillman, Eric', 'Hall, Jordan']","['Khieu M', 'Beauvais A', 'Matz R', 'Bersabe A', 'Brown P', 'Brown A', 'Fillman E', 'Hall J']","['From the Departments of Pathology, Internal Medicine, and Hematology/Oncology, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, and Dermatology, San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, Lackland Air Force Base, Lackland, Texas.', 'From the Departments of Pathology, Internal Medicine, and Hematology/Oncology, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, and Dermatology, San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, Lackland Air Force Base, Lackland, Texas.', 'From the Departments of Pathology, Internal Medicine, and Hematology/Oncology, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, and Dermatology, San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, Lackland Air Force Base, Lackland, Texas.', 'From the Departments of Pathology, Internal Medicine, and Hematology/Oncology, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, and Dermatology, San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, Lackland Air Force Base, Lackland, Texas.', 'From the Departments of Pathology, Internal Medicine, and Hematology/Oncology, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, and Dermatology, San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, Lackland Air Force Base, Lackland, Texas.', 'From the Departments of Pathology, Internal Medicine, and Hematology/Oncology, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, and Dermatology, San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, Lackland Air Force Base, Lackland, Texas.', 'From the Departments of Pathology, Internal Medicine, and Hematology/Oncology, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, and Dermatology, San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, Lackland Air Force Base, Lackland, Texas.', 'From the Departments of Pathology, Internal Medicine, and Hematology/Oncology, San Antonio Military Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, and Dermatology, San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, Lackland Air Force Base, Lackland, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,,,,,2017/04/05 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2017/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000634 [doi]', 'SMJ50361 [pii]']",ppublish,South Med J. 2017 Apr;110(4):308-313. doi: 10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000634.,,20170605,,,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Histiocytic Necrotizing Lymphadenitis/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The percentages of CD3+ cells producing cytokines were dependent on age, more so in CML patients than in healthy controls, and they negatively correlated with the number of leukocytes. Patients with an optimal therapy outcome possessed higher percentages of cytokine-producing CD3+ cells at diagnosis than those with nonoptimal outcomes.

Thus far, the mechanism of epigenetic silencing of the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase gene that occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells remains poorly understood. METHODS: The expressions of the target molecules were determined by quantitative real time PCR and western blot, respectively. Bisulfite sequencing PCR was used to detect methylation status of DNA CpG. The lentiviral vectors were applied to modify gene expression. RESULTS: In the present study, we found that the promoter 2 of SHP-1 gene is located between positions from -577bp to +300bp, and 22 CpG sites contained in positions -353bp approximately +182bp are aberrantly methylated in K562 cells. In vitro, we demonstrated that DNMT1 silencing induced demethylation of the 22 CpG sites located in the SHP-1 promoter and re-expression of SHP-1 gene in K562 cells. Moreover, we proved that the expression levels of DNMT1 and SHP-1 mRNA and protein were negatively correlated in K562 cells and BM aspirates mononuclear cells from CML patients. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results indicate that DNMT1 mediates aberrant methylation and silencing of SHP-1 gene in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, and provide a novel therapeutic target for CML.","['Li, Yinghua', 'Liu, Xuedong', 'Guo, Xiufeng', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Luo, Jianmin']","['Li Y', 'Liu X', 'Guo X', 'Liu X', 'Luo J']","['Department of Hematology, Harrison International Peace Hospital, Hengshui, Hebei Province, 053000, PR China.
