Uniformly elevated expression of TLR-9, occasional MYD88 mutations, and BCR specificity for DNA or Ags physically linked to DNA together suggest that TLR-9 signaling is important in driving B-CLL growth in patients. Nevertheless, reports of apoptosis after B-CLL exposure to CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) raised questions about a central role for TLR-9. Because normal memory B cells proliferate vigorously to ODN+IL-15, a cytokine found in stromal cells of bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen, we examined whether this was true for B-CLL cells. Through a CFSE-based assay for quantitatively monitoring in vitro clonal proliferation/survival, we show that IL-15 precludes TLR-9-induced apoptosis and permits significant B-CLL clonal expansion regardless of the clone's BCR mutation status. A robust response to ODN+IL-15 was positively linked to presence of chromosomal anomalies (trisomy-12 or ataxia telangiectasia mutated anomaly + del13q14) and negatively linked to a very high proportion of CD38(+) cells within the blood-derived B-CLL population. Furthermore, a clone's intrinsic potential for in vitro growth correlated directly with doubling time in blood, in the case of B-CLL with Ig H chain V region-unmutated BCR and <30% CD38(+) cells in blood. Finally, in vitro high-proliferator status was statistically linked to diminished patient survival. These findings, together with immunohistochemical evidence of apoptotic cells and IL-15-producing cells proximal to B-CLL pseudofollicles in patient spleens, suggest that collaborative ODN and IL-15 signaling may promote in vivo B-CLL growth.","['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Mongini, Patricia K A', 'Gupta, Rashmi', 'Boyle, Erin', 'Nieto, Jennifer', 'Lee, Hyunjoo', 'Stein, Joanna', 'Bandovic, Jela', 'Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti', 'Chu, Charles C', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Mongini PK', 'Gupta R', 'Boyle E', 'Nieto J', 'Lee H', 'Stein J', 'Bandovic J', 'Stankovic T', 'Barrientos J', 'Kolitz JE', 'Allen SL', 'Rai K', 'Chu CC', 'Chiorazzi N']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Manhasset, NY 11030;

The present study aimed to elucidate the effect of AMFR on the regulation of proliferation in an acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP1. THP1 cells were transfected with AMFRtargeted small interfering (si)RNA and a plasmid encoding a truncated AMFR, AMFRC, (pcDNA3.1AMFRC). The mRNA and protein levels of AMFR and the downstream targets, rhoassociated, coiledcoil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2), cyclin D1, and Bcell lymphoma (Bcl)2, were measured using reverse transcriptionquantitatibe polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analyses. The effects on cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated using flow cytometry. The present study successfully established the knockdown of AMFR and expression of AMFRC in the THP1 cells. Downregulation of AMFR induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and increased apoptosis of the THP1 cells (all P<0.05). The AMFR siRNA increased the percentage of early apoptotic cells between 3.88+/-1.43 and 19.58+/-4.29% (P<0.05). The expression levels of ROCK2, cyclin D1 and Bcl2 were reduced by the downregulation of AMFR and enhanced by overexpression of AMFRC. In conclusion, AMFR appears to be crucial for the proliferation of the THP1 acute monocytic leukemia cell line. Therefore, AMFR may represent a potential target for the treatment of acute monocytic leukemia.",,"['Wang, Yingchao', 'Ma, Lina', 'Wang, Chunmei', 'Sheng, Guangyao', 'Feng, Lei', 'Yin, Chuyun']","['Wang Y', 'Ma L', 'Wang C', 'Sheng G', 'Feng L', 'Yin C']","['Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000, P.R.

Thereby, in the present study we aimed to determine the role of distinct monocyte subsets in the prognostication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Moreover, we set out to analyze the effects of standard immune chemotherapy on different monocyte subsets and levels of membrane-associated and soluble forms of CD163, a monocyte/macrophage-related immunomodulatory protein. We demonstrated that the number of peripheral blood classical CD14++CD16- monocytes assessed at the time of diagnosis was negatively correlated with lymphocytosis and was decreased in the CLL patients who required immediate treatment as opposed to patients who qualified to 'watch and wait' strategy. Notably, lower baseline levels of classical CD14++CD16- monocytes in CLL patients who were qualified for 'watch and wait' therapy were associated with shorter time to initial treatment. Notably, therapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide and fludarabine resulted in a significant reduction in the number of non-classical CD14+CD16++ monocytes and soluble form of CD163 but upregulation of membrane-associated monocyte CD163. Our data indicate that distinct monocyte subsets and two forms of CD163 are differentially modulated by both CLL and immune chemotherapy.

However, we have observed cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with features of PMBL but without detectable mediastinal involvement. The goal was to assess our previously established gene expression profiling (GEP) signature for PMBL in classifying these cases. In a large series of DLBCL cases, we identified 24 cases with a GEP signature of PMBL, including 9 cases with a submission diagnosis of DLBCL consistent with PMBL (G-PMBL-P) and 15 cases with a submission diagnosis of DLBCL. The pathology reviewers agreed with the diagnosis in the 9 G-PMBL-P cases. Among the other 15 DLBCL cases, 11 were considered to be PMBL or DLBCL consistent with PMBL, 3 were considered to be DLBCL, and 1 case was a gray-zone lymphoma with features intermediate between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. All 9 G-PMBL-P and 9 of the 15 DLBCL cases (G-PMBL-M) had demonstrated mediastinal involvement at presentation. Interestingly, 6 of the 15 DLBCL cases (G-PMBL-NM) had no clinical or radiologic evidence of mediastinal involvement. The 3 subgroups of PMBL had otherwise similar clinical characteristics, and there were no significant differences in overall survival. Genetic alterations of CIITA and PDL1/2 were detected in 26% and 40% of cases, respectively, including 1 G-PMBL-NM case with gain of PDL1/2.

Impact of such computed structural descriptors towards antimitotic and antiproliferative activities was analysed by ridge regression (RR) studies. The RR model explained that the topological indices alone can produce significant influence upon the pharmacological responses while combination of topological, electrostatic and quantum chemical descriptors can enhance the degree of impact towards antimitotic and antiproliferative activities of these compounds. Furthermore, QSAR models were formulated utilizing only topological and the combination of topological, electrostatic and quantum chemical descriptors respectively by multiple linear regression method and the validation of the model was performed by searching the predictability of the QSAR models. Satisfactory results were obtained in terms of model quality expressed as R(2) = 0.826, QLoo(2) = 0.710, Rpred(2) = 0.771 respectively for the topological indices. Combination of topological, electrostatic and quantum chemical descriptors resulted in an increase of R(2) = 0.965, QLoo 2 = 0.891, Rpred(2) = 0.849.

The major green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin3-O-gallate (EGCG) is reported to have anticancer effects. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a major hematopoietic malignancy characterized by expansion of myeloid cells. In the present study, we showed EGCG-induced acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activation and lipid raft clustering in CML cells. The ASM inhibitor desipramine significantly reduced EGCG-induced cell death. Protein kinase Cdelta is a wellknown kinase that plays an important role in ASM activation. We observed EGCG-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase Cdelta at Ser664. Importantly, EGCG-induced ASM activation was significantly reduced by pretreatment of CML cells with the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor NS2028, suggesting that EGCG induced ASM activation through the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent pathway. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of a cGMP-negative regulator enhanced the anti-CML effect of EGCG.

Pre-clinical models have suggested that an apoptotic response to dual PI3K and MEK targeting is relatively rare and understanding apoptotic avoidance could lead to increased clinical efficiency. This study investigated solid cancer cell lines, which are known to be sensitive to dual PI3K and MEK inhibition but to have a limited apoptotic response. The cells were exposed to dual PI3K and MEK blockage in combination with a panel of additional pharmacological agents and cytotoxicity and apoptosis were analyzed. Our results indicated that the BH3 mimetic ABT-263, the HDAC inhibitor entinostat and the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib increased the cytotoxicity and apoptotic response of dual PI3K and MEK targeting. Furthermore, ABT-263 and entinostat was able to induce apoptosis in combination with single agent PI3K and MEK inhibitors. Protein expression, immunoprecipitation and siRNA knockdown models suggested that Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 were the most important factors circumventing PI3K and/or MEK inhibition-mediated apoptosis.

(Zingiberaceae) and it has antitumor, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its effects on leukemia cell proliferation and invasion are not clear. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effects of curcumin on acute monocytic leukemia SHI-1 cells at the molecular level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of SHI-1 cells treated with 6.25-25 muM curcumin for 12-48 h were measured by MTT assay, flow cytometry, and Matrigel transwell assay; the underlying molecular mechanisms were assessed by quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and gelatin zymography. RESULTS: Treatment of SHI-1 cells with curcumin inhibited cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the IC50 values at 12, 24, and 48 h were 32.40, 14.13, and 9.67 muM. Curcumin inhibited SHI-1 cell proliferation by arresting the cells in the S-phase, increasing the number of Annexin V-FITC(+)/PI(-) cells and promoting the loss of big up tri, openPsim. The results of PCR and Western blotting showed that curcumin increased the FasL mRNA level; inhibited Bcl-2, NF-kappaB, and ERK expression; and activated P38 MAPK, JNK, and caspase-3. Additionally, curcumin partially suppressed SHI-1 cell invasion and attenuated the mRNA transcription and secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that curcumin not only induces SHI-1 cell apoptosis, possibly via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways triggered by JNK, P38 MAPK and ERK signaling, but also partially suppresses SHI-1 cell invasion, likely by reducing the levels of transcription and secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9.",,"['Zhu, Guo-Hua', 'Dai, Hai-Ping', 'Shen, Qun', 'Ji, Ou', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Zhai, Yun-Liang']","['Zhu GH', 'Dai HP', 'Shen Q', 'Ji O', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhai YL']","['a First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine , Nanjing , China .', 'b Leukemia Research Unit, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, 1st Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , China , and.', 'a First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine , Nanjing , China .', 'c Department of Hematology , 1st Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine , Nanjing , China.', 'a First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine , Nanjing , China .', 'a First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine , Nanjing , China .', 'a First Clinical College, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine , Nanjing , China .']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150701,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (MMP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (MMP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Time Factors']",,,2015/07/03 06:00,2017/02/02 06:00,['2015/07/03 06:00'],"['2015/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13880209.2015.1060508 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2016 Aug;54(8):1303-11. doi: 10.3109/13880209.2015.1060508.

The designation cutaneous type ATL has been proposed to describe a peculiar subgroup of smoldering type ATL in which the skin is predominantly affected. However, diagnostic criteria and prognostic factors for cutaneous type ATL remain to be determined. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study to obtain a precise method for subtype classification and to clearly define cutaneous type ATL. A total of 87 ATL patients (acute, n = 31; lymphoma, n = 6; chronic, n = 24; smoldering, n = 26) were enrolled. The human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) proviral load in peripheral blood and the serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level were evaluated with respect to the clinical features of the different types of ATL. The HTLV-1 proviral load was significantly increased in the acute and chronic type and the serum sIL-2R level was increased in the acute and lymphoma type. The HTLV-1 proviral load was significantly lower in cutaneous than other smoldering types of ATL without skin lesions. The clinical findings of cutaneous type ATL were also different from other subtypes. These results indicate that, in combination, determination of the HTLV-1 proviral load and the serum sIL-2R level is useful for distinguishing among the different types of ATL, and strongly suggest that cutaneous type ATL is a distinct clinical entity.",['(c) 2015 Japanese Dermatological Association.'],"['Yonekura, Kentaro', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Seto, Masao', 'Takatsuka, Yoshifusa', 'Takeuchi, Shogo', 'Tokunaga, Masahito', 'Kubota, Ayumu', 'Takeda, Koichiro', 'Kanzaki, Tamotsu', 'Uchida, Youhei', 'Kawai, Kazuhiro', 'Kanekura, Takuro']","['Yonekura K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Seto M', 'Takatsuka Y', 'Takeuchi S', 'Tokunaga M', 'Kubota A', 'Takeda K', 'Kanzaki T', 'Uchida Y', 'Kawai K', 'Kanekura T']","['Department of Dermatology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20150630,England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification/immunology/*virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/classification/immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/blood', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/classification/immunology/virology', 'Viral Load', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/07/03 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/07/03 06:00'],"['2014/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/1346-8138.13004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 2015 Dec;42(12):1143-8. doi: 10.1111/1346-8138.13004.

The serum expression level of miR-10a-5p in de novo AML was significantly higher, compared with that in controls. The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was of 0.831 in the diagnostic value of miR-10a-5p. In the complete remission (CR) group, the serum expression level of miR-10a-5p was similar to that of healthy subjects and demonstrated a significant downtrend when compared to that on the day of diagnosis. Nevertheless, miR-10a-5p expression was found to significantly increase in cases of relapsed AML when compared individually to the CR population. On analysis of the association of miR-10a-5p expression with the clinical characteristics at diagnosis in AML patients, lower CR rates occurred more frequently in the high-expression group.

After release from the dendrimer in the cytosol, the ONs produced potent functional activity without causing significant cytotoxicity.

Recurrent Th abnormalities in AML peripheral blood were reported, while the comprehensive status of various Th subsets is rarely investigated in bone marrow (BM) microenvironment which is the origin of AML leukemic blast cells. METHODS: BM was extracted from 48 newly-diagnosed (ND), 34 complete-remission (CR), 19 relapsed-refractory AML patients and 15 controls. Slight iron deficiency anemia patients were used as controls. Th subsets frequencies were examined by flow cytometry. BM plasma Th-associated cytokines levels were determined by ELISA. The expression of key transcription factor was examined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Th22, Th17, Th1, Th2 cells, IL-22 and RORC expression were significantly decreased, while Treg cells, related cytokine IL-10 and transcription factor Foxp3 were markedly elevated in ND compared to CR patients or controls. Meanwhile, the imbalanced Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg ratio were observed in ND and relapsed-refractory patients. Negative correlation between Th1 or Th2 and peripheral WBC, between Th17/Treg or Th1/Th2 and leukemic blast existed in ND patients. Moreover, chemotherapy ameliorated these variations. CONCLUSION: Th subsets in BM are distinct for different stages of AML and chemotherapy partly ameliorates the abnormality. Our findings suggest that these cells and cytokines may be implicated in AML pathogenesis and provided therapeutic insights.",,"['Tian, Tian', 'Yu, Shuang', 'Liu, Lu', 'Xue, Fuzhong', 'Yuan, Cunzhong', 'Wang, Min', 'Ji, Chunyan', 'Ma, Daoxin']","['Tian T', 'Yu S', 'Liu L', 'Xue F', 'Yuan C', 'Wang M', 'Ji C', 'Ma D']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public health, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150702,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'XEO71E2E45 (interleukin-22)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/cytology', 'Th1 Cells/cytology', 'Th17 Cells/cytology', 'Th2 Cells/cytology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4489914,,2015/07/03 06:00,2016/04/20 06:00,['2015/07/03 06:00'],"['2014/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0131761 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-50812 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jul 2;10(7):e0131761. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0131761. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We obtained individual level data from eight case-control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. All studies had home paint exposure data (sometimes including lacquers and varnishes) for the pregnancy period with additional data for the 1-3-month period before conception in five, the year before conception in two, and the period after birth in four studies, respectively. Cytogenetic subtype data were available for some studies. Data were harmonized to a compatible format. Pooled analyses of individual data were undertaken using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Based on 3,002 cases and 3,836 controls, the pooled odds ratio (OR) for home paint exposure in the 1-3 months before conception and risk of ALL was 1.54 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28, 1.85], while based on 1,160 cases and 1,641 controls for exposure in the year before conception, it was 1.00 (95% CI 0.86, 1.17). For exposure during pregnancy, using 4,382 cases and 5,747 controls, the pooled OR was 1.14 (95% CI 1.04, 1.25), and for exposure after birth, the OR was 1.22 (95% CI 1.07, 1.39), based on data from 1,962 cases and 2,973 controls. The risk was greater for certain cytogenetic subtypes and if someone other than the parents did the painting. CONCLUSIONS: Home paint exposure shortly before conception, during pregnancy, and/or after birth appeared to increase the risk of childhood ALL.

METHODS: Capillary electrophoresis was used to detect the FLT3-ITD characteristics after PCR amplication. Single or multiple mutations were identified by the numbers of peak. FLT3-ITD mutation burden was calculated by the peak area of mutant divided by the wild-type and mutant peak areas. Clinical data was collected and followed up in the FLT3-ITD mutation patients. RESULTS: Multiple ITD mutations were common in patients aged 60 and above. Patients with single ITD mutation had higher percentage of blasts in bone marrow than multiple ITD mutations (0.758 vs 0.638, P=0.028). The numbers and length of FLT3-ITD mutation had no impact on prognosis. Patients with less than 10% of ITD mutation burden showed no difference with the intermediate-risk c-kit group in OS and CRD, but the two groups had longer OS and CRD than ITD mutation burden above 10% (OS: undefined, undefined, 9.9 months, P<0.05; CRD: undefined, undefined, 6.7 months, P<0.05). In patients with ITD mutation burden above 10%, cases with NPM1 or CEBPA mutation alone had markedly longer CRD than ITD mutation alone (25.0 vs 5.1 months, P=0.003), while OS were similar (11.4 vs 8.0 months, P>0.05).

This study aimed to investigate the anticancer effect of M. integrifolia and to detect the underlying mechanisms of these effects. METHODS: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and trypan blue assay were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of M. integrifolia. Changes in cell nuclear morphology and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level were observed by fluorescent microscopy. Apoptosis ratio, DNA damage and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss were analyzed by flow cytometry. Western blotting assay was adopted to detect the proteins related to apoptosis. Immuno fl uorescence was used to observe the release of cytochrome C. RESULTS: The obtained data revealed that M. integrifolia could significantly inhibit K562 cell viability, mainly by targeting apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. Collapse in cell morphology, chromatin condensation, DNA damage and ROS accumulation were observed. Further mechanism detection revealed that mitochondrion might be a key factor in M. integrifolia-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: M. integrifolia could induce mitochondria mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase with little damage to normal cells, suggesting that M. integrifolia might be a potential and efficient anticancer agent that deserves further investigation.",,"['Fan, Jianping', 'Wang, Pan', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Tang, Wei', 'Liu, Chunliang', 'Wang, Yaqin', 'Yuan, Wenjuan', 'Kong, Lulu', 'Liu, Quanhong']","['Fan J', 'Wang P', 'Wang X', 'Tang W', 'Liu C', 'Wang Y', 'Yuan W', 'Kong L', 'Liu Q']","[""Co-Innovation Center for Qinba Regions' Sustainable Development, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an District, 710119 Xi'an, China. qhfanjianping@126.com."", 'College of Life Sciences, Qinghai Normal University, No.38, West Wusi Road, 810008 Xining, China. qhfanjianping@126.com.', ""Co-Innovation Center for Qinba Regions' Sustainable Development, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an District, 710119 Xi'an, China. wangpan@snnu.edu.cn."", ""Co-Innovation Center for Qinba Regions' Sustainable Development, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an District, 710119 Xi'an, China. wangxiaobing@snnu.edu.cn."", ""Co-Innovation Center for Qinba Regions' Sustainable Development, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an District, 710119 Xi'an, China. tangwei@snnu.edu.cn."", ""Co-Innovation Center for Qinba Regions' Sustainable Development, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an District, 710119 Xi'an, China. 41208166@snnu.edu.cn."", ""Co-Innovation Center for Qinba Regions' Sustainable Development, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an District, 710119 Xi'an, China. wangyaqinjilin@snnu.edu.cn."", ""Co-Innovation Center for Qinba Regions' Sustainable Development, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an District, 710119 Xi'an, China. yuanwenjuan@snnu.edu.dn."", ""Co-Innovation Center for Qinba Regions' Sustainable Development, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an District, 710119 Xi'an, China. konglulu@snnu.edu.cn."", ""Co-Innovation Center for Qinba Regions' Sustainable Development, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an District, 710119 Xi'an, China. lshaof@snnu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150630,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', '*Medicine, Traditional', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tibet']",PMC6332253,,2015/07/03 06:00,2016/04/06 06:00,['2015/07/03 06:00'],"['2015/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules200711981 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules200711981 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2015 Jun 30;20(7):11981-93. doi: 10.3390/molecules200711981.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['G2/M phase arrest', 'K562 cells', 'M. integrifolia ethanol extract', 'apoptosis', 'mitochondria']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concerted action of these proteins results in a two-phase kinetics of viral expression that depends on a time delay between their action. However, it is difficult to explain this delay, as Tax and Rex are produced from the same mRNA. In the present study we investigated whether HTLV-1 may produce novel mRNA species capable of expressing Rex and Tax independently. FINDINGS: Results revealed the expression of three alternatively spliced transcripts coding for novel Rex isoforms in infected cell lines and in primary samples from infected patients. One mRNA coded for a Tax isoform and a Rex isoform, and two mRNAs coded for Rex isoforms but not Tax. Functional assays showed that these Rex isoforms exhibit activity comparable to canonic Rex. An analysis of the temporal expression of these transcripts upon ex vivo culture of cells from infected patients and cell lines transfected with a molecular clone of HTLV-1 revealed early expression of the dicistronic tax/rex mRNAs followed by the monocistronic mRNAs coding for Rex isoforms. CONCLUSION: The production of monocistronic HTLV-1 mRNAs encoding Rex isoforms with comparable activity to canonical Rex, but with distinct timing, would support a prolonged duration of Rex function with gradual loss of Tax, and is consistent with the two-phase expression kinetics. A thorough understanding of these regulatory circuits will shed light on the basis of viral latency and provide groundwork to develop strategies for eradicating persistent infections.",,"['Rende, Francesca', 'Cavallari, Ilaria', 'Andresen, Vibeke', 'Valeri, Valerio W', ""D'Agostino, Donna M"", 'Franchini, Genoveffa', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo']","['Rende F', 'Cavallari I', 'Andresen V', 'Valeri VW', ""D'Agostino DM"", 'Franchini G', 'Ciminale V']","['Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padua, Italy. francesca.rende@unipd.it.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padua, Italy. ilaria.cavallari@unipd.it.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. vibeke.andresen@k2.uib.no.', 'Translational Hemato-Oncology Group, Department of Clinical Science, Centre of Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. vibeke.andresen@k2.uib.no.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. williamvaleri@yahoo.com.', 'Novartis Vaccines Loc., Bellaria Rosia, 53018, Sovicille, SI, Italy. williamvaleri@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padua, Italy. dm.dagostino@unipd.it.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. franchig@mail.nih.gov.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padua, Italy. v.ciminale@unipd.it.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padua, Italy. v.ciminale@unipd.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150702,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (rex Protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Protein Isoforms/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/genetics']",PMC4488940,,2015/07/03 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2015/07/03 06:00'],"['2015/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-015-0184-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-015-0184-2 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2015 Jul 2;12:58. doi: 10.1186/s12977-015-0184-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The association between RAIT at high doses and leukemia is well known, but studies of this association in a large population are lacking. This study aims to investigate the association between RAIT and leukemia in the context of current practice. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a 542,845 person-year (PY) follow-up of thyroid cancer patients was conducted using the Korean National Health Insurance claims database between January 2008 and December 2013. Patients were categorized according to RAIT dose (no RAI; low dose, </=30 mCi; moderate dose, 31-100 mCi; high dose, 101-150 mCi; and very high dose, >150 mCi). RESULTS: Among 211,360 thyroid cancer patients, 72 (0.03%) patients developed leukemia during follow-up (median 877 days). The cumulative incidence of leukemia per 10(5) person-year (PY) was 9.8 in the no RAI [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.4-14.4]; 6.1 [CI 1.7-15.7] in the low-dose; 8.6 [CI 3.2-18.7] in the moderate-dose; 29.5 [CI 18.3-45.1] in the high-dose; and 20.9 [CI 11.7-34.4] in the very high-dose groups. The hazard ratios were elevated significantly in the high- and very high-dose groups (HR 3.1 and 2.1, respectively, p<0.001) when compared with the no RAI group. CONCLUSIONS: RAIT exceeding 100 mCi was strongly associated with the development of leukemia in a nationwide, population-based study, while lower RAIT doses were not. Considering the favorable survival of patients with thyroid cancer and the potential harm of RAIT, physicians need to consider the pros and cons of RAIT when using this treatment option.",,"['Seo, Gi Hyeon', 'Cho, Yoon Young', 'Chung, Jae Hoon', 'Kim, Sun Wook']","['Seo GH', 'Cho YY', 'Chung JH', 'Kim SW']","['1 Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service , Seoul, Korea.', '2 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Thyroid Center, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine , Seoul, Korea.', '2 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Thyroid Center, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine , Seoul, Korea.', '2 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Thyroid Center, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine , Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150702,United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",,,2015/07/03 06:00,2016/06/02 06:00,['2015/07/03 06:00'],"['2015/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/thy.2014.0557 [doi]'],ppublish,Thyroid. 2015 Aug;25(8):927-34. doi: 10.1089/thy.2014.0557.

This paradigm shift in the management of this disease has improved the median survival from 8-9 years before 2000 to an estimated 25 years. Rapid research in this area along with well-designed multicentric clinical trials have resulted in the development of second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which are more effective for patients who develop resistance to imatinib. The synergy of haematological, cytogenetic and molecular parameters is the mainstay of monitoring patients with chronic myelod leukaemia. Early identification of patients likely to have suboptimal response to initial tyrosine kinase inhibitors and when to discontinue therapy in those with an optimal response are areas of active research.","['Copyright 2014, NMJI.']","['Dasgupta, Alakananda', 'Kumar, Lalit']","['Dasgupta A', 'Kumar L']","['Dr B.R.

The FLAMSA- reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen, combining a cytoreductive and a transplant-conditioning part, has been described to be efficacious in patients with refractory disease. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 130 patients with AML after aSCT following FLAMSA RIC at our center. The median follow-up was 37 (10-125) months. The 4-yr overall and disease-free survival rates of the whole cohort were 45% and 40%. Cumulative incidence of relapse was 29%, 35%, and 40% at 1, 2, and 4 yr. There were no significant differences regarding overall and disease-free survival for patients transplanted in CR1, CR2, or primary induction failure (PIF). Patients with refractory disease after salvage therapy had significantly lower disease-free and overall survival (OS). Disease-free and OS rates were also significantly decreased in patients with 10% or more BLASTS at transplant. non-relapse mortality was 15%, 19%, and 20% at 1, 2, and 4 yr and similar in all cohorts. These data underscore the potency of the FLAMSA RIC regimen for patients with AML especially with PIF. The decision for re-induction therapy prior to aSCT in relapsed patients has to be weighed against the potential toxicity of this approach and might be influenced by the amount of leukemic BLASTS present.

Patients have a response to immunosuppressive therapy, but myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia develop in about 15% of the patients, usually many months to years after the diagnosis of aplastic anemia. METHODS: We performed next-generation sequencing and array-based karyotyping using 668 blood samples obtained from 439 patients with aplastic anemia. We analyzed serial samples obtained from 82 patients. RESULTS: Somatic mutations in myeloid cancer candidate genes were present in one third of the patients, in a limited number of genes and at low initial variant allele frequency. Clonal hematopoiesis was detected in 47% of the patients, most frequently as acquired mutations. The prevalence of the mutations increased with age, and mutations had an age-related signature. DNMT3A-mutated and ASXL1-mutated clones tended to increase in size over time; the size of BCOR- and BCORL1-mutated and PIGA-mutated clones decreased or remained stable. Mutations in PIGA and BCOR and BCORL1 correlated with a better response to immunosuppressive therapy and longer and a higher rate of overall and progression-free survival; mutations in a subgroup of genes that included DNMT3A and ASXL1 were associated with worse outcomes. However, clonal dynamics were highly variable and might not necessarily have predicted the response to therapy and long-term survival among individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal hematopoiesis was prevalent in aplastic anemia. Some mutations were related to clinical outcomes. A highly biased set of mutations is evidence of Darwinian selection in the failed bone marrow environment. The pattern of somatic clones in individual patients over time was variable and frequently unpredictable.

The latter is characterized by the atypical clustering of telomeres within promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, which harbor proteins that are linked with DNA repair and recombination activity. For this reason, it is speculated that these associated PML bodies represent the sites of the recombination that maintains telomere length. The protocols described here can be employed for the routine investigation of the structural integrity of telomeres and the association of proteins at telomeres in normal cells, challenged cells, and archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical tissue specimens that may have activated the ALT pathway.","['Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.']","['Cesare, Anthony J', 'Heaphy, Christopher M', ""O'Sullivan, Roderick J""]","['Cesare AJ', 'Heaphy CM', ""O'Sullivan RJ""]","[""Children's Medical Research Institute, The University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia."", 'Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['P30 CA047904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20150701,United States,Curr Protoc Cytom,Current protocols in cytometry,100899351,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Centrifugation', 'Chromosomes', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/*methods', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Mitosis', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Tissue Banks']",PMC4862373,['NIHMS782061'],2015/07/02 06:00,2016/09/13 06:00,['2015/07/02 06:00'],"['2015/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/0471142956.cy1240s73 [doi]'],epublish,Curr Protoc Cytom. 2015 Jul 1;73:12.40.1-12.40.31. doi: 10.1002/0471142956.cy1240s73.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALT pathway', 'DNA damage', 'metaphase', 'telomeres']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to know the frequency of Ik6 and Ik8 in 113 Mexican ALL-children treated within the National Popular Medical Insurance Program to determine whether there was an association with relapse-free survival, event-free survival and overall survival, and to assess its usefulness in the initial stratification of patients. The expression of these isoforms was analyzed using specific primer sets and nested RT-PCR. The detected transcripts were classified according to the isoforms's sizes reported. A non-expected band of 300 bp from one patient was analyzed by sequencing. Twenty-six patients expressed Ik6 and/or Ik8 and one of them expressed a variant of Ik8 denominated Ik8-deleted. Although the presence of them was not statistically associated with lower relapse free survival (p = 0.432), event free survival (p = 0.667) or overall survival (p = 0.531), inferior overall survival was observed in patients that expressed these isoforms and showed high or standard risk by age and white blood-cell count at diagnosis. Of the 26 patients Ik6+ and/or Ik8+, 14 did not present adverse events; from them 6 were exclusively Ik6+ and/or Ik8+, and 8 were positive for the other Ikaros isoforms (Ik1, Ik2, Ik5, Ik3A, Ik4, Ik4A, Ik7).

There were 42,754 cancer patients enrolled in order to study the determinants of medical expenditure for EOL care from 2009 to 2011.The mean medical expenditure for EOL care for cancer patients in the last 6 months of life was $12,965 +/- 10,959 (mean +/- standard deviation ) (all costs are given in US dollars). Patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma had an additional cost of $16,934 and $7840 than those with nonhematological malignancy (P < 0.001). Medical expenditures for cancer patients with a hematological malignancy and postdiagnosis survival of >6 months, between 6 and 12 months, and >12 months all showed that acute leukemia and lymphoma accounted for more medical expenditure than did others (P < 0.001).

However, whether NK cells play a role in the clinical course of solid tumors is debated. The controversy surrounding the role of NK cells is due, at least in part, to the limited extent of NK cell infiltration found in the tumor bed. Inactivation of NK cells may explain the shortage of NK cells in the microenvironment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Upon NK cell/tumor cell interaction, tumor cells may escape NK cells by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which possibly affects T-cells as well. Such an immunosuppressive microenvironment would hamper the functions of NK and T-cell and reduce NK and T-cell interactions. CRC patients with levels of tumor NK cell infiltration suitable for statistical analysis have been identified. The infiltration of the CRC microenvironment by NK cells, in combination with CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, has been shown to enhance the prognosis of CRC patients. Here, we discuss the clinicopathological role of NK cells in CRC, and present clinical data indicating a potential supporting role for NK cells in the anti-CRC effects of CD8(+) T-cells.",,"['Coppola, Andrea', 'Arriga, Roberto', 'Lauro, Davide', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Palomba, Patrizia', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Sconocchia, Giuseppe']","['Coppola A', 'Arriga R', 'Lauro D', 'Del Principe MI', 'Buccisano F', 'Maurillo L', 'Palomba P', 'Venditti A', 'Sconocchia G']","['Institute of Systems Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" , Rome , Italy.', 'Institute of Systems Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" , Rome , Italy.', 'Institute of Systems Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" , Rome , Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" , Rome , Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" , Rome , Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" , Rome , Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" , Rome , Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" , Rome , Italy.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy, Institute of Translational Pharmacology, CNR , Rome , Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150526,Switzerland,Front Med (Lausanne),Frontiers in medicine,101648047,,,,PMC4469113,,2015/07/02 06:00,2015/07/02 06:01,['2015/07/02 06:00'],"['2015/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmed.2015.00033 [doi]'],epublish,Front Med (Lausanne). 2015 May 26;2:33. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2015.00033. eCollection 2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD8+ T cells', 'NK cells', 'colorectal carcinoma', 'cooperation', 'inflammation', 'survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective Myeloid sarcoma (also known as chloroma) is a rare, extramedullary tumor composed of immature granulocytic cells. It may occur early in the course of acute or chronic leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. Spinal cord invasion by myeloid sarcoma is rare. The authors report a rare case of spinal myeloid sarcoma presenting as cervical radiculopathy. Methods A previously healthy 43-year-old man presented with progressive neck, right shoulder, and arm pain. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a very large enhancing extradural soft tissue mass extending from C7 through T1, with severe narrowing of the thecal sac at the T1 level. The patient underwent posterior cervical open biopsy, laminectomy, and decompression. Histologic examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. Postoperatively, a bone marrow biopsy was done, which showed myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia. The patient then received systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Results At the 10-month follow-up, the patient reported complete relief of arm pain and neck pain. X-rays showed that the overall cervical alignment was intact and there was no evidence of a recurrent lesion. MRI showed no evidence of compressive or remnant lesion.

Nowadays, however, despite its rising prevalence, cancer is no longer synonymous with death. Given the significance of emotional well-being in cancer patients, we decided to assess the frequency of psychological problems in seven to seventeen year-olds with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our sample included 42 children and adolescents with ALL referred to pediatric hematology department of Dr. Sheikh hospital, who were put under maintenance course of the treatment. Psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression and behavioral disturbances were examined by using RCMAS, CDI and SDQ questionnaires respectively. RESULTS: The entire population showed depressive symptoms.59.5% of patients (25 person) suffered from anxiety and 26.2% (11 person) had behavioral problems. No significant relation was found between depressive symptoms, and age (p=0.77), sex (p=0.97), length of disease (p=0.50), and type of treatment (p=0.064). Anxiety did not show any significant relation with age (p= 0.63), sex (p= 0.32), length of disease (p= 0.16) and treatment type (p= 0.064).Similarly behavioral disturbances did not indicate any suggestive relation with age (p= 0.20), sex (p= 0.56), length of disease (p= 0.81) and type of treatment (p= 0.19). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with ALL. It is strongly recommended, therefore, that besides somatic symptoms, careful attention be paid to psychological disorders. This can prevent rapid development of the disease reduce treatment costs, and improve the quality of life for both patients and their families.",,"['Farhangi, H', 'Badiei, Z', 'Moharreri, F']","['Farhangi H', 'Badiei Z', 'Moharreri F']","['Assistant Professor of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, faculty of medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Associated Professor of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, faculty of medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Ibn-e-Sina Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150420,Iran,Iran J Ped Hematol Oncol,Iranian journal of pediatric hematology and oncology,101571320,,,,PMC4475627,,2015/07/02 06:00,2015/07/02 06:01,['2015/07/02 06:00'],"['2015/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/02 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Ped Hematol Oncol. 2015;5(2):77-82.

Phospho-ERK5 (p-ERK5) plays a novel role in chemoresistance in some cancer cells and this pathway is a central mediator of cell survival and apoptotic regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a specific ERK5 small interference RNA (siRNA) on proliferation and the sensitivity of HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells to the chemotherapeutic drug cytarabine. METHODS: The cells were transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. Relative ERK5 mRNA and protein levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR, immunocytochemical assay, and Western blotting, respectively. The cytotoxic effects of cytarabine and ERK5 siRNA, alone and in combination, on leukemic cells were determined using colony formation and MTT assay. Apoptosis was assessed by ELISA cell death assay. RESULTS: ERK5 siRNA markedly reduced both mRNA and protein expression levels leading to distinct inhibition of cell proliferation and increased spontaneous apoptosis. Surprisingly, ERK5 siRNA synergistically increased the cell toxic effects of cytarabine. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that down-regulation of ERK5 by siRNA can trigger apoptosis and overcome drug resistance of leukemia cells. Therefore, ERK5 siRNA may be an effective adjuvant in AML chemotherapy.",,"['Xu, Yu', 'Cao, Cuiming', 'Gong, Xiuchun', 'Rong, LiJun']","['Xu Y', 'Cao C', 'Gong X', 'Rong L']","[""Department of Haematology, People's Hospital of Linyi Shandong, China."", 'Department of Medical Laboratory Diagnosis Center, Jinan Central Hospital Jinan, Shandong, China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, People's Hospital of Linyi Shandong, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, People's Hospital of LinYi Shandong, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150415,United States,Int J Clin Exp Med,International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,101471010,,,,PMC4483818,,2015/07/02 06:00,2015/07/02 06:01,['2015/07/02 06:00'],"['2015/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/02 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Med. 2015 Apr 15;8(4):6446-55. eCollection 2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'ERK5', 'chemotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We analyzed 2 polymorphisms (rs4149081 and rs11045897) in SLCO1B1 gene in 280 Chinese pediatric B-ALL patients, using MTX plasma concentration as an objective and quantifiable marker of toxicity. We utilized Enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) to measure the plasma concentration of MTX. The polymerase chain reaction-allele specific (PCR-AS) method was utilized to perform the genotyping. RESULTS: We found there was a statistically significant association between MTX plasma concentration and the SLCO1B1 rs11045879 CC genotype (P<0.05). We also found the rs4149081 AA genotype was associated with high-MTX plasma concentrations. A-C haplotype carriers have a higher risk for MTX delayed clearance but G-T haplotype was associated with a lower risk for MTX delayed clearance.

METHODS: Human leukemia K562, OUN-1, HL-60, U937, K562/AO2 cell lines and primary leukemic cells were used to detect the NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) expression such as MICA/B, ULBP-1, ULBP-2, ULBP-3, and NK cells receptor NKG2D, CD158a, CD158b were detected by flow cytometry. Cell cytotoxic activity of human NK cells and CIK cells against K562 leukemia cells was detected using CFSE/PI double staining. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in K562 or NK cells supernatant after matrine treatment were detected. RESULTS: Matrine could upregulate the expression of NKG2DL on leukemic cell lines, and primary leukemic cells and enhance the NK and CIK cytotoxicity targeted to K562 cells. After matrine treatment, pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecular such as IL-6, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, GRO and TNF-alpha in K562 cells supernatant were significantly decreased (P < 0.05).

We investigated Korean patients with ET and PMF to determine the prevalence, and clinical and laboratory correlations of CALR/JAK2/MPL mutations. Among 84 ET patients, CALR mutations were detected in 23 (27.4%) and were associated with higher platelet counts (P=0.006) and lower leukocyte counts (P=0.035) than the JAK2 V617F mutation. Among 50 PMF patients, CALR mutations were detected in 11 (22.0%) and were also associated with higher platelet counts (P=0.035) and trended to a lower rate of cytogenetic abnormalities (P=0.059) than the JAK2 V617F mutation. By multivariate analysis, triple-negative status was associated with shorter overall survival (HR, 7.0; 95% CI, 1.6-31.1, P=0.01) and leukemia-free survival (HR, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.8-22.0, P=0.004) in patients with PMF. The type 1 mutation was the most common (61.1%) type among all patients with CALR mutations, and tended toward statistical predominance in PMF patients.

Stem Cell transplantation is used for the treatment for a wide variety of diseases, including leukemia and lymphoma. PURPOSE: This study highlights prevention strategies of infectious diseases among HSCT donors and recipients in our institute as guided by International guidelines. We aim to highlight the strategy for extensive screening of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV infection and syphilis cases in all the stem cell units stored in our facility. METHODS: We searched the institutional database to identify cases of infectious diseases among HSC transplants. Extensive donor evaluation was conducted through screening and laboratory infectious disease testing for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV infection and syphilis. RESULTS: Between 1996 and 2014, 263 consecutive adult HSCT were performed. An approximate equal number of autologous and allogeneic HSC collections were undertaken. The median age for autologous donors was 35 years, whereas that of allogeneic donors is 25 years. Of the 263 stem cell donors, we found 18 patients (autologous) and 2 donors (allogeneic) to be infected. We did not find any of the donors infected with HIV by the serology as well as the NAT testing protocol. CONCLUSION: Donor screening and testing is the most critical parameter in stem cell transplantation in order to ensure the safety of the product to be transplanted. Modifications in the regulations related to donor screening are aimed at providing safe transplantation and negate the risk of accidental infection of the donor.",,"['Alsuhaibani, Omar', 'Pereira, Winston Costa', 'Tareeqanwar, Mohammed', 'Khizzi, Nora El', 'Bakheswain, Saadia', 'Shaker, Amira', 'Elyamany, Ghaleb']","['Alsuhaibani O', 'Pereira WC', 'Tareeqanwar M', 'Khizzi NE', 'Bakheswain S', 'Shaker A', 'Elyamany G']","['Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Hematology and Blood Bank Division;', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Hematology and Blood Bank Division;', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Hematology and Blood Bank Division;', 'Microbiology Division;', 'Microbiology Division;', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Hematology and Blood Bank Division;', 'Department of Central Military Laboratory and Blood Bank, Hematology and Blood Bank Division; ; Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Department of Hematology, Theodor Bilharz Research Institute, Giza, EGYPT.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann Neurosci,Annals of neurosciences,101523367,,,,PMC4480260,,2015/07/02 06:00,2015/07/02 06:01,['2015/07/02 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5214/ans.0972.7531.220206 [doi]', '220206 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Neurosci. 2015 Apr;22(2):81-6. doi: 10.5214/ans.0972.7531.220206.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Donors', 'HSCT', 'Hepatitis', 'Recipients', 'Screening']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ethanol extracts of EEHDW have been shown to possess various biological activities including anticancer function in vitro. Our earlier studies have shown that EEHDW affects immune responses in WEHI-3-generated leukemia mice, but EEHDW has not been reported to affect immune responses in a normal mouse model. Herein, we investigated whether EEHDW could affect immune responses on normal murine cells in vivo. Normal BALB/c mice were orally treated with or without EEHDW at 0, 16, 32, and 64 mg/kg or 32 mg/kg by i.p. for 3 weeks, then were weighed, and blood, liver and spleen samples were collected for further experiments. Results indicated that EEHDW did not significantly affect body and liver weight but significantly increased the spleen weight by i.p. treatment when compared to control groups. Flow cytometric assays indicated that EEHDW promoted CD11b levels at 16, 32 and 64 mg/kg oral treatment, CD19 levels at 16, 32, 64 mg/kg oral treatment and i.p. treatment, and Mac-3 levels at 16, 32 and 64 mg/kg oral treatment, however, it did not significantly affect the levels of CD3. Oral treatment with 16 and 32 mg/kg of EEHDW significantly decreased macrophage phagocytosis from PBMC; 32 mg/kg of EEHDW by i.p. treatment significantly increased phagocytosis activity of macrophages obtain from the peritoneal cavity. EEHDW at 32 mg/kg by i.p. treatment led to an increase of NK cell activities compared to oil control groups. EEHDW at 32 mg/kg of EEHDW by i.p. treatment increased B- and T-cell proliferation. Based on these observations, EEHDW seems to have promoted immune responses in this murine model.","['Copyright (c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Kuo, Yu-Jui', 'Lin, Jing-Pin', 'Hsiao, Yung-Ting', 'Chou, Guan-Ling', 'Tsai, Yu-Hsiang', 'Chiang, Su-Yin', 'Lin, Jaung-Geng', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Kuo YJ', 'Lin JP', 'Hsiao YT', 'Chou GL', 'Tsai YH', 'Chiang SY', 'Lin JG', 'Chung JG']","['Graduate Institute of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Matched unrelated donor transplant recipients received CNI with mycophenolate or methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis; 1245 patients received myeloablative and 737 received reduced intensity conditioning regimens. In the myeloablative setting, day 30 neutrophil recovery was lower after haploidentical compared with matched unrelated donor transplants (90% vs 97%, P = .02).

The interleukin-3 receptor alpha-chain (CD123) is highly expressed on the surface of acute leukemia cells compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells. CSL362 is a fully humanized, CD123-neutralizing monoclonal antibody containing a modified Fc structure, which enhances human natural killer cell antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Six continuous acute myelogenous leukemia xenografts established from patient explants and characterized by cell and molecular criteria, produced progressively lethal disease 42-202 days after transplantation. CSL362 alone reduced engraftment of one of four and three of four acute myelogenous leukemia xenografts in the bone marrow and peripheral organs, respectively. A cytarabine and daunorubicin regimen was optimized using this model to identify potentially synergistic interactions with CSL362. Cytarabine/daunorubicin improved the survival of mice engrafted with four of four acute myelogenous leukemia xenografts by 31-41 days. Moreover, CSL362 extended the survival of cytarabine/daunorubicin-treated mice for two of two acute myelogenous leukemia xenografts, while augmentation of natural killer cell-deficient NSG mice with adoptively transferred human natural killer cells improved survival against a single xenograft.

The introduction of reduced intensity conditioning has expanded the recipient pool for transplantation, which has importantly made transplant an option for the more commonly affected older age groups. Reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic transplantation is currently the standard of care for patients with intermediate or high-risk acute myeloid leukemia and is now most often employed in older patients and those with medical comorbidities. Despite being curative for a significant proportion of patients, post-transplant relapse remains a challenge in the reduced intensity conditioning setting. Herein we discuss the studies that demonstrate the feasibility of reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic transplants, compare the outcomes of reduced intensity conditioning versus chemotherapy and conventional myeloablative conditioning regimens, describe the optimal donor and stem cell source, and consider the impact of post-remission consolidation, comorbidities, center experience, and more intensive (reduced toxicity conditioning) regimens on outcomes.

In contrast to the membrane form of CD83, soluble CD83 appears to be immunosuppressive. In an analysis of the phenotype of leukemic CD4(+) T cells from patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), we found that a number of primary CD4(+) T cells became positive for cell surface CD83 after short-term culture, and that most of these CD83(+) CD4(+) T cells were positive for human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) Tax (Tax1). We hypothesized that Tax1 is involved in the induction of CD83. RESULT: We found that CD83 was expressed selectively on Tax1-expressing human CD4(+) T cells in short-term cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from HTLV-I(+) donors, including ATL patients and HTLV-I carriers. HTLV-I-infected T cell lines expressing Tax1 also expressed cell surface CD83 and released soluble CD83. CD83 can be expressed in the JPX-9 cell line by cadmium-mediated Tax1 induction and in Jurkat cells or PBMCs by Tax1 introduction via infection with a recombinant adenovirus carrying the Tax1 gene. The CD83 promoter was activated by Tax1 in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Based on a previous report showing soluble CD83-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production from human monocytes in vitro, we tested if PGE2 affected HTLV-I propagation, and found that PGE2 strongly stimulated expression of Tax1 and viral structural molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HTLV-I induces CD83 expression on T cells via Tax1 -mediated NF-kappaB activation, which may promote HTLV-I infection in vivo.",,"['Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Mizuguchi, Mariko', 'Takahashi, Yoshiaki', 'Fujii, Hideki', 'Tanaka, Reiko', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Tomoyose, Takeaki', 'Ansari, Aftab A', 'Nakamura, Masataka']","['Tanaka Y', 'Mizuguchi M', 'Takahashi Y', 'Fujii H', 'Tanaka R', 'Fukushima T', 'Tomoyose T', 'Ansari AA', 'Nakamura M']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. yuetsu@s4.dion.ne.jp.', 'Human Gene Sciences Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. m.mari.gene@tmd.ac.jp.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. ytakah3@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. hfujii@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. reiko_tanaka@s5.dion.ne.jp.', 'Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan. fukutaku@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Haematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan. ttomoyos@ryudai2nai.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA. pathaaa@emory.edu.', 'Human Gene Sciences Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. naka.gene@tmd.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['R01 AI098628/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150701,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*biosynthesis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*virology']",PMC4487981,,2015/07/02 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2015/07/02 06:00'],"['2015/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-015-0185-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-015-0185-1 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2015 Jul 1;12:56. doi: 10.1186/s12977-015-0185-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: miR-204 expression has been analyzed using RT-PCR in 95 bone marrow specimens from newly diagnosed AML patients in comparison to 20 healthy subject. RESULTS: We showed down-regulated miR-204 expression in AML patients, which was associated with shorter patients' survival.

Although mutations of the key haematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 are rare in human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), they are common in murine models of radiation-induced AML, and PU.1 downregulation and/or dysfunction has been described in human AML patients carrying the fusion oncogenes RUNX1-ETO and PML-RARA. To study the transcriptional programmes associated with compromised PU.1 activity, we adapted a Pu.1-mutated murine AML cell line with an inducible wild-type PU.1. PU.1 induction caused transition from leukaemia phenotype to monocytic differentiation. Global binding maps for PU.1, CEBPA and the histone mark H3K27Ac with and without PU.1 induction showed that mutant PU.1 retains DNA-binding ability, but the induction of wild-type protein dramatically increases both the number and the height of PU.1-binding peaks. Correlating chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Seq with gene expression data, we found that PU.1 recruitment coupled with increased histone acetylation induces gene expression and activates a monocyte/macrophage transcriptional programme. PU.1 induction also caused the reorganisation of a subgroup of CEBPA binding peaks.

Protein interaction sites are often devoid of the deep surface pockets presented by ""traditional"" drug targets, and crystal structures reveal that inhibitors typically engage these sites using very shallow binding modes. As a consequence, modern virtual screening tools developed to identify inhibitors of traditional drug targets do not perform as well when they are instead deployed at protein interaction sites. To address the need for novel inhibitors of important protein interactions, here we introduce an alternate docking strategy specifically designed for this regime. Our method, termed DARC (Docking Approach using Ray-Casting), matches the topography of a surface pocket ""observed"" from within the protein to the topography ""observed"" when viewing a potential ligand from the same vantage point. We applied DARC to carry out a virtual screen against the protein interaction site of human antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and found that four of the top-scoring 21 compounds showed clear inhibition in a biochemical assay. The Ki values for these compounds ranged from 1.2 to 21 muM, and each had ligand efficiency comparable to promising small-molecule inhibitors of other protein-protein interactions. These hit compounds do not resemble the natural (protein) binding partner of Mcl-1, nor do they resemble any known inhibitors of Mcl-1. Our results thus demonstrate the utility of DARC for identifying novel inhibitors of protein-protein interactions.",,"['Gowthaman, Ragul', 'Miller, Sven A', 'Rogers, Steven', 'Khowsathit, Jittasak',

In vitro cytotoxicity assays (MTT) showed that these sesquiterpene lactones display poor cytotoxic effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy human subjects, whereas a strong cytotoxicity was observed in leukemia and pancreas cancer cells. For the mechanism of action of polymatin B, oxidative stress seems to be involved.

Next, the cell growth inhibition was evaluated using the MTT assay and cellular morphology observation. Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining. The results demonstrated that treatment with resveratrol (concentration-dependent) and imatinib mesylate showed significantly greater inhibition of K562 cell growth and a higher apoptosis rate of K562 cells than imatinib mesylate medication alone and the control group (P < 0.01). The imatinib mesylate medication alone group showed significant inhibition of K562 cell growth and apoptosis rate of K562 cells compared to the control group (P < 0.01).

Side population (SP) cells possess some intrinsic stem cell properties and contain numerous LSCs. In this study, we examined the prognostic significance of cluster differentiation 47 (CD47) and identified the appropriate target for eliminating LSCs. We determined the percentage of SP cells in a THP-1 cell population and analyzed CD47 expression in different cell subsets. We then explored whether CD47 affected the phagocytic ability of macrophages to LSCs in vitro. Finally, the effect of anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies, alone or combination with cytarabine, against leukemic cells was evaluated in vitro and in vivo to identify the optimal targets for the treatment of leukemia. We observed an SP sub-fraction at low frequency (1.81 +/- 0.99%), which was a likely candidate for LSC enrichment. CD47 was more highly expressed on THP-1 LSCs (P < 0.05) and was an independent predictor of survival and refractory disease in THP-1-engrafted mice. Furthermore, the anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody stimulated preferential phagocytosis of LSCs by macrophages in vitro. Finally, single or combination treatment of THP-1 LSC-engrafted mice with cytarabine and anti-CD47 antibody resulted in targeting of LSCs and depletion of leukemia cells. These findings suggest that CD47 is an antibody target in LSCs and combination treatment with cytarabine and anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody represents an attractive option for the therapeutic targeting of acute monocytic leukemia.",,"['Wang, Y', 'Yin, C', 'Feng, L', 'Wang, C', 'Sheng, G']","['Wang Y', 'Yin C', 'Feng L', 'Wang C', 'Sheng G']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150525,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (CD47 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'CD47 Antigen/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Phagocytosis', 'Prognosis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2015/07/01 06:00,2016/04/12 06:00,['2015/07/01 06:00'],"['2015/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr5236 [pii]', '10.4238/2015.May.25.15 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2015 May 25;14(2):5630-41. doi: 10.4238/2015.May.25.15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty acute myeloid leukemia patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. Patient serum endostatin and FGF-19 levels were measured on admission, and then, standard chemotherapy was administered. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to chemotherapeutic effects: 21 patients in the chemotherapeutic sensitivity group (complete remission + partial remission) and 39 in the chemotherapeutic resistance group (no remission + degradation). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the relationship of serum endostatin and FGF-19 levels with chemotherapeutic sensitivity in acute myeloid leukemia patients. The levels of serum endostatin and FGF-19 in acute myeloid leukemia patients before chemotherapy were significantly higher than those in the control group. Moreover, these levels significantly decreased after chemotherapy (P < 0.01). The levels of serum endostatin and FGF-19 in the chemotherapeutic sensitivity group were lower than those in the chemotherapeutic resistance group, both before and after chemotherapy (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). ROC curve analysis showed that the predictive values of endostatin and FGF-19 were good, and there was no significant difference between these results. In conclusion, serum endostatin and FGF-19 can be used as predictors of chemotherapeutic sensitivity for acute myeloid leukemia patients, and may be important for determining prognosis.",,"['Su, Y Z', 'Wang, C B', 'Zhou, Y', 'Sun, N T']","['Su YZ', 'Wang CB', 'Zhou Y', 'Sun NT']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', ""Department of Tumor and Hematology, Yancheng Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University (The Third People's Hospital of Yancheng), Yancheng, China chunbinwang@126.com."", ""Department of Tumor and Hematology, Yancheng Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University (The Third People's Hospital of Yancheng), Yancheng, China."", ""Department of Tumor and Hematology, Yancheng Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University (The Third People's Hospital of Yancheng), Yancheng, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150518,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Endostatins)', '0 (FGF19 protein, human)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Endostatins/*blood/genetics', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/*blood/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Harringtonines/therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/07/01 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2015/07/01 06:00'],"['2015/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr5491 [pii]', '10.4238/2015.May.18.8 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2015 May 18;14(2):5181-7. doi: 10.4238/2015.May.18.8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The signaling pathways and gene expression patterns that give rise to these developmental processes are coordinated, in part, by two opposing classes of broad-based enzymatic regulators: histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HATs and HDACs can modulate gene transcription by altering histone acetylation to modify chromatin structure, and by regulating the activity of non-histone substrates, including an array of immune-cell transcription factors. In addition to their role in normal B and T cells, dysregulation of HAT and HDAC activity is associated with a variety of B- and T-cell malignancies. In this review, we describe the roles of HATs and HDACs in normal B- and T-cell physiology, describe mutations and dysregulation of HATs and HDACs that are implicated lymphoma and leukemia, and discuss HAT and HDAC inhibitors that have been explored as treatment options for leukemias and lymphomas.",,"['Haery, Leila', 'Thompson, Ryan C', 'Gilmore, Thomas D']","['Haery L', 'Thompson RC', 'Gilmore TD']","['Department of Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA047763/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007501/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,PMC4482241,,2015/07/01 06:00,2015/07/01 06:01,['2015/07/01 06:00'],"['2015/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/01 06:01 [medline]']","['65 [pii]', '10.18632/genesandcancer.65 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2015 May;6(5-6):184-213. doi: 10.18632/genesandcancer.65.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B cells', 'HAT', 'HDAC', 'T cells', 'acetylation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are conflicting literature reports on enhanced tumor accumulation of targeted NPs, which is essential for translating their applications as improved drug-delivery systems and contrast agents in cancer imaging. In this study, we characterized biodegradable NPs conjugated with an anti-CD20 antibody for in vivo imaging and drug delivery onto tumor cells. NPs' binding specificity mediated by anti-CD20 antibody was evaluated on MEC1 cells and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients' cells. The whole-body distribution of untargeted NPs and anti-CD20 NPs were compared by time-domain optical imaging in a localized human/mouse model of B-cell malignancy. These studies provided evidence that NPs' functionalization by an anti-CD20 antibody improves tumor pharmacokinetic profiles in vivo after systemic administration and increases in vivo imaging of tumor mass compared to non-targeted NPs.

During hematopoietic cell differentiation, GATA-2 exhibits dynamic expression patterns, which are regulated by multiple transcription factors. METHODS: Stable LSD1-knockdown cell lines were established by growing murine erythroleukemia (MEL) or mouse embryonic stem cells together with virus particles, in the presence of Polybrene((R)) at 4 mug/mL, for 24-48 hours followed by puromycin selection (1 mug/mL) for 2 weeks. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was used to test whether the TAL1 transcription factor is bound to 1S promoter in the GATA-2 locus or whether LSD1 colocalizes with TAL1 at the 1S promoter. The sequential ChIP assay was utilized to confirm the role of LSD1 in the regulation of H3K4me2 at the GATA-2 locus during erythroid differentiation. Western blot analysis was employed to detect the protein expression. The alamarBlue((R)) assay was used to examine the proliferation of the cells, and the absorbance was monitored at optical density (OD) 570 nm and OD 600 nm. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that LSD1 regulates the expression of GATA-2 during erythroid differentiation. Knockdown of LSD1 results in increased GATA-2 expression and inhibits the differentiation of MEL and embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that LSD1 binds to the 1S promoter of the GATA-2 locus and suppresses GATA-2 expression, via histone demethylation. CONCLUSION: Our data revealed that LSD1 mediates erythroid differentiation, via epigenetic modification of the GATA-2 locus.",,"['Guo, Yidi', 'Fu, Xueqi', 'Jin, Yue', 'Sun, Jing', 'Liu, Ye', 'Huo, Bo', 'Li, Xiang', 'Hu, Xin']","['Guo Y', 'Fu X', 'Jin Y', 'Sun J', 'Liu Y', 'Huo B', 'Li X', 'Hu X']","[""School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China ; Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China ; Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering of Ministry of Education, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China ; National Engineering Laboratory of AIDS Vaccine, School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150619,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM1a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Erythroid Cells/*enzymology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors']",PMC4482369,,2015/07/01 06:00,2016/03/30 06:00,['2015/07/01 06:00'],"['2015/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S81911 [doi]', 'dddt-9-3153 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2015 Jun 19;9:3153-62. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S81911. eCollection 2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['GATA factor switching', 'LSD1', 'histone demethylation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Children's Oncology Group high-risk B-ALL study AALL0232, we investigated MRD in subjects randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to receive either high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) or Capizzi methotrexate (C-MTX) during interim maintenance (IM) or prednisone or dexamethasone during induction. Subjects with end-induction MRD >/=0.1% or those with morphologic slow early response were nonrandomly assigned to receive a second IM and delayed intensification phase. MRD was measured by 6-color flow cytometry in 1 of 2 reference labs, with excellent agreement between the two. Subjects with end-induction MRD <0.01% had a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of 87% +/- 1% vs 74% +/- 4% for those with MRD 0.01% to 0.1%; increasing MRD amounts was associated with progressively worse outcome. Subjects converting from MRD positive to negative by end consolidation had a relatively favorable 79% +/- 5% 5-year disease-free survival vs 39% +/- 7% for those with MRD >/=0.01%. Although HD-MTX was superior to C-MTX, MRD retained prognostic significance in both groups (86% +/- 2% vs 58% +/- 4% for MRD-negative vs positive C-MTX subjects; 88% +/- 2% vs 68% +/- 4% for HD-MTX subjects). Intensified therapy given to subjects with MRD >0.1% did not improve either 5-year EFS or overall survival (OS). However, these subjects showed an early relapse rate similar to that seen in MRD-negative ones, with EFS/OS curves for patients with 0.1% to 1% MRD crossing those with 0.01% to 0.1% MRD at 3 and 4 years, thus suggesting that the intensified therapy altered the disease course of MRD-positive subjects.

To identify genes that may predict response to ruxolitinib, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a panel of 28 genes recurrently mutated in hematologic malignancies in a cohort of patients with MF who were treated with ruxolitinib in a phase 1/2 study. We also tested for CALR deletions by standard polymerase chain reaction methods. Ninety-eight percent of patients had a mutation in >/=1 gene. Seventy-nine (82.1%) patients had the JAK2(V617F) mutation, 9 (9.5%) had CALR mutations (7 type 1, 2 type 2), 3 (3.1%) had MPL mutations, and 4 (4.2%) were negative for all 3. ASXL1/JAK2 and TET2/JAK2 were the most frequently comutated genes. Mutations in NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, GATA2, TP53, and RUNX1 were found in <5% of patients. Spleen response (>/=50% reduction in palpable spleen size) was inversely correlated with the number of mutations; patients with </=2 mutations had ninefold higher odds of a spleen response than those with >/=3 mutations (odds ratio = 9.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-47.2). Patients with >/=3 mutations also had a shorter time to treatment discontinuation and shorter overall survival than those with fewer mutations.

RESULTS: We found that the expression of TRAILR2 and R3 was significantly increased in unfavorable risk groups, according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Additionally, cut-off analyses for TRAILR2 and TNFR1 showed significantly shorter overall survival, earlier disease onset, higher proportions of cases with unfavorable prognosis and higher probability of relapse when SFIs were above the established cut-off.

RESULTS: Considering 72,197 incident cases, thyroid cancer (IRR=1.68 in females and 1.40 in males) and lymphatic leukemia (IRR: females=1.48, males=1.39) were significantly increased in the volcanic area in both men and women. Hodgkin's lymphoma, stomach and breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men were also significantly increased in the volcanic area.

SRSF2, a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of splicing factors, is one of the mutation targets associated with poor survival in patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndromes. Here we report the biological function of SRSF2 in hematopoiesis by using conditional knockout mouse models. Ablation of SRSF2 in the hematopoietic lineage caused embryonic lethality, and Srsf2-deficient fetal liver cells showed significantly enhanced apoptosis and decreased levels of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Induced ablation of SRSF2 in adult Mx1-Cre Srsf2(flox/flox) mice upon poly(I):poly(C) injection demonstrated a significant decrease in lineage(-) Sca(+) c-Kit(+) cells in bone marrow. To reveal the functional impact of myelodysplastic syndromes-associated mutations in SRSF2, we analyzed splicing responses on the MSD-L cell line and found that the missense mutation of proline 95 to histidine (P95H) and a P95-to-R102 in-frame 8-amino-acid deletion caused significant changes in alternative splicing. The affected genes were enriched in cancer development and apoptosis. These findings suggest that intact SRSF2 is essential for the functional integrity of the hematopoietic system and that its mutations likely contribute to development of myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Therefore, more effective therapies are needed. In this study, we investigated the chemosensitizing efficacy of the selective Wee-1 kinase inhibitor, AZD-1775, in HPV(+) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clonogenic survival assays and an orthotopic mouse model of HPV(+) oral cancer were used to examine the in vitro and in vivo sensitivity of HPV(+) HNSCC cell lines to AZD-1775 in combination with cisplatin, respectively. Cell-cycle analysis, DNA damage (gammaH2AX), homologous recombination (HR), and apoptosis were examined to dissect molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: We found that AZD-1775 displays single-agent activity and enhances the response of HPV(+) HNSCC cells to cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. The sensitivity of the HPV(+) HNSCC cells to AZD-1775 alone or in combination with cisplatin was associated with G2 checkpoint abrogation, persistent DNA damage, and apoptosis induction. This finding of AZD-1775 increasing the sensitivity of HPV(+) HNSCC cells to cisplatin through apoptosis was not seen previously in the HPV(-) HNSCC cancer cells and is accompanied by a decreased expression of the antiapoptotic proteins, MCl-1and XIAP, which appear to be cleaved following AZD-1775 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: AZD-1775 selectively sensitizes HPV(+) HNSCC cells and orthotopic oral xenografts to cisplatin through apoptosis and support the clinical investigation of AZD-1775 in combination with

Unfortunately, spontaneous immune responses are often inefficient. Significant effort is required to develop reliable, broadly applicable immunotherapies for cancer patients. A major innovation was transplantation with hematopoietic stem cells from genetically distinct donors for patients with hematologic malignancies. In this setting, donor T cells induce long-term remission by keeping cancer cells in check through powerful allogeneic graft-versus-leukemia effects. More recently, a long awaited breakthrough for patients with solid tissue cancers was achieved, by means of therapeutic blockade of T cell inhibitory receptors. In untreated cancer patients, T cells are dysfunctional and remain in a state of T cell ""exhaustion"". Nonetheless, they often retain a high potential for successful defense against cancer, indicating that many T cells are not entirely and irreversibly exhausted but can be mobilized to become highly functional. Novel antibody therapies that block inhibitory receptors can lead to strong activation of anti-tumor T cells, mediating clinically significant anti-cancer immunity for many years.

Whereas previous studies have focused on wtNPM in centrosome duplication, we further elucidate the role of NPM in the cell cycle by utilizing the increased cytoplasmic load of NPMc. Overexpression of NPMc causes increased phosphorylation of NPM on T199 and, to a lesser degree, S4. T199 phosphorylation is dependent on cdk2 but activators of cdk2 were not elevated. Upon inhibition of cdk2, NPMc-overexpressing cells demonstrate a greater G2/M phase arrest than wtNPM or GFP counterparts. However, the number of cells with 2 centrosomes did not increase concordantly. This suggests that the arrest was caused by a delay in centrosome duplication, most likely due to the inhibition of centrosome duplication caused by unphosphorylated NPMc. Overall, these results suggest that the phosphorylation of T199 is important in the mitotic progression of NPMc-expressing cells. This further supports the hypothesis that NPMc is associated with normal karyotypes in AML because the higher cytoplasmic load of NPM can better suppress centrosome overduplication which would otherwise result in unequal segregation of chromosomes during mitosis, leading to aneuploidy and other genomic instabilities.",,"['Chan, Narisa', 'Lim, Tit Meng']","['Chan N', 'Lim TM']","['Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, 14 Science Drive 4, Singapore 117543.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, 14 Science Drive 4, Singapore 117543.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150630,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Centrosome/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'G2 Phase', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Transport', 'Threonine/metabolism']",PMC4485321,,2015/07/01 06:00,2016/07/07 06:00,['2015/07/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['srep11777 [pii]', '10.1038/srep11777 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Jun 30;5:11777. doi: 10.1038/srep11777.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies show that elevated expression of survivin correlates with a worse clinic outcome in AML patients. It remains unclear whether inhibition of survivin may alter the efficacy of chemotherapy against AML. Here, we evaluate the effects of specific knockdown of survivin on AML cells' sensitivity to chemotherapy, and investigate the therapeutic potential of the transcription inhibitor of survivin YM155 either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. We found Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells had relatively higher expression levels of survivin among all AML cell lines tested. Specific knockdown of survivin in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells resulted in: inhibition of cell proliferation; cell cycle G2/M arrest; induction of DNA damage response and apoptosis. Downregulation of survivin enhanced etoposide- or doxorubicin-induced anti-proliferative/anti-survival activity in AML cells. The small molecule inhibitor YM155 reduced survivin in a dose- and time-dependent manner and trigged apoptosis in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells. The combinatorial effects of YM155 and chemotherapeutics were either synergetic or antagonistic, depending upon the drugs used for combination and the type of AML cells being treated. Collectively, our data demonstrate that survivin plays an important role in the maintenance and proliferation of AML cells. While specific knockdown of survivin enhances chemosensitivity, the combinations of YM155 and chemotherapeutic agents exhibit synergetic or antagonistic effects on AML cells. Our findings provide a rationale for further assessment of survivin-targeted therapy in the treatment of patients with AML.","['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd..

It is considered as a paradigm for the multistep nature of cancer initiation and progression. Genetic and epigenetic reprogramming events, which transform T-cell precursors into malignant T-ALL lymphoblasts, have been extensively characterized over the past decade. Despite our comprehensive understanding of the genomic landscape of human T-ALL, leukemia patients are still treated by high-dose multiagent chemotherapy, potentially followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Even with such aggressive treatment regimens, which are often associated with considerable acute and long-term side effects, about 15% of pediatric and 40% of adult T-ALL patients still relapse, owing to acquired therapy resistance, and present with very dismal survival perspectives. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms by which residual T-ALL tumor cells survive chemotherapy and act as a reservoir for leukemic progression and hematologic relapse remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is expected that enhanced molecular understanding of T-ALL disease biology will ultimately facilitate a targeted therapy driven approach that can reduce chemotherapy-associated toxicities and improve survival of refractory T-ALL patients through personalized salvage therapy. In this review, we summarize recent biological insights into the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL and speculate how the genetic landscape of T-ALL could trigger the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of human T-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For 11 specific cancer sites, age-standardised mortality rates were analysed for the rural and urban administrative districts of South Korea during 2006-2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Poisson log linear regression models were employed to estimate cancer-specific mortality rates, and Bonferroni comparison method was used to identify rural-urban disparities. RESULTS: There were significant rural-urban disparities observed for all cancer sites except prostate, pancreas and leukaemia. The mortality rates of lung, liver and stomach cancers, the three most common cancers in the country, were observed to be significantly higher in rural areas than in metropolitan areas. In contrast, the reverse relationship was observed for the reproductive system (breast and uterus) and colon cancers. Central nervous system cancer mortality was observed to be significantly higher in rural areas than in non-metro urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time ever, significant rural-urban disparity patterns in cancer mortality rates in South Korea have been identified in this paper.

Furthermore, variation in the efficiency of imatinib influx via OCT1 has been demonstrated to result in the inter-patient variation observed in primary response to imatinib. Although studies have questioned the role of OCT1 in imatinib influx, these have been largely performed in non-clinical settings. Measuring both OCT1 mRNA levels and the functional activity of OCT1 in primary leukaemic cells has been demonstrated to predict molecular response and outcome in imatinib-treated CP-CML patients in several independent studies.

The median age of onset is 67 years with a male predominance of 2:1. Localized infiltration in the oropharynx and paranasal sinuses is exceptionally rare. The aims of this study were (1) to add an additional case series of CLL with involvement of the oropharynx and paranasal sinuses to the literature and (2) to determine incidence and demographic data. METHODS: Retrospective chart review from 1990 to 2014. RESULTS: Five cases were found in our case series, representing 0.74% of the total number of cases analyzed (5/680). Sixteen additional cases were identified through literature review, resulting in a total of 21 cases of CLL (13 men, 8 women) with involvement of the oropharynx (n = 15) and paranasal sinuses (n = 6). The average age of patients with CLL in the oropharynx was 62 years whereas in the paranasal sinuses it was 52 years (p = 0.16). The average age of female cases was 62 years and the average age of male cases was 58 years (p = 0.63). Almost 85% (84.6%) of men had oropharynx invasion vs 50% of females (p = 0.15), which suggests a nonsignificant trend. CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate that CLL infiltrates the oropharynx or paranasal sinuses in less than 1% of CLL cases. Although there seems to be no age bias between invasion in the oropharynx and the paranasal sinuses, there is a trend whereby women appear more likely to experience invasion of the paranasal sinuses.","['(c) 2015 ARS-AAOA, LLC.']","['Melton, Myles F', 'Pearlman, Aaron N']","['Melton MF', 'Pearlman AN']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Weill Cornell Medical College, NewYork-Presybterian Hospital, New York, NY.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Weill Cornell Medical College, NewYork-Presybterian Hospital, New York, NY.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20150629,United States,Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,International forum of allergy & rhinology,101550261,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Paranasal Sinuses/*pathology', '*Sex Factors', 'United States']",,,2015/07/01 06:00,2016/12/30 06:00,['2015/07/01 06:00'],"['2015/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/alr.21584 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Forum Allergy Rhinol. 2015 Nov;5(11):1055-8. doi: 10.1002/alr.21584.

One hundred patients received prophylactic azithromycin, of whom 12 developed BOS. BOS was significantly more frequent in patients who were treated with than without prophylactic azithromycin (12.0 versus 6.4 %, P = 0.036). Multivariate analysis revealed that a busulfan-based conditioning regimen (HR 2.73, 95 % CI 1.66-6.45) was the only independent predictor of BOS.

METHODS: Bone marrows (volume 1-1. 5 mL) were collected from 372 untreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and peripheral blood samples (2. 0 mL) were obtained from 401 healthy controls for the purpose of total DNA extraction. Polymorphisms of rs4135385, rs11079571 and rs7832767 located in CTNNB1, AXIN2 and SFRP1 were genotyped with high-resolution melting method (HRM).

HYDM1 is characterized by abnormal growth of placenta and lack of proper embryonic development. The molar tissues are characterized by abnormal methylation patterns at differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of imprinted genes. It is not known whether this occurs before or after fertilization, but the high specificity of this defect to the maternal allele indicates a possible maternal germ line-specific effect. To better understand the unknown molecular mechanism leading to HYDM1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen against an ovarian library using NLRP7 as bait. We identified the transcriptional repressor ZBTB16 as an interacting protein of NLRP7 and verified this interaction in mammalian cells by immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. Native protein analysis detected NLRP7 and ZBTB16 in a 480kD protein complex and both proteins co-localize in the cytoplasm in juxtanuclear aggregates. HYDM1-causing mutations in NLRP7 did not show altered patterns of interaction with ZBTB16. Hence, the biological significance of the NLRP7-ZBTB16 interaction remains to be revealed.

Our objective is to study sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with use of informal care in patients with hematologic malignancy and analyze how these changes throughout different phases of the treatment. METHODS: 139 patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancy who received an haematopoietic stem cell transplantation between 2006-2011 in two Spanish hospitals completed the developed postal questionnaire. A binary logistic regression model was used to analyse the factors associated with use of informal care each of four phases of the treatment (pretransplant, first year, second and third year, and from the fouth to sixth year postransplant). Dependent variable was receive vs. not receive informal care. RESULTS: Patients diagnosed with acute leukemia had higher probability of receiving informal care during pretransplant period (OR = 6.394) and during the second and third year postransplantation (OR = 42.212). In the long-term (4-6 years), multiple myeloma patients were the ones who required more informal care (OR = 15.977). Health status was statistically significant during all phases. Being male (OR = 0.263), having partner (OR = 0.137) and being employed (OR = 0.110) were associated with lower likelihood of receiving informal care in the long-term. CONCLUSIONS: Over 75% of patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancy received informal care during pretrasplant and first year postransplant.

In this work, we developed an in silico target fishing protocol to identify the primary target of GV2-20, a false-positive hit highlighted in a cell-based screen for 14-3-3 modulators. Although GV2-20 does not bind to 14-3-3 proteins, it showed remarkable antiproliferative effects in CML cells, thus raising interest toward the identification of its primary target. Six potential targets of GV2-20 were prioritized in silico and tested in vitro. Our results show that the molecule is a potent inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2), thus confirming the predictive capability of our protocol.

These analyses include 17,435 cohort members alive and not known to have had cancer prior to January 1, 1956 who lived in areas near the river or Chelyabinsk City at some time between 1956 and the end of 2007, utilized individualized dose estimates computed using the Techa River Dosimetry System 2009 and included five more years of follow-up. The median and mean dose estimates based on these doses are consistently higher than those based on earlier Techa River Dosimetry System 2000 dose estimates. This article includes new site-specific cancer risk estimates and risk estimates adjusted for available information on smoking. There is a statistically significant (P = 0.02) linear trend in the smoking-adjusted all-solid cancer incidence risks with an excess relative risk (ERR) after exposure to 100 mGy of 0.077 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.013-0.15. Examination of site-specific risks revealed statistically significant radiation dose effects only for cancers of the esophagus and uterus with an ERR per 100 mGy estimates in excess of 0.10. Esophageal cancer risk estimates were modified by ethnicity and sex, but not smoking. While the solid cancer rates are attenuated when esophageal cancer is removed (ERR = 0.063 per 100 mGy), a dose-response relationship is present and it remains likely that radiation exposure has increased the risks for most solid cancers in the cohort despite the lack of power to detect statistically significant risks for specific sites.",,"['Davis, F G', 'Yu, K L', 'Preston, D', 'Epifanova, S', 'Degteva, M', 'Akleyev, A V']","['Davis FG', 'Yu KL', 'Preston D', 'Epifanova S', 'Degteva M', 'Akleyev AV']","['a Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois;', 'b Epidemiology, Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation;', 'd Hirosoft International Corporation, Eureka, California; and.', 'b Epidemiology, Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation;', 'c Biophysics Laboratories, Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation;', 'e Clinical Department, Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation.']",['eng'],['HHSN261200900089C/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150629,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Rivers', 'Russia/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",,,2015/06/30 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2015/06/30 06:00'],"['2015/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1667/RR14023.1 [pii]', '10.1667/RR14023.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2015 Jul;184(1):56-65. doi: 10.1667/RR14023.1.

We used 10-fold cross-validation to achieve accuracy and also decision tree algorithm to find the relation between the biomarkers for biological point of view. To test the ability of the trained ANN models to categorize the cancers, we analyzed additional blinded samples that were not previously used for the training procedure.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which 21 therapy-naive patients with AML were compared with a group of 24 healthy individuals. The following data were analyzed: serum proteins, leucocytes and subgroups, erythrocytes, hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelets, cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultures under spontaneous and BCG- or PHA-stimulated conditions, immunoglobulin A, and erythrocytic glutathione. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, considering as significant p-values<0.05. RESULTS: Serum albumin levels were higher (p<0.0001) in the control group, as well as all the parameters related to red blood cells (p<0.0001). For leucocytes and subgroups, no statistical difference was found between the AML and the control groups. For cytokines, the concentrations were significantly higher under spontaneous and BCG-stimulated conditions for TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma in the control group. Under PHA-stimulated conditions, the concentration was higher (p=0.002) only for IL-6. No difference was found between the two groups for the other cytokines and for IgA in the saliva. Erythrocytic glutathione was higher (p<0.0001) in AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to characterize the biochemical and immunological profile of pediatric patients with AML, as well as highlight some significant differences in these parameters when comparing with healthy children and adolescents.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

Previously, we have demonstrated that Rcor1 is essential for the maturation of definitive erythroid cells and fetal survival. To determine the functional role of Rcor1 in steady-state hematopoiesis in the adult, we used a conditional knockout approach. Here, we show that the loss of Rcor1 expression results in the rapid onset of severe anemia due to a complete, cell autonomous block in the maturation of committed erythroid progenitors. By contrast, both the frequency of megakaryocyte progenitors and their capacity to produce platelets were normal. Although the frequency of common lymphoid progenitors and T cells was not altered, B cells were significantly reduced and showed increased apoptosis. However, Rcor1-deficient bone marrow sustained normal levels of B-cells following transplantation, indicating a non-cell autonomous requirement for Rcor1 in B-cell survival. Evaluation of the myelomonocytic lineage revealed an absence of mature neutrophils and a significant increase in the absolute number of monocytic cells. Rcor1-deficient monocytes were less apoptotic and showed approximately 100-fold more colony-forming activity than their normal counterparts, but did not give rise to leukemia. Moreover, Rcor1(-/-) monocytes exhibited extensive, cytokine-dependent self-renewal and overexpressed genes associated with hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell expansion including Gata2, Meis1, and Hoxa9. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Rcor1 is essential for the normal differentiation of myeloerythroid progenitors and for appropriately regulating self-renewal activity in the monocyte lineage.",['(c) 2015 AlphaMed Press.'],"['Yao, Huilan', 'Goldman, Devorah C', 'Fan, Guang', 'Mandel, Gail', 'Fleming, William H']","['Yao H', 'Goldman DC', 'Fan G', 'Mandel G', 'Fleming WH']","['Vollum Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Oregon Stem Cell Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Vollum Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Oregon Stem Cell Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.']",['eng'],"['S10 RR027376/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'S10RR027376/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL069133/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS022518/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL069133/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS22518/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150714,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Rcor1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage/*physiology', 'Co-Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism']",PMC7402203,['NIHMS1610761'],2015/06/30 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2015/06/30 06:00'],"['2015/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.2086 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2015 Nov;33(11):3304-14. doi: 10.1002/stem.2086.

Plasma levels of hCAP-18 were determined using immunoblot and ELISA. Patients with severe congenital neutropenia (n = 23) presented with the lowest levels of plasma hCAP-18 and differential diagnostic accuracy revealed high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (98.8%) for hCAP-18 ELISA. The correlation coefficient of the hCAP-18 ELISA versus immunoblotting was (R = 0.831) and that of the peptide LL-37 ELISA versus immunoblotting was (R = 0.405) (P < 0.001). Plasma hCAP-18 levels thus displayed high diagnostic value in differential diagnosis of chronic neutropenia. Neutropenic patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Barth syndrome, Cohen syndrome, acute myeloid leukaemia and specific granule deficiency presented with reduced plasma hCAP-18 levels as well.

We investigated the antiproliferative activity of hirsutanone (Hir) and oregonin (Ore) in human cancer cell lines and elucidated their mechanisms of action. A cytotoxicity study using a panel of 12 human cancer and 4 normal cell lines indicated that Hir exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against 4 leukemia (Jurkat, U937, THP-1, and HL-60) and 2 colon cancer cell lines (HCT-15 and Colo205). Although Ore suppressed the cell growth of Jurkat and THP-1, its inhibitory potency was weaker than that of Hir. The IC50 values of Hir and Ore in Jurkat were 11.37 muM and 22.16 muM, respectively. Further analysis on Jurkat cells demonstrated that Hir caused a sequence of events involved in apoptosis, including nuclear morphological changes and accumulation of cells with sub-G1 DNA content. Hir led to the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9. In addition, Hir-induced PARP cleavage was completely abolished by specific inhibitors to these caspases. Our data suggested that Hir is a potent antiproliferative compound against the 4 leukemia cell lines and the 2 colon cancer cell lines tested.

In tumors, telomere length is maintained by Telomerase activity or by the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres mechanism, whose hallmark is the telomeric localization of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein. Whether PML contributes to telomeres maintenance in normal cells is unknown. We show that in normal human fibroblasts the PML protein associates with few telomeres, preferentially when they are damaged. Proliferation-induced telomere attrition or their damage due to alteration of the shelterin complex enhances the telomeric localization of PML, which is increased in human T-lymphocytes derived from patients genetically deficient in telomerase. In normal fibroblasts, PML depletion induces telomere damage, nuclear and chromosomal abnormalities, and senescence. Expression of the leukemia protein PML/RARalpha in hematopoietic progenitors displaces PML from telomeres and induces telomere shortening in the bone marrow of pre-leukemic mice.

Mechanisms that keep this balance in check include regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs consist of a small but heterogeneous population which may be identified by the phenotype, CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127-. Role of Tregs in pathogenesis of cancers is thus far supported by evidence of increased Tregs in various cancers and may contribute to poorer prognosis. Tregs may also be important in acute leukemias. OBJECTIVE: A review of the literature on Tregs in acute leukemias was conducted and Tregs were determined in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). RESULTS: Studies on Tregs in B-cell ALL are few and controversial. We observed a significantly increased percentage of Tregs (mean +/- SD, 9.72 +/- 3.79% vs. 7.05 +/- 1.74%; P = 0.047) in the bone marrow/peripheral blood of ALL (n = 17) compared to peripheral blood of normal controls (n = 35). A positive trend between Tregs and age (R = 0.474, P = 0.055, n = 17) implicates this factor of poor prognosis in B-cell ALL. DISCUSSION: Tregs in cancer are particularly significant in immunotherapy. The manipulation of the immune system to treat cancer has for a long time ignored regulatory mechanisms inducible or in place. In lymphoma studies tumor-specific mechanisms that are unlike conventional methods in the induction of Tregs have been hypothesized. In addition, tumor-infiltrating Tregs may present different profiles from peripheral blood pictures. Tregs will continue to be dissected to reveal their mysteries and their impact on clinical significance.",,"['Idris, Siti-Zuleha', 'Hassan, Norfarazieda', 'Lee, Le-Jie', 'Md Noor, Sabariah', 'Osman, Raudhawati', 'Abdul-Jalil, Marsitah', 'Nordin, Abdul-Jalil', 'Abdullah, Maha']","['Idris SZ', 'Hassan N', 'Lee LJ', 'Md Noor S', 'Osman R', 'Abdul-Jalil M', 'Nordin AJ', 'Abdullah M']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150629,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/*pathology']",,,2015/06/30 06:00,2016/07/13 06:00,['2015/06/30 06:00'],"['2015/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000025 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Oct;20(9):523-9. doi: 10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000025.

METHODS: We studied 80,925 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age >/= 65 years in 1992-2009 from the nationwide 16 areas of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked data. Cumulative incidence and the time to events Cox hazard regressions were used to explore the risks of outcomes in association with the receipt of CSFs and ESAs. RESULTS: Patients who received chemotherapy (CT) with both CSF and ESA were 58% more likely to develop VTE than those who received CT without CSF and ESA (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.43-1.76). The risk of stroke appeared to be not associated with the use of CSF and ESA, whereas the risk of heart disease was only significantly elevated in those patients who did not receive CT but received ESA. The risk of acute myeloid leukemia or MDS was significantly increased 4- to 9-fold in patients who received ESA, regardless of receipt of CT or CSF. CONCLUSION: The use of ESAs was significantly associated with a substantially increased risk of MDS in patients with colorectal cancer. The use of CSFs and ESAs was also significantly associated with a moderately increased risk of VTE and a slightly elevated risk of heart disease.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In human, two isotypes of CD23 have been identified and related to different functions. The aim of our study was to investigate the relative expression of the two CD23 isotypes in CLL and find possible correlation with other prognostic factors. The expression of CD23 isotypes was analyzed in 54 cases of CLL by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR. The immunophenotype of CLL cells was characterized by flow cytometry. We demonstrated a higher CD23a than CD23b expression of CLL cells. Our results also revealed two subsets of CLL cases with a distinct CD23 isotype expression pattern. Thirty-two percent of the cases (group CLL1) showed both low mRNA level of CD23 isotypes and high protein levels of CD20 and CD38 in contrast to group CLL2 with high CD23 mRNA levels. By correlating these results to the presence of prognostic factors determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that the majority of the cases of group CLL1 (14/17) carried trisomy 12. In summary, our results confirm a high CD23a/CD23b ratio of the CLL cells and demonstrate that in a subset of CLL cases, low CD23 expression together with high CD20 and CD38 expressions may serve as a surrogate for trisomy 12.

This state was first observed in mouse embryonic stem cells and is characterized by high rates of proliferation, the ability to differentiate widely, and global hypomethylation. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) correspond to a later or ""primed"" stage of embryonic development. The conversion of hPSCs to a naive state is desirable as their features should facilitate techniques such as gene editing and more efficient differentiation. Here we review protocols which now allow derivation of naive human pluripotent stem cells by transgene expression or the use of media formulations containing inhibitors and growth factors and correlate this with pathways involved. Maintenance of these ground state cells is possible using a combination of basic fibroblast growth factor and human leukemia inhibitory factor together with dual inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). Close similarity between the ground state hPSC and the in vivo preimplantation epiblast have been shown both by demonstrating similar upregulation of endogenous retroviruses and correlation of global RNA-seq data. This suggests that the human naive state is not an in vitro artifact.","['(c) 2015 The Authors STEM CELLS published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of', 'AlphaMed Press.']","['Dodsworth, Benjamin T', 'Flynn, Rowan', 'Cowley, Sally A']","['Dodsworth BT', 'Flynn R', 'Cowley SA']","['Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['BB/L015447/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150714,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Embryonic Development/physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology/transplantation', 'Humans', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*physiology/transplantation', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",PMC4833179,,2015/06/30 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2015/06/30 06:00'],"['2015/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.2085 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2015 Nov;33(11):3181-6. doi: 10.1002/stem.2085.

The mechanisms through which HSCs prevent such detrimental accumulation, however, are unclear. Here, we show that Aspp1 coordinates with p53 to maintain the genomic integrity of the HSC pool. Aspp1 is preferentially expressed in HSCs and restricts HSC pool size by attenuating self-renewal under steady-state conditions. After genotoxic stress, Aspp1 promotes HSC cycling and induces p53-dependent apoptosis in cells with persistent DNA damage foci. Beyond these p53-dependent functions, Aspp1 attenuates HSC self-renewal and accumulation of DNA damage in p53 null HSCs. Consequently, concomitant loss of Aspp1 and p53 leads to the development of hematological malignancies, especially T cell leukemia and lymphoma. Together, these data highlight coordination between Aspp1 and p53 in regulating HSC self-renewal and DNA damage tolerance and suggest that HSCs possess specific mechanisms that prevent accumulation of mutations and malignant transformation.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Ibrutinib had an acceptable tolerability profile. Less than 10% of patients discontinued their treatment because of adverse events. Results are pending in other B-cell lymphomas subtypes such as in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in follicular lymphoma. An approval extension has already been enregistered for Waldenstrom disease in USA in January 2015. Given its efficacy and tolerability, ibrutinib is an emerging treatment option for patients with B-cell malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Societe Francise du Cancer.

Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is central to ATO treatment efficacy of acute promyelocytic leukemia. We examine impacts of PML expression on the effectiveness of ATO treatment in HCC. We show that increased PML expression predicts longer survival and lower cancer recurrence rates after HCC resection. However, high PML expression dampens the anti-tumor effects of ATO in HCC cells. Gene microarray analysis shows that reduced PML expression significantly down-regulates expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A1 (ALDH3A1). ALDH3A1 depression facilitates accumulation of ATO-induced reactive oxygen species. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and promoter activity assays confirm that PML regulates ALDH3A1 expression through binding to the promoter region of ALDH3A1. Clinically, ATO treatment decreases the disease progression rate in advanced HCC patients with negative PML expression. In conclusion, PML confers a favorable prognosis in HCC patients, but it induces ATO resistance through ALDH3A1 up-regulation in HCC cells. ATO is effective for HCC patients with negative PML expression. Combined with an ALDH3A1 inhibitor, ATO may be efficacious in patients with positive PML expression.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In HL60 cells, YM155 inhibition of growth proliferation was due to apoptosis which was measured by annexin V/PI staining. YM155 induced apoptosis through activation of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways that also culminated in caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage. YM155 sensitivity was partially associated with this compound's ability to down-regulate survivin transcription since this was more pronounced in the HL60 cell line. However, marked differences were also observed in XIAP, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1L, and Mcl-1s. Furthermore, YM155 treatment completely inhibited production of total Akt protein in HL60, but not U937 cells. Importantly, Akt activity (pAkt-Ser473) levels were maintained in YM155 treated U937 cells which may help stabilize other anti-apoptotic proteins. Combination treatments with an Akt inhibitor, MK-2206, reduced levels of pAkt-Ser473 in U937 cells and synergistically sensitized them to YM155 cytotoxicity. Collectively our results indicate that Akt signaling may be an important factor mediating YM155 response in AML, and combinatorial therapies with Akt inhibitors could improve treatment efficacy in YM155-resistant cells.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

For this reason, the present study was designed to evaluate the cytotoxicity and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in maleimide-induced cell death. Cell viability assays were performed to determine the cell death type in leukemia cell line induced by the compounds. The oxidative stress in maleimidetreated cells was characterized by antioxidant enzymes activities, intracellular ROS generation, and lipid peroxidation. In addition, we evaluated mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP level. Maleimide derivatives exhibited cytotoxic effects in leukemia cells with significantly increased ROS generation. However, cell viability was partly restored by catalase-treated cells. Caspases activities and caspase-independent key genes related to apoptosis were not altered by maleimides, suggesting necrosis as the main cell death process. Maleimide-induced necrosis was associated with oxidative stress, as an imbalance between ROS levels and glutathione reductase (GR) activity. This damage was also demonstrated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP depletion in cells treated with maleimide derivatives. These findings strongly confirmed that maleimide derivatives promoted cell death in leukemia cells triggered by oxidative stress, indicating that these compounds might be promising antitumor agents or lead molecules.",,"['Rosolen, Daiane', 'Noldin, Vania F', 'Winter, Evelyn', 'Filippin-Monteiro, Fabiola B', 'Campos-Buzzi, Fatima', 'Cechinel-Filho, Valdir', 'Creczynski-Pasa, Tania B']","['Rosolen D', 'Noldin VF', 'Winter E', 'Filippin-Monteiro FB', 'Campos-Buzzi F', 'Cechinel-Filho V', 'Creczynski-Pasa TB']","['Departamento de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Centro de Ciencias da Saude, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, 88040-900, CP 476 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil. tania.pasa@ufsc.br.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '2519R1UGP8 (maleimide)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Maleimides/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Propidium/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",,,2015/06/30 06:00,2016/06/14 06:00,['2015/06/30 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-68325 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520615666150629102158 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2015;15(9):1164-73. doi: 10.2174/1871520615666150629102158.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The availability of goat embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that are characteristically immortal in culture would be of enormous benefit for developing genetically modified animals. As an alternative to long-sought goat ESCs, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) by forced expression of bovine POU5F1, SOX2, MYC, KLF4, LIN-28, and NANOG reprogramming factors in combination with a MIR302/367 cluster, delivered by lentiviral vectors. In order to minimize integrations, the reprogramming factor coding sequences were assembled with porcine teschovirus-1 2A (P2A) self-cleaving peptides that allowed for tri-cistronic expression from each vector. The lentiviral-transduced cells were cultured on irradiated mouse feeder cells in a semi-defined, serum-free medium containing fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and/or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The resulting goat iPSC exhibit cell and colony morphology typical of human and mouse ESCs-that is, well-defined borders, a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, a short cell-cycle interval, alkaline phosphatase expression, and the ability to generate teratomas in vivo.

Rearrangement of the MLL1 gene generates chimeric proteins that fuse the NH3 terminus of MLL1 to the COOH terminus of its translocation partners. These MLL1 fusion oncoproteins drive the expression of homeobox genes such as HOXA cluster genes and myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 homolog (MEIS1), which are known to induce leukemic transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. Genomewide histone methylation studies have revealed that the abnormal expression of MLL1 fusion target genes is associated with high levels of H3K79 methylation at these gene loci. The only known enzyme that catalyzes methylation of H3K79 is disruptor of telomeric-silencing 1-like (DOT1L). Loss-of-function mouse models, as well as small molecular inhibitors of DOT1L, illustrate that leukemias driven by MLL1 translocations are dependent on DOT1L enzymatic activity for proliferation and for the maintenance of HOXA gene expression. Furthermore, DOT1L also appears to be important for HOXA gene expression in other settings including leukemias with select genetic abnormalities. These discoveries have established a foundation for disease-specific therapies that target chromatin modifications in highly malignant leukemias harboring specific genetic abnormalities. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying MLL1 translocation-driven leukemogenesis and the latest progress on DOT1L-targeted epigenetic therapies for MLL1-rearranged and other leukemias.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The canonical function of PRC2 is the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine residue 27. This epigenetic modification is associated with gene silencing. Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic functions have been reported for PRC2, depending on cellular context. In leukemia mediated by the leukemogenic fusion MLL-AF9, complete ablation of canonical PRC2 function by genetic inactivation of the core component embryonic ectoderm development (Eed) or by combined pharmacologic inhibition of the PRC2 methyltransferases EZH2 and EZH1 has a strong anti-leukemic effect, and this effect has been linked to de-repression of the PRC2 target locus Cdkn2a. We asked whether inactivation of Cdkn2a is sufficient to restore leukemic activity of Eed-inactivated MLL-AF9 leukemia cells, using combined genetic inactivation of Cdkn2a and Eed. We found that Cdkn2a inactivation partially rescues in vitro and in vivo growth of Eed-inactivated MLL-AF9 cells. However, the growth of Eed-null Cdkn2a-null MLL-AF9 cells in the absence of Cdkn2a remained severely compromised in vitro and in vivo, compared with that of their Eed-floxed Cdkn2a-null counterparts. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that several genes previously implicated in inefficient growth of MLL-AF9-transformed cells, including Gata2, Egr1, and Cdkn2b were de-repressed as a consequence of Eed inactivation. Furthermore, we found that direct binding targets of MLL fusion proteins are negatively enriched in Eed-inactivated Cdkn2a-null MLL-AF9-transformed cells. Our data indicate that interference with PRC2 function affects MLL-AF9-mediated leukemogenesis by both Cdkn2a-dependent and Cdkn2a-independent mechanisms.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The protein breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1)-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a deubiquitinase interacting with the DNA repair regulator BRCA1 and is frequently inactivated in many cancers. Here, we report that BAP1 mRNA and protein levels are downregulated in a BCR-ABL1-expressing hematopoietic cell line (UT-7/11). A decrease of BAP1 transcripts is also observed in newly diagnosed CML patients. Moreover, BAP1 protein levels are low or undetectable in CD34(+) cells from CML patients at diagnosis as compared with CD34(+) cells from normal donors. In addition, BRCA1 protein level is reduced in BCR-ABL1-expressing UT-7/11 cells. Finally, the enforced expression of BAP1 is associated with BRCA1 protein deubiquitination and restoration. These results demonstrate BAP1 as a major link with the BCR-ABL-induced downregulation of BRCA1 in CML.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

From karyotyping, which detects only large genomic aberrations of metaphase chromosomes, we have moved into an era when sequencing of each base pair allows us to define the AML genome at highest resolution. This has revealed a new complex landscape of genetic aberrations where addition of mutations in epigenetic regulators has been one of the most important contributions to the understanding of the pathogenesis of AML. These findings, together with new insights into epigenetic mechanisms, have placed dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms at the forefront of AML development. Not only have several new mutations in genes directly involved in epigenetic regulatory mechanisms been discovered, but also previously well-known gene fusions have been found to exert aberrant effects through epigenetic mechanisms. In addition, mutations in epigenetic regulators such as DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 have recently been found to be the earliest known events during AML evolution and to be present as preleukemic lesions before the onset of AML. In this article, we review epigenetic changes in AML also in relation to what is known about their mechanism of action and their prognostic role.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Retrospective analyses were conducted to characterize mutation development in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP treated with dasatinib (n=259) or imatinib (n=260) in DASISION (Dasatinib versus Imatinib Study in Treatment-Naive CML-CP), with 3-year minimum follow-up.

Cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption have also been found to affect leukemia risk. Previous analyses in a large cohort of Chornobyl clean-up workers in Ukraine found significant radiation-related increased risk for all leukemia types. We investigated the potential for additional effects of occupational and lifestyle factors on leukemia risk in this radiation-exposed cohort. METHODS: In a case-control study of chronic lymphocytic and other leukemias among Chornobyl cleanup workers, we collected data on a range of non-radiation exposures. We evaluated these and other potential risk factors in analyses adjusting for estimated bone marrow radiation dose. We calculated Odds Ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals in relation to lifestyle factors and occupational hazards. RESULTS: After adjusting for radiation, we found no clear association of leukemia risk with smoking or alcohol but identified a two-fold elevated risk for non-CLL leukemia with occupational exposure to petroleum (OR=2.28; 95% Confidence Interval 1.13, 6.79). Risks were particularly high for myeloid leukemias. No associations with risk factors other than radiation were found for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

NCOR1 and H3K9me3 ChIP-Seq, FAIRE-seq and DNA CpG methylation interactions were related to gene expression using bootstrapping approaches. Most NCOR1 combinations (24/44) were associated with significantly elevated level expression of protein coding genes and only very few combinations related to gene repression. DAVID's biological process annotation revealed that elevated gene expression was uniquely associated with acetylation and ETS binding. A matrix of gene and drug interactions built on NCI-60 data identified that Imatinib significantly targeted the NCOR1 governed transcriptome. Stable knockdown of NCOR1 in K562 cells slowed growth and significantly repressed genes associated with NCOR1 cistrome, again, with the GO terms acetylation and ETS binding, and significantly dampened sensitivity to Imatinib-induced erythroid differentiation. Mining public microarray data revealed that NCOR1-targeted genes were significantly enriched in Imatinib response gene signatures in cell lines and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. These approaches integrated cistrome, transcriptome and drug sensitivity relationships to reveal that NCOR1 function is surprisingly most associated with elevated gene expression, and that these targets, both in CML cell lines and patients, associate with sensitivity to Imatinib.","['(c) The Author(s) 2015.

Simple and interpretable descriptors derived from a two-dimensional representation of the chemical structures along with quantum topological molecular similarity indices have been used for model development, employing unambiguous modeling strategies that strictly obey the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis. The structure-toxicity relationships that emerged from both classification and regression-based models were in accordance with the findings of some previous studies. The models suggested that the cytotoxicity of ionic liquids is dependent on the cationic surfactant action, long alkyl side chains, cationic lipophilicity as well as aromaticity, the presence of a dialkylamino substituent at the 4-position of the pyridinium nucleus and a bulky anionic moiety. The models have been transparently presented in the form of equations, thus allowing their easy transferability in accordance with the OECD guidelines. The models have also been subjected to rigorous validation tests proving their predictive potential and can hence be used for designing novel and ""greener"" ionic liquids.

G-CSF acts by binding to its receptor G-CSFR (also called CSF3R), a member of the cytokine receptor type I superfamily, which after binding with G-CSF activates the canonical Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer, activator of transcription (STAT)and Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathways. G-CSF has been applied to the clinic to treat congenital and acquired neutropenia before or during courses of intensive chemotherapy. It has also been applied to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells into the peripheral blood for Auto-or allogeneic transplantation, and the priming strategies designed to enhance the sensitivity of leukemia stem cells to cytotoxic agents in protocols aimed to induce their differentiation, accompanying growth arrest, and cell death. With the rapid development of molecular genetics and clinical research, CSF3R mutations have been implicated in the progression of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) to leukemia.

METHODS: The clinical data of 70 adult PNH cases in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2009 were analyzed retrospectively, and the clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, treatment, complications and prognostic factors influencing survival rate were assessed. RESULTS: The nosopoietic median age of 70 cases(41 male cases and 29 female cases) was 37 (18-73) years old. The clinical manifestation included fatigue (87.1%), hemogolobinuria (44.3%), infection (22.9%), bleeding (37.1%), and abdominal pain (2.9%). FHb (free hemoglobin) in 56 patients (80%) was <50 mg/L. Hp (haptoglobin) in 54 patients (77.1%) was <0.5 g/L, and LDH in 49 patients (70.0%) was <220 U/L. The overall 10 year-survival rate after diagnosis was 72.2% estimated by Kaplan-Meier. The complications in this study were as follow: recurrent abdominal pain crisis (2.9%), infections (30.0%), thrombotic events (8.6%), evolution to MDS/AML (5.7%), calculus (11.4%) and death (17.1%). Both univariate and multivariate analyses identified risk factors affecting survival, including development of thrombotic events, progression to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelogenous leukemia (MDS/AML) and recurrent infections.

METHODS: A total of 80 patients with acute leukemia were collected and according to FAB classification standards they were divided into 65 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 15 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); R banding technique was used taken to detect their chromosome and to analyze the relationship between chromosome and efficacy of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Out of 65 cases of AML, 31 cases showed abnormal karyotypes and their aberration rate was 47.7%; among 31 cases of AML with chromosome abnormalities, the t (15; 17) was found in 9 cases and they accounted for 29%; t (8; 21) was found in 7 cases and they accounted for 22.6%; other karyotype and complex karyotypes were found in 15 cases and they accounted for 48.4%; the remission rate of t (15; 17) group was 88.9%, remission rate of t (8; 21) group was 71.4%, remission rate of other karyotype group was 66.7%. The comparison of between different groups showed that remission rate of t (15; 17) group was significantly higher than that in T (8; 21) group, other karyotype group and normal karyotype group (chi2=9.625,14.267,7.768, P<0.05); the remission rate between t (8; 21) group, other karyotype group and normal karyotype group was no significant different (chi2=0.517, 0.111, P>0.05). In 15 cases of ALL, 8 cases with normal karyotype accounted for 53.3%, 7 cases with abnormal karyotype accounted for 46.7% of ALL; as compared with AML, no significant difference was shown (chi2=0.020, P>0.05); the remission rates of patients with normal karyotype and abnormal karyotype were 87.5% and 42.9% respectively, the difference between the two groups had statistical significance (chi2=43.834, P<0.01).

METHODS: A total of 598 newly diagnosed ALL patients were enrolled and received prednisone pre-treatment. Based on the peripheral lymphoblast count on day 8, these patients were divided into 2 groups: prednisone good response (PGR) and prednisone poor response (PPR). PPR patients were classified into high risk group immediately and then received intensed chemotherapy. The all enrolled patients were followed up and the clinical features and treatment outcomes of the two groups were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with PGR group, PPR group had different characteristics. They were older in age and had higher initial white blood cell count (P<0.05). T-cell ALL (T-ALL) and Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL (Ph+ ALL) were frequent in PPR group (P<0.05). Event-free survival (EFS) rate of PPR group was significantly lower than that of PGR group (P<0.05). 2 year event-free survival(EFS) rate of PGR group was (88.3+/-1.5)%, while the 2-year EFS rate of PPR group was (58.4+/-5.3)%. 5 year EFS rates of PGR and PPR were (80.8+/-2.1)% and (53.4+/-6.0)%, respectively. The EFS rate of PPR group was falling rapidly within 2 years. PPR group had higher relapse rate, and most relapses occurred within 18 months (P<0.05). PPR group had more high incidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) both on day 33 and on week 12 (P<0.05). No significant difference of EFS and relapse time was found between PPR and high risk PGR patients (P>0.05). In multi-variate regression analysis, the PPR, the presence of BCR-ABL1 and MLL were significantly unfavorable factors (P<0.05).

Genotypes of RAD51-G135C and XRCC3-C241T were analyzed by TaqMan probe technology and the ralatienship between RAD51-G135C/XRCC3-C241T polymorphisms and onset of acute myeloid leukemia was investigated. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, RAD51-G135C homozygous mutant (CC) could significantly increase the risk of AML patients (OR=3.07), and there was no statistical relationship between heterozygous mutant (GC) of RAD51-G135C and onset of AML. There was no statistical relationship between homozygous mutant (TT) of XRCC3-C241T and onset of AML, and the XRCC3-C241T heterozygous mutation type (CT) increased the risk of AML patients (OR=0.66). CONCLUSION: RAD51-G135C homozygous mutant and XRCC3-C241T heterozygous mutation significantly increase the risk of the AML onset, which can provide more predictive value for incidence of AML.",,"['Miao, Lei', 'Qian, Xi-Feng', 'Yang, Guo-Hua', 'Zhao, Li-Dong']","['Miao L', 'Qian XF', 'Yang GH', 'Zhao LD']","['Department of Hematology, Lianyungang Hospital Affiliated to Xuzhou Medical College, Lianyungang 222000, Jiangsu Province, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Wuxi People's Hospital, Wuxi 214000, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Wuxi People's Hospital, Wuxi 214000, Jiangsu Province, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Lianyungang Hospital Affiliated to Xuzhou Medical College, Lianyungang 222000, Jiangsu Province, China.

Galectin-1 recognises intracellular-membrane-anchored Ras proteins that act as molecular switches regulating multiple signal transduction pathways. Human tumours frequently express Ras proteins that have become continuously activated due to point mutations, and this typically leads to deregulation of tumour cell growth, angiogenesis and invasion of metastatic cancer cells. Of significance is that galectin-1 preferably recognises H-Ras, one of the human Ras isoforms, and in particular galectin-1 recognition of the H-Ras farnesyl moiety is paramount to H-Ras membrane anchorage, a prerequisite step for H-Ras-mediated signal transduction regulating normal cell growth and malignant transformation. Herein the impact of the redox state on galectin-1's ability to interact with farnesyl analogues is explored. We demonstrate for the first time that reduced galectin-1 directly binds farnesyl and does so in a carbohydrate-independent manner. A K28T mutation abolishes farnesyl recognition by reduced dimeric galectin-1 whilst its carbohydrate-binding activity is retained, thus demonstrating the presence of an independent region on galectin-1 pertaining to growth inhibitory activity. Intriguingly, oxidised galectin-1 also recognises farnesyl, the biological implication of this novel finding is yet to be elucidated. Further, the redox effect on galectin-1 extracellular function was investigated and we discover that oxidised galectin-1 demonstrates a protective effect upon acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells challenged by oxidative stress.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie', 'Moleculaire (SFBBM).

Curcumin has been shown to exhibit antitumor activities in a wide spectrum of human cancer. The addition of Curcumin, to Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) cells, caused a dose-dependent increase of PTEN, target of miR-21. Curcumin treatment also decreased AKT phosphorylation and VEGF expression and release. Colony formation assays indicated that Curcumin affects the survival of CML cells. Some observation suggest a possible cellular disposal of miRNAs by exosomes. To elucidate if Curcumin caused a decrease of miR-21 in CML cells and its packaging in exosomes, we analyzed miR-21 content in K562 and LAMA84 cells and exosomes, after treatment with Curcumin. Furthermore, we showed that addition of Curcumin to CML cells caused a downregulation of Bcr-Abl expression through the cellular increase of miR-196b.The effects of Curcumin was then investigated on a CML xenograft in SCID mice. We observed that animals treated with Curcumin, developed smaller tumors compared to mice control. Real time PCR analysis showed that exosomes, released in the plasma of the Curcumin-treated mice, were enriched in miR-21 with respect control. Taken together, our results suggested that a selective packaging of miR-21 in exosomes may contribute to the antileukemic effect of Curcumin in CML.",,"['Taverna, Simona', 'Giallombardo, Marco', 'Pucci, Marzia', 'Flugy, Anna', 'Manno, Mauro', 'Raccosta, Samuele', 'Rolfo, Christian', 'De Leo, Giacomo', 'Alessandro, Riccardo']","['Taverna S', 'Giallombardo M', 'Pucci M', 'Flugy A', 'Manno M', 'Raccosta S', 'Rolfo C', 'De Leo G', 'Alessandro R']","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Metodologie Biomediche, Sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Universita di Palermo, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Metodologie Biomediche, Sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Universita di Palermo, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Metodologie Biomediche, Sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Universita di Palermo, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Metodologie Biomediche, Sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Universita di Palermo, Italy.', 'Istituto di Biofisica, CNR, Palermo, Italy.', 'Istituto di Biofisica, CNR, Palermo, Italy.', 'Phase I - Early Clinical Trials Unit Oncology Department and Center of Oncological Research (CORE), University Hospital Antwerp & Antwerp University, Belgium.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Metodologie Biomediche, Sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Universita di Palermo, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Metodologie Biomediche, Sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Universita di Palermo, Italy.', 'Istituto di Biomedicina e Immunologia Molecolare (IBIM), Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Exosomes/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Random Allocation', 'Transfection', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4673136,,2015/06/28 06:00,2016/08/04 06:00,['2015/06/28 06:00'],"['2015/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['4204 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4204 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Sep 8;6(26):21918-33. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.4204.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Curcumin', 'exosomes', 'miR-21', 'microRNAs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally designed to target hypoxic cells, PR-104A is independently activated by aldo-keto-reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3). The aim of this study was to test whether AKR1C3 is a predictive biomarker of in vivo PR-104 sensitivity. In a panel of 7 patient-derived pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) xenografts, PR-104 showed significantly greater efficacy against T-lineage ALL (T-ALL) than B-cell-precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) xenografts. Single-agent PR-104 was more efficacious against T-ALL xenografts compared with a combination regimen of vincristine, dexamethasone, and l-asparaginase. Expression of AKR1C3 was significantly higher in T-ALL xenografts compared with BCP-ALL, and correlated with PR-104/PR-104A sensitivity in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of AKR1C3 in a resistant BCP-ALL xenograft resulted in dramatic sensitization to PR-104 in vivo. Testing leukemic blasts from 11 patients confirmed that T-ALL cells were more sensitive than BCP-ALL to PR-104A in vitro, and that sensitivity correlated with AKR1C3 expression. Collectively, these results indicate that PR-104 shows promise as a novel therapy for relapsed/refractory T-ALL, and that AKR1C3 expression could be used as a biomarker to select patients most likely to benefit from such treatment in prospective clinical trials.",,"['Moradi Manesh, Donya', 'El-Hoss, Jad', 'Evans, Kathryn', 'Richmond, Jennifer', 'Toscan, Cara E', 'Bracken, Lauryn S', 'Hedrick, Ashlee', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Wilson, William R', 'Kurmasheva, Raushan T', 'Billups, Catherine', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Smith, Malcolm A', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Moradi Manesh D', 'El-Hoss J', 'Evans K', 'Richmond J', 'Toscan CE', 'Bracken LS', 'Hedrick A', 'Sutton R', 'Marshall GM', 'Wilson WR', 'Kurmasheva RT', 'Billups C', 'Houghton PJ', 'Smith MA', 'Carol H', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and."", 'School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia;', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and."", ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, NSW, Australia;"", 'Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand;', ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH;"", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; and."", ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH;"", 'Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, and.""]",['eng'],"['N01CM42216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA199297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-91001-03/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150626,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '0 (PR-104A)', 'EC 1.1.- (3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.357 (AKR1C3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.357 (Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member C3)']",IM,"['3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/*biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member C3', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases/*biosynthesis', 'Immunoblotting', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4559932,,2015/06/28 06:00,2016/04/29 06:00,['2015/06/28 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30954-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-12-618900 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Sep 3;126(10):1193-202. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-12-618900.

The viral genome encodes an oncogenic protein, Tax, which plays a key role in transactivating viral gene transcription and in deregulating cellular oncogenic signaling to promote survival, proliferation and transformation of virally infected T cells. Hence, Tax is a desirable therapeutic target, particularly at early stage of HTLV-1-mediated oncogenesis. We here show that niclosamide, an anti-helminthic molecule, induced apoptosis of HTLV-1-transformed T cells. Niclosamide facilitated degradation of the Tax protein in proteasome. Consistent with niclosamide-mediated Tax degradation, this compound inhibited activities of MAPK/ERK1/2 and IkappaB kinases. In addition, niclosamide downregulated Stat3 and pro-survival Bcl-2 family members such as Mcl-1 and repressed the viral gene transcription of HTLV-1 through induction of Tax degradation. Since Tax, Stat3 and Mcl-1 are crucial molecules for promoting survival and growth of HTLV-1-transformed T cells, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of niclosamide in inducing Tax degradation and downregulating various cellular pro-survival molecules, thereby promoting apoptosis of HTLV-1-associated leukemia cells.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT were eligible if they had acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and were MRD-positive after HSCT. Patients who were able to receive DLI were assigned to a preemptive DLI group (n = 45); patients who could not or did not agree to receive DLI after HSCT received preemptive IFN-alpha. A total of 22 patients received preemptive IFN-alpha; the median treatment duration was 35 days (range, 4 to 180 days). Seven patients relapsed, and 1 patient died from severe pneumonia. The 1-year cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after intervention was 90.9% for the IFN-alpha group and 62.9% for the DLI group (P < .001). MRD status after preemptive intervention was comparable in the 2 groups, and the 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse after intervention was 27.3% for the IFN-alpha group and 35.6% for the DLI group (P = .514). The 1-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality after intervention was 4.5% for the IFN-alpha group and 4.4% for the DLI group (P = .985). The 1-year probability of disease-free survival after intervention was 68.2% for the IFN-alpha group and 60.0% for the DLI group (P = .517). In multivariate analysis, early-onset MRD, persistent MRD after intervention, and absence of cGVHD after intervention were significantly associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Thus, preemptive IFN-alpha may be a potential alternative for MRD-positive patients who cannot receive preemptive DLI after HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The present study was designed to assess the cytotoxicity of anthraquinones from Pentas schimperi, namely damnacanthal (1), damnacanthol (2), 3-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl anthraquinone (3) and schimperiquinone B (4) against nine drug-sensitive and multidrug resistant (MDR) cancer cell lines. METHODS: The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the above compounds, whilst caspase-Glo assay was used to detect the activation of caspases enzymes by compounds 1 and 2. Cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and levels of reactive oxygen species were all analyzed via flow cytometry. RESULTS: Anthraquinones 1 and 2 displayed cytotoxic effects with IC50 values below 81 muM on all the nine tested cancer cell lines whilst 3 and 4 displayed selective activities. The recorded IC50 values for compounds 1 and 2 ranged from 3.12 muM and 12.18 muM (towards leukemia CCRF-CEM cells) and from 30.32 muM and 80.11 muM (towards gliobastoma U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells) respectively, and from 0.20 muM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 195.12 muM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. Compounds 1 and 2 induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells, mediated by the disruption of the MMP and increase in ROS production. CONCLUSIONS: Anthraquinones from Pentas schimperi and mostly 1 and 2 are potential cytotoxic natural products that deserve more investigations to develop novel antineoplastic drugs against multifactorial drug resistant cancers.",,"['Kuete, Victor', 'Donfack, Arno R Nanfack', 'Mbaveng, Armelle T', 'Zeino, Maen', 'Tane, Pierre', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Donfack AR', 'Mbaveng AT', 'Zeino M', 'Tane P', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Mainz, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150627,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Anthraquinones/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Roots', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', '*Rubiaceae']",,,2015/06/28 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/06/28 06:00'],"['2015/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-015-0268-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2015 Aug;33(4):861-9. doi: 10.1007/s10637-015-0268-9.

It was reported that the cytotoxic effects of FCCP are preceded by a rapid glutathione (GSH) depletion with a subsequent loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi). The GSH depletion was suggested as the cause of apoptosis in FCCP treated cells. This conclusion was further supported by the finding that all adverse effects of FCCP including cell death can be prevented by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) a precursor of GSH synthesis (Han and Park, 2011). Here, we argue that neither loss of DeltaPsi nor GSH depletion is sufficient to account for induction of apoptosis in FCCP treated leukemia K562 cells. Indeed, the lowest concentration of FCCP that brings about the permanent loss of DeltaPsi and the extensive decrease in GSH level induces cell death in minor population of cells. Only much higher concentrations of FCCP, that exceed the range to achieve permanent collapse of DeltaPsi, induce extensive apoptosis. The low proapoptotic activity of FCCP could be explained by hyperactivation of protein kinase B/Akt. A detailed LC/MS/MS analysis of cell extracts revealed extensive formation of FCCP adducts with GSH. This effect could explain the mechanism of GSH depletion, which is currently unknown. Although NAC induces an increase in the GSH pool, this effect is not crucial for abrogation of FCCP cytotoxicity. Indeed, the presence of NAC in the growth medium causes a rapid clearance of FCCP due to its quantitative conversion into the FCCP-NAC adduct, which is the real cause of abrogated FCCP cytotoxicity.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The effects of these mutations on clinical outcomes have been diverse and contrasting. METHODS: We examined a cohort of 129 de novo MDS patients, who did not harbor RS, for mutations affecting three spliceosomal genes (SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2). RESULTS: The mutation rates of SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2 were 7.0 %, 7.8 %, and 10.1 %, respectively. Compared with previously reported results, these rates were relatively infrequent. The SRSF2 mutation strongly correlated with old age (P < 0.001), while the mutation status of SF3B1 did not affect overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. In contrast, MDS patients with mutations in U2AF1 or SRSF2 exhibited inferior PFS. The U2AF1 mutation was associated with inferior OS in low-risk MDS patients (P = 0.035).

Not all samples of MSC are efficient for aGvHD prevention. The suitability of MSCs for aGvHD prophylaxis was studied. METHODS: MSCs were derived from the bone marrow (BM) of HCT donor and cultivated for no more than three passages. The characteristics of donor BM samples including colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) concentration, growth parameters of MSCs, and the relative expression levels (REL) of different genes were analyzed. MSCs were injected intravenously precisely at the moment of blood cell reconstitution. RESULTS: MSCs infusion induced a significant threefold decrease in aGvHD development and improved overall survival compared with the standard prophylaxis group. In ineffective MSC samples (9.4%), a significant decrease in total cell production and the REL of CSF1, FGFR1, and PDGFRB was observed. In all studied BM samples, the cumulative MSC production and CFU-F concentrations decreased with age. The expression levels of FGFR2, PPARG, and VEGF differed by age. CONCLUSIONS: A universal single indicator for the prediction of MSC eligibility for aGvHD prophylaxis was not identified. A multiparameter mathematical model for selecting MSC samples effective for the prevention of aGvHD was proposed.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Various deletions, gains, mutations and rearrangements of PAX5 comprised 45%, 12%, 29% and 14%, respectively, of the abnormalities found. 28% of patients showed more than one abnormality of the gene, implying bi-allelic impairment of PAX5. Novel PAX5-RHOXF2, PAX5-ELK3 and PAX5-CBFA2T2 rearrangements, which lead to aberrant expression of PAX5, were also identified. PAX5 rearrangements demonstrated a complex mechanism of formation including concurrent duplications/deletions of PAX5 and its partner genes. Finally, the splice variant c.1013-2A>G, seen in two patients with loss of one PAX5 allele, was confirmed to be germ-line in one patient and somatic in the other.

We sought to identify the target of chromosome 14 aUPD (aUPD14), a recurrent abnormality in myeloid neoplasms and population cohorts of elderly individuals. We identified 29 cases with aUPD14q that defined a minimal affected region (MAR) of 11.2 Mb running from 14q32.12 to the telomere. Exome sequencing (n=7) did not identify recurrently mutated genes, but methylation-specific PCR at the imprinted MEG3-DLK1 locus located within the MAR demonstrated loss of maternal chromosome 14 and gain of paternal chromosome 14 (P<0.0001), with the degree of methylation imbalance correlating with the level of aUPD (r=0.76; P=0.0001). The absence of driver gene mutations in the exomes of three individuals with aUPD14q but no known haematological disorder suggests that aUPD14q may be sufficient to drive clonal haemopoiesis. Analysis of cases with both aUPD14q and JAK2 V617F (n=11) indicated that aUPD14q may be an early event in some cases but a late event in others.

These mutations give rise to distinct alterations in normal splice site and exon recognition, such as unusual 3' splice site preferences, that likely contribute to tumorigenesis. METHODS: We analyzed genome-wide patterns of RNA splicing across 805 matched tumor and normal control samples from 16 distinct cancer types to identify signals of abnormal cancer-associated splicing. RESULTS: We found that abnormal RNA splicing, typified by widespread intron retention, is common across cancers even in the absence of mutations directly affecting the RNA splicing machinery. Almost all liquid and solid cancer types exhibited frequent retention of both alternative and constitutive introns relative to control normal tissues. The sole exception was breast cancer, where intron retention typified adjacent normal rather than cancer tissue. Different introns were preferentially retained in specific cancer types, although a small subset of introns enriched for genes encoding RNA splicing and export factors exhibited frequent retention across diverse cancers. The extent of intron retention correlated with the presence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia and across molecular subtypes in breast cancer. Many introns that were preferentially retained in primary cancers were present at high levels in the cytoplasmic mRNA pools of cancer cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that abnormal RNA splicing is a common characteristic of cancers even in the absence of mutational insults to the splicing machinery, and suggest that intron-containing mRNAs contribute to the transcriptional diversity of many cancers.",,"['Dvinge, Heidi', 'Bradley, Robert K']","['Dvinge H', 'Bradley RK']","['Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA USA ; Basic Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA USA.', 'Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA USA ; Basic Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097186/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA138293/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20150515,England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,,,,PMC4480902,,2015/06/27 06:00,2015/06/27 06:01,['2015/06/27 06:00'],"['2015/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13073-015-0168-9 [doi]', '168 [pii]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2015 May 15;7(1):45. doi: 10.1186/s13073-015-0168-9. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age at diagnosis is 72 years. During recent years numerous genetic aberrations have been identified that are associated with an aggressive course of the disease and resistance against genotoxic chemotherapies. The DNA damage-responsive proapoptotic ATM-CHK2-p53 signaling pathway is frequently mutationally inactivated in CLL either through large deletions on chromosome 11q (ATM) or 17p (TP53), or through protein-damaging mutations. Here, we focus on the role of ATM signaling for the immediate DNA damage response, DNA repair and leukemogenesis. We further discuss novel therapeutic concepts for the targeted treatment of ATM-defective CLLs. We specifically highlight the potential use of PARP1 and DNA-PKcs inhibitors for the treatment of ATM-mutant CLL clones. Lastly, we briefly discuss the current state of genetically engineered mouse models of the disease and emphasize the use of these preclinical tools as a common platform for the development and validation of novel therapeutic agents.",,"['Knittel, Gero', 'Liedgens, Paul', 'Reinhardt, Hans C']","['Knittel G', 'Liedgens P', 'Reinhardt HC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne Cologne, Germany ; Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne Cologne, Germany ; Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne Cologne, Germany ; Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150610,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC4461826,,2015/06/27 06:00,2015/06/27 06:01,['2015/06/27 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2015.00207 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2015 Jun 10;6:207. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2015.00207. eCollection 2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage response', 'DNA-PKcs inhibitor', 'PARP inhibitor', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'precision medicine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to confirm the expression of miR-181a and elucidate its physiological function and mechanism in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Pediatric AML patients and healthy controls were enrolled, and the expression of miR-181a and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) in tissues were examined using quantitative PCR. Moreover, cell proliferation and cell cycle were evaluated in several cell lines (HL60, NB4 and K562) by using flow cytometry after transfected with miR-181a mimics and inhibitors, or ATM siRNA and control siRNA. Finally, ATM as the potential target protein of miR-181a was examined. RESULTS: We found that miR-181a was significantly increased in pediatric AML, which showed an inverse association with ATM expression. Overexpressed miR-181a in cell lines significantly enhanced cell proliferation, as well as increased the ratio of S-phase cells by miR-181a mimics transfection in vitro. Luciferase activity of the reporter construct identified ATM as the direct molecular target of miR-181a. ATM siRNA transfection significantly enhanced cell proliferation and increased the ratio of S-phase cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: The results revealed novel mechanism through which miR-181a regulates G1/S transition and cell proliferation in pediatric AML by regulating the tumor suppressor ATM, providing insights into the molecular mechanism in pediatric AML.",,"['Liu, Xiaodan', 'Liao, Wang', 'Peng, Hongxia', 'Luo, Xuequn', 'Luo, Ziyan', 'Jiang, Hua', 'Xu, Ling']","['Liu X', 'Liao W', 'Peng H', 'Luo X', 'Luo Z', 'Jiang H', 'Xu L']","[""Division of Birth Cohort Study, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Division of Birth Cohort Study, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Division of Birth Cohort Study, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Department of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Division of Birth Cohort Study, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong Province, China. luoxul64@126.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150626,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2015/06/27 06:00,2016/05/18 06:00,['2015/06/27 06:00'],"['2015/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00432-015-1995-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-015-1995-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2016 Jan;142(1):77-87. doi: 10.1007/s00432-015-1995-1.

We report here the long-term, 6-year results of the first investigator-sponsored, GIMEMA multicenter phase 2, single-arm trial with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily as first-line treatment in 73 patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Six-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 96%, with one death after progression to blast phase. At 6 years, 75% of the patients were still on nilotinib. The cumulative incidence of major molecular response was 98%; only one patient had a confirmed loss of major molecular response. The cumulative incidence of deep molecular response (MR 4.0) was 76%. Deep molecular response was stable (>/= 2 years) in 34% of these patients. Cardiovascular adverse events, mainly due to arterial thrombosis, occurred in 11/73 patients (15%), after 24 to 76 months of therapy. They were more frequent in elderly patients, and in those with baseline cardiovascular risk factors. None was fatal, although there was a relevant morbidity.

Azacitidine (AZA) is now considered as the standard of care in high-risk MDS and oligoblastic AML patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of azacitine treatment in this cytogenetic subgroup. We report here a multicentre retrospective study of 157 patients treated with AZA for AML/MDS with chromosome 3q abnormalities and 27 patients with isolated EVI-1 overexpression. Median age was 65 years, 40 patients (25%) had inv(3)(q21q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21;q26.2), 36 patients (23%) had other balanced 3q26 rearrangements, 8 patients (5%) had balanced 3q21 rearrangements and 73 patients (46%) had other 3q abnormalities. The overall response rate was 50% (29% CR). Median overall survival was 10.6 months. By multivariate analysis, patients with lower bone marrow blast counts, higher platelet counts, non-complex cytogenetics, and absence of prior treatment with intensive chemotherapy had a better outcome. 27 patients were allo-transplanted and achieved a 21-month median OS. Balanced 3q21 translocations were associated with a better response rate and overall survival. Outcome of patients with isolated EVI-1 overexpression was comparable to that of patients with chromosome 3q lesions. Thus, AML/MDS patients with 3q abnormalities appear to be a heterogeneous group in their response to AZA, and AZA may represent a suitable option in particular as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Wanquet, Anne', 'Prebet, Thomas', 'Berthon, Celine', 'Sebert, Marie', 'Roux, Clemence', 'Kulasekararaj, Austin', 'Micol, Jean-Baptiste', 'Esterni, Benjamin', 'Itzykson, Raphael', 'Thepot, Sylvain', 'Recher, Christian', 'Delaunay, Jacques', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Mufti, Ghulam', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Vey, Norbert']","['Wanquet A', 'Prebet T', 'Berthon C', 'Sebert M', 'Roux C', 'Kulasekararaj A', 'Micol JB', 'Esterni B', 'Itzykson R', 'Thepot S', 'Recher C', 'Delaunay J', 'Dreyfus F', 'Mufti G', 'Fenaux P', 'Vey N']","['Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Centre Hospitalo Universitaire De Lille, Lille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux De Paris (APHP), Hopital Saint Louis, Paris and Paris 7 University, France.', 'Hematology Department, Centre Hospitalo Universitaire De Nice, Nice, France.', ""Hematology Department, King's College, London, United Kingdom."", 'Hematology Department, Insitut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Biostatistics Department, Institut paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux De Paris (APHP), Hopital Saint Louis, Paris and Paris 7 University, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hopital Avicenne (APHP) and Paris 13 University, Bobigny, France.', 'Hematology Department, Centre Hospitalo Universitaire De Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Hematology Department, Centre Hospitalo Universitaire De Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Hematology Department, Hopital Cochin (APHP) and Paris 5 University, Paris, France.', ""Hematology Department, King's College, London, United Kingdom."", 'Hematology Department, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux De Paris (APHP), Hopital Saint Louis, Paris and Paris 7 University, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Aix Marseille University, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150714,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allografts', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage', '*Blast Crisis/genetics/mortality/therapy', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate']",,,2015/06/27 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2015/06/27 06:00'],"['2015/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24099 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Oct;90(10):859-63. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24099.

We conducted the first large cohort study to examine perinatal factors including season of birth, a proxy for perinatal infectious exposures, and risk of AML in childhood through young adulthood. A national cohort of 3,569,333 persons without Down syndrome who were born in Sweden in 1973-2008 were followed up for AML incidence through 2010 (maximum age 38 years). There were 315 AML cases in 69.7 million person-years of follow-up. We found a sinusoidal pattern in AML risk by season of birth (P < 0.001), with peak risk among persons born in winter. Relative to persons born in summer (June-August), incidence rate ratios for AML were 1.72 (95 % CI 1.25-2.38; P = 0.001) for winter (December-February), 1.37 (95 % CI 0.99-1.90; P = 0.06) for spring (March-May), and 1.27 (95 % CI 0.90-1.80; P = 0.17) for fall (September-November). Other risk factors for AML included high fetal growth, high gestational age at birth, and low maternal education level. These findings did not vary by sex or age at diagnosis. Sex, birth order, parental age, and parental country of birth were not associated with AML. In this large cohort study, birth in winter was associated with increased risk of AML in childhood through young adulthood, possibly related to immunologic effects of early infectious exposures compared with summer birth.

The deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) suppresses cell death after DNA damage by antagonizing p53 acetylation. To facilitate efficient p53 acetylation, SIRT1 function needs to be restricted. How SIRT1 activity is regulated under these conditions remains largely unclear. Here we provide evidence that SIRT1 activity is limited upon severe DNA damage through phosphorylation by the DNA damage-responsive kinase HIPK2. We found that DNA damage provokes interaction of SIRT1 and HIPK2, which phosphorylates SIRT1 at Serine 682 upon lethal damage. Furthermore, upon DNA damage SIRT1 and HIPK2 colocalize at PML nuclear bodies, and PML depletion abrogates DNA damage-induced SIRT1 Ser682 phosphorylation. We show that Ser682 phosphorylation inhibits SIRT1 activity and impacts on p53 acetylation, apoptotic p53 target gene expression and cell death. Mechanistically, we found that DNA damage-induced SIRT1 Ser682 phosphorylation provokes disruption of the complex between SIRT1 and its activator AROS. Our findings indicate that phosphorylation-dependent restriction of SIRT1 activity by HIPK2 shapes the p53 response.",,"['Conrad, E', 'Polonio-Vallon, T', 'Meister, M', 'Matt, S', 'Bitomsky, N', 'Herbel, C', 'Liebl, M', 'Greiner, V', 'Kriznik, B', 'Schumacher, S', 'Krieghoff-Henning, E', 'Hofmann, T G']","['Conrad E', 'Polonio-Vallon T', 'Meister M', 'Matt S', 'Bitomsky N', 'Herbel C', 'Liebl M', 'Greiner V', 'Kriznik B', 'Schumacher S', 'Krieghoff-Henning E', 'Hofmann TG']","['German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (dkfz), Cellular Senescence Group, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150626,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (HIPK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sirtuin 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC4815982,,2015/06/27 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2015/06/27 06:00'],"['2014/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201575 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2015.75 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2016 Jan;23(1):110-22. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2015.75.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments were performed on BDF1 male mice (DBA/2, female x C57Bl/6, male) with transplantable L1210 lymphoid leukemia. Determination of antitumor activity of Benzyl-Fc Boron (Bn), it was injected intraperitoneally 6 times daily, starting on day 2 after L1210 leukemia cell transplantation. Doses of Bn such as 26; 260 and 2600 mug/kg were used. The determination of intracellular content of cardiolipin, thiols, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also analysis of Annexin V positivity and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (JC-1 staining) were performed with use of flow cytometry. The levels of ""free iron"" complexes, transferrin active forms and the rate of NO generation were measured by EPR-specroscopy. RESULTS: Six daily injections of Bn at a dose of 26 mug/kg resulted in an increased survival of mice with L1210 leukemia by 28% (p < 0.05). Bn led to an increase of apoptotic cells number and ROS amount in leukemia cells. Besides, Bn caused a decrease of cardiolipin and nonprotein thiol compounds content.

Despite these obvious advantages, and after over a decade of laboratory investigation and preclinical validation, MRD measurements are not currently routinely used for clinical decision-making or drug development in non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (non-APL) AML. We review here some potential constraints that may have delayed adoption, including a natural hesitancy of end users, economic impact concerns, misperceptions regarding the meaning of and need for assay sensitivity, the lack of one single MRD solution for all AML patients, and finally the need to involve patients in decision-making based on such correlates.

Epigenetic modulation is a part of normal physiologic development; its dysregulation is an important mechanism of pathogenesis of some cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite significant progress in understanding the pathogenesis of AML, therapeutic options remain quite limited. Technological advances have facilitated understanding of aberrant DNA methylation and histone methylation/acetylation as key elements in the development of AML and uncovered several recurrent mutations in genes important for epigenetic regulation. However, much remains to be learned about how to exploit this knowledge for epigenetic therapeutic targeting. Currently, no epigenetic therapy is approved for the treatment of AML, although two DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacitidine and decitabine) are commonly used in clinical practice. Among the other epigenetic modifiers undergoing research in AML, the histone deacetylase inhibitors are the most studied. Other promising drugs, such as inhibitors of histone methylation (eg, EZH2 and DOT1L inhibitors), inhibitors of histone demethylases (eg, LSD1 inhibitors), inhibitors of bromodomain-containing epigenetic ""reader"" BET proteins, and inhibitors of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenases, are at early stages of clinical evaluation.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Over the last few years, ibrutinib has developed from a promising drug candidate to being approved by FDA for the treatment of three B cell malignancies, a truly remarkable feat. Few, if any medicines are monospecific and ibrutinib is no exception; already during ibrutinib's initial characterization, it was found that it could bind also to other kinases. In this review, we discuss the implications of such interactions, which go beyond the selective effect on BTK in B cell malignancies. In certain cases, the outcome of ibrutinib treatment likely results from the combined inhibition of BTK and other kinases, causing additive or synergistic, effects. Conversely, there are also examples when the clinical outcome seems unrelated to inhibition of BTK. Thus, more specifically, adverse effects such as enhanced bleeding or arrhythmias could potentially be explained by different interactions. We also predict that during long-term treatment bone homoeostasis might be affected due to the inhibition of osteoclasts. Moreover, the binding of ibrutinib to molecular targets other than BTK or effects on cells other than B cell-derived malignancies could be beneficial and result in new indications for clinical applications.","['(c) 2015 The Authors.

The resulting BCR-ABL1 oncogene leads to increased proliferation and survival of leukemic cells. Successful treatment of CML has been accompanied by steady improvements in our capacity to accurately and sensitively monitor therapy response. Currently, measurement of BCR-ABL1 mRNA transcript levels by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) defines critical response endpoints. An antibody-based technique for BCR-ABL1 protein recognition could be an attractive alternative to RQ-PCR. To date, there have been no studies evaluating whether flow-cytometry based assays could be of clinical utility in evaluating residual disease in CML patients. Here we describe a flow-cytometry assay that detects the presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion proteins in CML lysates to determine the applicability, reliability, and specificity of this method for both diagnosis and monitoring of CML patients for initial response to therapy. We show that: i) CML can be properly diagnosed at onset, (ii) follow-up assessments show detectable fusion protein (i.e. relative mean fluorescent intensity, rMFI%>1) when BCR-ABL1IS transcripts are between 1-10%, and (iii) rMFI% levels predict CCyR as defined by FISH analysis.

Considering the good therapeutic potency and low toxicity of tetraarsenictetrasulfide (As4S4) in the treatment of APL, we investigated the effects of combining As4S4 and As3+ on the apoptosis and differentiation of NB4 and primary APL cells. As4S4, acting similarly to As3+, arrested the G1/S transition, induced the accumulation of cellular reactive oxygen species, and promoted apoptosis. Additionally, low concentrations of As4S4 (0.1-0.4 muM) induced differentiation of NB4 and primary APL cells. Compared with the As4S4- or As3+-treated groups, the combination of As4S4 and As3+ obviously promoted apoptosis and differentiation of NB4 and primary APL cells. Mechanistic studies suggested that As4S4 acted synergistically with As3+ to down-regulate Bcl-2 and nuclear factor-kappaB expression, up-regulate Bax and p53 expression, and induce activation of caspase-12 and caspase-3.

In this study, we analyzed epigenetic aging signatures in 5,621 DNAm profiles of 25 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Overall, age-associated DNAm patterns hardly reflect chronological age of cancer patients, but they are coherently modified in a non-stochastic manner, particularly at CpGs that become hypermethylated upon aging in non-malignant tissues. This coordinated regulation in epigenetic aging signatures can therefore be used for aberrant epigenetic age-predictions, which facilitate disease stratification. For example, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) higher epigenetic age-predictions are associated with increased incidence of mutations in RUNX1, WT1, and IDH2, whereas mutations in TET2, TP53, and PML-PARA translocation are more frequent in younger age-predictions. Furthermore, epigenetic aging signatures correlate with overall survival in several types of cancer (such as lower grade glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, esophageal carcinoma, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and neuroendocrine neoplasms). In conclusion, age-associated DNAm patterns in cancer are not related to chronological age of the patient, but they are coordinately regulated, particularly at CpGs that become hypermethylated in normal aging. Furthermore, the apparent epigenetic age-predictions correlate with clinical parameters and overall survival in several types of cancer, indicating that regulation of DNAm patterns in age-associated CpGs is relevant for cancer development.",,"['Lin, Qiong', 'Wagner, Wolfgang']","['Lin Q', 'Wagner W']","['Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Stem Cell Biology and Cellular Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150625,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*genetics', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/genetics/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Reference Values']",PMC4482318,,2015/06/26 06:00,2016/05/05 06:00,['2015/06/26 06:00'],"['2015/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1005334 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-15-00212 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2015 Jun 25;11(6):e1005334. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005334. eCollection 2015 Jun.,,,,,,,,,,,['GEO/GSE40279'],,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we showed that in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells acadesine induced caspase-dependent apoptosis through turning on the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery. At the molecular level, the compound triggered the activation of the AMPK pathway, consequently modulating known downstream targets, such as mTOR and the cell motility-related vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). VASP phosphorylation by acadesine was concomitant with a blockade of CXCL12-induced migration. The inhibition of the mTOR cascade by acadesine, committed MCL cells to enter in apoptosis by a translational downregulation of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein. In contrast, Bcl-2 protein levels were unaffected by acadesine and MCL samples expressing high levels of Bcl-2 tended to have a reduced response to the drug. Targeting Bcl-2 with the selective BH3-mimetic agent ABT-199 sensitized Bcl-2high MCL cells to acadesine. This effect was validated in vivo, where the combination of both agents displayed a more marked inhibition of tumor outgrowth than each drug alone.

Human T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognize and kill tumor cells in a MHC-unrestricted manner and persist in vivo when the CAR includes a CD28 costimulatory domain. However, the intensity of the CAR-mediated CD28 activation signal and its regulation by the CTLA-4 checkpoint are unknown. We investigated whether T cells expressing an anti-CD19, CD3 zeta and CD28-based CAR (19-28z) displayed the same proliferation and anti-tumor abilities than T cells expressing a CD3 zeta-based CAR (19z1) costimulated through the CD80/CD28, ligand/receptor pathway. Repeated in vitro antigen-specific stimulations indicated that 19-28z+ T cells secreted higher levels of Th1 cytokines and showed enhanced proliferation compared to those of 19z1+ or 19z1-CD80+ T cells. In an aggressive pre-B cell leukemia model, mice treated with 19-28z+ T cells had 10-fold reduced tumor progression compared to those treated with 19z1+ or 19z1-CD80+ T cells. shRNA-mediated CTLA-4 down-regulation in 19z1-CD80+ T cells significantly increased their in vivo expansion and anti-tumor properties, but had no effect in 19-28z+ T cells.

Starting doses and dosing schedules vary by malignancy, with lenalidomide started at a lower dose for CLL than for NHL or multiple myeloma. Certain adverse events (AEs) are common across tumor types (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue), whereas others are more often associated with CLL patients (e.g., tumor lysis syndrome and tumor flare reaction). Effective management requires awareness of these differences as well as appropriate prophylaxis, monitoring, and treatment of AEs. This article reviews the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in CLL and NHL, focusing on approaches for the advanced practitioner to improve patient quality of life through optimal management of side effects.

This to estimate the usefulness of the drug traditional preparation and compare it with those made in the laboratory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antioxidant activity of the extracts was evaluated using five different redox-based assays, all involving one redox reaction with the oxidant. High-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detection/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify and quantify the flavonoids content. Cytotoxicity on human monocytic leukemia cells (U937) was also carried out. RESULTS: All the extracts tested showed a good antioxidant/free radical scavenger activity and a similar flavonoid fingerprint. However, the methanolic one presented the best antioxidant activity that can be due to the highest flavonoid amount and significantly reduced the proliferation of leukemia cells.

To our knowledge, the functional role of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating NADPH oxidase 5 (Nox5) in HTLV-1 transformation remains undefined. Here, we found that Nox5alpha expression was upregulated in 88% of 17 ATL patient samples but not in normal peripheral blood T cells. Upregulation of the Nox5alpha variant was transcriptionally sustained by the constitutive Janus family tyrosine kinase (Jak)-STAT5 signaling pathway in interleukin-2 (IL-2)-independent HTLV-1-transformed cell lines, including MT1 and MT2, whereas it was transiently induced by the IL-2-triggered Jak-STAT5 axis in uninfected T cells. A Nox inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium, and antioxidants such as N-acetyl cysteine blocked proliferation of MT1 and MT2 cells. Ablation of Nox5alpha by small interfering RNAs abrogated ROS production, inhibited cellular activities, including proliferation, migration, and survival, and suppressed tumorigenicity in immunodeficient NOG mice. The findings suggest that Nox5alpha is a key molecule for redox-signal-mediated maintenance of the HTLV-1 transformation phenotype and could be a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention in cancer development. IMPORTANCE: HTLV-1 is the first human oncogenic retrovirus shown to be associated with ATL. Despite the extensive study over the years, the mechanism underlying HTLV-1-induced cell transformation is not fully understood. In this study, we addressed the expression and function of ROS-generating Nox family genes in HTLV-1-transformed cells. Our report provides the first evidence that the upregulated expression of Nox5alpha is associated with the pathological state of ATL peripheral blood mononuclear cells and that Nox5alpha is an integral component of the Jak-STAT5 signaling pathway in HTLV-1-transformed T cells. Nox5alpha-derived ROS are critically involved in the regulation of cellular activities, including proliferation, migration, survival, and tumorigenicity, in HTLV-1-transformed cells. These results indicate that Nox5alpha-derived ROS are functionally required for maintenance of the HTLV-1 transformation phenotype. The finding provides new insight into the redox-dependent mechanism of HTLV-1 transformation and raises an intriguing possibility that Nox5alpha serves as a potential molecular target to treat HTLV-1-related leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

However, overall survival of AML still remains unsatisfactory, and development of novel therapeutics is required. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) is one of the crucial transcription factors that induce granulocytic differentiation, and its activity is perturbed in human myeloid leukemias. As its reexpression can induce differentiation and subsequent apoptosis of leukemic cells in vitro, we hypothesized that chemical compounds that restore C/EBPalpha expression and/or activity would lead to myeloid differentiation of leukemic cells. Using a cell-based high-throughput screening, we identified 2-[(E)-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)vinyl]-3-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4(3H)-quinazolinone as a potent inducer of C/EBPalpha and myeloid differentiation. Leukemia cell lines and primary blast cells isolated from human patients with AML treated with ICCB280 demonstrated evidence of morphological and functional differentiation, as well as massive apoptosis. We performed conformational analyses of the high-throughput screening hit compounds to postulate the spatial requirements for high potency.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of minimal disseminated disease (MDD), studied by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC), in pediatric patients with T- and B-lineage LBL. PROCEDURE: We examined bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from a series of 65 children affected by T- (52) and B-lineage (13) LBL using an MFC method; 10 of them were also analyzed for clonality of T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. RESULTS: MDD was detected in 49% (32/65) of BM samples, whereas only 21% (14/65) were positive at standard morphological evaluation. Findings from MFC analyses of paired BM and PB samples were highly concordant. We analyzed the prognostic significance of MDD results detected at diagnosis in morphologically negative patients, as almost all relapsed cases (10/11) did not have any morphological involvement of BM at diagnosis. Using an MDD cut-off level of 3% by FCM (75th percentile), 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 60% (SE +/- 22) for patients with MDD >3% LBL cells versus 83% (SE +/- 6) for the remaining patients (P = 0.04). No statistically significant difference in EFS was observed between LBL patients considering all the other clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that MDD studied at diagnosis by MFC could represent a useful prognostic tool in childhood LBL and further application for better stratification is warranted.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mussolin, Lara', 'Buldini, Barbara', 'Lovisa, Federica', 'Carraro, Elisa', 'Disaro, Silvia', 'Lo Nigro, Luca', ""d'Amore, Emanuele S G"", 'Pillon, Marta', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Mussolin L', 'Buldini B', 'Lovisa F', 'Carraro E', 'Disaro S', 'Lo Nigro L', ""d'Amore ES"", 'Pillon M', 'Basso G']","['Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrico-Fondazione Citta della Speranza, Padua, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Clinic of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Clinic of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Clinic of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Clinic of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Clinic of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", 'Center of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Policlinico, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Clinic of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Clinic of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150624,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology']",,,2015/06/26 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/06/26 06:00'],"['2015/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25607 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Nov;62(11):1906-13. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25607.

Early relapse and short overall survival are commonplace. Use of the monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab has improved the rate of complete remission and duration of response to more than 50% and between 6 and 12 months, respectively. Despite this advance, without an allogeneic transplant, resistant relapse is inevitable. We report seven complete and one partial remission in eight patients receiving alemtuzumab and cladribine with or without a histone deacetylase inhibitor. These data show that administration of epigenetic agents can overcome alemtuzumab resistance. We also report epigenetically induced expression of the surface receptor protein CD30 in T-PLL. Subsequent treatment with the anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin overcame organ-specific (skin) resistance to alemtuzumab.

Bortezomib provokes unwanted protein accumulation and the endoplasmic reticulum stress to activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy as compensatory mechanisms that restore protein homeostasis. High-throughput screens to detect pharmacologics that modulated autophagy to enhance the anti-myeloma effect of bortezomib revealed metformin, a widely used antidiabetic agent with proven efficacy and limited adverse effects. Metformin co-treatment with bortezomib suppressed induction of the critical UPR effector glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) to impair autophagosome formation and enhance apoptosis. Gene expression profiling of newly diagnosed myeloma patient tumors further correlated the hyperexpression of GRP78-encoding HSPA5 with reduced clinical response to bortezomib. The effect of bortezomib was enhanced with metformin co-treatment using myeloma patient tumor cells and the chemoresistant, stem cell-like side population that may contribute to disease recurrence. The relevance of the findings was confirmed in vivo as shown by metformin co-treatment with bortezomib that delayed the growth of myeloma xenotransplants. Taken together, our results suggest that metformin suppresses GRP78, a key driver of bortezomib-induced autophagy, and support the pharmacologic repositioning of metformin to enhance the anti-myeloma benefit of bortezomib.",,"['Jagannathan, S', 'Abdel-Malek, M A Y', 'Malek, E', 'Vad, N', 'Latif, T', 'Anderson, K C', 'Driscoll, J J']","['Jagannathan S', 'Abdel-Malek MA', 'Malek E', 'Vad N', 'Latif T', 'Anderson KC', 'Driscoll JJ']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'University of Cincinnati Cancer Institute, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'University of Cincinnati Cancer Institute, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150625,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Bortezomib/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Female', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Metformin/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology']",PMC4635337,,2015/06/26 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/06/26 06:00'],"['2015/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015157 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.157 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Nov;29(11):2184-91. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.157.

Secondary kinase domain mutations in FLT3-ITD, particularly at the D835 residue are frequently associated with acquired clinical resistance to effective FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Molecular docking studies have suggested that D835 mutations primarily confer resistance by stabilizing an active Asp-Phe-Gly in ('DFG-in') kinase conformation unfavorable to the binding of type II FLT3 TKIs, which target a 'DFG-out' inactive conformation. We profiled the activity of active type II FLT3 TKIs against D835 kinase domain mutants that have been clinically detected to date. We found that type II inhibitors (quizartinib, sorafenib, ponatinib and PLX3397) retain activity against specific D835 substitutions.

Constitutive activation of beta-catenin in osteoblasts is sufficient to alter the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors and to initiate the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice. We show here that Notch1 is the receptor mediating the leukemogenic properties of osteoblast-activated beta-catenin in HSCs. Moreover, using cell-specific gene inactivation mouse models, we show that FoxO1 expression in osteoblasts is required for and mediates the leukemogenic properties of beta-catenin. At the molecular level, FoxO1 interacts with beta-catenin in osteoblasts to induce expression of the Notch ligand, Jagged-1. Subsequent activation of Notch signaling in long-term repopulating HSC progenitors induces the leukemogenic transformation of HSCs and ultimately leads to the development of AML. These findings identify FoxO1 expressed in osteoblasts as a factor affecting hematopoiesis and provide a molecular mechanism whereby the FoxO1/activated beta-catenin interaction results in AML. These observations support the notion that the bone marrow niche is an instigator of leukemia and raise the prospect that FoxO1 oncogenic properties may occur in other tissues.",,"['Kode, A', 'Mosialou, I', 'Manavalan, S J', 'Rathinam, C V', 'Friedman, R A', 'Teruya-Feldstein, J', 'Bhagat, G', 'Berman, E', 'Kousteni, S']","['Kode A', 'Mosialou I', 'Manavalan SJ', 'Rathinam CV', 'Friedman RA', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Bhagat G', 'Berman E', 'Kousteni S']","['Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Development, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Biomedical Informatics Shared Resource, Department of Biomedical Informatics, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute for Cancer Genetics Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AR055931/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR054447/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK063608-07/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL130937/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR051187/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AG032959/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK063608/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150625,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxo1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Jag1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Anemia/etiology', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/*physiology', 'Receptors, Notch/physiology', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'beta Catenin/*physiology']",PMC4691220,['NIHMS700025'],2015/06/26 06:00,2016/06/02 06:00,['2015/06/26 06:00'],"['2015/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015161 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.161 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Jan;30(1):1-13. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.161.

To target the MEK/ERK pathway, we identified glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) inhibitors including lithium chloride (LiCl) as activators of this pathway in APL cells. Using NB4 (RA-sensitive) and UF-1 (RA-resistant) APL cell lines, we observed that LiCl as well as synthetic GSK-3beta inhibitors decreased proliferation, induced apoptosis and restored, in RA-resistant cells, the expression of RA target genes and the RA-induced differentiation. Inhibition of the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway abolished these effects. These results were corroborated in primary APL patient cells and translated in vivo using an APL preclinical mouse model in which LiCl given alone was as efficient as RA in increasing survival of leukemic mice compared with untreated mice. When LiCl was combined with RA, we observed a significant survival advantage compared with mice treated by RA alone. In this work, we demonstrate that LiCl, a well-tolerated agent in humans, has antileukemic activity in APL and that it has the potential to restore RA-induced transcriptional activation and differentiation in RA-resistant APL cells in an MEK/ERK-dependent manner.",,"['Zassadowski, F', 'Pokorna, K', 'Ferre, N', 'Guidez, F', 'Llopis, L', 'Chourbagi, O', 'Chopin, M', 'Poupon, J', 'Fenaux, P', 'Ann Padua, R', 'Pla, M', 'Chomienne, C', 'Cassinat, B']","['Zassadowski F', 'Pokorna K', 'Ferre N', 'Guidez F', 'Llopis L', 'Chourbagi O', 'Chopin M', 'Poupon J', 'Fenaux P', 'Ann Padua R', 'Pla M', 'Chomienne C', 'Cassinat B']","['Service de Biologie Cellulaire AP-HP Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', ""Departement d'Experimentation Animale, IUH, Universite Paris-Diderot, Paris, France."", 'Laboratoire de Toxicologie Biologique, AP-HP Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Senior, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", 'Inserm UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', ""Departement d'Experimentation Animale, IUH, Universite Paris-Diderot, Paris, France."", 'Service de Biologie Cellulaire AP-HP Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris-Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Service de Biologie Cellulaire AP-HP Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMR-S 1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150625,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*physiology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*physiology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lithium Chloride/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,,2015/06/26 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/06/26 06:00'],"['2014/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015159 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Dec;29(12):2277-84. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.159.

However, the exact molecular mechanism by which these T-cell specific oncogenes cooperate during transformation remains to be established. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing to establish the genome-wide binding pattern of TLX1 in human T-ALL. This integrative genomics approach showed that ectopic TLX1 expression drives repression of T cell-specific enhancers and mediates an unexpected transcriptional antagonism with NOTCH1 at critical target genes, including IL7R and NOTCH3. These phenomena coordinately trigger a TLX1-driven pre-leukemic phenotype in human thymic precursor cells, reminiscent of the thymus regression observed in murine TLX1 tumor models, and create a strong genetic pressure for acquiring activating NOTCH1 mutations as a prerequisite for full leukemic transformation. In conclusion, our results uncover a functional antagonism between cooperative oncogenes during the earliest phases of tumor development and provide novel insights in the multi-step pathogenesis of TLX1-driven human leukemia.",,"['Durinck, K', 'Van Loocke, W', 'Van der Meulen, J', 'Van de Walle, I', 'Ongenaert, M', 'Rondou, P', 'Wallaert, A', 'de Bock, C E', 'Van Roy, N', 'Poppe, B', 'Cools, J', 'Soulier, J', 'Taghon, T', 'Speleman, F', 'Van Vlierberghe, P']","['Durinck K', 'Van Loocke W', 'Van der Meulen J', 'Van de Walle I', 'Ongenaert M', 'Rondou P', 'Wallaert A', 'de Bock CE', 'Van Roy N', 'Poppe B', 'Cools J', 'Soulier J', 'Taghon T', 'Speleman F', 'Van Vlierberghe P']","['Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Genome Rearrangements and Cancer Laboratory, U944 INSERM, University Paris Diderot and Hematology Laboratory, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics and Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150625,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Oncogenes', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/physiology']",,,2015/06/26 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/06/26 06:00'],"['2015/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015162 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.162 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Dec;29(12):2317-27. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.162.

We reasoned that paracrine exosome trafficking may have a broader role in shaping the leukemic niche. In a series of in vitro studies and murine xenografts, we demonstrate that AML exosomes downregulate critical retention factors (Scf, Cxcl12) in stromal cells, leading to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) mobilization from the bone marrow. Exosome trafficking also regulates HSPC directly, and we demonstrate declining clonogenicity, loss of CXCR4 and c-Kit expression, and the consistent repression of several hematopoietic transcription factors, including c-Myb, Cebp-beta and Hoxa-9. Additional experiments using a model of extramedullary AML or direct intrafemoral injection of purified exosomes reveal that the erosion of HSPC function can occur independent of direct cell-cell contact with leukemia cells. Finally, using a novel multiplex proteomics technique, we identified candidate pathways involved in the direct exosome-mediated modulation of HSPC function.

In addition to donating a blood specimen, all MCB participants completed a baseline questionnaire to collect information on medical history and family history of cancer. RESULTS: Forty-nine of 9,012 male patients were carriers of G84E (0.5%). Thirty-one percent (n = 2,595) of participants had been diagnosed with cancer, including 51.1% of G84E carriers compared with just 30.6% of noncarriers (P = 0.004). G84E was most frequently observed among men with prostate cancer compared with men without cancer (P < 0.0001). However, the mutation was also more commonly observed in men with bladder cancer (P = 0.06) and leukemia (P = 0.01). G84E carriers were more likely to have a positive family history of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative compared to noncarriers (36.2% vs. 16.0%, P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the association between the HOXB13 G84E variant and prostate cancer and suggests a novel association between G84E and leukemia and a suggestive association with bladder cancer. Future investigation is warranted to confirm these associations in order to improve our understanding of the role of germline HOXB13 mutations in human cancer. IMPACT: The associations between HOXB13 and prostate, leukemia, and bladder suggest that this gene is important in carcinogenesis.",['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Beebe-Dimmer, Jennifer L', 'Hathcock, Matthew', 'Yee, Cecilia', 'Okoth, Linda A', 'Ewing, Charles M', 'Isaacs, William B', 'Cooney, Kathleen A', 'Thibodeau, Stephen N']","['Beebe-Dimmer JL', 'Hathcock M', 'Yee C', 'Okoth LA', 'Ewing CM', 'Isaacs WB', 'Cooney KA', 'Thibodeau SN']","['Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.

Subsequent studies on its role in tumours and in normal settings have highlighted LMO2 as an archetypical chromosomal translocation oncogene, activated by association with antigen receptor gene loci and a paradigm for translocation gene activation in T-ALL. The normal function of LMO2 in haematopoietic cell fate and angiogenesis suggests it is a master gene regulator exerting a dysfunctional control on differentiation following chromosomal translocations. Its importance in T cell neoplasia has been further emphasized by the recurrent findings of interstitial deletions of chromosome 11 near LMO2 and of LMO2 as a target of retroviral insertion gene activation during gene therapy trials for X chromosome-linked severe combined immuno-deficiency syndrome, both types of event leading to similar T cell leukaemia. The discovery of LMO2 in some B cell neoplasias and in some epithelial cancers suggests a more ubiquitous function as an oncogenic protein, and that the current development of novel inhibitors will be of great value in future cancer treatment.

This study assessed the psychometric properties of the Illness Cognition Questionnaire (ICQ), adjusted for the parents of an ill child. METHODS: Participants were recruited from two multicenter studies: sample 1 included 128 parents of a child diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (response rate 82 %) and sample 2 included 114 parents of a child diagnosed with cancer (response rate 74 %). Parents completed an adapted version of the ICQ (Illness Cognition Questionnaire-Parent version (ICQ-P)), together with the Profile of Mood States (POMS; sample 1) or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; sample 2). The factor structure of the ICQ-P was examined by means of principal component analysis. Cronbach's alpha for each subscale and correlations between the ICQ-P scales and the HADS and POMS were calculated. The illness cognitions of parents with and without psychological distress were compared. RESULTS: Factor analysis confirmed the hypothesized structure of the ICQ-P in our sample (n = 242). The three scales Helplessness, Acceptance, and Perceived Benefits explained 9.8, 31.4, and 17.9 % of the variance, respectively. Cronbach's alpha showed adequate internal consistency (.80-.88). Concurrent and criterion-related validity were appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that the ICQ-P reliably assesses the illness cognitions of the parents of a child with cancer. Psychologically distressed parents showed less acceptance and more helplessness. The availability of a short and valid illness cognition questionnaire will help clinicians gain insight into parental cognitions regarding the illness of their child, information that might be helpful for targeting interventions.",,"['Sint Nicolaas, Simone M', 'Schepers, Sasja A', 'van den Bergh, Esther M M', 'Evers, Andrea W M', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'Grootenhuis, Martha A', 'Verhaak, Christianne M']","['Sint Nicolaas SM', 'Schepers SA', 'van den Bergh EMM', 'Evers AWM', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'Grootenhuis MA', 'Verhaak CM']","['Department of Medical Psychology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. simone.sintnicolaas@radboudumc.nl.', ""Psychosocial Department, Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Medical Psychology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Psychology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Health, Medical and Neuropsychology Unit, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Pediatric Oncology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (SKION), The Hague, The Netherlands.', ""Psychosocial Department, Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Medical Psychology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150625,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anxiety/*diagnosis', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Depression/psychology', '*Emotional Adjustment', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychometrics/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC4689765,,2015/06/26 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2015/06/26 06:00'],"['2015/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00520-015-2795-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-015-2795-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2016 Feb;24(2):529-537. doi: 10.1007/s00520-015-2795-5.

However, off-target TKs like platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGF-R) and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-fms), involved in bone remodeling, are also inhibited. Thus, pediatric patients with CML on imatinib exhibit altered bone metabolism, leading to linear growth failure. As TKI treatment might be necessary for a lifetime, long-term effects exerted on bone in children are of major concern. Therefore, we studied the skeletal long-term effects of continuous and intermittent imatinib exposure in a juvenile rat model. Four-weeks-old male Wistar rats were chronically exposed to imatinib via drinking water over a period of 10 weeks. Animals were exposed to a standard and high imatinib dosage continuously and to the high imatinib dose intermittently. Bone mass and strength were assessed using pQCT, micro-computed tomography (muCT), and biomechanical testing at the prepubertal, pubertal, and postpubertal age. Bone length and vertebral height as well as biochemical markers of bone turnover were analyzed. Femoral and tibial bone length were dose-dependently reduced by up to 24% (p<0.0001), femoral and tibial trabecular bone mass density (BMD) were reduced by up to 25% (p<0.01), and femoral breaking strength was lowered by up to 20% (p<0.05). Intermittent exposure mitigated these skeletal effects. Long-term exposure resulted in reduced vertebral height by 15% and lower trabecular BMD by 5%. Skeletal changes were associated with suppressed serum osteocalcin (p<0.01) and non-significantly elevated serum CTX-I and PINP levels. In conclusion, imatinib mainly impaired longitudinal growth of long bones rather than the vertebrae of growing rats. Interestingly, intermittent imatinib exposure has less skeletal side effects, which may be beneficial in pediatric patients taking imatinib.",,"['Tauer, Josephine T', 'Hofbauer, Lorenz C', 'Jung, Roland', 'Gerdes, Sebastian', 'Glauche, Ingmar', 'Erben, Reinhold G', 'Suttorp, Meinolf']","['Tauer JT', 'Hofbauer LC', 'Jung R', 'Gerdes S', 'Glauche I', 'Erben RG', 'Suttorp M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Experimental Center of the Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],['I 734/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150624,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Density/*drug effects', 'Bone Remodeling/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Femur/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tibia/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects', 'X-Ray Microtomography']",PMC4479438,,2015/06/25 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2015/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0131192 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-09333 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jun 24;10(6):e0131192. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0131192. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This problem raises the need to create automatic tools that provide hematologists with a second opinion during the classification process. Our research presents a contextual analysis methodology for the detection of acute leukemia subtypes from bone marrow cells images. We propose a cells separation algorithm to break up overlapped regions. In this phase, we achieved an average accuracy of 95% in the evaluation of the segmentation process. In a second phase, we extract descriptive features to the nucleus and cytoplasm obtained in the segmentation phase in order to classify leukemia families and subtypes. We finally created a decision algorithm that provides an automatic diagnosis for a patient.

Loss of FPGS activity results in decreased cellular levels of antifolates and consequently to polyglutamatable antifolates in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: During May 1997 and December 2003, 134 children diagnosed with ALL were recruited from one hospital in Thailand. We performed a mutation analysis in the coding regions of the FPGS gene and the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within FPGS in a case-control sample of childhood ALL patients. Mutation screening was conducted by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and subsequently with direct sequencing (n=72). Association analysis between common FPGS variants and ALL risk was done in 98 childhood ALL cases and 95 healthy volunteers recruited as controls. RESULTS: Seven SNPs in the FPGS coding region were identified by mutation analysis, 3 of which (IVS13+55C>T, g.1297T>G, and g.1508C>T) were recognized as novel SNPs. Association analysis revealed 3 of 6 SNPs to confer significant increase in ALL risk these being rs7039798 (p= 0.014, OR=2.14), rs1544105 (p=0.010, OR= 2.24), and rs10106 (p=0.026, OR= 1.99). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that common genetic polymorphisms in the FPGS coding region including rs7039789, rs1544105, and rs10106 are significantly associated with increased ALL risk in Thai children.",,"['Piwkham, Duangjai', 'Siriboonpiputtana, Teerapong', 'Beuten, Joke', 'Pakakasama, Samart', 'Gelfond, Jonathan Al', 'Paisooksantivatana, Karan', 'Tomlinson, Gail E', 'Rerkamnuaychoke, Budsaba']","['Piwkham D', 'Siriboonpiputtana T', 'Beuten J', 'Pakakasama S', 'Gelfond JA', 'Paisooksantivatana K', 'Tomlinson GE', 'Rerkamnuaychoke B']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand E-mail : budsaba.rer@mahidol.ac.th.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Peptide Synthases/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,2015/06/25 06:00,2016/04/06 06:00,['2015/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.11.4727 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2015;16(11):4727-32. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.11.4727.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Thailand, though, the survival rate for ALL is unimpressive. In 2006, standard national protocols for childhood leukemia treatment were implemented. We herein report the outcome of the ALL national protocols and explanations behind discrepancies in outcomes between institutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2006 and February 2008, 486 children with ALL from 12 institutions were enrolled in the Thai national protocols. There were 3 different protocols based on specific criteria: one each for standard risk, high risk and Burkitt's ALL. We classified participating centers into 4 groups of institutions, namely: medical schools in Bangkok, provincial medical schools, hospitals in Bangkok and provincial hospitals. We also evaluated supportive care, laboratory facilities in participating centers, socioeconomics, and patient compliance. Overall and event-free survival were determined for each group using the Kaplan Meier method. Statistical differences were determined using the log-rank test. Previous outcomes of Thai childhood ALL treatment between 2003 and 2005 served as the historic control. RESULTS: Five-year overall survival of ALL treated using the Thai national protocol was 67.2%; an improvement from the 63.7% of the 12-institute historical control (p-value=0.06). There were discrepancies in event-free survival of ALL between centers in Bangkok and up-country provinces (69.9% vs 51.2%, p-value <0.01). Socioeconomics and patient compliance were key elements in determining the outcome (65.5% vs 47.5%, 59.4% vs 42.9%) (p-value < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of standard national protocols for childhood leukemia in Thailand did not significantly improve the outcome of ALL.

It may occur in patients with acute and chronic leukemia and is particularly associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia). OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical benefits and harms of any pharmacological intervention for treating DIC in patients with acute or chronic leukemia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 05), MEDLINE (1946 to 7 May 2015), LILACS (1982 to 7 May 2015) and African Index Medicus (7 May 2015). There was no language restrictions. We sought additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the reference lists of primary studies identified. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs assessing the clinical benefits and harms of interventions for treating DIC in patients with acute and chronic leukemia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed trial selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. Primary outcomes were overall mortality, in-hospital mortality from any cause (15-day and 30-day) and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: In this Cochrane Review update we did not include any new RCT compared with the first review version. Accordingly, four RCTs (388 participants) met the inclusion criteria. These trials evaluated the human activated protein C, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, tranexamic acid and dermatan sulphate. Included trials reported data on mortality and bleeding. The studies were conducted in Japan, Italy and the Netherlands. We classified the included trials as: 1) including patients with or without leukemia which did not report data for the leukemia subgroup (366 participants); and 2) only including patients with leukemia (22 participants). Overall, the risk of bias of the included trials was high, since the trial authors did not provide a detailed description about trial design and execution.According to the GRADE recommendations, we judged the overall quality of the body of evidence for all prefixed outcomes as 'very low', due to methodological limitations and very small sample size.One trial, including 10 participants with leukemia and comparing dermatan sulphate with heparin, reported no deaths during trial treatment.In terms of bleeding data, we were unable to pool results from two studies that were only conducted with leukemia patients due to the inconsistency in the measurement and reporting of this outcome. One trial, including 12 participants with leukemia, found very low quality evidence that tranexamic acid can reduce the cumulative hemorrhagic score in participants compared with those assigned to placebo (P = 0.0015, very low quality evidence). On the contrary, there is no evidence that dermatan sulphate compared with placebo reduces new events of hemorrhagic diathesis (1/5 (20%) versus 2/5 (40%); RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.06 to 3.91; P = 0.51, very low quality evidence).No thromboembolic complications were reported in either trial that included patients with leukemia only (very low quality evidence). The safety profile was inconclusive.The included trials did not assess overall mortality, resolution of respiratory failure, renal failure or shock. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Due to a lack of new RCTs, our conclusions in this Cochrane Review update are the same as the previous review version. We included four RCTs which reported mortality and bleeding data. It is not possible to determine whether human activated protein C, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, tranexamic acid and dermatan sulphate are effective or harmful for patients presenting with DIC related to acute or chronic leukemia. The quality of the evidence was low to very low. Therefore, prescription of these interventions for treating DIC in patients with acute and chronic leukemia can neither be supported nor rejected, unless new evidence from a large high-quality trial alters this conclusion.",,"['Marti-Carvajal, Arturo J', 'Anand, Vidhu', 'Sola, Ivan']","['Marti-Carvajal AJ', 'Anand V', 'Sola I']","['Iberoamerican Cochrane Network, Valencia, Venezuela.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20150624,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Protein C)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '24967-94-0 (Dermatan Sulfate)', '6T84R30KC1 (Tranexamic Acid)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anticoagulants/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dermatan Sulfate/therapeutic use', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*complications', 'Protein C/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Thrombomodulin/therapeutic use', 'Tranexamic Acid/therapeutic use']",PMC7173718,,2015/06/25 06:00,2016/02/11 06:00,['2015/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD008562.pub3 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015 Jun 24;(6):CD008562. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008562.pub3.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011;(6):CD008562.

We previously demonstrated that genomic alterations related to the cell cycle de-regulation such as CDKN2A and immune escape such as CD58 alteration can serve as predictive biomarkers for acute transformation of the chronic type.

In the present study, mutation of TP53 was further analyzed by sequencing for these cases as well as HTLV-I carriers with oligo-clonality. However, no TP53 mutation was identified. These results suggested that TP53 mutation plays a role for the later stage of ATLL development.",,"['Yoshida, Noriaki', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Arakawa, Fumiko', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Seto, Masao']","['Yoshida N', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Miyoshi H', 'Arakawa F', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Ohshima K', 'Seto M']","['Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/virology', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,,2015/06/25 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2015/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3960/jslrt.55.13 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2015;55(1):13-6. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.55.13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The statewide Utah Population Database, with linkages to the Utah Cancer Registry, was used to identify 1,651 patients who were diagnosed with cancer from 1996 to 2009 at ages 0 to 21 years. A comparison group of 4,953 same-sex and -age individuals was generated from birth certificates. Claims-based hospitalization data from 1996 to 2012 were retrieved from the Utah Department of Health. Using the regression method, we estimated survival (differences due to survival) and intensity (differences due to resource accumulation) effects of the cancer diagnosis on hospitalization outcomes within 10 years after diagnosis. RESULTS: At 10 years after diagnosis, on average, patients with cancer incurred $51,723 (95% CI, $48,100 to $58,284) more in charges, spent 30 additional days (95% CI, 27.7 to 36.1 days) in the hospital, and had 5.7 (95% CI, 5.4 to 6.4) more admissions than the comparison group. Our analyses showed that the highest hospitalization burden occurred during the first 4 years of diagnosis. Patients with leukemia incurred the greatest hospitalization burden throughout the 10 years from diagnosis. Intensity effects explained the majority of differences in hospital outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that children and adolescents who were diagnosed with cancer in 2014 in the United States will incur over $800 million more in hospital charges than individuals without cancer by 2024. Interventions to reduce this burden should be explored in conjunction with improving health and survival outcomes.",['Copyright (c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Kaul, Sapna', 'Barbeau, Bree', 'Wright, Jennifer', 'Fluchel, Mark', 'Kirchhoff, Anne C', 'Nelson, Richard E']","['Kaul S', 'Barbeau B', 'Wright J', 'Fluchel M', 'Kirchhoff AC', 'Nelson RE']","['University of Utah; and Utah Department of Health, Salt Lake City, UT sapna.kaul@hci.utah.edu.', 'University of Utah; and Utah Department of Health, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'University of Utah; and Utah Department of Health, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'University of Utah; and Utah Department of Health, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'University of Utah; and Utah Department of Health, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'University of Utah; and Utah Department of Health, Salt Lake City, UT.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA42014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000105/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201000026C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001067/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150623,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospital Charges/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Length of Stay/*statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia/economics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*economics', 'Patient Admission/*statistics & numerical data', 'Utah', 'Young Adult']",PMC4507394,,2015/06/25 06:00,2016/06/24 06:00,['2015/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JOP.2014.003590 [pii]', '10.1200/JOP.2014.003590 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2015 Jul;11(4):e468-75. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2014.003590.

Trofoblastic invasion: The role of subunits STAT1 and STAT3.,306,10.1016/j.preghy.2012.04.235 [doi] S2210-7789(12)00264-4 [pii],"INTRODUCTION: The trophoblastic migration/invasion are controlled by cytokines and growth factors that use intracellular pathways of signal to promote the regulation of gene expression, proliferation, cells differentiation, angiogenesis and embryonic development. The most important mediator of cytokine in trophoblastic invasion is the Janus-Kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT). STATs are amino acids, compounds of 700-850 variable long-chain with isoforms alpha and beta and molecular weight between 83-113kDa. The role of these factors in the pregnancy set up may contribute to adopt interventions that could contribute to prophylaxis and/or treatment of abnormalities in the course of gestation when installed early. OBJECTIVES: Search on database the role of STAT in the process of trophoblastic invasion with emphasis on subunits STAT1 and STAT3. METHODS: This is a review performed on PubMed database. Have been included Studies found from 1992 (the year of discovery of STATs) until July 2011, without language restriction. The descriptors were: ""Signal transducers and activators of transcription ""and"" Trophoblast"". In the end we excluded bibliographical review. RESULTS: Five of the six selected papers studied the role of STAT3 in the physiology of the trophoblastc invasion process. One of them, indirectly by selection process of lactobacilli of vaginal flora endogenous, during change of vaginal pH on pregnancy, altering the release of greater or lesser number of Interleukin-10 which modulates the activation JAK/STAT. Among them, one of the study refers to involvement of STAT1 in the immunomodulation of interface fetus-mother. CONCLUSION: STAT3 is directly involved in the process of trophoblast invasion either in its endometrium adherence to, angiogenesis, invasion and regulation of invasion. And STAT1 is involved in immunomodulation through its suppression by trophoblast STAT utron. Several soluble factors that are generally present in the decidua, especially hepatocyte growth factor, granulocyte macrophagocytic-colony stimulating factors, interleukin-6, interleukin-11 and inhibition leukemia factor , which have been described by using the JAK-STAT activating STAT1 and STAT3 for intracellular signaling and from this process may influence the invasion trophoblast.",['Copyright (c) 2012.

Effects of STAT1 suppression on ERK1/2 in trophoblastic cells.,243,10.1016/j.preghy.2012.04.118 [doi] S2210-7789(12)00147-X [pii],"INTRODUCTION: Migration and trophoblast invasion are controlled functionally along with the active participation of cytokines and growth factors. Two important intracellular signaling pathways are the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and extracellular regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2). These pathways have been associated with the regulation of gene expression, cellular proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, embryo development and invasion in tumor and trophoblast cells. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study is to characterize and analyze the regulation and crosstalks of STAT1 and ERK1/2 in trophoblast cells and the identification of activating cytokines. METHODS: The trophoblast derived cell line HTR-8/svneo and a choriocarcinoma cell line (JEG-3) were stimulated with interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-11, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMC-SF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or oncostatine M (OSM). The the expression and phosphorylation of STAT1(tyr705) and ERK1/2 were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Expression of STAT1 was inhibited by administration of 50muM fludarabine (2-fluoro-ara-AMP) for 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 or 72h or by using small interfering RNA (siRNA). The full activation of STAT1 was assessed by using an STAT1 DNA-binding assay. Finally, proliferation and invasion assays were performed (Grant Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst A/10172477). RESULTS: LIF and OSM induce STAT1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HTR-8 and JEG-3 cells. Fludarabine inhibits the so induced phosphorylation of STAT1 when administered 48 or 72h before stimulation. Simultaneously, ERK phosphorylation increases. In contrast, silencing of STAT1 by application of specific siRNA induces reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Fludarabine reduces STAT1 DNA-binding capacity. LIF and OSM increase proliferation. Silencing of STAT1 slightly decreases invasiveness of analyzed cells. CONCLUSION: STAT1 in trophoblast cells can be activated by placental cytokines. Suppression of STAT1 by fludarabine or siRNA influences activity of ERK1/2 which indicates a crosstalk between both pathways. Current studies will clarify the reason for the different effects on ERK1/2 in trophoblastic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2010.

We used data from the Pediatric Health Information System on a cohort of children treated for newly diagnosed AML to compare course-specific mortality and resource utilization in patients who were discharged after chemotherapy to outpatient management during neutropenia relative to patients who remained hospitalized. Patients were categorized at each course as early or standard discharge. Discharges within 3 days after chemotherapy completion were considered ""early"". Resource utilization was determined based on daily billing data and reported as days of use per 1000 hospital days. Inpatient mortality, occurrence of intensive care unit (ICU)-level care, and duration of hospitalization were compared using logistic, log-binomial and linear regression methods, respectively. Poisson regression with inpatient days as offset was used to compare resource use by discharge status. The study population included 996 patients contributing 2358 treatment courses. Fewer patients were discharged early following Induction I (7%) than subsequent courses (22-24%). Across courses, patients discharged early experienced high readmission rates (69-84%), yet 9-12 fewer inpatient days (all P < 0.001). Inpatient mortality was low across courses and did not differ significantly by discharge status. The overall risk for ICU-level care was 116% higher for early compared to standard discharge patients (adjusted risk ratio: 2.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.50, 3.11). Rates of antibiotic, vasopressor, and supplemental oxygen use were consistently elevated for early discharge patients.

Some reports have described the presence of BCR-ABL on endothelial cells from CML patients, suggesting the origin of the disease in a primitive hemangioblastic cell. On the other hand, extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by CML leukemic cells are involved in the angiogenesis modulation process. In the current work we hypothesized that EVs released from BCR-ABL(+) cells may carry inside the oncogene that can be transferred to endothelial cells leading to the expression of both BCR-ABL transcript and the oncoprotein. EVs from K562 cells and plasma of newly diagnosed CML patients were isolated by ultracentrifugation. RT-PCR analysis detected the presence of BCR-ABL RNA in the EVs isolated from both K562 cells and plasma of CML patients. The incorporation of these EVs into endothelial cells was demonstrated by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy showed that after 24h of incubation most EVs were incorporated. BCR-ABL transcripts were detected in all experiments on endothelial cells incubated with EVs from both sources. The presence of BCR-ABL on endothelial cells incubated with Philadelphia(+) EVs was also confirmed by Western blot assays.

More accurate risk group stratification and effective personalized risk adapted treatment are necessary to improve outcome. In the last two decades, controversial results have been published concerning the prognostic relevance of CD34 expression. In this study of 706 acute myeloid leukaemia patients, we established a new flow cytometric-based CD34-definition, without use of cut-off values. We discriminated CD34-positive (n = 548) and CD34-negative (n = 158) patients by the presence or absence of neoplastic CD34+ cells, respectively. CD34-status was defined using aberrant immunophenotypes and validated using molecular phenotypes. This new definition of CD34 enables strong prediction of treatment outcome in the entire patient group and in several risk subgroups. Previously observed discrepancies in prognostic impact of CD34 protein expression using cut-offs (5-20%) can now entirely be explained by considering the number of CD34-negative cases. In the total patient group, the absence of neoplastic CD34-positive cells is paralleled by low levels of minimal residual disease, suggesting relative therapy sensitivity and explaining longer survival. Overall, we present CD34 surface expression as a relatively simple, powerful and independent predictor of clinical outcome, now warranting incorporation in acute myeloid leukaemia risk stratification.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Zeijlemaker, Wendelien', 'Kelder, Angele', 'Wouters, Rolf', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Witte, Birgit I', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J']","['Zeijlemaker W', 'Kelder A', 'Wouters R', 'Valk PJM', 'Witte BI', 'Cloos J', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Centre, Cancer Centre Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Centre, Cancer Centre Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Centre, Cancer Centre Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Centre, Cancer Centre Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Centre, Cancer Centre Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Centre, Cancer Centre Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150624,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,,,,,2015/06/25 06:00,2015/06/25 06:01,['2015/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/25 06:01 [medline]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.13572 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Oct;171(2):227-238. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13572.

Functional studies indicate that this hypomorphic variant results in reduced tumour suppressor function of p16(INK4A), increases the susceptibility to leukaemic transformation of haematopoietic progenitor cells, and is preferentially retained in ALL tumour cells. Resequencing the CDKN2A-CDKN2B locus in 2,407 childhood ALL cases reveals 19 additional putative functional germline variants.

In this study, we investigate the effects of wogonoside, a naturally bioactive flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, on cell growth and cell cycle in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, and uncover its underlying mechanisms. The experimental design comprised CML cell lines K562, imatinib-resistant K562 (K562r) cells, and primary CML cells, treated in vitro or in vivo, respectively, with wogonoside; growth and cell cycle were then evaluated. We found that wogonoside could induce growth inhibition and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in both normal and K562r cells. Wogonoside promotes the expression of GATA-1 and facilitates the binding to methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and p21 promoter, thus inhibiting MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling and cell cycle checkpoint proteins, including CDK2, CDK4, cyclin A, and cyclin D1, and increasing p21 expression. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that administration of wogonoside decreased CML cells and prolonged survival in NOD/SCID mice with CML cell xenografts. In conclusion, these results clearly revealed the inhibitory effect of wogonoside on the growth in CML cells and suggested that wogonoside may act as a promising drug for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML.",,"['Li, Hui', 'Hui, Hui', 'Xu, Jingyan', 'Yang, Hao', 'Zhang, Xiaoxiao', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Zhou, Yuxin', 'Li, Zhiyu', 'Guo, Qinglong', 'Lu, Na']","['Li H', 'Hui H', 'Xu J', 'Yang H', 'Zhang X', 'Liu X', 'Zhou Y', 'Li Z', 'Guo Q', 'Lu N']","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, People's Republic of China. anticancer_drug@163.com."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, People's Republic of China. luna555@163.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150624,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Glucosides)', 'ETX4944Z3R (wogonoside)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Flavanones/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Glucosides/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Scutellaria baicalensis/chemistry']",,,2015/06/25 06:00,2017/08/18 06:00,['2015/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00204-015-1552-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-015-1552-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2016 Jun;90(6):1507-22. doi: 10.1007/s00204-015-1552-3.

These processes are tightly regulated by the transcription factors, signaling molecules and epigenetic factors. Impaired regulations of their function could result in hematological malignancies. Using a large-scale zebrafish N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis screening, we identified a line named LDD731, which presented significantly increased HSPCs in hematopoietic organs. Further analysis revealed that the cells of erythroid/myeloid lineages in definitive hematopoiesis were increased while the primitive hematopoiesis was not affected. The homozygous mutation was lethal with a median survival time around 14-15 days post fertilization. The causal mutation was located by positional cloning in the c-cbl gene, the human ortholog of which, c-CBL, is found frequently mutated in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) or acute leukemia. Sequence analysis showed the mutation in LDD731 caused a histidine-to-tyrosine substitution of the amino acid codon 382 within the RING finger domain of c-Cbl. Moreover, the myeloproliferative phenotype in zebrafish seemed dependent on the Flt3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) signaling, consistent with that observed in both mice and humans. Our study may shed new light on the pathogenesis of MPN and provide a useful in vivo vertebrate model of this syndrome for screening drugs.",,"['Peng, X', 'Dong, M', 'Ma, L', 'Jia, X-E', 'Mao, J',

The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) has a crucial role in quiescence and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as well as leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) of acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. We have investigated the effect of HIF-1alpha loss on the phenotype and biology of FLT-3(ITD)-induced myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Using transgenic mouse models, we show that deletion of HIF-1alpha leads to an enhanced MPN phenotype reflected by an increased number of white blood cells, more severe splenomegaly and decreased survival. The proliferative effect of HIF-1alpha loss is cell intrinsic as shown by transplantation into recipient mice. HSC loss and organ-specific changes in the number and percentage of long-term HSCs were the most pronounced effects on a cellular level after HIF-1alpha deletion. Furthermore, we found a metabolic hyperactivation of malignant cells in the spleen upon loss of HIF-1alpha. Some of our findings are in contrary to what has been previously described for the role of HIF-1alpha in other myeloid hematologic malignancies and question the potential of HIF-1alpha as a therapeutic target.",,"['Velasco-Hernandez, T', 'Tornero, D', 'Cammenga, J']","['Velasco-Hernandez T', 'Tornero D', 'Cammenga J']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cells and Restorative Neurology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Skanes University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Skanes University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Institution for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150624,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hif1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2015/06/25 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015156 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.156 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Dec;29(12):2366-74. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.156.

Here, using CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that had been gene modified with a retroviral vector expressing HLA-A*24:02-restricted and Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1)-specific TCR-alpha/beta genes and siRNAs for endogenous TCRs (WT1-siTCR/CD4(+) T cells and WT1-siTCR/CD8(+) T cells), we examined the utility of this strategy. WT1-siTCR/CD4(+) T cells sufficiently recognized leukemia cells in an HLA class I-restricted manner and provided target-specific Th1 help for WT1-siTCR/CD8(+) T cells. By using a xenografted mouse model, we found that WT1-siTCR/CD4(+) T cells migrated to leukemia sites and subsequently attracted WT1-siTCR/CD8(+) T cells via chemotaxis. Therapy-oriented experiments revealed effective enhancement of leukemia suppression mediated by concomitant administration of WT1-siTCR/CD4(+) T cells and WT1-siTCR/CD8(+) T cells. Importantly, this augmented efficacy in the presence of WT1-siTCR/CD4(+) T cells was correlated with longer survival and enhanced formation of memory T cells by WT1-siTCR/CD8(+) T cells.

Here, we describe a role of p38alpha/beta as a regulator of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) proliferation and survival in experimental ALL models. We also report first evidence that p38alpha/beta phosphorylation is associated with the occurrence of relapses in TEL-AML1-positive leukemia. First, in vitro experiments show that p38alpha/beta signaling is induced in a cyclical manner upon initiation of proliferation and remains activated during log-phase of cell growth. Next, we provide evidence that growth-permissive signals in the bone marrow activate p38alpha/beta in a novel avian ALL model, in which therapeutic targeting can be tested. We further demonstrate that p38alpha/beta inhibition by small molecules can suppress leukemic expansion and prolong survival of mice bearing ALL cell lines and primary cells. Knockdown of p38alpha strongly delays leukemogenesis in mice xenografted with cell lines. Finally, we show that in xenografted TEL-AML1 patients, ex vivo p38alpha/beta phosphorylation is associated with an inferior long-term relapse-free survival.

It is commonly deregulated in leukemia. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by a blockade of granulocytic differentiation at the promyelocyte stage. Despite the great success of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-based therapy, which results in a clinical remission by inducing promyelocyte maturation, a significant number of patients relapse due to the development of ATRA resistance. A significant role has been ascribed to the cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway in retinoid treatment since PKA activation is able to restore differentiation in some ATRA-resistant cells and eradicate leukemia-initiating cells in vivo. In this study, using NB4 APL cell variants resistant to ATRA-induced differentiation, we reveal distinct functional roles of the two PKA isozymes, PKA type I (PKA-I) and PKA-type II (PKA-II), on the steady-state level of c-Myc protein, providing a likely mechanism by which cAMP-elevating agents can restore differentiation in ATRA maturation-resistant APL cells. Therefore, both the inhibition of c-Myc activity and the PKA-I/PKA-II ratio should be taken into account if cAMP-based therapy is considered in the clinical management of APL.","['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Liu, Qingyuan', 'Nguyen, Eric', 'Doskeland, Stein', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, Evelyne']","['Liu Q', 'Nguyen E', 'Doskeland S', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale UMR-S 1007, Homeostasie Cellulaire et Cancer, Universite Paris-Descartes, Paris Sorbonne Cite, Paris, France (Q.L., E.N., E.S.-B.); and Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway (S.D.).', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale UMR-S 1007, Homeostasie Cellulaire et Cancer, Universite Paris-Descartes, Paris Sorbonne Cite, Paris, France (Q.L., E.N., E.S.-B.); and Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway (S.D.).', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale UMR-S 1007, Homeostasie Cellulaire et Cancer, Universite Paris-Descartes, Paris Sorbonne Cite, Paris, France (Q.L., E.N., E.S.-B.); and Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway (S.D.).', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale UMR-S 1007, Homeostasie Cellulaire et Cancer, Universite Paris-Descartes, Paris Sorbonne Cite, Paris, France (Q.L., E.N., E.S.-B.); and Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway (S.D.) evelyne.segal-bendirdjian@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150623,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism']",,,2015/06/25 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2015/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.115.097915 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.115.097915 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2015 Sep;88(3):469-76. doi: 10.1124/mol.115.097915.

High expression of Fat1 cadherin within the developing neuroepithelium and the manifestation of severe neurological phenotypes in Fat1-knockout mice suggest roles in neurogenesis. Using the SH-SY5Y model of neuronal differentiation and employing gene silencing techniques, we show that FAT1 acts to control neurite outgrowth, also driving cells towards terminal differentiation via inhibitory effects on proliferation. FAT1 actions were shown to be mediated through Hippo signalling where it activated core Hippo kinase components and antagonised functions of the Hippo effector TAZ. Suppression of FAT1 promoted the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of TAZ leading to enhanced transcription of the Hippo target gene CTGF together with accompanying increases in nuclear levels of Smad3. Silencing of TAZ reversed the effects of FAT1 depletion thus connecting inactivation of TAZ-TGFbeta signalling with Hippo signalling mediated through FAT1. These findings establish FAT1 as a new upstream Hippo element regulating early stages of differentiation in neuronal cells.",,"['Ahmed, Abdulrzag F', 'de Bock, Charles E', 'Lincz, Lisa F', 'Pundavela, Jay', 'Zouikr, Ihssane', 'Sontag, Estelle', 'Hondermarck, Hubert', 'Thorne, Rick F']","['Ahmed AF', 'de Bock CE', 'Lincz LF', 'Pundavela J', 'Zouikr I', 'Sontag E', 'Hondermarck H', 'Thorne RF']","['School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW, 2305, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW, 2305, Australia.', 'Laboratory for the Molecular Biology of Leukemia, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven and Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW, 2305, Australia.', 'Hunter Haematology Research Group, Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, Waratah, NSW, 2298, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW, 2305, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW, 2305, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centre for Translational Neuroscience and Mental Health, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW, 2305, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW, 2305, Australia.

Increase in lymphocyte counts has been known to be predictive of a good treatment response under dasatinib treatment as a second line therapy. However, clinical significance of lymphocyte dynamics in the upfront setting has yet to be clarified. To investigate the significance of lymphocyte dynamics in newly diagnosed chronic phase (CP)-CML, patient data of D-First study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01464411) were analyzed. Fifty-two CML-CP patients enrolled to this study were treated with dasatinib (100 mg day(-1) ) and all were followed-up for 18 months. The incidence of lymphocyosis was observed in 14 (27%), but it was not associated with deep molecular response achievement. However, natural killer (NK) cell or cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) counts at 1 month were significantly higher in patients with deep molecular response (DMR) by 18 months compared to those without DMR. When the patients were divided into two groups according to those calculated thresholds by receiver operating characteristic curve (407/muL for NK cells and 347/muL for CTLs), the cumulative DMR rates by 18 months were significantly better in higher value group compared to lower value group. In contrast, regulatory T cell counts were significantly lower at 12 and 15 months in patients achieved DMR. These results suggest the presence of dual effects of dasatinib on immune system through the cytotoxic lymphocytes activation and Treg deregulation in different periods in newly diagnosed CML-CP.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Iriyama, Noriyoshi', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Yoshida, Chikashi', 'Wakita, Hisashi', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro', 'Kawakami, Kimihiro', 'Takezako, Naoki', 'Kumagai, Takashi', 'Inokuchi, Koiti', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Yano, Shingo', 'Igarashi, Tadahiko', 'Kouzai, Yasuji', 'Morita, Satoshi', 'Sakamoto, Junichi', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi']","['Iriyama N', 'Fujisawa S', 'Yoshida C', 'Wakita H', 'Chiba S', 'Okamoto S', 'Kawakami K', 'Takezako N', 'Kumagai T', 'Inokuchi K', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Taguchi J', 'Yano S', 'Igarashi T', 'Kouzai Y', 'Morita S', 'Sakamoto J', 'Sakamaki H']","['Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Mito Medical Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Japanese Red Cross Society, Narita Red Cross Hospital, Narita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Oncology, Kagawa Prefectural Central Hospital, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Disaster Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Ohme Municipal General Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Shizuoka Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Gunma Prefectural Cancer Center, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Synthesis Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biomedical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Tokai Central Hospital, Gifu, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis/chemically induced/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'ROC Curve', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use']",,,2015/06/24 06:00,2015/11/04 06:00,['2015/06/24 06:00'],"['2015/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24096 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Sep;90(9):819-24. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24096.,,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01464411'],,,,,,,,,,

While such mutations were first identified in severe developmental disorders, or in specific cancers, several genes have been implicated in both, including the plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (PHF6) gene. Indeed, germline mutations in PHF6 are the cause of the Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann X-linked intellectual disability syndrome (BFLS), while somatic PHF6 mutations have been identified in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Studies from different groups over the last few years have made a significant impact towards a functional understanding of PHF6 protein function. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of PHF6 with particular emphasis on how it interfaces with a distinct set of interacting partners and its functional roles in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus. Overall, PHF6 is emerging as a key chromatin adaptor protein critical to the regulation of neurogenesis and hematopoiesis.",,"['Todd, Matthew A M', 'Ivanochko, Danton', 'Picketts, David J']","['Todd MA', 'Ivanochko D', 'Picketts DJ']","['Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada. mtodd.research@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8M5, Canada. mtodd.research@gmail.com.', 'Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada. divan061@uottawa.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8M5, Canada. divan061@uottawa.ca.', 'Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada. dpicketts@ohri.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8M5, Canada. dpicketts@ohri.ca.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8M5, Canada. dpicketts@ohri.ca.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150619,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,,,,PMC4488667,,2015/06/24 06:00,2015/06/24 06:01,['2015/06/24 06:00'],"['2015/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:01 [medline]']","['genes6020325 [pii]', '10.3390/genes6020325 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2015 Jun 19;6(2):325-52. doi: 10.3390/genes6020325.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BFLS', 'NuRD', 'PAF1', 'PHF6', 'T-ALL', 'XLID', 'hematopoiesis', 'neurogenesis', 'nucleolus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Major obstacles in recent studies have included heterogeneity of patient populations and differences in the conditioning regimens used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 50 patients who had acute myeloblastic leukemia and received busulfan-fludarabine-antithymocyte globulin-based conditioning for peripheral allogeneic stem cell transplant. The concentration of CD34+ cells, T-cell subsets, B cells, and natural killer cells in the graft were analyzed by flow cytometry in the donors who were matched for human leukocyte antigen. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, infusion with a higher dose of natural killer cells (> 1.55 x 106/kg) was associated with improved survival (P = .007 for disease-free survival; P = .024 for overall survival) in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Cox regression models revealed that increased concentration of natural killer cells and CD34+ cells positively affected the clinical outcome of allotransplanted patients (P = .005 for both cell types). According to univariate analysis, these findings were dependent on minimal residual disease and acute graft-versus-host disease. Graft-versus-host disease (acute and chronic forms) was not affected by graft composition. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increased concentration of natural killer cells and CD34+ cells in the apheretic product may predict better survival. In contrast, busulfan-fludarabine-antithymocyte globulin-based conditioning eliminates the disadvantages that resulted from the high content of T-cell subsets and B cells, and the course of the transplant and clinical parameters were not affected by the amount of T and B cells.",,"['Yeral, Mahmut', 'Kasar, Mutlu', 'Boga, Can', 'Kozanoglu, Ilknur', 'Ozdogu, Hakan', 'Sariturk, Cagla']","['Yeral M', 'Kasar M', 'Boga C', 'Kozanoglu I', 'Ozdogu H', 'Sariturk C']","['Baskent University Adana Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Adana, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150615,Turkey,Exp Clin Transplant,Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,101207333,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*transplantation', '*Blood Component Removal', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turkey', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",,,2015/06/24 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2015/06/24 06:00'],"['2015/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.6002/ect.2014.0223 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Clin Transplant. 2015 Oct;13(5):453-60. doi: 10.6002/ect.2014.0223.

DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on lymph node, bone marrow, or tissue morphology of centrocytic lymphocytes, small cell type, or blastoid variant cells. A chromosomal translocation t (11:14) is the molecular hallmark of MCL, resulting in the overexpression of cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 is detected by immunohistochemistry in 98% of cases. The absence of SOX-11 or a low Ki-67 may correlate with a more indolent form of MCL. The differential diagnosis of MCL includes small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma. RISK STRATIFICATION: The MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI) is the prognostic model most often used and incorporates ECOG performance status, age, leukocyte count, and lactic dehydrogenase. A modification of the MIPI also adds the Ki-67 proliferative index if available. The median OS for the low-risk group was not reached (5-year OS of 60%). The median OS for the intermediate risk group was 51 months and 29 months for the high risk group. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: For selected indolent, low MIPI MCL patients, initial observation may be appropriate therapy. For younger patients with intermediate or high risk MIPI MCL, aggressive therapy with a cytotoxic regimen +/- autologous stem cell transplantation should be considered. For older MCL patients with intermediate or high risk MIPI, combination chemotherapy with R-CHOP, R-Bendamustine, or a clinical trial should be considered. In addition, rituximab maintenance therapy may prolong the progression-free survival. At the time of relapse, agents directed at activated pathways in MCL cells such as bortezomib (NFkB inhibitor), lenalidamide (anti-angiogenesis) and Ibruitinib (Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase [BTK] inhibitor) have demonstrated excellent clinical activity in MCL patients. Autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation can also be considered in young patients. Clinical trials with novel agents are always a consideration for MCL patients.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Vose, Julie M']",['Vose JM'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Management', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Spleen/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,,2015/06/24 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2015/06/24 06:00'],"['2015/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24094 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Aug;90(8):739-45. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24094.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated on the basis of drug prices in the United States in 2014. Sixty-three percent of the studies (15 of 24) had ICERs higher than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), the benchmark widely used by health economists to define cost-effectiveness. In studies evaluating the current standard-of-care treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia, the ICERs for tyrosine kinase inhibitors versus hydroxyurea or interferon ranged from $210,000 to $426,000/QALY. The lower ICER values were mostly obtained from 11 studies evaluating rituximab, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997 (ICER range, $37,000-$69,000/QALY).

Ectopic expression of C/EBPalpha in AML cells suppresses proliferation and induces differentiation suggesting that restoring C/EBPalpha expression/activity in AML cells could be therapeutically useful. Unfortunately, current approaches of gene or protein delivery in leukemic cells are unsatisfactory. However, ""drug repurposing"" is becoming a very attractive strategy to identify potential new uses for existing drugs. In this study, we assessed the biological effects of candidate C/EBPalpha-mimetics identified by interrogation of the Connectivity Map database. We found that amantadine, an antiviral and anti-Parkinson agent, induced a monocyte-macrophage-like differentiation of HL60, U937, Kasumi-1 myeloid leukemia cell lines, as indicated by morphology and differentiation antigen expression, when used in combination with suboptimal concentration of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or Vit D3. The effect of amantadine depends, in part, on increased activity of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), since it induced VDR expression and amantadine-dependent monocyte-macrophage differentiation of HL60 cells was blocked by expression of dominant-negative VDR.

The aim of this study was to investigate CD146 expression in acute leukemia using a multiparametric cytofluorimetric approach. METHODS: Cytofluorimetric and cytogenetic studies were performed on peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from 162 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 121) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 41). ALL patients were subdivided in B-ALL (n = 38) and T-ALL (n = 3). Adult (n = 18) and pediatric (n = 20) B-ALL were considered as a whole group. RESULTS: Four out of 121 (3.3%) AML cases, 14/38 (36.8%) B-ALL, and 2/3 (66.6%) T-ALL expressed CD146 on 12-98% of blasts (p < 0.001). CD146 expression was not observed in 10 healthy controls. Among B-ALL CD146-positive cases, 78.6% were associated with a ""common""/BII-ALL and 21.4% with a pre-B/BIII-ALL immunophenotype while pro-B/BI-ALL and mature-B/BIV-ALL cases were CD146-negative. Statistical analysis showed CD146 expression strongly associated with Ph+ positivity in B-ALL with the highest percentage of CD146-positive blasts in all Ph-positive B-ALL cases (84 +/- 22% Ph-positive B-ALL SD vs. 40 +/- 24% SD in Ph-negative B-ALL; p < 0,001). CONCLUSION: In our series, CD146 was expressed in all cases of Ph-positive B-ALL and in the vast majority of T-ALL, whereas it was rarely expressed by AML blasts. We suggest that CD146 may be considered as an additional marker for acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosis and monitoring of minimal residual disease in those cases which are CD146-positive at diagnosis.

This program consisted of regular distributions of test samples followed by biannual plenary participant meetings in which results were presented and discussed. A scoring system was developed in which the quality of results was rated by systematically reviewing the pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical assay stages using three scores, i.e., correct (A), minor fault (B), and major fault (C). Here, we report on 90 consecutive samples distributed to 40-61 participating laboratories between 1998 and 2012. Most samples contained >20% aberrant cells, mainly selected from mature lymphoid malignancies (B or T cell) and acute leukemias (myeloid or lymphoblastic). In 2002, minimally required monoclonal antibody (mAb) panels were introduced, whilst methodological guidelines for all three assay stages were implemented. Retrospectively, we divided the study into subsequent periods of 4 (""initial""), 4 (""learning""), and 7 years (""consolidation"") to detect ""learning effects."" Uni- and multivariate models showed that analytical performance declined since 2002, but that post-analytical performance improved during the entire period. These results emphasized the need to improve technical aspects of the assay, and reflected improved interpretational skills of the participants. A strong effect of participant affiliation in all three assay stages was observed: laboratories in academic and large peripheral hospitals performed significantly better than those in small hospitals.

Human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells were treated with aminoglutethimide (AG), an arylamine drug that has a risk of adverse drug reactions, including drug-induced agranulocytosis. HL-60 cells contain abundant amounts of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a hemoprotein, which catalyzes one-electron oxidation of arylamines using H2O2 as a cofactor. Previous studies have shown that arylamine metabolism by MPO results in protein radical formation. The purpose of this study was to determine if pathways associated with a toxic response could be determined from conditions that produced protein radicals. Conditions for AG-induced protein radical formation (with minimal cytotoxicity) were optimized, and these conditions were used to carry out proteomic studies. We identified 43 proteins that were changed significantly upon AG treatment among which 18 were up-regulated and 25 were down-regulated. The quantitative proteomic data showed that AG peroxidative metabolism led to the down-regulation of critical anti-apoptotic proteins responsible for inhibiting the release of pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondria as well as cytoskeletal proteins such as nuclear lamina. This overall pro-apoptotic response was confirmed with flow cytometry which demonstrated apoptosis to be the main mode of cell death, and this was attenuated by MPO inhibition. This response correlated with the intensity of AG-induced protein radical formation in HL-60 cells, which may play a role in cell death signaling mechanisms.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We undertook a retrospective review of children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and treated with modern COG protocols (n = 80) to determine longitudinal changes in body mass index (BMI) and the prevalence of obesity compared with a healthy reference population. Results. At diagnosis, the majority of patients (77.5%) were in the healthy weight category. During treatment, increases in BMI z-scores were greater for females than males; the prevalence of obesity increased from 10.3% to 44.8% (P < 0.004) for females but remained relatively unchanged for males (9.8% to 13.7%, P = 0.7). Longitudinal analysis using linear mixed-effects identified associations between BMI z-scores and time-dependent interactions with sex (P = 0.0005), disease risk (P < 0.0001), age (P = 0.0001), and BMI z-score (P < 0.0001) at diagnosis and total dose of steroid during maintenance (P = 0.01). Predicted mean BMI z-scores at the end of therapy were greater for females with standard risk ALL irrespective of age at diagnosis and for males younger than 4 years of age at diagnosis with standard risk ALL. Conclusion. Females treated on standard risk protocols and younger males may be at greatest risk of becoming obese during treatment for ALL.

A certain amount of risk remains to the recipient cat, as immediate or delayed adverse reactions can occur during or after transfusion, related to immunemediated mechanisms. This article, however, focuses on adverse events caused by infectious agents, which may originate either from contamination of blood following incorrect collection, storage or transfusion, or from transfusion of contaminated blood obtained from an infected donor. PREVENTION OF BLOOD CONTAMINATION: In cats, blood cannot be collected through a closed system and, therefore, collection of donor blood requires a multi-step manipulation of syringes and other devices. It is crucial that each step of the procedure is performed under the strictest aseptic conditions and that bacterial contamination of blood bags is prevented, as bacterial endotoxins can cause an immediate febrile reaction or even fatal shock in the recipient cat. PREVENTION OF DISEASE TRANSMISSION: With a view to preventing transmission of blood-borne infectious diseases, the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine has adopted basic criteria for selecting pathogens to be tested for in donor pets. The worldwide core screening panel for donor cats includes feline leukaemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, Bartonella species and feline haemoplasma. The list should be adapted to the local epidemiological situation concerning other vector-borne feline infections. The most practical, rapid and inexpensive measure to reduce transfusion risk is to check the risk profile of donor cats on the basis of a written questionnaire. Blood transfusion can never, however, be considered entirely safe.",['(c) Published by SAGE on behalf of ISFM and AAFP 2015.'],"['Pennisi, Maria Grazia', 'Hartmann, Katrin', 'Addie, Diane D', 'Lutz, Hans', 'Gruffydd-Jones, Tim', 'Boucraut-Baralon, Corine', 'Egberink, Herman', 'Frymus, Tadeusz', 'Horzinek, Marian C', 'Hosie, Margaret J', 'Lloret, Albert', 'Marsilio, Fulvio', 'Radford, Alan D', 'Thiry, Etienne', 'Truyen, Uwe', 'Mostl, Karin']","['Pennisi MG', 'Hartmann K', 'Addie DD', 'Lutz H', 'Gruffydd-Jones T', 'Boucraut-Baralon C', 'Egberink H', 'Frymus T', 'Horzinek MC', 'Hosie MJ', 'Lloret A', 'Marsilio F', 'Radford AD', 'Thiry E', 'Truyen U', 'Mostl K']",,['eng'],"['BB/D008425/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G0300387/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline']",,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,,IM,"['Animal Welfare/standards', 'Animals', 'Blood Transfusion/*veterinary', 'Cat Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Cats', 'Communicable Diseases/*veterinary', 'Iatrogenic Disease/prevention & control/*veterinary', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'Veterinary Medicine/standards']",,,2015/06/24 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/06/24 06:00'],"['2015/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['17/7/588 [pii]', '10.1177/1098612X15588449 [doi]']",ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2015 Jul;17(7):588-93. doi: 10.1177/1098612X15588449.,['European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using MR1-antigen (Ag) tetramers that specifically bind to the MR1-restricted MAIT T cell receptors (TCRs), we demonstrate that MAIT cells are detectable in a broad range of tissues in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. These cells include CD4(-)CD8(-), CD4(-)CD8(+), and CD4(+)CD8(-) subsets, and their frequency varies in a tissue- and strain-specific manner. Mouse MAIT cells have a CD44(hi)CD62L(lo) memory phenotype and produce high levels of IL-17A, whereas other cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and GM-CSF, are produced at low to moderate levels. Consistent with high IL-17A production, most MAIT cells express high levels of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gammat (RORgammat), whereas RORgammat(lo) MAIT cells predominantly express T-bet and produce IFN-gamma. Most MAIT cells express the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) transcription factor, and their development is largely PLZF dependent. These observations contrast with previous reports that MAIT cells from Valpha19 TCR transgenic mice are PLZF(-) and express a naive CD44(lo) phenotype. Accordingly, MAIT cells from normal mice more closely resemble human MAIT cells than previously appreciated, and this provides the foundation for further investigations of these cells in health and

Risk-adapted intensive chemotherapy is effective in curing the majority of children with BCP-ALL (>85%), but some children, not considered ""high risk"" and treated accordingly, experience a hematologic relapse. Moreover, survival rates in adults are significantly lower ( approximately 40%) than those in children. Recent developments in genomewide genetic analysis have provided a wide range of chromosomal and genomic abnormalities characterizing BCP-ALL, several of which are associated with patient outcome. These findings provide an opportunity to adapt risk stratification and treatment schedules and to identify new druggable targets. In this review, we discuss the established and novel genetic alterations in BCP-ALL, their molecular background, and their potential use in risk stratification and treatment of BCP-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

A major controversy concerns MLD's role in NPM1-mutated (NPM1(+)) AML, which correlates with good prognosis. We used flow cytometry (FC), an emerging technique for assessing dysplasia, to investigate MLD in NPM1(+) AML by an immunophenotypic score (IPS), a technique previously adopted in myelodysplastic syndrome. Eighty-five intensively treated NPM1(+) AML cases were studied. Patients were grouped according to the combination of data in maturing cell compartments. FC-assessed dysplasia showed a significant correlation with morphology-assessed dysplasia, showing the efficacy of this method in highlighting dysplasia in AML. Except for MLD, IPS did not influence any patient- or disease-related characteristics at diagnosis. Furthermore, IPS did not influence complete remission rate, disease-free survival, or overall survival. By investigating NPM1 status on separated cell compartments, we established a correlation between FC-assessed MLD and belonging to AML clone. This study shows that dysplasia evaluated by immunophenotype has no impact on clinical-biological characteristics or on outcome of NPM1(+) AML. Dysplasia is part of the spectrum of NPM1(+) AML, and the prognostic stratification of this category of patients should not be based upon it.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: King Edward Medical University, Lahore and Hameed Latif Hospital, Lahore, from February 2013 to March 2014. METHODOLOGY: A total of 50 newly diagnosed and untreated patients of ALL were selected from Mayo Hospital and Hameed Latif Hospital. These patients included both genders and all age groups. Hemoglobin, total leukocyte count and platelet count were determined on hematology analyser-Sysmex-Kx-2I. Blast cell percentage was estimated on Giemsa stained blood smears. Immunophenotyping was done on bone marrow samples by 5 colour flowcytometery on Beckman Coulter Navious Flowcytometer. An acute leukemia panel of 23 antibodies was used. The data was entered and analyzed in SPSS version 22. RESULTS: Of the 50 ALL patients, 36 (72%) were B-ALL and 14 (28%) T-ALL. There were 18 (36%) children and 32 (64%) adults. T-ALL included 22% of the childhood and 31% of the adult cases. Immunophenotypic analysis showed that CD19, CD79a and CD20 were B-lineage specific markers whereas cCD3, CD3 and CD5 were T-lineage specific. CD10 was the most sensitive marker for B-ALL and CD7 was the most sensitive marker of T-ALL. TdT was expressed in 92% B-ALL and 71% T-ALL cases, CD34 in 58% and 43% cases and CD45 in 83% and 100% respectively. High leukocyte count (> 50 x 109/L) was present in 58% cases. Hemoglobin was < 10 g/dl in 74% patients and platelet count was below 20 x 109/Lin 12% patients. Leukocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count and blast cell % did not show a significant difference in the two ALL immunotypes.

Although second-generation TKIs (TKI2), including dasatinib and nilotinib, are appropriate treatment regimens for patients with disease that progressed to accelerated phase following imatinib therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only curative therapy. This study retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of TKI2 and HSCT for treatment of CML in accelerated phase. Ninety-three patients with CML registered in the Chinese CML alliance database from February 2001 to February 2014 were enrolled and divided into the TKI2 (n = 33) and allo-HSCT (n = 60) groups. In the TKI2 group, 26 and 7 patients received nilotinib and dasatinib, respectively, as initial TKI2 and 11 patients transferred to the alternative TKI2 after failure to one TKI2. In the allo-HSCT group, 22 (36.7%), 35 (58.3%), and 3 (10%) patients underwent allo-HSCT from an HLA-matched sibling donor, HLA mismatched/haploidentical donor, and unrelated donor, respectively. All patients in the HSCT group were engrafted. Overall, 69.7%, 48.5%, and 45.5% of patients presented hematological, cytogenetic, and major molecular responses, respectively, to at least one of TKI2. All 60 patients (100%) achieved CHR and cytogenetic response in the HSCT group. Patients in the TKI2 group exhibited lower 5-year overall survival rate (42.9% vs. 86.4%, P = 0.002), 5-year event-free survival rate (14.3% vs. 76.1%, P < 0.001), and 5-year progression-free survival (28.6% vs. 78.1%, P < 0.001) than those in the allo-HSCT group. Multivariate analysis showed that male sex and TKI2 therapy were predictors of poor overall survival, whereas hemoglobin < 100 g/L and TKI2 therapy were predictors of poor event-free survival and progression-free survival. These results indicated that allo-HSCT may be superior to nilotinib and dasatinib for adult patients with CML in accelerated phase.",,"['Xu, Lanping', 'Zhu, Huanling', 'Hu, Jianda', 'Wu, Depei', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Huang, Xiaojun']","['Xu L', 'Zhu H', 'Hu J', 'Wu D', 'Jiang H', 'Jiang Q', 'Huang X']","[""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, 100044, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150622,China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Dasatinib/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/06/24 06:00,2016/05/28 06:00,['2015/06/24 06:00'],"['2014/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11684-015-0400-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Front Med. 2015 Sep;9(3):304-11. doi: 10.1007/s11684-015-0400-4.

To solve the problem, we here present a novel colorimetric analytical strategy based on iodide-responsive Cu-Au nanoparticles (Cu-Au NPs) combined with the iodide-catalyzed H2O2-TMB (3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine) reaction system. In this strategy, bimetallic Cu-Au NPs prepared with an irregular shape and a diameter of approximately 15 nm could chemically absorb iodide, thus indirectly inducing colorimetric signal variation of the H2O2-TMB system. By further utilizing its property of easy biomolecule modification, a versatile colorimetric platform was constructed for detection of any target that could cause the change of Cu-Au NPs concentration via molecular recognition. As proof of concept, an analysis of human leukemia CCRF-CEM cells was performed using aptamer Sgc8c-modified Cu-Au NPs as the colorimetric probe. Results showed that Sgc8c-modified Cu-Au NPs successfully achieved a simple, label-free, cost-effective, visualized, selective, and ultrasensitive detection of cancer cells with a linear range from 50 to 500 cells/mL and a detection limit of 5 cells in 100 muL of binding buffer. Moreover, feasibility was demonstrated for cancer cell analysis in diluted serum samples.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential roles of miR-374b in the development and treatment of T-LBL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MiRCURY LNA array was used to generate a miRNA-expressing profile. Real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were applied to detect the expression of miR-374b, AKT1, and Wnt16 in T-LBL samples. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm target associations of miR-374b. The tumor-suppressive effect of miR-374b was determined by both in vitro and in vivo studies. RESULTS: The expression of 380 miRNAs was evaluated in five human T-LBL tissues and five infantile thymus samples by microRNA microarrays. Downregulation of miR-374b was frequently detected in primary T-LBL tissues, which was significantly associated with worse overall survival and increased risk of recurrence of the 58 patients enrolled in this study. miR-374b suppressed T-LBL cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and sensitized cells to serum starvation- and chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we characterized two AKT pathway-associated molecules, AKT1 and Wnt16, as direct targets of miR-374b. Consistently, in T-LBL patient tissues, AKT1 and Wnt16 expression was inversely correlated with miR-374b levels, and was an independent predictor of recurrence and survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the molecular etiology and clinical significance of miR-374b in T-LBL.

The pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is stringently associated with a tumor-supportive microenvironment and a dysfunctional immune system. Here, we explore the role of CLL-derived exosomes in the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which malignant cells create this favorable surrounding. We show that CLL-derived exosomes are actively incorporated by endothelial and mesenchymal stem cells ex vivo and in vivo and that the transfer of exosomal protein and microRNA induces an inflammatory phenotype in the target cells, which resembles the phenotype of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). As a result, stromal cells show enhanced proliferation, migration, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, contributing to a tumor-supportive microenvironment. Exosome uptake by endothelial cells increased angiogenesis ex vivo and in vivo, and coinjection of CLL-derived exosomes and CLL cells promoted tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. Finally, we detected alpha-smooth actin-positive stromal cells in lymph nodes of CLL patients. These findings demonstrate that CLL-derived exosomes actively promote disease progression by modulating several functions of surrounding stromal cells that acquire features of cancer-associated fibroblasts.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Paggetti, Jerome', 'Haderk, Franziska', 'Seiffert, Martina', 'Janji, Bassam', 'Distler, Ute', 'Ammerlaan, Wim', 'Kim, Yeoun Jin', 'Adam, Julien', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Solary, Eric', 'Berchem, Guy', 'Moussay, Etienne']","['Paggetti J', 'Haderk F', 'Seiffert M', 'Janji B', 'Distler U', 'Ammerlaan W', 'Kim YJ', 'Adam J', 'Lichter P', 'Solary E', 'Berchem G', 'Moussay E']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg;', 'Department for Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department for Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg;', 'Luxembourg Clinical Proteomics Center, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg;', 'Integrated BioBank of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg;', 'Luxembourg Clinical Proteomics Center, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg;', 'INSERM U981, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Faculty of Medicine, University Paris-Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France;', 'Department for Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Faculty of Medicine, University Paris-Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France; INSERM UMR1009, Gustave Roussy Villejuif, France; and.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg;']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150622,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Exosomes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Fibroblasts/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Transport', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/immunology/metabolism/*pathology']",PMC4560344,,2015/06/24 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/06/24 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30978-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-12-618025 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Aug 27;126(9):1106-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-12-618025.

Based on the fact that high levels of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and increased angiogenesis have been described in acute myeloid leukemia and associated with disease progression, we studied the in vivo effects of HF using an Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) mouse model. METHODS: NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with leukemic cells from hCG-PML/RARA transgenic mice (TM) and treated with HF 150 mug/kg/day for 21 days. The leukemic infiltration and the percentage of VEGF+ cells were evaluated by morphology and flow cytometry. The effect of HF on the gene expression of several pro- and antiangiogenic factors, phosphorylation of SMAD2 and VEGF secretion was assessed in vitro using NB4 and HUVEC cells. RESULTS: HF treatment resulted in hematological remission with decreased accumulation of immature cell and lower amounts of VEGF in BM of leukemic mice. In vitro, HF modulated gene expression of several pro- and antiangiogenic factors, reduced VEGF secretion and phosphorylation of SMAD2, blocking TGF-beta-signaling. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results demonstrate that HF inhibits SMAD2 signaling and reduces leukemia growth and angiogenesis.",,"['Assis, Patricia A', 'De Figueiredo-Pontes, Lorena L', 'Lima, Ana Silvia G', 'Leao, Vitor', 'Candido, Larissa A', 'Pintao, Carolina T', 'Garcia, Aglair B', 'Saggioro, Fabiano P', 'Panepucci, Rodrigo A', 'Chahud, Fernando', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Falcao, Roberto P', 'Rego, Eduardo M']","['Assis PA', 'De Figueiredo-Pontes LL', 'Lima AS', 'Leao V', 'Candido LA', 'Pintao CT', 'Garcia AB', 'Saggioro FP', 'Panepucci RA', 'Chahud F', 'Nagler A', 'Falcao RP', 'Rego EM']","['Hematology and Oncology Divisions of the Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. patricia_aas@yahoo.com.br.', 'Hematology and Oncology Divisions of the Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. lorenafigdo@yahoo.com.br.', 'Hematology and Oncology Divisions of the Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. asglima@hotmail.com.', 'Hematology and Oncology Divisions of the Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. vitor.leao.vleao@gmail.com.', 'Hematology and Oncology Divisions of the Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. larissa_candidoa@usp.br.', 'Hematology and Oncology Divisions of the Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. cpintao@hotmail.com.', 'Hematology and Oncology Divisions of the Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. aglairbg@hotmail.com.', 'Pathology Department, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. fchahud@fmrp.usp.br.', 'Hematology and Oncology Divisions of the Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. panepucci@hemocentro.fmrp.usp.br.', 'Pathology Department, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. fchahud@fmrp.usp.br.', 'Hematology Division and Cord Blood Bank, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Hashomer, 6997801, Israel. arnon.nagler@sheba.health.gov.il.', 'Hematology and Oncology Divisions of the Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. rpfalcao@fmrp.usp.br.', 'Hematology and Oncology Divisions of the Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14049900, Brazil. emrego@hcrp.fmrp.usp.br.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150623,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (SMAD2 protein, human)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', 'L31MM1385E (halofuginone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperidines/*metabolism', 'Quinazolinones/*metabolism', 'Smad2 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4486128,,2015/06/24 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/06/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-015-0181-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-015-0181-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2015 Jun 23;34:65. doi: 10.1186/s13046-015-0181-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ACT based on the administration of cytotoxic T cells genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognizing CD19 expressed by B cell malignancies has been shown to induce complete lasting responses in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). So far, eleven clinical trials including 99 CLL and ALL patients treated with CAR T cells targeting CD19 have been published, and the results from these trials are promising with impressive clinical responses in heavily pretreated patients. Thus, CAR T cell therapy has induced complete responses in both CLL and ALL, and surprisingly, current results indicate that patients with ALL are more prone to respond than are CLL patients. Importantly, the majority of CAR cell studies have observed severe therapy-associated toxicities, which needs attention.

The siRNA-NP-Ab-loaded film (siRNA-NP-Ab-film) was transparent, displayed suitable physicomechanical properties, and was noncytotoxic. Targeting activity was evaluated in a mucosal coculture model consisting of a vaginal epithelial monolayer (VK2/E6E7 cells) and differentiated KG-1 cells (HLA-DR+ DCs). siRNA-NP-Ab were rapidly released from the film and were able to penetrate the epithelial layer to be taken up by differentiated KG-1 cells. siRNA-NP-Ab demonstrated higher targeting activity and significantly higher knockdown of synaptosome-associated 23-kDa protein (SNAP-23) mRNA and protein when compared to siRNA-NP without antibody conjugation.

Elucidating the mechanism by which E2A-PBX1 induces lymphoid leukemia would be expedited by the availability of a tractable experimental model in which enforced expression of E2A-PBX1 in hematopoietic progenitors induces pre-B-cell ALL. However, hematopoietic reconstitution of irradiated mice with bone marrow infected with E2A-PBX1-expressing retroviruses consistently gives rise to myeloid, not lymphoid, leukemia. Here, we elucidate the hematopoietic consequences of forced E2A-PBX1 expression in primary murine hematopoietic progenitors. We show that introducing E2A-PBX1 into multipotent progenitors permits the retention of myeloid potential but imposes a dense barrier to lymphoid development prior to the common lymphoid progenitor stage, thus helping to explain the eventual development of myeloid, and not lymphoid, leukemia in transplanted mice. Our findings also indicate that E2A-PBX1 enforces the aberrant, persistent expression of some genes that would normally have been down-regulated in the subsequent course of hematopoietic maturation. We show that enforced expression of one such gene, Hoxa9, a proto-oncogene associated with myeloid leukemia, partially reproduces the phenotype produced by E2A-PBX1 itself. Existing evidence suggests that the 1;19 translocation event takes place in committed B-lymphoid progenitors. However, we find that retrovirus-enforced expression of E2A-PBX1 in committed pro-B-cells results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our findings indicate that the neoplastic phenotype induced by E2A-PBX1 is determined by the developmental stage of the cell into which the oncoprotein is introduced.",,"['Woodcroft, Mark W', 'Nanan, Kyster', 'Thompson, Patrick', 'Tyryshkin, Kathrin', 'Smith, Steven P', 'Slany, Robert K', 'LeBrun, David P']","['Woodcroft MW', 'Nanan K', 'Thompson P', 'Tyryshkin K', 'Smith SP', 'Slany RK', 'LeBrun DP']","[""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", ""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", ""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", ""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", ""Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Genetics, University Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', ""Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],['MOP-81333/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150622,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/metabolism', '*Lymphopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Myelopoiesis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",PMC4476730,,2015/06/23 06:00,2016/03/30 06:00,['2015/06/23 06:00'],"['2014/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0130495 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-33039 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jun 22;10(6):e0130495. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0130495. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe a pathogenic mechanism in which follicular translocation of marginal zone (MZ) B cells in the spleens of BXD2 lupus mice disrupts marginal zone macrophages (MZMs), which normally clear AC debris and prevent follicular entry of AC-Ags. Phagocytosis of ACs by splenic MZMs required the megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) transcriptional coactivator-mediated mechanosensing pathway, which was maintained by MZ B cells through expression of membrane lymphotoxin-alpha1beta2 (mLT). Specifically, type I IFN-induced follicular shuttling of mLT-expressing MZ B cells disengaged interactions between these MZ B cells and LTbeta receptor-expressing MZMs, thereby downregulating MKL1 in MZMs. Loss of MKL1 expression in MZMs led to defective F-actin polymerization, inability to clear ACs, and, eventually, MZM dissipation. Aggregation of plasmacytoid DCs in the splenic perifollicular region, follicular translocation of MZ B cells, and loss of MKL1 and MZMs were also observed in an additional murine lupus model and in the spleens of patients with SLE.

Mice were transplanted with Bcr-Abl-transfected proB lymphocytes mimicking leukemia and received either POS or INU in their diet (5%) for 2 weeks. Combination of pyrosequencing, PCR-DGGE and qPCR analyses of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that POS decreased microbial diversity and richness of caecal microbiota whereas it increased Bifidobacterium spp., Roseburia spp. and Bacteroides spp. (affecting specifically B. dorei) to a higher extent than INU. INU supplementation increased the portal SCFA propionate and butyrate, and decreased cancer cell invasion in the liver. POS treatment did not affect hepatic cancer cell invasion, but was more efficient than INU to decrease the metabolic alterations. Indeed, POS better than INU delayed anorexia linked to cancer progression. In addition, POS treatment increased acetate in the caecal content, changed the fatty acid profile inside adipose tissue and counteracted the induction of markers controlling beta-oxidation, thereby hampering fat mass loss.

HIV infection is complicated by various opportunistic infections (OIs) such as tuberculosis (TB), candidiasis, herpes zoster, Pneumocystis jirvoceii, cytomegalovirus (CMV) etc., This study carried out to know the clinical profile of HIV patients with OIs. METHODS: A case series study was carried out at a tertiary care hospital in Bellary, Karnataka, India. A hospital based case series study was conducted among 164 HIV patients with OIs admitted to various wards as well as attending outpatient department at Vijayanagara Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital, Bellary during Jan 2013 to Nov 2013. Both primary and secondary data was collected to gather information on clinical profile. The statistical tests used were descriptive statistics and independent t test. RESULTS: Among 164 patients, 29.3% were females and 68.3% males. High proportions of patients were observed in 28-37 years of age group and heterosexual route was the most common mode of transmission. TB (50%) is the most frequent OI followed by candidiasis (49%), pneumocystis (16%) and others. The mean CD4 cell count in TB was 237.02/mL and in candidiasis 189.07/mL. Low values were observed in promyelocytic leukemia (18.10/mL), CMV (18.5/mL) and in toxoplasmosis (73.1/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory system was the most common system involved by OIs and most of patients with OIs had CD4 T cell count below 200/mL, whereas there were no patients in the study with counts above 500/mL.",,"['Ramesh, K', 'Gandhi, Sangeetha', 'Rao, Vishwas']","['Ramesh K', 'Gandhi S', 'Rao V']","['Associate Professor, Department of Community Medicine, Vijayanagara Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Bellary, Karnataka, India.', 'Junior Resident, Department of Community Medicine, Vijayanagara Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Bellary, Karnataka, India.', 'Junior Resident, Department of Community Medicine, Vijayanagara Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Bellary, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Int J Appl Basic Med Res,International journal of applied & basic medical research,101579831,,,,PMC4456886,,2015/06/23 06:00,2015/06/23 06:01,['2015/06/23 06:00'],"['2014/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2229-516X.157166 [doi]', 'IJABMR-5-119 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Appl Basic Med Res. 2015 May-Aug;5(2):119-23. doi: 10.4103/2229-516X.157166.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD4 cell and tuberculosis', 'Human immunodeficiency virus', 'opportunistic infections']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous studies have been done on cytotoxic components of pomegranate's juices, barks and leaves. The peels, which considered as a waste, contain higher antioxidant components compared with other parts of the plant. AIM: To investigate the potential anti-cancer activity of pomegranate peel on growth and cell death mechanisms of chronic myeloid leukemic (CML) cells, K562. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Punica granatum peels extract (PGPE) was extracted by successive ethanol extraction, 80% (v/v), freeze dried, diluted to 20 mg/mL working concentration and was subjected to phytochemical screening. K562 cell was treated with crude PGPE for 72 h. Following IC50 concentration, the apoptosis, cell cycle and protein analysis were evaluated. Cell growth inhibition assay was performed by conventional trypan blue exclusion assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed by flow-cytometry using BD apoptosis and cell cycle kits and protein analysis by western blotting. All the results are expressed as mean +/- standard error of mean of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that PGPE promotes growth inhibition of K562 cells mainly via G2/M phase arrest while still conserving apoptosis induction, but at a lower rate. Apoptosis activities were proposed by the up-regulation of caspases and cytochrome c with an elevated level of p21 and p53.

It is considered to be useful for predicting the severity of fibrosis and the risk of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the association between the presence of diffuse regions of increased cell density in the liver and elevated LS values has not been assessed. We experienced a case in which a mature T-cell neoplasm had invaded the liver, but the infiltrating lesion was not detected by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT scans. Instead, the tumor's presence was indicated by the change in the patient's TE-derived LS values after chemotherapy. At diagnosis liver dysfunction was detected in a biochemical examination, and mean LS value was as high as 25.4 kPa [interquartile range (IQR): 0.3, success rate (SR):100%]. After chemotherapy, the patient's mean LS value fell to 4.3 kPa (IQR: 0.8, SR:100%). A follow-up pathological investigation demonstrated that proliferating abnormal T-cells were no longer present in the patient's liver. This is the first report to describe the use of LS data to support a diagnosis of liver infiltration by tumor cells exhibiting a portal and sinusoidal distribution pattern rather than a focal pattern.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that functions in a variety of cellular processes including apoptosis. MiRNAs have been implicated as effectors of SCI. However, role of miRNAs in SCI-associated neuronal apoptosis remains to be investigated. A number of bioinformatics approaches have suggested Mcl-1 and BH3-only family genes as potential downstream targets regulated by miR-20a and miR-29b, respectively. To determine whether miR-20a and miR-29b play a role in neuronal apoptosis of SCI by regulating those genes, we transfected Neuro-2A neuroblastoma cells with mimic and inhibitor for the two miRNAs. The miR-20a mimic decreased Mcl-1 expression and the miR-29b mimic reduced the expression of Bad, Bim, Noxa and Puma. The repressor role of miR-20a and miR-29b is confirmed by the transfection of Neuro-2A cells with their inhibitor. Moreover, miR-20a mimic or miR-29b inhibitor attenuated Neuro-2A cell viability and co-transfection of both further diminished the viability of these cells. The in vitro effects of miR-20a and miR-29b on neuronal apoptosis were corroborated by the in vivo studies. Injection of miR-20a mimic or miR-29b inhibitor into the lesion of the injured spinal cord rescued the neuronal death and co-injection of both completely abolished SCI-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, altered expression of miR-20a and miR-29b may cooperatively contribute to the neuronal cell death of SCI through down-regulating anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (Mcl-1) and up-regulating pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins.",,"['Liu, Xue-Jun', 'Zheng, Xue-Ping', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Guo, Yun-Liang', 'Wang, Jian-Hong']","['Liu XJ', 'Zheng XP', 'Zhang R', 'Guo YL', 'Wang JH']","['Department of Radiology, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Neurologial Intensive Care Unit, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Institute of Integrative Medicine, Qingdao University Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Organ Transplantation Center, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Qingdao 266003, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150401,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,"['0 (MIRN29 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn20 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neurons/*metabolism/pathology', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC4466950,,2015/06/23 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2015/06/23 06:00'],"['2015/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2015 Apr 1;8(4):3811-8. eCollection 2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MicroRNAs', 'Neuronal apoptosis', 'myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1', 'spinal cord injury']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Afflicted individuals often have elongated features, marfanoid habitus, macroorchidism and intellectual impairment. Evolving literature suggests the condition may actually protect from malignancy while chromosomal instability would presumably elevate the risk. Increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation should also be predicted by unstable sites within the DNA. Interestingly, in this report, we detail a patient with FXS diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with induction followed by subsequent cycles of hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone) with a complete response who then was recommended to undergo peripheral stem cell transplantation.

However, its incorporation into clinical practice is not well-described. We studied the distribution of NHL subtypes in adults diagnosed from 1998 to 2011, evaluated time trends, geo-demographic correlates, and changes in 5-year overall survival (OS). We obtained data prospectively collected by the National Cancer Data Base, which covers 70% of US cancer cases. There were 596,476 patients diagnosed with NHL. The major subtypes were diffuse large B-cell (32.5%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL; 18.6%), follicular (17.1%), marginal zone (8.3%), mantle cell (4.1%), peripheral T-cell not-otherwise-specified (1.7%), Burkitt (1.6%), hairy cell (1.1%), lymphoplasmacytic (1.1%), and NHL not-otherwise-specified (10.8%). Over the study period, the proportion of NHL not-otherwise-specified declined by half, while marginal zone lymphoma doubled. The distribution of major and rare NHL subtypes varied according to demographics but less so geographically or by type of treatment facility. We noted several novel findings among Hispanics (lower proportion of CLL/SLL, but higher Burkitt lymphoma and nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma), Asians (higher enteropathy-associated T-cell and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas), Blacks (higher hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma), and Native Americans (similar proportions of CLL/SLL and nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma as Asians). With the exception of peripheral T-cell not-otherwise-specified and hairy cell leukemia, 5-year OS has improved for all the major NHL subtypes.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Al-Hamadani, Mohammed', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Macon, William R', 'Maurer, Matthew J', 'Go, Ronald S']","['Al-Hamadani M', 'Habermann TM', 'Cerhan JR', 'Macon WR', 'Maurer MJ', 'Go RS']","['Department of Medical Research, Gundersen Medical Foundation, La Crosse, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E.

The mechanisms underpinning apoptosis activation following HSP90 inhibition and how they are modified during acquired drug resistance are unknown. We show for the first time that, to induce apoptosis, HSP90 inhibition requires the cooperation of multi BH3-only proteins (BID, BIK, PUMA) and the reciprocal suppression of the pro-survival BCL-2 family member MCL1, which occurs via inhibition of STAT5A. A subset of tumour cell lines exhibit dependence on MCL1 expression for survival and this dependence is also associated with tumour response to HSP90 inhibition. In the acquired resistance setting, MCL1 suppression in response to HSP90 inhibitors is maintained; however, a switch in MCL1 dependence occurs.

B-1 cell responses to B cell receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptor ligation are tightly regulated owing to the cross-reactivity to self-antigens. CD5 has been shown to play a major role in downregulation of BCR responses in B-1 cells. Here, we provide evidence for another mechanism by which BCR response is regulated in B-1 cells. B-1 cells, as well as their malignant counterpart, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells, produce interleukin-10 (IL-10) constitutively. IL-10 secretion by normal B-1 cells downregulates their proliferation responses to BCR ligation. However, we found that CLL cells appear to be unique in not responding to IL-10-mediated feedback-suppressive effects in comparison to normal B-1 cells. In addition, we describe a novel role of the BCR signaling pathway in constitutive IL-10 secretion by normal and malignant B-1 cells. We found that inhibition of Src family kinases, spleen tyrosine kinase, Syk, or Bruton's tyrosine kinase reduces constitutive IL-10 production by both normal and malignant B-1 cells.",['(c) 2015 New York Academy of Sciences.'],"['Alhakeem, Sara S', 'Sindhava, Vishal J', 'McKenna, Mary K', 'Gachuki, Beth W', 'Byrd, John C', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Bondada, Subbarao']","['Alhakeem SS', 'Sindhava VJ', 'McKenna MK', 'Gachuki BW', 'Byrd JC', 'Muthusamy N', 'Bondada S']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA165469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA165990/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150611,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (IL10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Interleukin-10/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",PMC4676736,['NIHMS686314'],2015/06/23 06:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2015/06/23 06:00'],"['2015/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/nyas.12802 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2015 Dec;1362:239-249. doi: 10.1111/nyas.12802.

We previously found that the enriched expression of Bcl11b was detected in high tumorigenic C6 glioma cells. However, the role of Bcl11b in glioma malignancy and its mechanisms remains to be uncovered. In this study, using the lentivirus-mediated knockdown (KD) approach, we found that Bcl11b KD in tumorigenic C6 cells reduced the cell proliferation, colony formation, and migratory ability. The results were further verified using two human malignant glioma cell lines, U87 and U251 cells. A cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a known Bcl11b target, was significantly upregulated in tumorigenic C6, U87, and U251 cells after Bcl11b KD. Cellular senescence was observed by examination of the beta-galactosidase activity in U87 and U251 cells with Bcl11b KD. Reduced expression of stemness gene Sox-2 and its downstream effector Bmi-1 was also observed in U87 and U251 cells with Bcl11b KD. These results suggest that the ablation of Bcl11b gene expression induced glioma cell senescence. Propidium iodide (PI) staining combined with flow cytometry analysis also showed that Bcl11b KD led to the cell cycle arrest of U87 and U251 cells at the G0/G1 or at the S phase, indicating that Bcl11b is required for glioma cell cycle progression. Together, this is the first study to show that the inhibition of Bcl11b suppresses glioma cell growth by regulating the expression of the cell cycle regulator p21 and stemness-associated genes (Sox-2/Bmi-1).",,"['Liao, Chih-Kai', 'Fang, Kuan-Min', 'Chai, Kitman', 'Wu, Chin-Hsien', 'Ho, Chia-Hsin', 'Yang, Chung-Shi', 'Tzeng, Shun-Fen']","['Liao CK', 'Fang KM', 'Chai K', 'Wu CH', 'Ho CH', 'Yang CS', 'Tzeng SF']","['Department of Life Sciences, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Sciences, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Sciences, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Sciences, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Sciences, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Nanomedicine, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Miaoli County, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Sciences, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. stzeng@mail.ncku.edu.tw.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150623,United States,Mol Neurobiol,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,"['0 (BCL11B protein, human)', '0 (BCL11B protein, rat)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glioma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,,2015/06/23 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2015/06/23 06:00'],"['2015/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12035-015-9231-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12035-015-9231-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Neurobiol. 2016 Aug;53(6):3528-3539. doi: 10.1007/s12035-015-9231-1.

METHODS: Human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells were cultured and treated with saponin to selectively alter cell membrane permeability, resulting in a broad physiologically relevant range of 0.011-0.044 mum/ms. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were acquired with the effective diffusion time (Deltaeff ) ranging from 0.42 to 3000 ms. Cosine-modulated oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) measurements were performed to achieve short Deltaeff from 0.42 to 5 ms, while stimulated echo acquisitions were used to achieve long Deltaeff from 11 to 2999 ms. Computer simulations were also performed to support the experimental results. RESULTS: Both computer simulations and experiments in vitro showed that the influence of membrane permeability on diffusion MR measurements is highly dependent on the choice of diffusion time, and it is negligible only when the diffusion time is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the intracellular exchange lifetime. CONCLUSION: The influence of cell membrane permeability on the measured ADCs is negligible in OGSE measurements at moderately high frequencies. By contrast, cell membrane permeability has a significant influence on ADC and quantitative diffusion measurements at low frequencies such as those sampled using conventional pulsed gradient methods.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Li, Hua', 'Jiang, Xiaoyu', 'Xie, Jingping', 'McIntyre, J Oliver', 'Gore, John C', 'Xu, Junzhong']","['Li H', 'Jiang X', 'Xie J', 'McIntyre JO', 'Gore JC', 'Xu J']","['Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA128323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K25-CA168936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K25 CA168936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA109106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA173593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-CA128323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD019993/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150611,United States,Magn Reson Med,Magnetic resonance in medicine,8505245,"['0 (Saponins)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)']",IM,"['Algorithms', '*Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Computer Simulation', '*Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'K562 Cells', 'Linear Models', 'Oscillometry', 'Permeability', 'Saponins/chemistry', 'Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Water/chemistry']",PMC4676747,['NIHMS679126'],2015/06/23 06:00,2017/01/19 06:00,['2015/06/23 06:00'],"['2015/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mrm.25724 [doi]'],ppublish,Magn Reson Med. 2016 May;75(5):1927-34. doi: 10.1002/mrm.25724.

During T lymphocyte activation as well as production of cytokines, sustained Ca(2+) influx is essential, however, it remains unclear how this influx is regulated. Previously, we reported the expression and functional activity of calcium channels TRPV5 and TRPV6 (transient receptor potential vanilloid type 5 and 6) in human leukemia Jurkat T cells. In this study, using single channel recordings, we found that activity of calcium channels TRPV5/V6 in Jurkat T cells is subject to strong control of external stimuli such as a low- or high-pH stressor. We showed that extracellular acidic pH reduces the activity of TRPV5/V6 channels, whereas alkaline pH increases the activity of TRPV5/V6 channels in Jurkat T cells. Using calcium imaging, we found that Ca(2+) influx in Jurkat T cells displayed sensitivity to extracellular pH, similar to that shown for the calcium channels TRPV5/V6. Double immunostaining of Jurkat T cells revealed that TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels colocalize with clathrin and the early endocytosis marker, EEA1. Moreover, we demonstrated that a specific inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, dynasore, blocked TRPV5/V6 activity, and Ca(2+) influx into Jurkat T cells. Overall, our findings indicate that strong environmental cues may affect the intracellular calcium level in Jurkat T cells by influencing the traffic of TRPV5/V6 channels in lymphocytes.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Tomilin, Victor N', 'Cherezova, Alena L', 'Negulyaev, Yuri A', 'Semenova, Svetlana B']","['Tomilin VN', 'Cherezova AL', 'Negulyaev YA', 'Semenova SB']","['Institute of Cytology RAS, 194064 Tikhoretsky Ave. 4, St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology RAS, 194064 Tikhoretsky Ave. 4, St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology RAS, 194064 Tikhoretsky Ave. 4, St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Department of Medical Physics Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, 29, Polytechnicheskaya st., 195251, St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology RAS, 194064 Tikhoretsky Ave. 4, St. Petersburg, Russia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPV5 protein, human)', '0 (TRPV6 channel)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Electrophysiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Jurkat Cells/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'TRPV Cation Channels/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2015/06/23 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/06/23 06:00'],"['2015/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.25264 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2016 Jan;117(1):197-206. doi: 10.1002/jcb.25264.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ca2+ INFLUX', 'JURKAT T CELLS', 'PATCH-CLAMP', 'TRPV6', 'TRV5', 'pH']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that Smac mimetic BV6 dose-dependently induces cell death in 28 of 51 (54%) investigated CLL samples, while B-cells from healthy donors are largely unaffected. Importantly, BV6 is significantly more effective in prognostic unfavorable cases with, e.g., non-mutated VH status and TP53 mutation than samples with unknown or favorable prognosis. The majority of cases with 17p deletion (10/12) and Fludarabine refractory cases respond to BV6, indicating that BV6 acts independently of p53. BV6 also triggers cell death under survival conditions mimicking the microenvironment, e.g., by adding CD40 ligand or conditioned medium. Gene expression profiling identifies cell death, NF-kappaB and redox signaling among the top pathways regulated by BV6 not only in CLL but also in core-binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Consistently, BV6 stimulates production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are contributing to BV6-induced cell death, since antioxidants reduce cell death. While BV6 causes degradation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP)1 and cIAP2 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway activation in primary CLL samples, BV6 induces cell death independently of caspase activity, receptor-interacting protein (RIP)1 activity or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, as zVAD.fmk, necrostatin-1 or TNFalpha-blocking antibody Enbrel fail to inhibit cell death. Together, these novel insights into BV6-regulated cell death in CLL have important implications for developing new therapeutic strategies to overcome cell death resistance especially in poor prognostic CLL subgroups.",['(c) 2015 UICC.'],"['Opel, Daniela', 'Schnaiter, Andrea', 'Dodier, Dagmar', 'Jovanovic, Marjana', 'Gerhardinger, Andreas', 'Idler, Irina', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Opel D', 'Schnaiter A', 'Dodier D', 'Jovanovic M', 'Gerhardinger A', 'Idler I', 'Mertens D', 'Bullinger L', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Fulda S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, , Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150731,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BV6 peptide)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TNF protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Proteolysis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,,2015/06/23 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/06/23 06:00'],"['2014/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29650 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Dec 15;137(12):2959-70. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29650.

In mature B-cell lymphoma, the B-NHL03 study indicated that the 4 year EFS according to treatment group was 94% for group 1, 98% for group 2, 84% for group 3, and 78% for group 4. Moreover, the 2 year EFS rate was 81% in Japanese advanced stage patients based on the international ALCL99 study. Thus, EFS >80% was achieved in any subtype of pediatric lymphoma. With regard to refractory or recurrent lymphoma, however, treatment methods for improvement of the survival rate in these patients still need to be developed. Also the difference between child, and adolescent and young adult patients still needs to be clarified, and treatment protocols developed. Although lymphoma treatment does not greatly change according to country, it does differ between other countries and Japan for some subtypes of lymphoma.

Several lines of evidence, including the graft versus leukemia effect associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), suggest that immunotherapy is an active modality in AML. Given the lack of progress for chemotherapy in this disease, many novel immunologic treatment approaches have been explored. The goals of non-transplant-based immune approaches have largely consisted of the stimulation or restoration of endogenous immune responses or the targeting of specific tumor antigens by immune cells. These strategies have been associated with less toxicity than allogeneic HSCT but typically have inferior efficacy. Allogeneic HSCT exploits major and minor histocompatibility differences between the donor and recipient in order to recognize and eradicate malignancy.

Gab2, a key member of the Gab family of proteins, is involved in the amplification and integration of signal transduction, evoked by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines and antigen receptors. Gab2 protein lacks intrinsic catalytic activity; however, when phosphorylated by proteintyrosine kinases (PTKs), Gab2 recruits several Src homology2 (SH2) domaincontaining proteins, including the SH2containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide3 kinase (PI3K), phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma)1, Crk, and GCGAP. Through these interactions, the Gab2 protein triggers various downstream signal effectors, including SHP2/rat sarcoma viral oncogene/RAF/mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signalregulated kinase and PI3K/AKT, involved in cell growth, differentiation, migration and apoptosis.

Heterozygous mutations of ASXL1 that result in premature truncations are frequent in myeloid leukemias and Bohring-Opitz syndrome. Here we demonstrate that ASXL1 truncations confer enhanced activity on the ASXL1-BAP1 complex. Stable expression of truncated, hyperactive ASXL1-BAP1 complexes in a haematopoietic precursor cell line results in global erasure of H2AK119Ub, striking depletion of H3K27me3, selective upregulation of a subset of genes whose promoters are marked by both H2AK119Ub and H3K4me3, and spontaneous differentiation to the mast cell lineage. These outcomes require the catalytic activity of BAP1, indicating that they are downstream consequences of H2AK119Ub erasure.

To characterize the spectrum of toxicity of repeated doses of polyethylene glycolated-asparaginase (PEG-asp) in adults, we reviewed all doses (2000 IU/m(2) ) administered as part of a pediatric-inspired regimen in adult ALL at our center. Subjects aged 18-60 yr with ALL (n = 152, 69.1% male) contributed 522 dose cycles to the study. Hepatotoxicity was the most common adverse event: grades 3-4 transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 53.9% and 23.7% of subjects, respectively. Hepatotoxicity was reversible; no cases of fulminate hepatic failure were observed. Other toxicities affecting at least 5% of subjects were grades 3-4 triglyceridemia in 50.9%, hypofibrinogenemia (<100 mg/dL) in 47.9%, clinical pancreatitis in 12.6%, venous thromboembolism in 11.2%, allergic reaction in 7.2%, and any grade bleeding in 5.3%. PEG-asp was always discontinued after grades 3-4 pancreatitis or allergic reaction. Otherwise, toxicities did not preclude administration of additional cycles of the drug. Our results suggest that repeated PEG-asp dosing is safe in adults aged 18-60 yr, even after occurrence of a drug-related toxicity.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts.

However, the evidence base relevant to application of both standard and self-generation forms of errorless learning in children is far weaker. We address this limitation in the present study to examine recall performance in children with brain injury (n = 16) who were taught novel age-appropriate science and social science facts through the medium of Skype. All participants were taught these facts under conditions of standard errorless learning, errorless learning with self-generation, and trial-and-error learning after which memory was tested at 5-minute, 30-minute, 1-hour and 24-hour delays. Analysis revealed no main effect of time, with participants retaining most information acquired over the 24-hour testing period, but a significant effect of condition. Notably, self-generation proved more effective than both standard errorless and trial-and-error learning. Further analysis of the data revealed that severity of attentional impairment was less detrimental to recall performance under errorless conditions. This study extends the literature to provide further evidence of the value of errorless learning methods in children with ABI and the first demonstration of the effectiveness of self-generation when delivered via the Internet.",,"['Haslam, Catherine', 'Wagner, Joseph', 'Wegener, Signy', 'Malouf, Tania']","['Haslam C', 'Wagner J', 'Wegener S', 'Malouf T']","['a School of Psychology , University of Queensland , St Lucia , Queensland , Australia.', 'a School of Psychology , University of Queensland , St Lucia , Queensland , Australia.', ""b Queensland Paediatric Rehabilitation Service, Royal Children's Hospital , Brisbane , Australia."", ""b Queensland Paediatric Rehabilitation Service, Royal Children's Hospital , Brisbane , Australia.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150622,England,Neuropsychol Rehabil,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,9112672,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Injuries/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Brain Injuries, Traumatic/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Brain Neoplasms/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Cerebral Infarction/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Child', 'Encephalitis/psychology/rehabilitation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocephalus/psychology/rehabilitation', '*Learning', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Mental Recall', '*Neurological Rehabilitation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology/rehabilitation', '*Telecommunications']",,,2016/10/25 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2015/06/23 06:00'],"['2016/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2015/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09602011.2015.1053947 [doi]'],ppublish,Neuropsychol Rehabil. 2017 Jan;27(1):60-79. doi: 10.1080/09602011.2015.1053947.

DESIGN: Prospective experimental study. SETTING: Gynecology research unit in a university hospital. PATIENT(S): Ten women undergoing laparoscopy for benign gynecologic disease. INTERVENTION(S): Follicle isolation from ovarian tissue artificially contaminated with marked fluorescent leukemic cells, either by the usual pickup technique without further treatment (group 1) or by washing three times after pickup (group 2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Evidence of leukemic cells in follicle suspensions using fluorescence microscopy and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and analysis of follicle viability. RESULT(S): In group 1, 196 leukemic cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy out of 499 follicles retrieved, while just one leukemic cell was found among 772 follicles after three washes. The BCR-ABL fusion transcript was detected when at least 19 cells were present in follicle suspensions; four samples were positive in group 1, and all were negative in group 2. Follicle viability was similar in both groups (95.6% vs. 96.4%). CONCLUSION(S): Cancer cells could inadvertently be picked up with isolated follicles in case of malignant contamination of ovarian tissue. A simple purging procedure consisting of three washes proved effective for eliminating leukemic cells while maintaining good follicle viability.","['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

FINDINGS: Thirty patients received escalating doses of GRASPA(R) on Day 3 and 6 of induction Phases 1 and 2. The primary efficacy endpoint was asparagine depletion < 2 micromol/L for at least 7 days. This was reached in 85 and 71% of patients with 100 and 150 IU/kg respectively but not with 50 IU/kg. Grade 3/4 infection, hypertransaminasemia, hyperbilirubinemia and deep vein thrombosis occurred in 77, 20, 7, and 7% of patients, respectively. No allergic reaction or clinical pancreatitis was observed despite 17% of Grade 3/4 lipase elevation. Anti-asparaginase antibodies were detected in 50% of patients and related to a reduction in the duration of asparagine depletion during induction Phase 2 without decrease of encapsulated L-asparaginase activity. Complete remission rate was 70%. With a median follow-up of 42 months, median overall survival was 15.8 and 9.7 months, in the 100 and 150 IU/kg cohorts respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of GRASPA(R), especially at the 100 IU/kg dose level, is feasible in elderly patients without excessive toxicity and associated with durable asparagine depletion.

Here, the rFVIIIFc manufacturing process and results of studies evaluating product quality and the capacity of the process to remove potential impurities and viruses are described. This manufacturing process utilized readily transferable and scalable unit operations and employed multi-step purification and viral clearance processing, including a novel affinity chromatography adsorbent and a 15 nm pore size virus removal nanofilter. A cell line derived from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293H cells was used to produce rFVIIIFc. Validation studies evaluated identity, purity, activity, and safety. Process-related impurity clearance and viral clearance spiking studies demonstrate robust and reproducible removal of impurities and viruses, with total viral clearance >8-15 log10 for four model viruses (xenotropic murine leukemia virus, mice minute virus, reovirus type 3, and suid herpes virus 1). Terminal galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose and N-glycolylneuraminic acid, two non-human glycans, were undetectable in rFVIIIFc. Biochemical and in vitro biological analyses confirmed the purity, activity, and consistency of rFVIIIFc. In conclusion, this manufacturing process produces a highly pure product free of viruses, impurities, and non-human glycan structures, with scale capabilities to ensure a consistent and adequate supply of rFVIIIFc.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Biogen.

Both genes are hemizygous in Jacobsen syndrome, an 11q contiguous gene deletion disorder involving thrombocytopenia, facial dysmorphism, growth and mental retardation, malformation of the heart and other organs, and hearing impairment associated with recurrent ear infections. To determine whether any of these defects are because of hemizygosity for ETS1 and FLI1, we characterized the phenotype of mice heterozygous for mutant alleles of Ets1 and Fli1. Fli1(+/-) mice displayed mild thrombocytopenia, as did Ets1(+/-)Fli1(+/-) animals. Fli1(+/-) and Ets1(+/-)Fli1(+/-) mice also displayed craniofacial abnormalities, including a small middle ear cavity, short nasal bone, and malformed interface between the nasal bone process and cartilaginous nasal septum. They exhibited hearing impairment, otitis media, fusions of ossicles to the middle ear wall, and deformed stapes. Hearing impairment was more penetrant and stapes malformations were more severe in Ets1(+/-)Fli1(+/-) mice than in Fli1(+/-) mice, indicating partial functional redundancy of these transcription factors during auditory development. Our findings indicate that the short nose, otitis media, and hearing impairment in Jacobsen syndrome are likely because of hemizygosity for ETS1 and FLI1.","['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

We have identified cytokine, signaling, and transcription factors that are required for cachexia in the mouse C26 colon carcinoma model of cancer. C2C12 myotubes treated with conditioned medium from C26 cancer cells induced atrophy and activated a STAT-dependent reporter gene but not reporter genes dependent on SMAD, FOXO, C/EBP, NF-kappaB, or AP-1. Of the gp130 family members IL-11, IL-6, oncostatin M (OSM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), only OSM and LIF were sufficient to activate the STAT reporter in myotubes. LIF was elevated in C26 conditioned medium (CM), but IL-6, OSM, TNFalpha, and myostatin were not. A LIF-blocking antibody abolished C26 CM-induced STAT reporter activation, STAT3 phosphorylation, and myotube atrophy but blocking antibodies to IL-6 or OSM did not. JAK2 inhibitors also blocked C26 CM-induced STAT reporter activation, STAT3 phosphorylation, and atrophy in myotubes. LIF at levels found in the C26 CM was sufficient for STAT reporter activation and atrophy in myotubes. In vivo, an increase in serum LIF preceded the increase in IL-6 in mice with C26 tumors. Overexpression of a dominant negative Stat3Cbeta-EGFP gene in myotubes and in mouse muscle blocked the atrophy caused by C26 CM or C26 tumors, respectively. Taken together, these data support an important role of LIF-JAK2-STAT3 in C26 cachexia and point to a therapeutic approach for at least some types of cancer cachexia.","['(c) 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Seto, Danielle N', 'Kandarian, Susan C', 'Jackman, Robert W']","['Seto DN', 'Kandarian SC', 'Jackman RW']","['From the Department of Health Sciences, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215.', 'From the Department of Health Sciences, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215.', 'From the Department of Health Sciences, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts 02215 rjackman@bu.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 AR060217/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000157/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1-TR000157/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150619,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/pharmacology', 'Cachexia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Size', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncostatin M/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4528156,,2015/06/21 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/06/21 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)42251-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.638411 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Aug 7;290(32):19976-86. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.638411.

The results showed that both of them were downregulated in AML cells. In vitro, induced activation of HES1 by retrovirus in AML cell lines consistently led to AML cell growth arrest and apoptosis induction, which was associated with enhanced p21 expression.

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on patients undergoing robotic pulmonary resections from October 2011 to December 2014. The operating time, including the docking and console times, postoperative hospitalization, and peri- and postoperative complications were studied. RESULTS: Hundred patients underwent 102 robotic anatomic pulmonary resections due to various pathologies. Fifty-three percent of the patients underwent lobectomy procedure, whereas 45% underwent segmentectomy. The mean operating time was 104 +/- 34 min. The learning curve was calculated to be 14 patients (R(2) = 0.57). The complication rate in our series was 24% (n = 24) and higher in elderly patients (p = 0.03) and in patients with longer operating times (p = 0.03). Prolonged air leaks were observed in 10, and arrhythmia developed in nine patients. Two patients died, due to a concurrent lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed at the postoperative period and exacerbation of interstitial fibrosis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic pulmonary resections prove to be safe and effective even at the initial learning experience. The duration of operations is considered to be acceptable.

However, this hypothesis is largely supported by indirect evidence and fails to explain the large differences in relapse rates across AML subtypes. To address this, bone marrow aspirates from 41 AML patients and five healthy donors were analyzed by high-dimensional mass cytometry. All patients displayed immunophenotypic and intracellular signaling abnormalities within CD34(+)CD38(lo) populations, and several karyotype- and genotype-specific surface marker patterns were identified. The immunophenotypic stem and early progenitor cell populations from patients with clinically favorable core-binding factor AML demonstrated a 5-fold higher fraction of cells in S-phase compared with other AML samples. Conversely, LSCs in less clinically favorable FLT3-ITD AML exhibited dramatic reductions in S-phase fraction. Mass cytometry also allowed direct observation of the in vivo effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanisms underlying differences in relapse rates across AML subtypes are poorly understood. This study suggests that known chemotherapy sensitivities of common AML subsets are mediated by cell-cycle differences among LSCs and provides a basis for using in vivo functional characterization of AML cells to inform therapy selection.",['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Behbehani, Gregory K', 'Samusik, Nikolay', 'Bjornson, Zach B', 'Fantl, Wendy J', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Nolan, Garry P']","['Behbehani GK', 'Samusik N', 'Bjornson ZB', 'Fantl WJ', 'Medeiros BC', 'Nolan GP']","['Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.

Although much is known about the anti-apoptotic ability of Bcl-2, little information is available concerning its function in other cellular processes, such as cell differentiation. METHODS: In this study, stable cell lines from pre-malignant MCF10ATG3B mammary epithelial cells, a cell line derived from a human proliferative breast disease model, to express exogenous Bcl-2 was established. CMV promoter driven Bcl-2 expression vector or empty vector was transfected into MCF10ATG3B human mammary epithelial cells to investigate the effects of Bcl-2 on mammary epithelial cells. In addition, western blot and immunofluoresence staining were employed to testify the marker proteins of both mesenchymal and epithelial cells. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, a dramatic change of phenotype from epithelial cells to fibroblast-like cells was observed in Bcl-2-transfected cells. Western blot analysis and immunofluoresence staining results demonstrated that the E-cadherin and desmoplakin, markers of epithelial cells, were downregulated in the Bcl-2-transfected cells. However, N-cadherin and vimentin, markers of mesenchymal cells, were upregulated in these cells. Redistributions of cytokeratin and beta-catenin were also observed in the Bcl-2-transfected cells. Our results further showed that the Bcl-2-transfected MCF10ATG3B cells retained some epithelial markers, such as epithelial specific antigen (ESA) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), indicating their epithelial origin. In addition, cell migration and invasion was substantially increased in Bcl-2 transfected cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results strongly indicate that in addition to its anti-apoptotic function, Bcl-2 is also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a fundamental mechanism in normal morphogenesis and pathogenesis of some diseases.",,"['An, Juan', 'Lv, Jin', 'Li, Aimin', 'Qiao, Junxiao', 'Fang, Liang', 'Li, Zhihua', 'Li, Bo', 'Zhao, Wei', 'Chen, Huoming', 'Wang, Liying']","['An J', 'Lv J', 'Li A', 'Qiao J', 'Fang L', 'Li Z', 'Li B', 'Zhao W', 'Chen H', 'Wang L']","['The Second Artillery General Hospital, PLA, Beijing, 100088, China. angel0311@163.com.', 'The Second Artillery General Hospital, PLA, Beijing, 100088, China. lvjin6630@hotmail.com.', 'The Second Artillery General Hospital, PLA, Beijing, 100088, China. liaimin53@sina.com.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, The Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing, 100088, China. liaimin53@sina.com.', 'The Second Artillery General Hospital, PLA, Beijing, 100088, China. qjxiao@126.com.', 'The Second Artillery General Hospital, PLA, Beijing, 100088, China. 49452525@qq.com.', 'The Second Artillery General Hospital, PLA, Beijing, 100088, China. 39456001@qq.com.', 'The Second Artillery General Hospital, PLA, Beijing, 100088, China.

Blockade of the PD-1 pathway through the use of PD-1 or PD ligand 1(PD-L1) antibodies releases this brake on the immune response. The anti-PD-1 antibodies have produced encouraging results across a broad range of malignancies. Many hematologic malignancies have usurped the PD-1 pathway. Recent investigations have explored the use of anti-PD-1 therapy in hematologic malignancies, with encouraging results.

The identification of new molecular targets for ATL prevention and treatment is desired. SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(+) -dependent histone/protein deacetylase, plays crucial roles in various physiological processes, including aging and apoptosis. We previously reported that ATL patients had significantly higher SIRT1 protein levels than healthy controls. Here, we demonstrate that two novel small-molecule SIRT1 inhibitors, NCO-01/04, reduced cell viability and enhanced apoptotic cells in peripheral blood monocyte cells of patients with acute ATL, which has a poor prognosis. NCO-01/04 also reduced the cell viability with DNA fragmentation, Annexin V-positive cells, and caspase activation. However, a caspase inhibitor did not inhibit this caspase-dependent cell death. NCO-01/04 enhanced the endonuclease G level in the nucleus with loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, which can promote caspase-independent death. Interestingly, NCO-01/04 increased the LC3-II-enriched protein fraction, indicating autophagosome accumulation as well as autophagy. Thus, NCO-01/04 simultaneously caused caspase activation and autophagy. These results suggest that NCO-01/04 is highly effective against ATL cells in caspase-dependent or -independent manners with autophagy, and that its clinical application might improve the prognosis of patients with this fatal disease.",,"['Kozako, Tomohiro', 'Suzuki, Takayoshi', 'Yoshimitsu, Makoto', 'Uchida, Yuichiro', 'Kuroki, Ayako', 'Aikawa, Akiyoshi', 'Honda, Shin-ichiro', 'Arima, Naomichi', 'Soeda, Shinji']","['Kozako T', 'Suzuki T', 'Yoshimitsu M', 'Uchida Y', 'Kuroki A', 'Aikawa A', 'Honda S', 'Arima N', 'Soeda S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology and Immunology, Kagoshima University Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan [2] Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology and Immunology, Kagoshima University Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan [2] Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150619,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sirtuin 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4473680,,2015/06/20 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['srep11345 [pii]', '10.1038/srep11345 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Jun 19;5:11345. doi: 10.1038/srep11345.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NPM mutations are characteristic of a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where mutant NPM seems to play an oncogenic role. AML-associated NPM mutants exhibit altered subcellular traffic, being aberrantly located in the cytoplasm of leukoblasts. Exacerbated export of AML variants of NPM is mediated by the nuclear export receptor CRM1, and due, in part, to a mutationally acquired novel nuclear export signal (NES). To gain insight on the molecular basis of NPM transport in physiological and pathological conditions, we have evaluated the export efficiency of NPM in cells, and present new data indicating that, in normal conditions, wild type NPM is weakly exported by CRM1. On the other hand, we have found that AML-associated NPM mutants efficiently form complexes with CRM1HA (a mutant CRM1 with higher affinity for NESs), and we have quantitatively analyzed CRM1HA interaction with the NES motifs of these mutants, using fluorescence anisotropy and isothermal titration calorimetry. We have observed that the affinity of CRM1HA for these NESs is similar, which may help to explain the transport properties of the mutants. We also describe NPM recognition by the import machinery.

There are four major WT1 isoforms resulting from alternative splicing at two sites, exon 5 (17AA) and exon 9 (KTS). All major WT1 isoforms are overexpressed in leukemia and solid tumors and play oncogenic roles such as inhibition of apoptosis, and promotion of cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In the present study, a novel alternatively spliced WT1 isoform that had an extended exon 4 (designated as exon 4a) with an additional 153 bp (designated as 4a sequence) at the 3' end was identified and designated as an Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform. The insertion of exon 4a resulted in the introduction of premature translational stop codons in the reading frame in exon 4a and production of C-terminal truncated WT1 proteins lacking zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Overexpression of the truncated Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform inhibited the major WT1-mediated transcriptional activation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL gene promoter and induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Conversely, suppression of the Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform by Ex4a-specific siRNA attenuated apoptosis. These results indicated that the Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform exerted dominant negative effects on anti-apoptotic function of major WT1 isoforms. Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform was endogenously expressed as a minor isoform in myeloid leukemia and solid tumor cells and increased regardless of decrease in major WT1 isoforms during apoptosis, suggesting the dominant negative effects on anti-apoptotic function of major WT1 isoforms. These results indicated that Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform had an important physiological function that regulated oncogenic function of major WT1 isoforms.",,"['Tatsumi, Naoya', 'Hojo, Nozomi', 'Sakamoto, Hiroyuki', 'Inaba, Rena', 'Moriguchi, Nahoko', 'Matsuno, Keiko', 'Fukuda, Mari', 'Matsumura, Akihide', 'Hayashi, Seiji', 'Morimoto, Soyoko', 'Nakata, Jun', 'Fujiki, Fumihiro', 'Nishida, Sumiyuki', 'Nakajima, Hiroko', 'Tsuboi, Akihiro', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Sugiyama, Haruo', 'Oji, Yusuke']","['Tatsumi N', 'Hojo N', 'Sakamoto H', 'Inaba R', 'Moriguchi N', 'Matsuno K', 'Fukuda M', 'Matsumura A', 'Hayashi S', 'Morimoto S', 'Nakata J', 'Fujiki F', 'Nishida S', 'Nakajima H', 'Tsuboi A', 'Oka Y', 'Hosen N', 'Sugiyama H', 'Oji Y']","['Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, National Hospital Organization, Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center, Osaka, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization, Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunotherapy, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Disease, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunotherapy, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Functional Diagnostic Science, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Stem Cell Biology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150619,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Exons', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Isoforms/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'WT1 Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4474557,,2015/06/20 06:00,2016/05/05 06:00,['2015/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0130578 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-35855 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jun 19;10(6):e0130578. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0130578. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The levels of Bax expression and released cytochrome C were also increased after treatment with ESM. Furthermore, during the ESM mediated-apoptosis, phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and p38 but not JNK were increased and cell viabilities of the co-treated cells with ESM and inhibitors of ERK 1/2 or p38 were also increased. In addition, treatment with lactose rescued the ESM-mediated decrease in cell viability, indicating lactose-containing glycans in the leukemia cells acted as a counterpart of the ESM for interaction.

Initially proposed to be a cancer-restricting process for tumor initiation, recent studies suggest that autophagy can also promote cell survival in established tumors. ATG7 is an essential autophagy gene that encodes the E1 enzyme necessary for the lipidation of the LC3 family of ubiquitin-like proteins and autophagosome formation. In this study we identified a rare case of a cancer cell line, H1650 lung adenocarcinoma, which has lost ATG7 expression due to a focal biallelic deletion within the ATG7 locus. These cells displayed no evidence of ATG7 pathway activity; however, reconstituting the cells with wild-type ATG7 restored both LC3 lipidation and downstream autophagic consumption of autophagy substrates such as the SQSTM1/p62 protein. We characterized several phenotypes reported to be influenced by autophagy, and observed an ATG7-dependent increase in cell growth and clearance of proteasome-inhibitor induced protein aggregates. Cellular changes in mitochondrial metabolism or response to nutrient starvation were unaffected by ATG7 expression. In addition, parental H1650 cells that lacked ATG7 were still able to consume autophagy substrates SQSTM1, NBR1 and TAX1BP1 via a bafilomycin A1-sensitive pathway, suggesting that these proteins were not exclusively degraded by autophagy. Overall, these findings highlight a unique outlier instance of complete loss of ATG7-dependent autophagy in a cancer cell line.

To investigate the association between the maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and early age leukemia (EAL) in offspring. Methods. Datasets were analyzed from a case-control study carried out in Brazil during 1999-2007. Data were obtained by maternal interviews using a standardized questionnaire. The present study included 675 children (193 acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), 59 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 423 controls). Unconditional logistic regression was performed, and adjusted odds ratios (adj. OR) on the association between alcohol consumption and EAL were ascertained. Results. Alcohol consumption was reported by 43% of ALL and 39% of AML case mothers and 35.5% of controls'. Beer consumption before and during pregnancy was associated with ALL in crude analysis (OR = 1.54, 95% CI, 1.08-2.19), although in adjusted analysis no statistical significance was found. For weekly intake of </=1 glass (adj. OR = 1.30, 95% CI, 0.71-2.36) and >/=1 glass/week (adj. OR = 1.47, 95% CI, 0.88-2.46) a potential dose-response was observed (P trend < 0.03). Conclusion. This study failed to support the hypothesis of an increased risk of EAL associated with maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy, neither with the interaction with tobacco nor with alcohol consumption.",,"['Ferreira, Jeniffer Dantas', 'Couto, Arnaldo Cezar', 'Emerenciano, Mariana', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Koifman, Sergio']","['Ferreira JD', 'Couto AC', 'Emerenciano M', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Koifman S']","['Environment and Public Health Postgraduation Program, National School of Public Health, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Rua Leopoldo Bulhoes 1480, 21041-210 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'State University Center of the West Zone (UEZO), Rua Manuel Caldeira de Alvarenga 1203, 23070-200 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rua Andre Cavalcanti 37, 20231-050 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rua Andre Cavalcanti 37, 20231-050 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Environment and Public Health Postgraduation Program, National School of Public Health, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Rua Leopoldo Bulhoes 1480, 21041-210 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150518,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Brazil', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Mothers', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors']",PMC4450284,,2015/06/20 06:00,2016/03/11 06:00,['2015/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/732495 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:732495. doi: 10.1155/2015/732495.

The polymorphisms of some Ara-C metabolizing enzymes seem to affect outcome and toxicity in AML patients receiving cytarabine. We conducted this study in a cohort of Mexican pediatric patients with AML to investigate whether the polymorphisms of the deoxycytidine kinase and cytidine deaminase enzymes are implicated in clinical response and toxicity. Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples obtained at diagnosis from 27 previously untreated pediatric patients with de novo AML were processed for genotyping and in vitro chemosensitivity assay, and we analyzed the impact of genotypes and in vitro sensitivity on disease outcome and toxicity.

In this study, we selected an internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) for distinguishing these indirubin-containing species from five of their usual adulterants, after assessing identification efficiency of matK, rbcL, psbA-trnH, and ITS2 among these species. The results of genetic distances and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree indicated that ITS2 region is a powerful DNA barcode to accurately identify these indirubin-containing species and discriminate them from their adulterants. Additionally, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to verify indirubin in different organs of the above species. The results showed that indirubin had been detected in the leaves of Is. tinctoria, P. tinctorium, S. cusia, and Indigo Naturalis (made from their mixture), but not in their roots, or in the leaves of their adulterants.

However, the surrogacy of those endpoints for overall survival (os) is not validated in all cancer settings. In the present study, we used a trial-based approach to assess the relationship between median pfs or ttp and median os in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll). METHODS: The pico (population, interventions, comparators, outcomes) method was used to conduct a systematic review of the literature. The population consisted of patients with cll; the interventions and comparators were standard therapies for cll; and the outcomes were median pfs, ttp, and os. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full papers for eligibility and then extracted data from selected studies. Correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationship between median pfs or ttp and median os. Subgroup correlation analyses were also conducted according to the characteristics of the selected studies (such as line of treatment and type of treatment under investigation). RESULTS: Of the 1263 potentially relevant articles identified during the literature search, twenty-three were included. On average, median pfs or ttp was 16.0 months (standard deviation: 12.4 months) and median os was 43.5 months (standard deviation: 31.2 months). Results of the correlation analysis indicated that median pfs or ttp is highly correlated with median os (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.813; p </= 0.001). A significant correlation between median pfs or ttp and median os was observed in second- and subsequent-line therapies, but not in the first-line setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a strong correlation between median pfs or ttp and median os in previously treated cll, which reinforce the hypothesis that pfs and ttp could be adequate surrogate endpoints for os in this cancer setting.",,"['Beauchemin, C', 'Johnston, J B', 'Lapierre, M E', 'Aissa, F', 'Lachaine, J']","['Beauchemin C', 'Johnston JB', 'Lapierre ME', 'Aissa F', 'Lachaine J']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Montreal, QC;', 'Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, MB;', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Montreal, QC;', 'Lundbeck Canada, Montreal, QC.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Montreal, QC;']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,,,PMC4462536,,2015/06/20 06:00,2015/06/20 06:01,['2015/06/20 06:00'],"['2015/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.22.2119 [doi]', 'conc-22-e148 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2015 Jun;22(3):e148-56. doi: 10.3747/co.22.2119.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Progression-free survival', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'overall survival', 'surrogate endpoints']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore sought to investigate the in vivo effect of ibrutinib on migration and adhesion of CLL cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received single-agent ibrutinib (420 mg daily) on an investigator-initiated phase II trial. Serial blood samples were collected pretreatment and during treatment for ex vivo functional assays. RESULTS: Adhesion of CLL cells to fibronectin was rapidly (within hours) and almost completely inhibited (median reduction 98% on day 28, P < 0.001), while the effect on migration to chemokines was more moderate (median reduction 64%, P = 0.008) and less uniform. Although cell surface expression of key adhesion molecules such as CD49d, CD29, and CD44 were modestly reduced, this was only apparent after weeks of treatment. Stimulation of CLL cells from patients on ibrutinib with PMA, which activates PKC independent of BTK, restored the ability of the cells to adhere to fibronectin in a VLA-4-dependent manner. Finally, the addition of ibrutinib to CLL cells adhered to fibronectin in vitro caused the detachment of 17% of the cells, on average; consisten t with in vivo observations of an increasing lymphocytosis within 4 hours of starting ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of BTK and VLA-4-dependent adhesion of CLL cells to stroma and stromal components provides a mechanistic explanation for the treatment-induced lymphocytosis and may reduce CD49d-dependent prosurvival signals in the tissue microenvironment.",['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Herman, Sarah E M', 'Mustafa, Rashida Z', 'Jones, Jade', 'Wong, Deanna H', 'Farooqui, Mohammed', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Herman SE', 'Mustafa RZ', 'Jones J', 'Wong DH', 'Farooqui M', 'Wiestner A']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.

The introduction of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) raised a debate on treatment optimization. The debate is still heated: some studies have protocol restrictions or limited follow-up; in other studies, some relevant data are missing. The aim of this report is to provide a comprehensive, long-term, intention-to-treat, analysis of 559 newly diagnosed, chronic-phase, patients treated frontline with imatinib. With a minimum follow-up of 66 months, 65% of patients were still on imatinib, 19% were on alternative treatment, 12% died and 4% were lost to follow-up. The prognostic value of BCR-ABL1 ratio at 3 months (10% in 81% of patients) was confirmed. The prognostic value of complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response at 1 year was confirmed. The 6-year overall survival was 89%, but as 50% of deaths occurred in remission, the 6-year cumulative incidence of leukemia-related death was 5%. The long-term outcome of first-line imatinib was excellent, also because of second-line treatment with other TKIs, but all responses and outcomes were inferior in high-risk patients, suggesting that to optimize treatment results, a specific risk-adapted treatment is needed for such patients.",,"['Castagnetti, F', 'Gugliotta, G', 'Breccia, M', 'Stagno, F', 'Iurlo, A', 'Albano, F', 'Abruzzese, E', 'Martino, B', 'Levato, L', 'Intermesoli, T', 'Pregno, P', 'Rossi, G', 'Gherlinzoni, F', 'Leoni, P', 'Cavazzini, F', 'Venturi, C', 'Soverini, S', 'Testoni, N', 'Alimena, G', 'Cavo, M', 'Martinelli, G', 'Pane, F', 'Saglio, G', 'Rosti, G', 'Baccarani, M']","['Castagnetti F', 'Gugliotta G', 'Breccia M', 'Stagno F', 'Iurlo A', 'Albano F', 'Abruzzese E', 'Martino B', 'Levato L', 'Intermesoli T', 'Pregno P', 'Rossi G', 'Gherlinzoni F', 'Leoni P', 'Cavazzini F', 'Venturi C', 'Soverini S', 'Testoni N', 'Alimena G', 'Cavo M', 'Martinelli G', 'Pane F', 'Saglio G', 'Rosti G', 'Baccarani M']","[""Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology 'L and A Seragnoli', University of Bologna, 'S Orsola-Malpighi' University Hospital, Bologna, Italy."", ""Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology 'L and A Seragnoli', University of Bologna, 'S Orsola-Malpighi' University Hospital, Bologna, Italy."", ""Chair of Hematology, 'La Sapienza' University, Roma, Italy."", 'Chair of Hematology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', ""Oncohematology of the Elderly Unit, Oncohematology Division, IRCCS Ca' Granda -

Thirty-one patients were treated, with a median followup of 28 months (range, 12 - 35+). Due to failure to meet the predetermined efficacy rules for treatment success the study was terminated early. Simultaneous administration of ruxolitinib and lenalidomide was difficult: 20 of the 23 dose interruptions occurred within the first 3 months of therapy. Lenalidomide was interrupted in all 20 cases. Fourteen patients (45%) were completely off lenalidomide within 3 months of initiation. Responses were noted in 17 patients (55%). The median time to response was 1.8 months (range, 0.4 - 31).

PML/RARA is the primary abnormality implicated in this pathology, but the mechanisms by which this chimeric fusion protein initiates disease are incompletely understood. Identifying PML/RARA targets in vivo is critical for comprehending the road to pathogenesis. Utilizing a novel sorting strategy, we isolated highly purified promyelocyte populations from normal and young preleukemic animals, carried out microarray and methylation profiling analyses, and compared the results from the two groups of animals. Surprisingly, in the absence of secondary lesions, PML/RARA had an overall limited impact on both the transcriptome and methylome. Of interest, we did identify down-regulation of secondary and tertiary granule genes as the first step engaging the myeloid maturation block. Although initially not sufficient to arrest terminal granulopoiesis in vivo, such alterations set the stage for the later, complete differentiation block seen in leukemia. Further, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that PML/RARA promyelocytes exhibit a subtle increase in expression of cell cycle genes, and we show that this leads to both increased proliferation of these cells and expansion of the promyelocyte compartment. Importantly, this proliferation signature was absent from the poorly leukemogenic p50/RARA fusion model, implying a critical role for PML in the altered cell-cycle kinetics and ability to initiate leukemia. Thus, our findings challenge the predominant model in the field and we propose that PML/RARA initiates leukemia by subtly shifting cell fate decisions within the promyelocyte compartment.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Gaillard, Coline', 'Tokuyasu, Taku A', 'Rosen, Galit', 'Sotzen, Jason', 'Vitaliano-Prunier, Adeline', 'Roy, Ritu', 'Passegue, Emmanuelle', 'de The, Hugues', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Kogan, Scott C']","['Gaillard C', 'Tokuyasu TA', 'Rosen G', 'Sotzen J', 'Vitaliano-Prunier A', 'Roy R', 'Passegue E', 'de The H', 'Figueroa ME', 'Kogan SC']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris-Diderot UMR 944/7212, France."", 'Computational Biology Core, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Phoenix Children's Hospital, AZ, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', ""Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris-Diderot UMR 944/7212, France."", 'Computational Biology Core, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', ""Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris-Diderot UMR 944/7212, France."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA scott.Kogan@ucsf.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA095274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA95274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150618,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC5004423,,2015/06/20 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/06/20 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.123018 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.123018 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Aug;100(8):1064-75. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.123018.

This is a retrospective analysis of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis who underwent kidney biopsy for renal insufficiency and/or nephrotic syndrome. Between January 1995 and June 2014, 49 of 4,024 (1.2%) patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=44) or monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (n=5) had a renal biopsy: 34 (69%) for renal insufficiency and 15 (31%) for nephrotic syndrome. The most common findings on biopsy were: membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (n=10, 20%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia interstitial infiltration as primary etiology (n=6, 12%), thrombotic microangiopathy (n=6, 12%), and minimal change disease (n=5, 10%). All five membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis patients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide and prednisone-based regimens had recovery of renal function compared to 0/3 patients treated with rituximab with or without steroids. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia infiltration as the primary cause of renal abnormalities was typically observed in relapsed/refractory patients (4/6). Thrombotic microangiopathy primarily occurred as a treatment-related toxicity of pentostatin (4/6 cases), and resolved with drug discontinuation.

Methilthioadenosine phosphorylase(MTAP) is a tumor-suppressor gene, the loss of expression of which is associated with a poor prognosis and better response to specific chemotherapy in leukemia and non-small-cell lung cancer. The expression of MTAP in brain tumors remains largely unknown and its biological role in PA is still unexplored. Our aims were to describe the immunohistochemical MTAP expression in a series of PAs and relate it to the clinicopathological features of the patients. METHODS: We assessed MTAP expression on immunohistochemistry in 69 pediatric and adult patients with PA in a tissue microarray platform. RESULTS: Retained expression of MTAP was seen in >85% of the tumors compared to in the nonneoplastic adjacent tissue. Only 3 supratentorial tumors showed a complete loss of MTAP expression. No significant association with clinicopathological features or overall survival of the patients was found. CONCLUSIONS: MTAP expression is retained in PAs and is not an outcome predictor for these tumors.

METHODS: The cohort included 49 long-term male ALL survivors and 55 age-matched healthy controls. Fat and lean mass was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; blood biochemistry was obtained for adipokines and testicular endocrine markers. RESULTS: As compared with controls, the ALL survivors (median age 29 years, range 25-38), assessed 10-28 years after ALL diagnosis, had higher percentages of body (p < 0.05) and trunk fat mass (p < 0.05), and a lower body lean mass (p < 0.001). Survivors had significantly higher levels of leptin and adiponectin and lower levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3. Body fat mass and percent fat mass correlated with serum leptin and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Altogether, 15% of the ALL survivors and 9% of age-matched controls were obese (BMI >/= 30). Obese survivors more often had hypogonadism, had received testicular irradiation, and needed testosterone replacement therapy compared to nonobese survivors. CONCLUSION: At young adulthood, long-term male ALL survivors have significantly increased body adiposity despite normal weight and BMI. Potential indicators of increased adiposity included high leptin and low SHBG levels. Serum testicular endocrine markers did not correlate with body adiposity.","['(c) 2015 S.

Of the 3,654 cytogenetically informative cases diagnosed between January 1997 and May 2014, 68 (1.9%) were HH (n = 50)/TT (n = 18). Patients with HH/TT were older than those with intermediate risk (IR) AML (median 71 years vs. 67 years; P = 0.042) and less often had de novo AML (63% vs. 79%; P = 0.004); no such differences were observed between HH/TT and complex karyotype (CK) AML. The overall survival (OS) was similar between patients with HH/TT and CK AML (median 0.9 years vs. 0.6 years; P = 0.082), whereas OS was significantly longer (median 1.6 years; P = 0.028) for IR AML. The OS was shorter for cases with HH than with TT (median 0.6 years vs. 1.4 years; P = 0.032) and for HH/TT AMLs with adverse abnormalities (median 0.8 years vs. 1.1 years; P = 0.044). In conclusion, HH/TT AML is associated with a poor outcome, but chromosome numbers >65 and absence of adverse aberrations seem to translate into a more favorable prognosis. Thus, HH/TT AMLs are clinically heterogeneous and should not automatically be grouped as high risk.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Lazarevic, Vladimir', 'Rosso, Aldana', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Antunovic, Petar', 'Rangert-Derolf, Asa', 'Lehmann, Soren', 'Mollgard, Lars', 'Uggla, Bertil', 'Wennstrom, Lovisa', 'Wahlin, Anders', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Lazarevic V', 'Rosso A', 'Juliusson G', 'Antunovic P', 'Rangert-Derolf A', 'Lehmann S', 'Mollgard L', 'Uggla B', 'Wennstrom L', 'Wahlin A', 'Hoglund M', 'Johansson B']","['Department of Hematology and Vascular Disease, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Epidemiology and Registry Center in South Sweden, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and Vascular Disease, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology Stockholm and Huddinge, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology Stockholm and Huddinge, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, School of Health and Medical Sciences, Orebro University Hospital, Orebro, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Department of Radiation Sciences, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories Region Skane, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150722,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Ploidies', 'Prognosis', '*Registries', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Sweden']",,,2015/06/20 06:00,2015/11/04 06:00,['2015/06/20 06:00'],"['2015/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24091 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Sep;90(9):800-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24091.

Family income has seldom been included in large population-based studies, and the specific contributions of it remain unknown. METHODS: A total of 712,674 children born between 1967 and 2009 in the Oslo region were included. Of these, 864 were diagnosed with leukemia or cancer in the central nervous system before the age of 15 years. The association between poverty and childhood leukemia or brain cancer was analyzed using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. Family income was stratified according to poverty lines. Parents' educational level and several perinatal variables were also examined. RESULTS: Family poverty during the first 2 years of life was associated with lymphoid leukemia before the age of 15 years: odds ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.64. In the same age group we found a significant dose response, with a 21% increased risk of lymphoid leukemia with increasing poverty. The risk for intracranial and intraspinal embryonal tumors in the whole study period was lower for children in the middle family income category. For astrocytomas there was a more than 70% increased risk in the medium income category when analyzing the two first years of life. The observed increase was reduced when all years each child contributed to the study were included. The risk of cancer in the central nervous system overall was 20% higher in the medium income category compared to the high-income category. CONCLUSIONS: Being born into a household of low family income the first 2 years of life was found to be a risk factor for development of lymphoid leukemia. For astrocytomas we observed an increased risk among children born into the medium income category throughout the first two years of life.",['(c) 2015 the Nordic Societies of Public Health.'],"['Del Risco Kollerud, Ruby', 'Blaasaas, Karl Gerhard', 'Claussen, Bjorgulf']","['Del Risco Kollerud R', 'Blaasaas KG', 'Claussen B']","['Agency for Health, City of Oslo, Norway ruby.kollerud@hotmail.com.', 'Finance Norway, Oslo Norway.', 'Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150618,Sweden,Scand J Public Health,Scandinavian journal of public health,100883503,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Astrocytoma/epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Educational Status', 'Female', '*Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Income/statistics & numerical data', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Norway/epidemiology', '*Poverty', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Class']",,,2015/06/20 06:00,2016/02/20 06:00,['2015/06/20 06:00'],"['2015/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1403494815590499 [pii]', '10.1177/1403494815590499 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Public Health. 2015 Nov;43(7):736-43. doi: 10.1177/1403494815590499.

Tumour surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the main techniques in treat cancers. Targeted therapy and drug resistance are the main focus in cancer research, but many molecular intracellular mechanisms remain unknown. Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2) is associated with breast cancer, leukaemia, lung cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, laryngeal cancer, oral cancer and other cancer types. Signalling pathways involving Shp2 have also been discovered. Shp2 is related to many diseases. Mutations in the ptpn11 gene cause Noonan syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome and childhood leukaemia. Shp2 is also involved in several cancer-related processes, including cancer cell invasion and metastasis, apoptosis, DNA damage, cell proliferation, cell cycle and drug resistance. Based on the structure and function of Shp2, scientists have investigated specific mechanisms involved in cancer. Shp2 may be a potential therapeutic target because this phosphatase is implicated in many aspects. Furthermore, Shp2 inhibitors have been used in experiments to develop treatment strategies. However, conflicting results related to Shp2 functions have been presented in the literature, and such results should be resolved in future studies.","['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Mutational statuses of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGVH) genes has been consider one of the most important prognostic factors in CLL, but despite of its proven value to predict the course of the disease, the regulatory programs and biological mechanisms responsible for the differences in clinical behavior are poorly understood. METHODS: In this study, (i) we performed differential gene expression analysis between the IGVH statuses using multiple and independent CLL cohorts in microarrays platforms, based on this information, (ii) we constructed a simplified protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and (iii) investigated its structure and critical genes. This provided the basis to (iv) develop a Boolean model, (v) infer biological regulatory mechanism and (vi) performed perturbation simulations in order to analyze the network in dynamic state. RESULTS: The result of topological analysis and the Boolean model showed that the transcriptional relationships of IGVH mutational status were determined by specific regulatory proteins (PTEN, FOS, EGR1, TNF, TGFBR3, IFGR2 and LPL). The dynamics of the network was controlled by attractors whose genes were involved in multiple and diverse signaling pathways, which may suggest a variety of mechanisms related with progression occurring over time in the disease. The overexpression of FOS and TNF fixed the fate of the system as they can activate important genes implicated in the regulation of process of adhesion, apoptosis, immune response, cell proliferation and other signaling pathways related with cancer. CONCLUSION: The differences in prognosis prediction of the IGVH mutational status are related with several regulatory hubs that determine the dynamic of the system.",,"['Alvarez-Silva, Maria Camila', 'Yepes, Sally', 'Torres, Maria Mercedes', 'Barrios, Andres Fernando Gonzalez']","['Alvarez-Silva MC', 'Yepes S', 'Torres MM', 'Barrios AF']","['Grupo de Diseno de Productos y Procesos (GDPP), Departamento de Ingenieria Quimica, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, DC, Colombia. as.maria10@uniandes.edu.co.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, DC, Colombia. sl.yepes233@uniandes.edu.co.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, DC, Colombia. maritorr@uniandes.edu.co.', 'Grupo de Diseno de Productos y Procesos (GDPP), Departamento de Ingenieria Quimica, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota, DC, Colombia. andgonza@uniandes.edu.co.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150620,England,Theor Biol Med Model,Theoretical biology & medical modelling,101224383,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Protein Interaction Maps/*physiology']",PMC4479082,,2015/06/20 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/06/20 06:00'],"['2015/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12976-015-0008-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12976-015-0008-z [pii]']",epublish,Theor Biol Med Model. 2015 Jun 20;12:12. doi: 10.1186/s12976-015-0008-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism and clinical implication of a specific allosteric AKT inhibitor, MK-2206, in the treatment of AML. Four leukemia cell lines, MV-4-11, MOLM-13, OCI/AML3, and U937, were used. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were determined by flow cytometry analysis. Expression of anti-apoptotic protein family and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) signaling was determined by western blotting. Drug combination effects of MK-2206 with cytarabine were evaluated by cell proliferation assay, and the combination index values were calculated by CompuSyn software. MK-2206 had no effect on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but induced G1-phase arrest and apoptosis in leukemia cells. Among anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, only myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) was significantly suppressed. Mcl-1 suppression by MK-2206 was closely associated with decreased GSK3beta phosphorylation at Ser9, an event leads to GSK3beta activation. Furthermore, the effect of MK-2206 on Mcl-1 downregulation was abolished by GSK3beta inhibitor, lithium chloride and proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, suggesting that MK-2206 acted through a GSK3beta-mediated, proteasome-dependent protein degradation. In addition, co-administration of MK-2206 with cytarabine could enhance the cytotoxic efficacy of cytarabine in leukemia cell lines.

From the perspective of the anesthesiologist, the preprocedural evaluation is essential in providing safe and high-quality care. This review focuses on the purpose, considerations and methods for providing information during the preprocedural evaluation process based on the most recent literature review. RECENT FINDINGS: Upon review of the literature, there is an agreement that a preprocedural evaluation is fundamental to the management of our patients. This evaluation is the process of clinical assessment that precedes the delivery of anesthesia for all procedures. Consideration must be given to information from many sources and consultation ordered only as necessary. A determination of the medical condition as indicated by the American Society of Anesthesiologists score must be applied. The evaluation process is relatively standard across institutions. It appears to be more clearly defined among adult patients particularly when presenting with multiple comorbidities, and will tend to be assessed days to weeks prior to the scheduled procedure. Differences may exist, however, among an institutions' overall approach to the preprocedural evaluation of children. Ultimately, the results are efforts by the institutions to improve efficiency, reduce delays and cancellation rates. SUMMARY: It is important for the anesthesia provider to perform a thorough preprocedural evaluation. Tests that are ordered as part of the evaluation are done to understand the current medical state, verify a condition or formulate a plan. Informed consent must be obtained and the risks and benefits of the anesthesia plan in a manner understandable to the patient and parent or care giver.Many pediatric patients undergoing procedures outside of the operating room are in good health, and their evaluation will be relatively routine. Other children will present with complex medical conditions that require more time for the evaluation process. This may include the consultation of a pediatric specialist(s) as a necessary step toward completion of the preprocedural evaluation.Similarly, there are adult patients undergoing procedures outside of the operating room, which will have a straightforward preprocedural evaluation and others are more complex. Disease states that might require further testing include diabetes, leukemia, kidney and liver disease, central nervous system disease, malabsorption syndrome, coronary artery disease, coagulopathies and patients on diuretics.",,"['Gooden, Cheryl K', 'Frost, Elizabeth A M']","['Gooden CK', 'Frost EA']","['aDepartment of Anesthesiology bDepartment of Anesthesiology and Pediatrics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,8813436,,IM,"['Adult', 'Ambulatory Surgical Procedures', '*Anesthesia', 'Child', '*Health Status', 'Humans', '*Referral and Consultation']",,,2015/06/19 06:00,2016/04/05 06:00,['2015/06/19 06:00'],"['2015/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/ACO.0000000000000217 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Anaesthesiol. 2015 Aug;28(4):441-5. doi: 10.1097/ACO.0000000000000217.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is one of the earliest embryo-derived secreted signals in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that abundantly expresses hCG receptors. The aims of this study were to estimate the effect of human embryo-secreted hCG on PBMC function and investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of activated PBMC in trophoblast invasion. Blood samples were collected from women undergoing benign gynecological surgery during the mid-secretory phase. PBMC were isolated and stimulated with or without hCG for 0 or 24 h. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expressions in PBMC were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The JAR cell line served as a model for trophoblast cells and was divided into four groups: control, hCG only, PBMC only, and PBMC with hCG. JAR cell invasive and proliferative abilities were detected by trans-well and CCK8 assays and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, and TIMP-2 expressions in JAR cells were detected by western blotting and real-time PCR analysis. We found that hCG can remarkably promote IL-1beta and LIF promotion in PBMC after 24-h culture. PBMC activated by hCG significantly increased the number of invasive JAR cells in an invasion assay without affecting proliferation, and hCG-activated PBMC significantly increased MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF and decreased TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expressions in JAR cells in a dose-dependent manner. This study demonstrated that hCG stimulates cytokine secretion in human PBMC and could stimulate trophoblast invasion.",,"['Yu, Nan', 'Yan, Wenjie', 'Yin, Tailang', 'Wang, Yaqin', 'Guo, Yue', 'Zhou, Danni', 'Xu, Mei', 'Ding, Jinli', 'Yang, Jing']","['Yu N', 'Yan W', 'Yin T', 'Wang Y', 'Guo Y', 'Zhou D', 'Xu M', 'Ding J', 'Yang J']","[""Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150618,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/*pharmacology', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4472760,,2015/06/19 06:00,2016/04/26 06:00,['2015/06/19 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0125589 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-39244 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jun 18;10(6):e0125589. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0125589. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed EBV DNA load by quantitative PCR at CLL presentation in mononuclear cells (MNC) of 220 prospective patients that were enrolled and followed-up in two major Institutions. In 20 patients EBV DNA load was also assessed on plasma samples. Forty-one age-matched healthy subjects were tested for EBV DNA load on MNC. Findings were validated in an independent retrospective cohort of 112 patients with CLL. EBV DNA load was detectable in 59%, and high (>/=2000 copies/microg DNA) in 19% of patients, but it was negative in plasma samples. EBV DNA load was significantly higher in CLL patients than in healthy subjects (P < .0001). No relation was found between high EBV load and clinical stage or biological variables, except for 11q deletion (P = .004), CD38 expression (P = .003), and NOTCH1 mutations (P = .05). High EBV load led to a 3.14-fold increase in the hazard ratio of death and to a shorter overall survival (OS; P = .001). Poor OS was attributable, at least in part, to shorter time-to-first-treatment (P = .0008), with no higher risk of Richter's transformation or second cancer.

Excessive HCK activation is associated with several types of leukemia and enhances cell proliferation and survival by physical association with oncogenic fusion proteins, and with functional interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases. Elevated HCK activity is also observed in many solid malignancies, including breast and colon cancer, and correlates with decreased patient survival rates. HCK enhances the secretion of growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines from myeloid cells, and promotes macrophage polarization towards a wound healing and tumor-promoting alternatively activated phenotype. Within tumor associated macrophages, HCK stimulates the formation of podosomes that facilitate extracellular matrix degradation, which enhance immune and epithelial cell invasion. By virtue of functional cooperation between HCK and bona fide oncogenic tyrosine kinases, excessive HCK activation can also reduce drug efficacy and contribute to chemo-resistance, while genetic ablation of HCK results in minimal physiological consequences in healthy mice.

We found a preferential acquisition of unbalanced ACA in patients with b3a2 vs. b2a2 fusion type (ratio: 6.3 vs. 1.6, p = 0.0246) concurring with a faster progress to blast crisis for b3a2 patients (p = 0.0124). ESPL1/Separase, a cysteine endopeptidase, is a key player in chromosomal segregation during mitosis. Separase overexpression and/or hyperactivity has been reported from a wide range of cancers and cause defective mitotic spindles, chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy. We investigated the influence of p210BCR-ABL breakpoint variants and imatinib treatment on expression and proteolytic activity of Separase as measured with a specific fluorogenic assay on CML cell lines (b2a2: KCL-22, BV-173; b3a2: K562, LAMA-84). Despite a drop in Separase protein levels an up to 5.4-fold increase of Separase activity under imatinib treatment was observed exclusively in b3a2 but not in b2a2 cell lines. Mimicking the influence of imatinib on BV-173 and LAMA-84 cells by ESPL1 silencing stimulated Separase proteolytic activity in both b3a2 and b2a2 cell lines. Our data suggest the existence of a fusion type-related feedback mechanism that posttranslationally stimulates Separase proteolytic activity after therapy-induced decreases in Separase protein levels. This could render b3a2 CML cells more prone to aneuploidy and clonal evolution than b2a2 progenitors and may therefore explain the cytogenetic results of CML patients.",,"['Haass, Wiltrud', 'Kleiner, Helga', 'Weiss, Christel', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Seifarth, Wolfgang']","['Haass W', 'Kleiner H', 'Weiss C', 'Haferlach C', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Muller MC', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hofmann WK', 'Fabarius A', 'Seifarth W']","['III.

NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, regulates activity of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) and thus indirectly controls NF-kappaB activity. Inhibition of CRLs with MLN4924, an investigational agent that targets the NEDD8-activating enzyme, induces accumulation of CRL substrates, including inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB), a negative pathway modulator. We demonstrate that both continuous and pulse treatments with MLN4924 abrogate NF-kappaB activity in CLL B-cells ex vivo in a CD40L-expressing stromal co-culture system and identify pathways potentially responsible for resistance to MLN4924.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 71 prospective patients were included. Analyses of oral microbiota and blood sample were conducted on days 14 (D14) and 56 (D56) of the Brazilian GBTLI-99 treatment protocol. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) identification was performed by PCR followed by DNA sequencing analysis. Bacteria and fungi identification was obtained by standard microbiological culture tests. RESULTS: 103 episodes of mucositis occurred, being 65 at D14 and 38 at D56. Most cases positive for herpes viral DNA sequences were identified as HSV-1. At D14, we found a significant association between the severity of mucositis and presence of HSV-1 (p = 0.0347), Candida spp. (p = 0.0078), and low platelet count (p = 0.0064). At D56, we found a significant association between the severity of mucositis and the presence of HSV-1 (p = 0.0317), previous HSV-1 presence on D14 (p < 0.0001) and neutrophil count (p = 0.0211). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: the identification of risk factors for mucositis in children and adolescents may contribute to the development of new strategies for prevention and/or treatment, reducing the complications associated with this condition. CONCLUSIONS: the presence of HSV, platelet count, and Candida spp. presence at D14 of ALL induction treatment is associated with increased severity of mucositis in children and adolescents. At D56 of ALL treatment, mucositis severity was associated with neutrophil count, HSV presence, and previous presence of HSV (at D14).",,"['Mendonca, Regina Maria Holanda de', 'Araujo, Marcela de', 'Levy, Carlos Emilio', 'Morari, Joseane', 'Silva, Rosangela A', 'Yunes, Jose Andres', 'Brandalise, Silvia Regina']","['Mendonca RM', 'Araujo Md', 'Levy CE', 'Morari J', 'Silva RA', 'Yunes JA', 'Brandalise SR']","['Centro Infantil Boldrini; Universidade Estadual de Campinas , Campinas, SP , Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150618,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Brazil/epidemiology', '*Candida', 'Candidiasis/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Herpes Simplex/chemically induced/*epidemiology', '*Herpesvirus 1, Human', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/*epidemiology']",,,2015/06/19 06:00,2016/05/19 06:00,['2015/06/19 06:00'],"['2015/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2015.1034819 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2015;32(5):322-30. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2015.1034819.

Our study was intended to investigate DLX4 methylation pattern in different clinical stages of CML and further determine its role in regulating DLX4 expression. Real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR were applied to detect DLX4 methylation. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) was used for demethylation studies. DLX4 was significantly hypermethylated in CML patients (P = 0.002) especially in blastic phase (BC) stage (P < 0.001) as compared with controls. Moreover, DLX4 methylation level in BC stage was significantly higher than in chronic phase (CP) stage (P < 0.001). DLX4 methylation density was significantly increased during the progression of CML among the tested two patients (P < 0.001). DLX4 hypermethylation occurred with the highest incidence in BC stage (83%), lower incidence in acute phase (AP) stage (43%), and the lowest incidence in CP stage (26%) (P = 0.001). Moreover, t(9; 22) with additional alteration cases had significantly higher frequency of DLX4 hypermethylation compared with the other cytogenetics (P = 0.010). Significantly negative correlation was observed between DLX4 methylation and DLX4-TV2 (the shorter DLX4 isoform) expression (R = -0.382, P = 0.001, n = 78) but not between DLX4 methylation and BP1 (the longer DLX4 isoform) expression (R = 0.134, P = 0.244, n = 78) in CML patients. Both DLX4-TV2 and BP1 mRNA were significantly increased after 5-aza-dC treatment in K562 cell line (P < 0.001). Our study indicated that hypermethylation of DLX4 correlated with disease progression of CML. Moreover, DLX4 expression was regulated by its methylation in CML.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, there are only a limited number of targeted therapies that act by increasing senescence in cancers, but the majority of them are not selective and also target healthy cells. Here we developed a chemogenomic screening to identify compounds that enhance senescence in PTEN-deficient cells without affecting normal cells. By using this approach, we identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a pro-senescent target. Mechanistically, we show that Pten loss increases CK2 levels by activating STAT3. CK2 upregulation in Pten null tumours affects the stability of Pml, an essential regulator of senescence. However, CK2 inhibition stabilizes Pml levels enhancing senescence in Pten null tumours. Taken together, our screening strategy has identified a novel STAT3-CK2-PML network that can be targeted for pro-senescence therapy for cancer.",,"['Kalathur, Madhuri', 'Toso, Alberto', 'Chen,

This is exemplified by the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) system in which lymphoproliferative disorders develop in ruminants after latency periods of several years. In principle, the equilibrium reached between the virus and its host could be disrupted by emergence of more pathogenic strains. Intriguingly but fortunately, such a hyperpathogenic BLV strain was never observed in the field or designed in vitro. In this study, we sought to understand the role of envelope N-linked glycosylation with the hypothesis that this posttranslational modification could either favor BLV infection by allowing viral entry or allow immune escape by using glycans as a shield. Using reverse genetics of an infectious molecular provirus, we identified a N-linked envelope glycosylation site (N230) that limits viral replication and pathogenicity. Indeed, mutation N230E unexpectedly leads to enhanced fusogenicity and protein stability. IMPORTANCE: Infection by retroviruses requires the interaction of the viral envelope protein (SU) with a membrane-associated receptor allowing fusion and release of the viral genomic RNA into the cell. We show that N-linked glycosylation of the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) SU protein is, as expected, essential for cell infection in vitro. Consistently, mutation of all glycosylation sites of a BLV provirus destroys infectivity in vivo. However, single mutations do not significantly modify replication in vivo. Instead, a particular mutation at SU codon 230 increases replication and accelerates pathogenesis. This unexpected observation has important consequences in terms of disease control and managing.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

During the lytic cycle, these capsid proteins are synthesized and imported into the host nucleus for capsid assembly. This study finds that EBV capsid proteins colocalize with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) in P3HR1 cells during the viral lytic cycle, appearing as nuclear speckles under a confocal laser scanning microscope. In a glutathione S-transferase pulldown study, we show that BORF1 interacts with PML-NBs in vitro. BORF1 also colocalizes with PML-NBs in EBV-negative Akata cells after transfection and is responsible for bringing VCA and the VCA-BFRF3 complex from the cytoplasm to PML-NBs in the nucleus. Furthermore, BDLF1 is dispersed throughout the cell when expressed alone but colocalizes with PML-NBs when BORF1 is also present in the cell. In addition, this study finds that knockdown of PML expression by short hairpin RNA does not influence the intracellular levels of capsid proteins but reduces the number of viral particles produced by P3HR1 cells. Together, these results demonstrate that BORF1 plays a critical role in bringing capsid proteins to PML-NBs, which may likely be the assembly sites of EBV capsids. The mechanisms elucidated in this study are critical to understanding the process of EBV capsid assembly. IMPORTANCE Capsid assembly is an important event during the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic cycle, as this process is required for the production of virions. In this study, confocal microscopy revealed that the EBV capsid protein BORF1 interacts with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) in the host nucleus and is responsible for transporting the other EBV capsid proteins, including VCA, BDLF1, and BFRF3, to these subnuclear locations prior to initiation of capsid assembly. This study also found that knockdown of PML expression by short hairpin RNA significantly reduces EBV capsid assembly capabilities. This enhanced understanding of capsid assembly offers potential for the development of novel antiviral strategies and therapies that can prevent the propagation and spread of EBV.",,"['Wang, Wen-Hung', 'Kuo, Chung-Wen', 'Chang, Li-Kwan', 'Hung, Chen-Chia', 'Chang, Tzu-Hsuan', 'Liu, Shih-Tung']","['Wang WH', 'Kuo CW', 'Chang LK', 'Hung CC', 'Chang TH', 'Liu ST']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150617,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/*genetics', 'Antigens, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Capsid/*metabolism', 'Capsid Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/virology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering']",PMC4524052,,2015/06/19 06:00,2016/04/30 06:00,['2015/06/19 06:00'],"['2015/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01114-15 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01114-15 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 Sep;89(17):8922-31. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01114-15.

Although critically important in leukemogenesis, the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms they trigger remain largely unknown.

Using genetically modified mice, we found that loss of Id1 inhibited t(8;21) leukemia initiation and progression in vivo by abrogating protein kinase B (AKT)1 activation, and that Id1 interacted with AKT1 through its C terminus. An Id1 inhibitor impaired the in vitro growth of AML cells and, when combined with an AKT inhibitor, triggered even greater apoptosis and growth inhibition, whereas normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were largely spared. We then performed in vivo experiments and found that the Id1 inhibitor significantly prolonged the survival of t(8;21)(+) leukemic mice, whereas overexpression of activated AKT1 promoted leukemogenesis.

Although the mechanisms remain unclear, new insights are emerging into the complex relationship between the CLL clone and its immune environment. T cells are increased in early-stage disease and show progressive accumulation and exhaustion. The mechanisms that drive this expansion may include auto-antigens involved in the original clonal expansion. In addition, chronic viral infections such as cytomegalovirus generate huge virus-specific immune responses, which are further expanded in CLL. Attention is now focused largely on the direct immunosuppressive properties of the tumor. Remarkably, CLL clones often have features of the recently described regulatory B cells producing immunosuppressive IL-10. Better knowledge of the regulatory properties intrinsic to CLL cells may soon become more important with the switch from chemotherapy-based treatments, which trade control of CLL with further impairment of immune function, to the new agents targeting CLL B-cell receptor-associated signaling. Treatment with these new agents is associated with evidence of immune recovery and reduced infectious complications. As such, they offer the prospect of immunologic rehabilitation and a platform from which to ultimately replace chemotherapy.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Forconi, Francesco', 'Moss, Paul']","['Forconi F', 'Moss P']","['Haematology Oncology Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK Centre and National Institute for Health Research Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, University of Southampton, Faculty of Medicine, Southampton, United Kingdom; Haematology Department, University Hospital Southampton National Health Service Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom; and.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham & University Medical School, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150617,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adaptive Immunity', 'Agammaglobulinemia/etiology/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Infections/epidemiology/etiology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Burden/immunology', 'Tumor Escape']",,,2015/06/19 06:00,2015/10/20 06:00,['2015/06/19 06:00'],"['2015/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31374-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-03-567388 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jul 30;126(5):573-81. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-03-567388.

Recently, we observed upregulation of microRNA-340-5p (miR-340) in failing human hearts because of dilated cardiomyopathy, but the functional consequence of miR-340 remains to be clarified.We transfected neonatal cardiomyocytes with miR-340 and found fetal gene expression including Nppa, Nppb and Myh7. We also observed eccentric hypertrophy development upon treatment which was analogous to the phenotype after cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) stimulation. As a potent inducer of cardiac eccentric hypertrophy, treatment by IL-6 family members CT-1 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) led to the elevation of miR-340. Knockdown of miR-340 using antagomir attenuated fetal gene expression and hypertrophy formation, which means miR-340 could convey the hypertrophic signal of CT-1. To demonstrate the initial factor of miR-340 activation, we constructed a volume overloaded abdominal aorta-inferior vena cava fistula rat HF model. miR-340 and CT-1 were found to be up-regulated in the left ventricle. Dystrophin (DMD), a putative target gene of miR-340 which is eccentric hypertrophy-susceptible, was decreased in this HF model upon Western blotting and immunohistochemistry tests. Luciferase assay constructed in two seed sequence of DMD gene 3'UTR showed decreased luciferase activities, and miR-340 transfected cells resulted in the degradation of DMD.miR-340 is a pro-eccentric hypertrophy miRNA, and its expression is dependent on volume overload and cytokine CT-1 activation.

RESULTS: Se levels in the serum and hair of the children with cancer were significantly lower than those of the controls. There were no differences between the leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors group. On the other hand, the Se levels of the urine samples were slightly elevated in cancer patients compared with the control group.

In particular, expression studies of Eph receptors and limited functional studies have demonstrated a role for the Eph/ephrin system in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. In particular, EphA2 was reported on hematopoietic stem cells and stromal cells. There are also reports of EphA2 expression in many different types of malignancies including leukemia, however there is a lack of knowledge in understanding the role of EphA2 in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. We explored the role of EphA2 in hematopoiesis by analyzing wild type and EphA2 knockout mice. Mature, differentiated cells, progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells derived from knockout and control mice were analyzed and no significant abnormality was detected. These studies showed that EphA2 does not have an obligatory role in normal hematopoiesis. Comparative studies using EphA2-negative MLL-AF9 leukemias derived from EphA2-knockout animals showed that there was no detectable functional role for EphA2 in the initiation or progression of the leukemic process. However, expression of EphA2 in leukemias initiated by MLL-AF9 suggested that this protein might be a possible therapy target in this type of leukemia. We showed that treatment with EphA2 monoclonal antibody IF7 alone had no effect on tumorigenicity and latency of the MLL-AF9 leukemias, while targeting of EphA2 using EphA2 monoclonal antibody with a radioactive payload significantly impaired the leukemic process.

An important target for MoAbs was the CD20 B-cell lineage antigen. Rituximab (RTX) is a chimeric mouse anti-human MoAb that targets the CD20 antigen on the surface of malignant and normal B lymphocytes, and has rapidly become the widest used immunotherapeutic drug. RTX has had a significant impact on how B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia is now treated. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors demonstrate the mechanisms of action of RTX, and the preclinical data that have led to clinical trials and its final approval for the treatment of B-cell NHLs. EXPERT OPINION: The discovery of RTX opened a new era for treatment of B-cell malignancies and became the starting point for the development of new, more active classes of anti-CD20 agents. Furthermore, it has contributed to the construction of a number of MoAbs specific for other antigens that target different types of neoplastic cells.",,"['Smolewski, Piotr', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Smolewski P', 'Robak T']","['Medical University of Lodz, Department of Experimental Hematology , Ciolkowskiego 2, Lodz, 93-510 Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150617,England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Rituximab/*pharmacology']",,,2015/06/18 06:00,2016/03/22 06:00,['2015/06/18 06:00'],"['2015/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/17460441.2015.1045295 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2015 Jul;10(7):791-808. doi: 10.1517/17460441.2015.1045295.

Candidate Ara-C metabolizing gene expression in primary AML cells is proposed to account for this variation. METHODS: Ex vivo Ara-C sensitivity was determined in primary AML samples using MTT assay. mRNA expression of candidate Ara-C metabolizing genes were evaluated by RQPCR analysis. Global gene expression profiling was carried out for identifying differentially expressed genes between exvivo Ara-C sensitive and resistant samples. RESULTS: Wide interindividual variations in ex vivo Ara-C cytotoxicity were observed among samples from patients with AML and were stratified into sensitive, intermediately sensitive and resistant, based on IC50 values obtained by MTT assay. RNA expression of deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (ENT1) and ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) were significantly higher and cytidine deaminase (CDA) was significantly lower in ex vivo Ara-C sensitive samples. Higher DCK and RRM1 expression in AML patient's blast correlated with better DFS. Ara-C resistance index (RI), a mathematically derived quotient was proposed based on candidate gene expression pattern. Ara-C ex vivo sensitive samples were found to have significantly lower RI compared with resistant as well as samples from patients presenting with relapse. Patients with low RI supposedly highly sensitive to Ara-C were found to have higher incidence of induction death (p = 0.002; RR: 4.35 [95% CI: 1.69-11.22]). Global gene expression profiling undertaken to find out additional contributors of Ara-C resistance identified many apoptosis as well as metabolic pathway genes to be differentially expressed between Ara-C resistant and sensitive samples. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of evaluating expression of candidate Ara-C metabolizing genes in predicting ex vivo drug response as well as treatment outcome. RI could be a predictor of ex vivo Ara-C response irrespective of cytogenetic and molecular risk groups and a potential biomarker for AML treatment outcome and toxicity.

In this study, based on an information flow model and microarray data, we measured the information flow in cellular networks indirectly by using a systems biology method. First, we used a recursive least square parameter estimation algorithm to identify the system parameters of coupling signal transduction pathways and the cellular gene regulatory network (GRN). Then, based on the identified parameters and systems theory, we estimated the signal transductivities of the coupling signal transduction pathways from the extracellular signals to each downstream protein and the information transductivities of the GRN between transcription factors in response to environmental events. According to the proposed method, the information flow, which is characterized by signal transductivity in coupling signaling pathways and information transductivity in the GRN, can be estimated by microarray temporal data or microarray sample data. It can also be estimated by other high-throughput data such as next-generation sequencing or proteomic data. Finally, the information flows of the signal transduction pathways and the GRN in leukemia cancer cells and non-leukemia normal cells were also measured to analyze the systematic dysfunction in this cancer from microarray sample data.

There were no previous studies investigating the impact of ASXL1 mutations in Ph-negative MPNs in Turkey. In the current study, we investigated the prognostic significance of ASXL1 mutations in Turkish MPN patients. We also aimed to determine the prognostic significance of JAK2V617F allele burden and the relationship of JAK2V617F mutation with ASXL1 mutations in Ph-negative MPNs. METHODS: About 184 patients from a single center diagnosed with Ph-negative MPNs were screened for ASXL1, JAK2V617F mutations, and JAK2V617F allele burden: 107 ET and 77 PMF. RESULTS: A total of 29 ASXL1 mutations were detected in 24.7% of PMF and 8.4% of ET patients. ASXL1-mutated ET patients showed a trend toward an increase in the incidence of cerebrovascular events and higher total leukocyte counts. ASXL1-mutation in PMF was associated with older age and a higher prevalence of bleeding complications. In univariate analysis, overall survival (OS) was significantly reduced in ASXL1-mutated PMF patients. In multivariate analysis, Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System-plus high-risk category and ASXL1 mutation status were independently associated with shorter survival in PMF. In PMF, mutational status and allele burden of JAK2V617F showed no difference in terms of OS and leukemia-free survival.

Numerous studies suggest that GM-CSF signaling plays a central role in establishing and maintaining JMML/MP-CMML phenotypes in human and mouse. However, it remains elusive how GM-CSF signaling impacts on JMML/MP-CMML initiation and progression. Here, we investigate this issue in a well characterized MP-CMML model induced by endogenous Nras(G12D/+) mutation. In this model, Nras(G12D/+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are required to initiate and maintain CMML phenotypes and serve as CMML-initiating cells. We show that the common beta chain of the GM-CSF receptor (betac) is dispensable for Nras(G12D/+) HSC function; loss of betac does not affect the expansion, increased self-renewal, or myeloid differentiation bias in Nras(G12D/+) HSCs. Therefore, betac(-/-) does not abrogate CMML in Nras(G12D/+) mice. However, betac deficiency indeed significantly reduces Nras(G12D/+)-induced splenomegaly and spontaneous colony formation and prolongs the survival of CMML-bearing mice, suggesting that GM-CSF signaling plays an important role in promoting CMML progression. Together, our results suggest that inhibiting GM-CSF signaling in JMML/MP-CMML patients might alleviate disease symptoms but would not eradicate the disease.","['(c) 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Zhang, Jingfang', 'Ranheim, Erik A', 'Du, Juan', 'Liu, Yangang', 'Wang, Jinyong', 'Kong, Guangyao', 'Zhang, Jing']","['Zhang J', 'Ranheim EA', 'Du J', 'Liu Y', 'Wang J', 'Kong G', 'Zhang J']","['From the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53705 and.', 'the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, Madison, Wisconsin 53705.', 'From the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53705 and.', 'From the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53705 and.', 'From the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53705 and.', 'From the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53705 and.', 'From the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53705 and zhang@oncology.wisc.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL113066/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL113066/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150616,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Nras protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spleen/pathology']",PMC4521033,,2015/06/18 06:00,2015/10/20 06:00,['2015/06/18 06:00'],"['2015/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)42282-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M115.653154 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Jul 31;290(31):19093-103. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.653154.

Pathologically, hemophagocytosis is commonly seen but is only present in 60% of MAS patients. MAS, or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), is triggered by infectious (e.g., herpes family viruses), rheumatologic (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) and oncologic (e.g., T-cell leukemia) conditions. Formal HLH criteria, while specific, are frequently insensitive for MAS diagnosis. Thus, disease-specific (e.g., SLE) and generic MAS criteria have been published.

A more favorable outcome has been reported in patients receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (alloHSCT), but this has not been confirmed in large series. We analyzed the outcome of alloHSCT among adult patients reported to the Acute Leukemia Working Party between 2000 and 2010. We identified 159 patients with 11q23/MLL rearranged AML allografted in first complete remission (CR1, n=138) or CR2, mostly corresponding to t(9;11), t(11;19), t(6;11) and t(10;11) translocations. Two-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), relapse incidence and non-relapse mortality were 56+/-4%, 51+/-4%, 31+/-3% and 17+/-4%, respectively. The outcome differed according to 11q23/MLL rearrangement, being more favorable in patients with t(9;11) and t(11;19) compared with t(10;11) and t(6;11) (2-year OS: 64+/-6% and 73+/-10% vs 40+/-13% and 24+/-11%, respectively; P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis for OS identified t(6;11), t(10;11), age>40 years and CR2 as unfavorable features, whereas t(6;11), t(10;11), CR2 and the use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimen affected poorly the LFS.

Currently, lymphocytes aggregation is only evaluated qualitatively or by semiquantitative methods. In this study, we assessed the capacity of flow cytometry to measure lymphocytes aggregation in a quantitative, accurate, and reproducible manner, and examined the significance of aggregation responses in various lymphoproliferative diseases. METHODS: Extracellular triggers such as anti-CD19 antibodies or phorbol ester were utilized to induce lymphoid cells aggregation in a concentration dependent manner. Aggregation was quantified by flow cytometry based on the forward or side scatter (SSC), or by dark-field SSC of aggregates measured by ImageStreamX. Accuracy, reproducibility, and limitations of the methodology were evaluated. Aggregation responses were measured in various types of lymphoproliferative diseases, and correlated with immunophenotyping and IGHV mutational status in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. RESULTS: Lymphoid aggregates provoked by extracellular stimuli elevate the forward and SSC signals relatively to the number of cells in each event. Aggregation responses vary among different types of lymphoproliferative diseases. Moreover, elevated levels of CD19-induced aggregation are associated with aberrant chronic lymphocytic leukemia characteristics, but not with IGHV mutational status of the disease CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that flow cytometry can provide accurate and reproducible measurement of both primary as well as T and B cell lines aggregation in response to extracellular stimuli. The use of quantitative evaluation of activation driven or other cellular aggregation may provide an analytical tool to elucidate biochemical and molecular mechanisms associated with lymphoproliferative diseases.

CXCR4 is crucial in the trafficking of hematopoietic stem cells from/to the bone marrow, which involves also uPAR. Both uPAR and CXCR4 are expressed in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), with a lower expression in undifferentiated and myeloid subsets, and higher expression in myelomonocytic and promyelocytic subsets. We hypothesized a microRNA (miR)-mediated co-regulation of uPAR and CXCR4 expression, which could allow their cross-talk at the cell surface. We identified three miRs, miR-146a, miR-335 and miR-622, regulating the expression of both uPAR and CXCR4 in AML cell lines. Indeed, these miRs directly target the 3'untranslated region of both uPAR- and CXCR4-mRNAs; accordingly, uPAR/CXCR4 expression is reduced by their overexpression in AML cells and increased by their specific inhibitors. Overexpression of all three miRs impairs migration, invasion and proliferation of myelomonocytic cells. Interestingly, we observed an inverse relationship between uPAR/CXCR4 expression and miR-146a and miR-335 levels in AML blasts, suggesting their possible role in the regulation of uPAR/CXCR4 expression also in vivo.","['(c) 2015 The Authors.

Cordycepin is characterized by strong antileukemic properties and is regarded as an effective natural compound for leukemia therapy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of HMGB1 knockdown and cordycepin treatment on proliferation, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and adhesion of K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia cells. The Cell Counting kit8 assay was used to determine the proliferation of K562 cells. The cell cycle and apoptosis of K562 cells was determined using flow cytometric analysis. In addition, a cell adhesion assay was performed. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expression of cyclooxygenase 2, Bax, receptor for advanced glycation end-products and Bcl2. The data collected demonstrated that HMGB1 knockdown combined with cordycepin treatment had significant antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. In addition, it increased the ROS levels and reduced the adhesion of K562 cells. It was also identified that HMGB1 knockdown had synergistic effects with cordycepin, which aided in accelerating apoptosis, and inhibiting proliferation and adhesion in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. These results indicated that HMGB1 may be used as a potential therapeutic target, with cordycepin having potential as an auxiliary drug.

In past several years, kinase inhibition has emerged as potential anti-cancer drug target. Purine is a priveleged heterocyclic nucleus which exists in the chemical architecture of various bioactive compounds. Numerous reports on the use of purine analogues in the treatment of acute leukemias (thiopurines, pentostatin), as antiviral (acyclovir, penciclovir, ganciclovir), as immunosuppressive (azathioprine), as antitumor (vidarabine), as bronchodilator (theophylline) have been revealed. In the past decade, purine analogues have emerged as significantly potent kinase inhibitors. A fair amount of research has been done and several patents have also been published highlighting the kinase inhibitory action of purines. Caffeine, 2-aminopurine, purvalanol-A, seleciclib, FSBA, adenosine thiol analogue possessing purine as the basic moiety fall under this category.

However, the results were inconsistent. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between cancer risk and MTHFR C677T (150,086 cases and 200,699 controls from 446 studies) polymorphism. Overall, significantly increased cancer risk was found when all eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. In the further stratified and sensitivity analyses, significantly increased breast cancer risk was found in Asians and Indians, significantly decreased colon cancer risk was found, significantly decreased colorectal cancer risk was found in male population, significantly increased gastric cancer risk was found in Caucasians and Asians, significantly increased hepatocellular cancer risk was found in Asians, significantly decreased adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (AALL) risk was found in Caucasians, significantly decreased childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CALL) risk was found in Asians, and significantly increased multiple myeloma and NHL risk was found in Caucasians. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is associated with increased breast cancer, gastric cancer, and hepatocellular cancer risk in Asians, is associated with increased gastric cancer, multiple myeloma, and NHL risk in Caucasians, is associated with decreased AALL risk in Caucasians, is associated with decreased CALL risk in Asians, is associated with increased breast cancer risk in Asians, is associated with decreased colon cancer risk, and is associated with decreased colorectal cancer risk in male population. Moreover, this meta-analysis also points out the importance of new studies, such as Asians of HNC, Asians of lung cancer, and Indians of breast cancer, because they had high heterogeneity in this meta-analysis (I(2) > 75%).",,"['Xie, Shu-Zhe', 'Liu, Zhi-Zhong', 'Yu, Jun-hua', 'Liu, Li', 'Wang, Wei', 'Xie, Dao-Lin', 'Qin, Jiang-Bo']","['Xie SZ', 'Liu ZZ', 'Yu JH', 'Liu L', 'Wang W', 'Xie DL', 'Qin JB']","['Department of General Surgery, Peace Hospital of Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi, 046000, China. xieshuzhezl@163.com.', ""Department of Gastroenterology, The Second People's Hospital of Zhuhai, Zhuhai, 519000, China."", 'Department of Neurosurgery, Ezhou Central Hospital of Hubei Province, Ezhou, Hubei, 436000, China.', 'Department of Reproductive Medicine, First Center Hospital, Tianjin, 300192, China.', ""Department of Gastroenterology, The Second People's Hospital of Zhuhai, Zhuhai, 519000, China."", 'Department of Ultrasound Diagnosis, Peace Hospital of Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi, 046000, China.', 'Department of Ear, Nose, and Throat, Peace Hospital of Changzhi Medical College, Changzhi, 046000, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20150617,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Alleles', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Risk Factors']",,,2015/06/18 06:00,2016/03/30 06:00,['2015/06/18 06:00'],"['2015/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-3648-z [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-3648-z [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 Nov;36(11):8953-72. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-3648-z.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the antiproliferative and apoptotic actions exerted by fisetin and hesperetin on human HL60 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. The viability of HL60 cells was evaluated using the MTT assay, apoptosis by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and cell cycle distribution using flow cytometry, and changes in caspase-3 enzyme activity and mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Moreover, we performed whole-genome microarray gene expression analysis to reveal genes affected by fisetin and hesperetin that can be important for developing of future targeted therapy. Based on data obtained from microarray analysis, we also described biological networks modulated after fisetin and hesperetin treatment by KEGG and IPA analysis. Fisetin and hesperetin treatment showed a concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation and induced G2/M arrest for both agents and G0/G1 arrest for hesperetin at only the highest concentrations. There was a disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential together with increased caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, fisetin- and hesperetin-triggered apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V/PI analysis. The microarray gene profiling analysis revealed some important biological pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) signaling pathways altered by fisetin and hesperetin treatment as well as gave a list of genes modulated >/=2-fold involved in cell proliferation, cell division, and apoptosis.

Little is known of the cellular origin and release mechanisms of such proteasome. We recently identified and characterized a novel particulate cytoplasmic structure (PaCS) showing selective accumulation of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) components. PaCSs have been reported in some epithelial neoplasms and in two genetic disorders characterized by hematopoietic cell dysplasia and increased risk of leukemia. However, no information is available about PaCSs in hematopoietic neoplasms. METHODS: PaCSs were investigated by ultrastructural, immunogold, and immunofluorescence analysis of bone marrow (BM) biopsies and peripheral blood (PB) cell preparations of 33 consecutive, untreated, or relapsed patients affected by different hematopoietic neoplasms. BM and PB samples from individuals with non-neoplastic BM or healthy donors were studied as controls. Granulocytes and platelet proteasome content was measured by immunoblotting and plasma proteasome levels by ELISA. RESULTS: PaCSs with typical, selective immunoreactivity for polyubiquitinated proteins and proteasome were widespread in granulocytic cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). In acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), PaCSs were only occasionally detected in blast cells and were found consistently in cells showing granulocytic and megakaryocytic maturation. Conversely, PaCSs were poorly represented or absent in non-neoplastic hematopoietic tissue or lymphoid neoplasms. In MPN granulocytes and platelets, the presence of PaCSs was associated with increased amounts of proteasome in cell lysates. PaCSs were often localized in cytoplasmic blebs generating PaCSs-filled plasma membrane vesicles observable in the BM intercellular space. In MPN and MDS, accumulation of PaCSs was associated with significant increase in plasma proteasome. Immunogold analysis showed that PaCSs of myeloid neoplasia selectively concentrated the chaperone proteins Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp90. CONCLUSIONS: PaCSs accumulate in cells of myeloid neoplasms in a lineage- and maturation-restricted manner; in particular, they are widespread in granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineages of MPN patients. PaCSs development was associated with excess accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, proteasome, and chaperone molecules, indicating impairment of the UPS-dependent protein homeostasis and a possible link with Hsp90-related leukemogenesis.

A previous study demonstrated that NE has an important role in the development of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The process of APL was shown to be accelerated in animals that expressed abundant NE, whereas NEdeficient mice were protected from APL development; thus suggesting an important role for NE in the development of APL. The present study aimed to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of NE. Up- and downregulation of NE in various leukemia cell lines was conducted in order to explore its significance in the occurrence and procession of leukemia, with the aim of identifying novel targeted therapeutic drugs for the treatment of leukemia. NE was overexpressed in cells following infection with an adenovirus, and Cell Counting kit8 and flow cytometry results demonstrated that cell proliferation was promoted, and cell apoptosis was inhibited, as compared with the untreated cells. NE was downregulated in the cells by both RNA interference and treatment with GW311616A, a specific inhibitor of NE, following which cell growth was shown to be inhibited and apoptosis was induced. These results suggested that NE may promote the development of APL, therefore, NE may be a therapeutic target and its inhibitor GW311616A may be a potential therapeutic drug for leukemia. Furthermore, the apoptosisassociated protein Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)associated X protein was significantly increased, whereas Bcl2 was markedly decreased in the cells with downregulated NE. Further experiments revealed that the probable apoptosisassociated signaling pathway was the phosphoinositide 3kinase/AKT pathway. The present study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to demonstrate that GW311616A, a specific NE inhibitor, may act as a potential targeted drug for leukemia, which may have a profound impact on the future of leukemia-targeted therapy.",,"['Jiang, Kai-Ling', 'Ma, Peng-Peng', 'Yang, Xiao-Qun', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Wang, Hui', 'Zhu, Xin-Yu', 'Liu, Bei-Zhong']","['Jiang KL', 'Ma PP', 'Yang XQ', 'Zhong L', 'Wang H', 'Zhu XY', 'Liu BZ']","['Central Laboratory of YongChuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, P.R.

METHODS: Retrospective reviews were conducted for 46 patients with MDS (n = 14) and AML (n = 32) on a therapy of decitabine prior to allo-HSCT between September 2009 and February 2013. RESULTS: In MDS patients, complete remission (CR, n = 10), partial remission (PR, n = 2) and stable disease (SD, n = 1) were achieved prior to HSCT. And the remission rate of one course was 10/14. After decitabine dosing, 17/32 patients achieved CR in 32 with AML and the remission rate of one course was 53.1 (17/32) and effective rate of one course (CR+PR) achieves 78.1 (25/32). Successful engraftment was attained in all MDS patients and 12/14 patients survived disease-free and one died of pneumonia after relapse. And 28 patients with AML attained successful engraftment after using decitabine prior to allo-HSCT and there were 20 disease-free survivors. Ten patients died and another lived with tumor. The incidences of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) among evaluable patients were 4.3% (2/26) and 23.9% (11/46) respectively. After a median follow-up of 8 months for survivors, the treatment-related mortality was 23.9% (11/46). The 30-month disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 53.1% and 30-month overall survival rate after decitabine dosing 61.9%.

LRF short hairpin RNA (shRNA) suppressed the expression of LRF protein in a glioma cell line (GL261-EGFP) compared to the negative control vector-transfected glioma cells. LRF knockdown also reduced glioma cell viability and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in glioma cells. AKT activation and the expression of various cell cycle-related genes were inhibited following LRF knockdown. The effect on growth and migration is related to dose response results of AKT and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) inhibitors.

METHODS: A total of 177 newly diagnosed MM inpatients were recruited from July 2008 to July 2012. Clinical parameters at diagnosis of international staging system (ISS), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), serum calcium, extramedullary involvement and amyloidosis were collected and cytogenetic abnormalities were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Response and death were recorded as endpoints. Otherwise the follow-up period was over 24 months. RESULTS: And 73 patients dying within 24 months were classified into high-risk group while another 104 survivors for over 24 months into control group. Age and gender at baseline were comparable. However, OS of high-risk group was only 8 months while it was not attained during a median follow up of 38 months in control group (P < 0.001).

The pre-treatment percentages of the following parameters were significantly higher in high-risk group, including ISS stage III (76.71% (56/73) vs 50.00% (52/104), P = 0.002), renal dysfunction (47.95% (35/73) vs 31.73% (33/104), P = 0.029), elevated LDH (20.55% (15/73) vs 7.69% (8/104), P = 0.015) and plasma cell leukemia (PCL, 5.48% (4/73) vs 0 (0/104), P = 0.016). Conversely, extramedullary involvement, plasmacytoma, amyloidosis and hypercalcemia were similar. Despite comparable chemotherapeutic regimens, the rate of deep response, including complete response (CR) and very good partial response (VGPR), was significant lower in high-risk group than that in control group (12.33% (9/73) vs 53.85% (56/104), P < 0.001). Overall response rates (ORR, i.e. CR+VGPR+ partial response (PR)) were markedly different (38.36% (28/73) vs 86.54% (90/104), P < 0.001). Univariate analysis of cytogenetic abnormalities indicated a higher proportion of 1q21 amplification in high-risk group (35.62% (26/73) vs 25.15% (22/104), P = 0.033). Multivariate Logistic regression revealed that ISS, LDH and primary response worse than PR independently affected early death (P = 0.046, 0.005, < 0.001).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cytotoxic effects of BEZ235 and dexamethasone as single agents and in combination were assessed in a panel of ALL cell lines and xenograft models. The underlying mechanism of BEZ235 and dexamethasone was evaluated using immunoblotting, TaqMan RT-PCR, siRNA, immunohistochemistry, and immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 enhanced dexamethasone-induced anti-leukemic activity in in vitro (continuous cell lines and primary ALL cultures) and systemic in vivo models of T-ALL (including a patient-derived xenograft). Through inhibition of AKT1, BEZ235 was able to alleviate AKT1-mediated suppression of dexamethasone-induced apoptotic pathways leading to increased expression of the proapoptotic BCL-2 protein BIM. Downregulation of MCL-1 by BEZ235 further contributed to the modulation of dexamethasone resistance by increasing the amount of BIM available to induce apoptosis, especially in PTEN-null T-ALL where inhibition of AKT only partially overcame AKT-induced BIM suppression.

Aplastic anemia (AA) can remain stable for years but can become severe or transform into a myelodysplastic syndrome, acute leukemia, or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Corticosteroids and erythropoietin are ineffective for management of aplastic anemia; and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is only indicated in severe infections that do not improve with antibiotics. Supportive care with leukocyte-poor red blood cell transfusions reduces HLA antigen alloimmunization and platelet transfusion refractoriness. Horse or rabbit antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine typically is first-line therapy for patients with nonsevere AA who are transfusion-dependent, patients older than 40 years with severe AA, and patients with severe AA who lack an HLA antigen-matched sibling for bone marrow transplantation. The overall 5-year survival rate among patients taking antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine therapy is 75% to 85%. Bone marrow transplantation from an HLA antigen-matched sibling is considered the treatment of choice for severe AA in children and adults younger than 40 years. Less than approximately 33% of patients with AA have an HLA antigen-matched sibling donor, so matched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cells are increasingly used. Umbilical cord stem cell transplantation is in clinical trials.","['Written permission from the American Academy of Family Physicians is required for', 'reproduction of this material in whole or in part in any form or medium.']","['Baltierra, David', 'Harper, Tiffany', 'Jones, Matthew Page', 'Nau, Konrad C']","['Baltierra D', 'Harper T', 'Jones MP', 'Nau KC']","['West Virginia University School of Medicine Robert C.

One of such targets, cyclin A1, was shown to be overexpressed in AML including AML stem cells. However, the function of cyclin A1 in AML is largely unknown, and the data on its impact on patients' survival remain controversial. Therefore, we developed a transgenic mouse model of stem cell-directed inducible cyclin A1 overexpression and crossed these mice with PML-RARalpha-knockin mice, which develop an AML M3-like phenotype. To observe the effects of cyclin A1 loss-of-function, we also crossed PML-RARalpha-knockin mice to cyclin A1-knockout mice. Neither overexpression nor loss of cyclin A1 significantly altered leukemogenesis in PML-RARalpha-knockin mice.

Here, we describe a new method to quantitate fusion transcripts in acute myeloid leukemia by qRT-PCR without the need for standard curves. Our approach uses a plasmid calibrator containing both a fusion transcript sequence and a reference gene sequence, representing a perfect normalized copy number (fusion transcript copy number/reference gene transcript copy number; NCN) of 1.0. The NCN of patient specimens can be calculated relative to that of the single plasmid calibrator using experimentally derived PCR efficiency values. We compared the data obtained using the plasmid calibrator method to commercially available assays using standard curves and found that the results obtained by both methods are comparable over a broad range of values with similar sensitivities. Our method has the advantage of simplicity and is therefore lower in cost and may be less subject to errors that may be introduced during the generation of standard curves.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The function of AF1q is not yet fully known, however, elevated AF1q expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes in various malignancies. Here, we show that AF1q specifically binds to T-cell-factor-7 (TCF7) in the Wnt signaling pathway and results in transcriptional activation of CD44 as well as multiple downstream targets of the TCF7/LEF1. In addition, enhanced AF1q expression promotes breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, mammosphere formation, and chemo-resistance. In xenograft models, enforced AF1q expression in breast cancer cells also promotes liver metastasis and lung colonization. In a cohort of 63 breast cancer patients, higher percentages of AF1q-positive cancer cells in primary sites were associated with significantly poorer overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and brain metastasis-free survival (b-MFS). Using paired primary/metastatic samples from the same patients, we demonstrate that AF1q-positive breast cancer cells become dynamically dominant in the metastatic sites compared to the primary sites. Our findings indicate that breast cancer cells with a hyperactive AF1q/TCF7/CD44 regulatory axis in the primary sites may represent ""metastatic founder cells"" which have invasive

The first cohort of 13 was transplanted with bone marrow (BM) as the stem cell source, whereas the second cohort of 23 used peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The BM cohort received a single 60-mg/kg dose of cyclophosphamide on day +3, whereas the PBSC cohort received 2 doses on days +3 and +4. Patients in the first cohort were slightly older and had a higher proportion of acute myeloid leukemia, but there were no differences in the distribution of Disease Risk Index scores between the 2 groups. Patients in the PBSC group received double the number of CD34(+) cells in the stem cell graft. Times to neutrophil and platelet recovery were not different between the 2 groups. Three patients, all in the PBSC group, failed to engraft but recovered with autologous hemopoiesis and survived. The 6-month cumulative incidences of acute GVHD were 55.1% for BM and 48.5% for PBSCs (P = .651), whereas 24-month cumulative rates for chronic GHVD were 28.6% for BM and 32.3% for PBSCs (P = .685). Only 2 patients, both in the BM group, died of nonrelapse causes, both of second cancers. The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse were 43.9% for BM and 23.5% for PBSCs (P = .286). Overall survival at 2 years was significantly better for PBSC patients (P = .028), at 83.4% versus 52.7% for BM. Relapse-free and event-free survival did not differ significantly between BM and PBSC groups. In this retrospective analysis, we conclude that the use of PBSCs for haploidentical RIC transplants is a feasible strategy, with equivalent rates of acute and chronic GVHD and risk of relapse and low nonrelapse mortality compared with BM.","['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Treatment with vitamin B12 cures the anemia, but not the gastritis. Findings from small studies have indicated that patients with pernicious anemia could have an increased risk of cancer. METHODS: We performed a population-based, case-control study of individuals in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, comparing 1,138,390 cancer cases (age, 66-99 y) with 100,000 matched individuals without cancer (controls). Individuals with pernicious anemia were identified based on their medical claims within the year before selection for the study. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression, and models were adjusted for sex, age, and calendar year of diagnosis and selection. RESULTS: Compared with controls, we found individuals with pernicious anemia to be at increased risk for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.94-2.45) and gastric carcinoid tumors (OR, 11.43; 95% CI, 8.90-14.69). In addition, people with pernicious anemia have an increased risk of developing tonsilar cancer (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.40-2.85), hypopharyngeal cancer (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.35-2.73), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.76-2.55), small intestinal cancer (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.32-2.02), liver cancer (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.28- 1.73), myeloma (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.37-1.75), acute myeloid leukemia (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.46-1.93), and myelodysplastic syndrome (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 2.53-3.26). People with pernicious anemia have a lower risk of rectal cancer than the general population (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74- 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based, case-control study of individuals in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database, we found individuals with pernicious anemia to have significantly increased risks of gastric carcinoid tumors, adenocarcinomas, and other cancers located throughout the body.",['Copyright (c) 2015 AGA Institute.

Methods. The expression of miR-26b and Mcl-1 in HCC was detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. The regulation of Mcl-1 by miR-26b was determined by luciferase reporter assay. MTT and flow cytometry were employed to detect the cell viability and apoptosis. RESULTS: miR-26b is commonly downregulated in HCC cell lines compared with the LO2 cell line. In contrast, the Mcl-1 expression is upregulated in HCC cell lines. Bioinformatic analysis identified a putative target site in the Mcl-1 mRNA for miR-26b and luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-26b directly targeted the 3'-UTR (3'-Untranslated Regions) of Mcl-1 mRNA. Transfection of miR-26b mimics suppressed Mcl-1 expression in HCC cells and sensitized the cancer cells to TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) cytotoxicity. In addition, transfection of HCC cells with Mcl-1 expression plasmid abolished the sensitization effect of miR-26b to TRAIL-inducing apoptosis.

We also showed mutational shifts between diagnosis and relapse, with the outgrowth of a clone at relapse different from that dominant at diagnosis. Since NGS is scalable, we were able to adapt sensitivity by increasing the number of reads obtained for follow-up samples, compared to diagnosis samples.

The recombinant L-asparaginase was purified to homogeneity by nickel-affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme displayed the maximum activity at pH 8.5 and 90 degrees C, and the optimum temperature was the highest ever reported. The K m, k cat, and k cat/K m values toward L-asparagine were measured to be 6.08 mM, 3267 s(-1), and 537.3 mM(-1) s(-1), respectively.

Avocatin B reduced human primary AML cell viability without effect on normal peripheral blood stem cells. Functional stem cell assays demonstrated selectivity toward AML progenitor and stem cells without effects on normal hematopoietic stem cells. Mechanistic investigations indicated that cytotoxicity relied on mitochondrial localization, as cells lacking functional mitochondria or CPT1, the enzyme that facilitates mitochondria lipid transport, were insensitive to avocatin B. Furthermore, avocatin B inhibited fatty acid oxidation and decreased NADPH levels, resulting in ROS-dependent leukemia cell death characterized by the release of mitochondrial proteins, apoptosis-inducing factor, and cytochrome c.

Molecular anomalies are mostly epigenetic; however, mutations of CDKN1C are implicated in 8% of cases, including both sporadic and familial forms. We aimed to describe the phenotype of BWS patients with CDKN1C mutations and develop a functional test for CDKN1C mutations. For each propositus, we sequenced the three exons and intron-exon boundaries of CDKN1C in patients presenting a BWS phenotype, including abdominal wall defects, without 11p15 methylation defects. We developed a functional test based on flow cytometry. We identified 37 mutations in 38 pedigrees (50 patients and seven fetuses). Analysis of parental samples when available showed that all mutations tested but one was inherited from the mother. The four missense mutations led to a less severe phenotype (lower frequency of exomphalos) than the other 33 mutations. The following four tumors occurred: one neuroblastoma, one ganglioneuroblastoma, one melanoma, and one acute lymphoid leukemia. Cases of BWS caused by CDKN1C mutations are not rare. CDKN1C sequencing should be performed for BWS patients presenting with abdominal wall defects or cleft palate without 11p15 methylation defects or body asymmetry, or in familial cases of BWS.","['(c)

BRD4, the best studied BET protein, is implicated in a number of hematological and solid tumors. This is linked to its role in modulating transcription elongation of essential genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis such as c-Myc and BCL2. Potent BET inhibitors with promising antitumor efficacy in a number of preclinical cancer models have been identified in recent years. This led to clinical studies focusing mostly on the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma, and first encouraging signs of efficacy have already been reported.

High CD70 expression was observed on CD4 + CD25+ T cells from patients with acute-type ATL, while patients with smoldering- or chronic-type ATL and HTLV-1 carriers exhibited lower expression. Furthermore, significantly higher CD27 expression was observed on HTLV-1-specific CTLs. We found an association between CD70 expression on CD4 + T cells and HTLV-1 infection; increased CD70 expression was observed after exposure to Tax. Moreover, addition of anti-CD70 antibodies enhanced the CD107a surface mobilization of HTLV-1 Tax-specific CTLs following Tax-peptide stimulation in the PBMCs of carriers.

Alisertib is a novel oral AAK inhibitor without adverse safety signals in early-phase studies that demonstrated preliminary activity in T-cell lymphoma. This phase II study was conducted to further investigate the efficacy of alisertib in relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (PTCL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with histologically confirmed relapsed/refractory PTCL or transformed Mycosis fungoides (tMF) received alisertib 50 mg twice a day for 7 days on 21-day cycles. RESULTS: Of 37 eligible patients, the histologic subtypes enrolled included PTCL not otherwise specified (n = 13), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (n = 9), tMF (n = 7), adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (n = 4), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (n = 2), and extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (n = 2). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events in >/= 5% of patients included neutropenia (32%), anemia (30%), thrombocytopenia (24%), febrile neutropenia (14%), mucositis (11%), and rash (5%). Treatment was discontinued most commonly for disease progression. Among the PTCL subtypes, the overall response rate was 30%, whereas no responses were observed in tMF. Aurora B kinase was more commonly overexpressed than AAK in tumor specimens. Analysis of AAK, Aurora B kinase, MYC, BCL-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma, and Notch1 expression revealed no association with response. CONCLUSION: Alisertib has antitumor activity in PTCL, including heavily pretreated patients. These promising results are being further investigated in an ongoing international, randomized phase III trial comparing alisertib with investigator's choice in PTCL.",['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Barr, Paul M', 'Li, Hongli', 'Spier, Catherine', 'Mahadevan, Daruka', 'LeBlanc, Michael', 'Ul Haq, Mansoor', 'Huber, Bryan D', 'Flowers, Christopher R', 'Wagner-Johnston, Nina D', 'Horwitz, Steven M', 'Fisher, Richard I', 'Cheson, Bruce D', 'Smith, Sonali M', 'Kahl, Brad S', 'Bartlett, Nancy L', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W']","['Barr PM', 'Li H', 'Spier C', 'Mahadevan D', 'LeBlanc M', 'Ul Haq M', 'Huber BD', 'Flowers CR', 'Wagner-Johnston ND', 'Horwitz SM', 'Fisher RI', 'Cheson BD', 'Smith SM', 'Kahl BS', 'Bartlett NL', 'Friedberg JW']","['Paul M.

We also confirmed that cell type specific markers of megakaryocytes, CD41a and CD42b are induced by phytosphingosine. Phospholipids with highly similar structures were unable to induce similar changes, indicating that the activity of phytosphingosine is highly specific.

However, the results reported were not consistent. Thus, a comprehensive meta-analysis containing 12 eligible studies including 1,532 Asian patients was conducted to investigate a steady and reliable conclusion. The results showed that BIM deletion polymorphism was significantly associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) clinical efficacy in term of response rate (Ph = 0.349, HR = 0.438, 95%CI = 0.274-0.699) and disease control rate (Ph = 0.941, HR = 0.370, 95%CI = 0.202-0.678) in EGFR-mutated NSCLC population, not in CML and HCC subgroups. Additionally, EGFR-mutated NSCLC patient harbored BIM deletion polymorphism was associated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those with BIM wild polymorphism (Ph = 0.580, adjusted HR = 2.194, 95%CI = 1.710-2.814). However, no significant association was examined between BIM deletion polymorphism and overall survival (OS) and toxic adverse events in EGFR-mutated NSCLC population and it was not associated with PFS and OS in HCC subgroup. These findings revealed that BIM deletion polymorphism might be a genetic cause of intrinsic resistance to TKI therapy and it could be emerged as an independent predictor to identify patients who would benefit from TKI targeted therapy in EGFR-mutated NSCLC.",,"['Ying, Hou-Qun', 'Chen, Jie', 'He, Bang-Shun', 'Pan, Yu-Qin', 'Wang, Feng', 'Deng, Qi-Wen', 'Sun, Hui-Ling', 'Liu, Xian', 'Wang, Shu-Kui']","['Ying HQ', 'Chen J', 'He BS', 'Pan YQ', 'Wang F', 'Deng QW', 'Sun HL', 'Liu X', 'Wang SK']","['1] Medical College, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, China [2] Central Laboratory, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.', '1] Life Scientific College, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, China [2] Central Laboratory, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.', '1] Life Scientific College, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, China [2] Central Laboratory, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210006, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150615,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4466895,,2015/06/17 06:00,2016/05/25 06:00,['2015/06/17 06:00'],"['2015/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['srep11348 [pii]', '10.1038/srep11348 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Jun 15;5:11348. doi: 10.1038/srep11348.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a cross-sectional questionnaire study that administered SF-36, FACT-Leukemia and EuroQOL5D to 524 acute leukemia survivors, to compare patient-reported QOL between chemotherapy and allo-HCT, and to elucidate predictors of QOL. Patients who received chemotherapy alone had a better physical QOL than those who received allo-HCT. On the other hand, the allo-HCT group reported a better mental QOL. In the comparison of QOL in the allo-HCT patients according to the presence of GVHD at survey, patients who had GVHD symptoms experienced statistically and clinically significantly worse QOL than those who did not. In the allo-HCT patients without GVHD, the physical QOL was comparable to that in the chemotherapy patients, and they experienced significantly better mental and general QOL than the chemotherapy patients.

Dietary supplementation began on the day of LP-BM5 MuLV infection and continued for 12 weeks. Dietary supplementation of PSPE inhibited LP-BM5 MuLV-induced splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy and attenuated the suppression of T- and B-cell proliferation and T helper 1/T helper 2 cytokine imbalance in LP-BM5 MuLV-infected mice.

Previous attempts to identify causal mutations of MRKH syndrome have primarily resulted in negative outcomes. We investigated whether these reported variants are associated with MRKH syndrome (types I and II) in a relatively large sample size of Chinese Han patients, and whether any gene-gene epistatic interactions exist among these variants. METHODS: This study included 182 unrelated Chinese women with MRKH syndrome (155 with type I and 27 with type II) and 228 randomized female controls. Seventeen candidate loci in the AMH, PBX1, WNT4, WNT7A, WNT9B, HOXA10, HOXA11, LHXA1 and GALT genes were genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform. Single-marker association, additive effects and multifactor interactions were investigated. RESULTS: The gene frequency distributions of MRKH type 1 and type 2 were similar. Rs34072914 in WNT9B was found to be associated with MRKH syndrome (P = 0.024, OR = 2.65, 95%CI = 1.14-6.17). The dominant models of rs34072914 and rs2275558 in WNT9B and PBX1, respectively, were significantly associated with MRKH syndrome risk in the Chinese Han patients. Additive gene-gene interaction analyses indicated a significant synergetic interaction between WNT9B and PBX1 (RERI = 1.397, AP = 0.493, SI = 4.204). Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis revealed novel dimensional epistatic four-gene effects (AMH, PBX1, WNT7A and WNT9B) in MRKH syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: This association study successfully identified two susceptibility SNPs (WNT9B and PBX1) associated with MRKH syndrome risk, both separately and interactively. The discovery of a four-gene epistatic effect (AMH, PBX1, WNT7A and WNT9B) in MRKH syndrome provides novel information for the elucidation of the genetic mechanism underlying the etiology of MRKH syndrome.",,"['Ma, Wenqing', 'Li, Ya', 'Wang, Man', 'Li, Haixia', 'Su, Tiefen', 'Li, Yan', 'Wang, Shixuan']","['Ma W', 'Li Y', 'Wang M', 'Li H', 'Su T', 'Li Y', 'Wang S']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, P.R.

METHODS: A group of 204 consecutive patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at University Hospital Wuerzburg in Germany received an ophthalmologic examination after transplantation. TFO was measured and the chronic ocular GVHD score was calculated based on the Schirmer test, corneal fluorescein staining, conjunctival injection, Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire, and presence of systemic GVHD. RESULTS: A total of 172 patients showed no chronic ocular GVHD. Of the remaining 32 patients using the international chronic ocular GVHD score, 21 were classified as ""probably"" and 11 as ""definite"" chronic ocular GVHD. TFO was positively correlated with the new chronic ocular GVHD score (P < 0.01, r = 0.35). TFO differed significantly between patients with no ocular GVHD (300 +/- 16.5 mOsm/L) and definite ocular GVHD (337 +/- 36 mOsm/L)-a receiver operating characteristic analysis showed high discrimination capability (area under the curve: 0.91 +/- 0.04) and suggested a threshold level of the TFO value of 312 mOsm/L yielding a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 82%. CONCLUSIONS: TFO can be used for detecting chronic ocular GVHD with high sensitivity and specificity as a noninvasive objective test in addition to traditional dry eye tests.

Since both curcumin and bortezomib inhibit NF-kappaB, we tested the effects of their combination on leukemia cells. To improve potency, a novel Mannich-type curcumin derivative, C-150, was synthesized. Curcumin and its analogue showed potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on the human leukemia cell line, HL60, with different potency but similar additive properties with bortezomib. Additive antiproliferative effects were correlated well with LPS-induced NF-kappaB inhibition results. Gene expression data on cell cycle and apoptosis related genes, obtained by high-throughput QPCR, showed that curcumin and its analogue act through similar signaling pathways. In correlation with in vitro results similar additive effect could be obsereved in SCID mice inoculated systemically with HL60 cells. C-150 in a liposomal formulation given intravenously in combination with bortezomib was more efficient than either of the drugs alone. As our novel curcumin analogue exerted anticancer effects in leukemic cells at submicromolar concentration in vitro and at 3 mg/kg dose in vivo, which was potentiated by bortezomib, it holds a great promise as a future therapeutic agent in the treatment of leukemia alone or in combination.",,"['Nagy, L I', 'Feher, L Z', 'Szebeni, G J', 'Gyuris, M', 'Sipos, P', 'Alfoldi, R', 'Ozsvari, B', 'Hackler, L Jr', 'Balazs, A', 'Batar, P', 'Kanizsai, I', 'Puskas, L G']","['Nagy LI', 'Feher LZ', 'Szebeni GJ', 'Gyuris M', 'Sipos P', 'Alfoldi R', 'Ozsvari B', 'Hackler L Jr', 'Balazs A', 'Batar P', 'Kanizsai I', 'Puskas LG']","['AVIDIN Ltd., Alsokikoto Sor 11, Szeged, Hungary.', 'AVIDIN Ltd., Alsokikoto Sor 11, Szeged, Hungary.', 'AVIDIN Ltd., Alsokikoto Sor 11, Szeged, Hungary.', 'AVIDIN Ltd., Alsokikoto Sor 11, Szeged, Hungary.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Szeged, Eotvos u 6, Szeged 6720, Hungary.', 'AVIDIN Ltd., Alsokikoto Sor 11, Szeged, Hungary.', 'AVIDIN Ltd., Alsokikoto Sor 11, Szeged, Hungary.', 'AVIDIN Ltd., Alsokikoto Sor 11, Szeged, Hungary.', 'AVIDIN Ltd., Alsokikoto Sor 11, Szeged, Hungary.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Internal Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei Korut 98, Debrecen 4032, Hungary.', 'AVIDIN Ltd., Alsokikoto Sor 11, Szeged, Hungary.', 'AVIDIN Ltd., Alsokikoto Sor 11, Szeged, Hungary ; Institute of Genetics, Biological Research Center of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Temesvari Korut 62, Szeged 6726, Hungary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150517,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bortezomib/*pharmacology', 'Curcumin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4449904,,2015/06/16 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/06/16 06:00'],"['2015/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/968981 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:968981. doi: 10.1155/2015/968981.

As the inappropriate administration of empirical antibacterial may alter survival, we studied risk factors for resistance to our usual empirical first-line antibacterial therapy, cefepime. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 103 first episodes of bacteraemia recorded in our haematology department over 2.5 years. Risk factors for cefepime-resistance were identified by multivariate logistic regression with backward selection (P < 0.05). A scoring system for predicting cefepime-resistance was built on independent factor, with an internal validation by the bootstrap resampling technique. RESULTS: 38 (37%) episodes were due to Gram-negative bacteria. Fifty (49%) were due to bacteria resistant to cefepime. Cefepime resistance was significantly associated with a decreased survival at day 30 (P < 0.05).

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the best curative option not only for t(4;11) ALL, but also for t(9;22) ALL in the tyrosin-kinase inhibitors era. In the last years, low molecular level of minimal residual disease (MRD) before HSCT was reported as one of the best favourable indexes for survival in ALL. Here we observed that even these patients can show a favourable outcome if submitted to HSCT with very low MRD. METHODS: We considered 18 consecutive VHR-ALL patients eligible to HSCT. 16 of them were transplanted in first remission, as soon as possible, employing myelo-ablative conditioning regimens. Molecular MRD has been evaluated before and after HSCT. RESULTS: Immediately before HSCT, MRD revealed: complete molecular remission (MRD(neg)) for five patients, and a level <1x10(-3) for seven patients. 100 days after HSCT we had: MRD(neg) for seven patients and a decrease for all the others after HSCT. After the tapering of immunosuppressive drugs, 13 patients reached the MRD(neg) in a median time of 8 months (range 3-16). In the intention to treat analysis, 14/18 patients are alive and disease free at the date of analysis. Overall survival and event free survival is of 78% and 66% respectively, with an average follow-up of 45 months (range 6-84) since HSCT. CONCLUSION: Early transplantation with low MRD level seems to be correlated with a favourable outcome also in VHR-ALL.",,"['Parma, Matteo', 'Vigano, Clara', 'Fumagalli, Monica', 'Colnaghi, Federica', 'Colombo, Arianna', 'Mottadelli, Federica', 'Rossi, Vincenzo', 'Elli, Elena', 'Terruzzi, Elisabetta', 'Belotti, Angelo', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Pogliani, Enrico Maria', 'Pioltelli, Pietro']","['Parma M', 'Vigano C', 'Fumagalli M', 'Colnaghi F', 'Colombo A', 'Mottadelli F', 'Rossi V', 'Elli E', 'Terruzzi E', 'Belotti A', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Pogliani EM', 'Pioltelli P']","['Haematology Division and BMT Unit, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Haematology Division and BMT Unit, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Haematology Division and BMT Unit, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Haematology Division and BMT Unit, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Haematology Division and BMT Unit, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Haematology Division and BMT Unit, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Universita di Milano Bicocca.', 'Haematology Division and BMT Unit, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150601,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,PMC4450652,,2015/06/16 06:00,2015/06/16 06:01,['2015/06/16 06:00'],"['2015/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2015.041 [doi]', 'mjhid-7-1-e2015041 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2015 Jun 1;7(1):e2015041. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2015.041. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several genes mapping to the commonly deleted region of the 5q- syndrome have been implicated in disease pathogenesis in recent years. Haploinsufficiency of the ribosomal gene RPS14 has been shown to cause the erythroid defect in the 5q- syndrome. Loss of the microRNA genes miR-145 and miR-146a has been associated with the thrombocytosis observed in 5q- syndrome patients. Haploinsufficiency of CSNK1A1 leads to hematopoietic stem cell expansion in mice and may play a role in the initial clonal expansion in patients with 5q- syndrome. Moreover, a subset of patients harbor mutation of the remaining CSNK1A1 allele. Mouse models of the 5q- syndrome, which recapitulate the key features of the human disease, indicate that a p53-dependent mechanism underlies the pathophysiology of this disorder. Importantly, activation of p53 has been demonstrated in the human 5q- syndrome.

The CD44 standard isoform (CD44s) is highly expressed in many cells and most abundantly in cells of the hematopoietic system, whereas expression of CD44 variant isoforms (CD44v) is more restricted. CD44s and CD44v are known as stem cell markers, first described for hematopoietic stem cells and later on confirmed for cancer- and leukemia-initiating cells. Importantly, both abundantly expressed CD44s as well as CD44v actively contribute to the maintenance of stem cell features, like generating and embedding in a niche, homing into the niche, maintenance of quiescence, and relative apoptosis resistance. This is surprising, as CD44 is not a master stem cell gene. I here will discuss that the functional contribution of CD44 relies on its particular communication skills with neighboring molecules, adjacent cells and, last not least, the surrounding matrix. In fact, it is the interaction of the hyaluronan receptor CD44 with its prime ligand, which strongly assists stem cells to fulfill their special and demanding tasks. Recent fundamental progress in support of this ""old"" hypothesis, which may soon pave the way for most promising new therapeutics, is presented for both hematopoietic stem cell and leukemia-initiating cell. The contribution of CD44 to the generation of a stem cell niche, to homing of stem cells in their niche, to stem cell quiescence and apoptosis resistance will be in focus.",,"['Zoller, Margot']",['Zoller M'],"['Department of Tumor Cell Biology, University Hospital of Surgery , Heidelberg , Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150526,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC4443741,,2015/06/16 06:00,2015/06/16 06:01,['2015/06/16 06:00'],"['2015/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2015.00235 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2015 May 26;6:235. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2015.00235. eCollection 2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD44', 'adhesion', 'apoptosis resistance', 'bone marrow niche', 'dormancy', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'homing', 'leukemia-initiating cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The limited efficacy of the available agents (both conventional cytotoxic and novel target-specific) reflects not only the expression of defence mechanisms, but also the complexity of tumour cell alterations and the redundancy of survival pathways, thus resulting in tumour cell ability to survive under stress conditions. A well-established strategy to improve the efficacy of antitumour therapy is the rational design of drug combinations aimed at achieving synergistic effects and overcoming drug resistance. An alternative strategy could be the use of agents designed to inhibit simultaneously multiple cellular targets relevant to tumour growth/survival. Among these novel agents are hybrid bifunctional drugs, i.e. compounds resulting by conjugation of different drugs or containing the pharmocophores of different drugs. This strategy has been pursued using various conventional or target-specific agents (with DNA damaging agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors as the most exploited compounds). A critical overview of the most representative compounds is provided with emphasis on the HDAC inhibitor-based hybrid agents. In spite of some promising results, the actual pharmacological advantages of the hybrid agents remain to be defined. This commentary summarizes the recent advances in this field and highlights the pharmacological basis for a rational design of hybrid bifunctional agents.",['Copyright (c) 2015.

However, aberrant PI3K/Akt/mTOR survival signaling may confer TRAIL resistance by altering the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. In the present study, we showed that the Akt/mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human leukemic Jurkat T cells, which show PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation and basal expression levels of death receptor (DR) 5 (TRAIL-R2). Investigation of the effect of RAD001 treatment on the expression of TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-Rs) in Jurkat T cells showed that RAD001 significantly upregulated DR5 by up to 51.22%, but not other TRAIL-Rs such as DR4 (TRAIL-R1), decoy receptor (DcR) 1 (TRAIL-R3), and DcR2 (TRAIL-R4). Pretreatment with DR5:Fc chimera abrogated the RAD001-induced increase of TRAIL cytotoxicity, indicating that the upregulation of DR5 by RAD001 plays a role in enhancing the susceptibility of Jurkat T cells to TRAIL.

We report on three cases of delayed elimination of methotrexate in children with chromosome Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated concomitantly with imatinib. CASE SUMMARY: Three patients, aged 9-17 years, presented with high methotrexate blood levels following co-administration of imatinib and high-dose methotrexate. Two patients presented with clinical symptoms (nausea, epigastric pain and mucositis, acute renal failure, liver cytolysis). One patient required extra supplementary folinic acid doses than used in the standard protocol and one child required the use of carboxypeptidase-G2. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: There is an apparent pharmacokinetic interaction between imatinib and methotrexate in children. Several mechanisms could explain this interaction, including competition for BCRP or ABCB transporters.

However, the role of PAX5 in human lymphoma remains unclear. We generated PAX5-silenced cells using mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) as a model system. These PAX5(-) MCL cells exhibited unexpected phenotypes, including increased proliferation in vitro, enhanced tumor infiltration in vivo, robust adhesion to the bone marrow stromal cells and increased retention of quiescent stem-like cells. These phenotypes were attributed to alterations in the expression of genes including p53 and Rb, and to phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway hyperactivation. On PAX5 silencing, the MCL cells displayed upregulated interleukin (IL)-6 expression and increased responses to paracrine IL-6. Moreover, decreased PAX5 levels in CD19+ MCL cells correlated with their increased infiltration and progression; thus, PAX5 levels can be used as a prognostic marker independent of cyclin D1 in advanced MCL patients. Importantly, high-throughput screening of 3800 chemical compounds revealed that PAX5(-) MCL cells are highly drug-resistant compared with PAX5 wild-type MCL cells. Collectively, the results of our study support a paradigm shift regarding the functions of PAX5 in human B-cell cancer and encourage future efforts to design effective therapies against MCL.",,"['Teo, A E', 'Chen, Z', 'Miranda, R N', 'McDonnell, T', 'Medeiros, L J', 'McCarty, N']","['Teo AE', 'Chen Z', 'Miranda RN', 'McDonnell T', 'Medeiros LJ', 'McCarty N']","['Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Brown Foundation, Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Diseases (IMM), University of Texas-Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Brown Foundation, Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Diseases (IMM), University of Texas-Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Brown Foundation, Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Diseases (IMM), University of Texas-Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA181319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000371/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20150515,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4644730,['NIHMS690174'],2015/06/16 06:00,2016/07/20 06:00,['2015/06/16 06:00'],"['2015/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015140 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.140 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Mar;30(3):580-93. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.140.

It is therefore essential to elucidate the current features of ATL. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 81 patients with aggressive type ATL at our institution over a 7-year period based on Shimoyama's diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients with a median age of 67.5 years were classified as having acute (n=47), lymphoma (n=32), or chronic type (n=2) ATL. They were initially treated by either palliative therapy (n=25) or systemic chemotherapy [n=56; cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) therapy (n=25)/vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VCAP)-doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone (AMP)-vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone (VECP) therapy (VCAP-AMP-VECP) or CHOP-VMMV therapy (n=31)], and showed median survival durations of 16 and 277 days, respectively. Subsequent to the initial treatment, HSCT (n=6) was performed for certain patients, thus revealing that two-thirds (n=4) relapsed, and one-third (n=2) survived for 131 days and 203 days, respectively. The relapsed ATL patients were treated with conventional salvage therapy (n=29) or anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 antibody (mogamulizumab) (n=3). The patients treated with mogamulizumab demonstrated complete response (2) and partical response (1) with short duration periods of 82 days, 83 days, and 192 days, respectively. Among the five long-term survivors (>5 years) who received chemotherapy, most showed a low and intermediate risk according to the ATL prognostic index. CONCLUSION: In our study, the overall survival of ATL remains poor due to the advanced age of the patients at diagnosis, a high proportion of patients receiving palliative therapy, and a small proportion of long-term survivors receiving chemotherapy and undergoing HSCT.

In the present study, we used mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to determine how BRAF inhibition remodeled the signaling network of melanoma cell lines that were BRAF mutant and PTEN null. Short-term BRAF inhibition was associated with marked changes in fibronectin-based adhesion signaling that were PTEN dependent. These effects were recapitulated through BRAF siRNA knockdown and following treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. Increased fibronectin expression was also observed in mouse xenograft models as well as specimens from melanoma patients undergoing BRAF inhibitor treatment. Analysis of a melanoma tissue microarray showed loss of PTEN expression to predict for a lower overall survival, with a trend for even lower survival being seen when loss of fibronectin was included in the analysis. Mechanistically, the induction of fibronectin limited the responses of these PTEN-null melanoma cell lines to vemurafenib, with enhanced cytotoxicity observed following the knockdown of either fibronectin or its receptor alpha5beta1 integrin. This in turn abrogated the cytotoxic response to BRAF inhibition via increased AKT signaling, which prevented the induction of cell death by maintaining the expression of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1.

Despite successful treatment outcomes and the rate of survival at 5 to 10 years being 95%, survivors can experience late effects of both their cancer and the treatment they received, including secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs). We discuss the development of non-germ cell SMNs that develop after diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer and their effect on mortality. RESULTS: Patients diagnosed with testicular cancer frequently choose postoperative surveillance if they are diagnosed with clinical stage I disease. These patients may experience an increased risk for developing SMNs following radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging. Similarly, radiotherapy for testicular cancer is associated with increased risks of developing both solid tumors and leukemia. Studies have reported that patients exposed to higher doses of radiation have an increased risk of developing SMNs when compared with patients who received lower doses of radiation. Patients treated with chemotherapy also experience an increased risk of developing SMNs following testicular cancer, though the risk following chemotherapy and radiation therapy combined is not well described. A large population-based study concluded that the rate ratios for both cancer-specific and all-cause mortality for SMNs among testicular cancer survivors were not significantly different from those of matched first cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is known that patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy or who undergo routine diagnostic or follow-up imaging for a primary testicular cancer are at an increased risk for developing SMNs, the extent of this risk is largely unknown.

Recently, the heteromeric transcription factor GA-binding protein (GABP) was found to promote CML-like myeloproliferative disease in mice. In a cohort of 70 CML patients, we found that expression of the GABP alpha subunit (GABPalpha) is positively correlated to the BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio. Moreover, significantly higher GABPalpha expression was detected in blast crisis than in chronic phase CML after performing data mining on 91 CML patients. In functional studies, imatinib sensitivity is enhanced after GABPalpha knockdown in tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)-sensitive K-562, as well as by overexpression of a deletion mutant in TKI-resistant NALM-1 cells. Moreover, in K-562 cells, GABP-dependent expression variations of PRKD2 and RAC2, relevant signaling mediators in CML, were observed. Notably, protein kinase D2 (Prkd2) was reported to be a GABP target gene in mice. In line with this, we detected a positive correlation between GABPA and PRKD2 expression in primary human CML, indicating that the effects of GABP are mediated by PRKD2. These findings illustrate an important role for GABP in disease development and imatinib sensitivity in human CML.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Functionally, loss of MYST2 accelerated leukemic growth and colony formation, while forced expression of MYST2 induced H4K5 acetylation (H4K5Ac) and suppressed hematopoietic progenitor cell growth. Consistently, global H4K5Ac levels were frequently decreased in AML blasts. Low levels of H4K5Ac were most prominent in patients with complex karyotype AML and were associated with inferior overall survival in univariate but not multivariate analysis. ChIP-seq experiments in primary AML patients' blasts revealed widespread H4K5Ac deregulation, most prominent at gene promoters. Taken together, MYST2 is a repressed growth suppressor in AML mediating reduced acetylation of histone 4 at residue 5 and is associated with inferior AML patient survival.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanisms by which IFNalpha affects disease-initiating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) remain poorly understood. Although IFNalpha has been found to transiently impair quiescence of murine hematopoietic stem cells, its effects on human HSPCs have not been studied in vivo. Here, we compared bone marrow serially obtained from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms before and during pegylated IFNalpha treatment against marrow serially obtained from patients on hydroxyurea. The percentage of HSPCs actively undergoing cell cycle was increased after pegylated IFNalpha treatment in a majority of patients compared with hydroxyurea-treated controls, suggesting that IFNalpha promotes cell division. Furthermore, transcriptional profiling revealed that cell cycle-associated genes were induced, whereas genes involved in HSPC quiescence were repressed during IFNalpha treatment. Compared with hydroxyurea-treated controls, pegylated IFNalpha-treated patients had similar numbers of HSPCs, but increased numbers of hematopoietic progenitors as determined by colony formation assay, indicating an increase in myeloid proliferation/differentiation. These effects occurred regardless of JAK2 mutational status. Together, these data provide the first in vivo evidence that pegylated IFNalpha promotes cell division and differentiation of human HSPCs.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, there is striking lack of published data regarding such experience in the developing countries. Therefore, the goal of this study is to prospectively evaluate CT request forms to assess how many children could be protected from harmful radiation exposure if 'Justification' and 'Optimization' principles of ALARA are applied before obtaining CT imaging in a developing country. This can save children from potential radiation risks including development of brain cancer and leukemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive CT request forms over a six month study period (May 16, 2013 to November 15, 2013) in a tertiary pediatric children's hospital in India were prospectively reviewed by two pediatric radiologists before obtaining CT imaging. First, 'Justification' of CT was evaluated and then 'Optimization' was applied for evaluation of appropriateness of the requested CT studies. The number (and percentage) of CT studies avoided by applying 'Justification' and 'Optimization' principle of ALARA were calculated. The difference in number of declined and optimized CT requests between CT requests from inpatient and outpatient departments was compared using Chi-Square test. RESULTS: A total of 1302 consecutive CT request forms were received during the study period. Some of the request forms (n=86; 6.61%) had requests for more than one (multiple) anatomical regions, hence, a total of 1392 different anatomical CT requests were received. Based on evaluation of the CT request forms for 'Justification' and 'Optimization' principle of ALARA by pediatric radiology reviewers, 111 individual anatomic part CT requests from 105 pediatric patients were avoided. Therefore, 8.06% (105 out of 1302 pediatric patients) were protected from unnecessary or additional radiation exposure.The rates of declined or optimized CT requests from inpatient department was significantly higher than that from outpatient departments (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of pediatric patients, particularly coming from outpatient departments, can be protected from unnecessary or additional radiation exposure from CT imaging when 'Justification' and 'Optimization' principle of ALARA are applied before obtaining CT imaging in a developing country.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In addition to drug treatment, the adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells to restore cellular immunity has become a standard therapy after allogeneic HSCT. We recently demonstrated potent anti-leukemic activity of interleukin (IL)-15-activated cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells. With the use of the same expansion protocol, we asked whether concurrent CMV antigen-pulsing might generate CIK cells with anti-leukemic and anti-CMV activity. METHODS: CIK cells expanded in the presence of interferon-gamma, IL-2, IL-15 and anti-CD3 antibody were pulsed once with CMV(pp65) peptide pool. CMV-specific CIK (CIK(pp65)) and conventional CIK cells were phenotypically and functionally characterized according to their cytokine secretion pattern, degranulation capacity and T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated and NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity. RESULTS: We demonstrated that among CIK cells generated from CMV-seropositive donors, a single stimulation with CMV(pp65) protein co-expanded cytotoxic CMV-specific cells without sacrificing anti-tumor reactivity. Cells generated in this fashion lysed CMV(pp65)-loaded target cells and CMV-infected fibroblasts but also leukemic cells. Meanwhile, the alloreactive potential of CIK(pp65) cells remained low. Interestingly, CMV reactivity was TCR-mediated and CMV-specific cells could be found in CD3(+)CD8(+)CD56(+/-) cytotoxic T-cell subpopulations. CONCLUSIONS: We provide an efficient method to generate CIK(pp65) cells that may represent a useful cell therapy approach for preemptive immunotherapy in patients who have both an apparent risk of CMV and impending leukemic relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Copyright (c) 2015 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

This study examined the associations between dietary factors and the risk of adult leukemia in Chinese populations. METHODS: A multicenter case-control study was conducted in southeast and northeast China between 2008 and 2013. It included 442 incident cases with hematologically confirmed leukemia and 442 controls, individually match to cases by gender, birth quinquennium, and study site. Information on diet was sought from face-to-face interviews using a validated and reliable 103-item food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Vegetables intake was associated with decreased risk of adult leukemia, with a significant dose-response relationship and adjusted OR of 0.30 (95 % CI 0.18-0.50) for the highest versus the lowest quartiles intake. Compared with non-consumers, the adjusted OR was 0.51 (95 % CI 0.29-0.93) for those who consumed milk at the highest tertile. Intakes of fruits, red meat, poultry, and fish were not associated with the risk. Dietary nutrients, including dietary fiber, carotenoids, vitamins B1, B2, and C, niacin, and folate, were significantly associated with reduced risks. Elevated risk was related to dietary intake animal fat and dietary habits with frequent intakes of fat, deep-fried, and smoked foods ( p for trend <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that diets rich in vegetables and adequate amount of milk reduce the risk of adult leukemia, whereas diets preferring fat, deep-fried, and smoked foods increase the risk in Chinese populations.",,"['Liu, Ping', ""Holman, C D'Arcy J"", 'Jin, Jie', 'Zhang, Min']","['Liu P', 'Holman CD', 'Jin J', 'Zhang M']","['School of Population Health, The University of Western Australia, M431, 135 Stirling Highway, Crawley, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150614,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['0 (Dietary Fiber)', '0 (Vitamins)', '2679MF687A (Niacin)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'TLM2976OFR (Riboflavin)', 'X66NSO3N35 (Thiamine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Carotenoids', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China/epidemiology', '*Diet', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Folic Acid', 'Food', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Niacin', 'Odds Ratio', 'Riboflavin', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Thiamine', 'Vitamins']",,,2015/06/15 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/06/15 06:00'],"['2014/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-015-0608-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2015 Aug;26(8):1141-51. doi: 10.1007/s10552-015-0608-2.

Case-specific information regarding flow cytometric, morphologic, and laboratory findings of this subtype of leukemia is currently lacking. METHODS: We searched the databases of three large institutions for lymphoblastic leukemia with iAMP21 from 2005 through 2012 and analyzed the clinicopathologic features. RESULTS: We identified 17 cases with five or more RUNX1 signals on interphase nuclei, 14 of which were consistent with the Children's Oncology Group (COG) definition for iAMP21-namely, the presence of three or more RUNX1 signals on one marker chromosome. These cases showed a statistically significant lower peripheral WBC count and older age at diagnosis compared with all pediatric cases of B-ALL. We also identified three cases with increased RUNX1 signals scattered on multiple marker chromosomes that did not meet the COG definition of iAMP21 but showed similar 21q instability and older age at presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings not only demonstrate that B-ALL with iAMP21 is truly a distinct clinicopathologic entity but also suggest that a subset of cases of B-ALL with iAMP21 can show variable cytogenetic features.",['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],"['Johnson, Ryan C', 'Weinberg, Olga K', 'Cascio, Michael J', 'Dahl, Gary V', 'Mitton, Bryan A', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Cherry, Athena M', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Ohgami, Robert S']","['Johnson RC', 'Weinberg OK', 'Cascio MJ', 'Dahl GV', 'Mitton BA', 'Silverman LB', 'Cherry AM', 'Arber DA', 'Ohgami RS']","['From the Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA; ryancj@stanford.edu.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA; and."", 'Oregon Health and Science University, Portland.', 'From the Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA;', 'From the Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA;', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA; and."", 'From the Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA;', 'From the Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA;', 'From the Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA;']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/06/14 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/06/14 06:00'],"['2015/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['144/1/103 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPLUYF11HQBYRB [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2015 Jul;144(1):103-12. doi: 10.1309/AJCPLUYF11HQBYRB.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Clinical and molecular epidemiology', 'Cytogenetics and molecular genetics', 'Flow cytometry', 'Hematopathology', 'Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'iAMP21']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, however, only a small number of non-HCL, splenic B-cell lymphomas have been examined by IHC. METHODS: We analyzed 121 cases, including 26 HCLs, 52 non-HCL splenic lymphomas, 22 chronic lymphocytic leukemias/small lymphocytic lymphomas (CLLs/SLLs), and 21 plasma cell neoplasms (PCNs) for BRAF V600E expression by IHC. Molecular testing for BRAF V600E was performed in a subset of cases, using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and/or Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Twenty-six (100%) of 26 HCL cases were positive by IHC vs one (1%) of 95 non-HCL cases. Positive staining was identified in one (2%) of 44 splenic marginal zone lymphomas (SMZLs), while each of 22 CLLs/SLLs, 21 PCNs, six unclassifiable splenic lymphomas, and two HCL variants were negative. IHC and molecular results were concordant in all cases examined (21 HCLs and 21 non-HCLs, including the BRAF+ SMZLs). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of BRAF V600E by IHC is useful in the distinction of HCLs from other splenic-based lymphomas, although the identification of at least rare SMZLs containing this abnormality illustrates the continuing need for a multiparameter approach to diagnosis.",['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],"['Turakhia, Samir', 'Lanigan, Christopher', 'Hamadeh, Fatima', 'Swerdlow, Steven H', 'Tubbs, Raymond R', 'Cook, James R']","['Turakhia S', 'Lanigan C', 'Hamadeh F', 'Swerdlow SH', 'Tubbs RR', 'Cook JR']","['From Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, and.', 'From Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, and.', 'From Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'From Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, and.', 'From Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, and cookj2@ccf.org.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Aged', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics']",,,2015/06/14 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/06/14 06:00'],"['2015/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['144/1/87 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCP5WVXJ2KTLODO [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2015 Jul;144(1):87-93. doi: 10.1309/AJCP5WVXJ2KTLODO.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BRAF', 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'Immunohistochemistry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The detection of isolated del(5q) in patients following therapies for various malignancies raises serious concern for an emerging t-MN. METHODS: We identified 25 patients who developed isolated del(5q) following cytotoxic therapy (n = 21) or tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; n = 4) therapy. Twenty-four patients had an interstitial and one had a terminal 5q deletion. The 5q31/EGR1 gene was deleted in 20 patients and intact in five patients. The clone size as assessed by metaphase analysis was minor (10%-30%) in 12 patients and large (45%-100%) in 13 patients. After a median follow-up of 17 months, none of the 12 patients with a minor del(5q) clone developed t-MN; del(5q) disappeared in four patients and persisted in eight patients. By contrast, 12 of 13 patients with a large del(5q) clone developed t-MN, and del(5q) was persistent in all patients who had follow-up cytogenetic testing.

Genetic abnormalities associated with AML-MRC are often associated with adverse prognostic features, and many cases are preceded by a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm. METHODS: Although the criteria of 20% or more blasts in blood or bone marrow and multilineage dysplasia affecting 50% or more of cells in two or more of the myeloid lineages seem straightforward for AML-MRC, identification of morphologic dysplasia among observers is not always consistent, and there is morphologic overlap with other leukemic disorders such as acute erythroleukemia. RESULTS: Session 3 of the workshop cases displayed heterogeneity as expected within AML-MRC, yet several cases suggested that recently recognized entities may exist within this category, such as familial MDS/AML predisposition syndromes and rare cases of high-risk AML associated with the cryptic t(5;11)(q35;p15);NUP98-NSD1 that may masquerade as a del(5q). However, most cases of AML-MRC were usually associated with adverse genetic abnormalities, particularly -5/del(5q), -7/del(7q), and/or complex karyotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-genome sequencing and array studies may identify genetic abnormalities, such as those affecting TP53, which may provide prognostic information.",['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],"['Vardiman, James', 'Reichard, Kaaren']","['Vardiman J', 'Reichard K']","['From the Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, IL and James.Vardiman@uchospitals.edu.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology', 'Nucleophosmin']",,,2015/06/14 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/06/14 06:00'],"['2015/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['144/1/29 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCP58RSMFRHLHHH [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2015 Jul;144(1):29-43. doi: 10.1309/AJCP58RSMFRHLHHH.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Acute leukemia', 'Myelodysplasia', 'NPM1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Among 22 AML cases submitted, 14 had the NPM1 mutation, most also accompanied by mutations of other genes such as FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A, or, rarely, TP53; three cases had the heterozygous CEBPA mutation; and two cases had MYC amplification. RESULTS: We explored prognostic implications of gene mutations such as DNMT3A, issues related to the classification of AML cases with the NPM1 mutation, and myelodysplasia-related changes arising from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia after a short latency interval. Disparate patterns of treatment response to targeted therapy using an FLT3 inhibitor, designated as cytotoxic or differentiation, and their genetic underpinnings were described. Finally, a minimal screening panel for gene mutations and the optimal approach for monitoring minimal residual disease were discussed.

METHODS: Based on World Health Organization 2008 criteria, seven specific translocations are defined as ""recurrent"" in AML. Of these seven, three are considered to be AML defining regardless of blast percentage. Workshop cases provided the opportunity to consider potential new AML-defining cytogenetic mutations, as well as other unique aspects of AML with cytogenetic abnormalities. RESULTS: Most of the 38 cases submitted were acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1) and so-called variants (12 cases), AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22) (seven cases), AML with inv(3)(q11q26.2) (six cases), and AML with 11q23 translocations (five cases). CONCLUSIONS: This review focuses on providing updated recommendations for the rapid diagnosis of APL, discussing the types and significance of variant RARA mutations in APL-like leukemias, and refining low-blast-count (oligoblastic) AML.

Patterns of late effects include deficits in attention and concentration, working memory, processing speed, and executive function, as well as other domains. As childhood cancer survivors are living longer, ameliorating deficits both in broad and specific neurocognitive domains has been increasingly recognized as an endeavor of paramount importance. Interventions to improve cognitive functioning were first applied to the field of pediatric oncology in the 1990s, based on strategies used effectively with adults who had sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Compilation and modification of these techniques has led to the development of structured cognitive training programs, with the effectiveness and feasibility of such interventions currently an active area of research. Consequently, the purpose of this critical review is to: (1) review cognitive training programs intended to remediate or prevent neurocognitive deficits in pediatric cancer patients and survivors, (2) critically analyze training program strengths and weaknesses to inform practice, and (3) provide recommendations for future directions of clinical care and research.",,"['Olson, Katie', 'Sands, Stephen A']","['Olson K', 'Sands SA']","[""a Children's National Medical Center , Divisions of Hematology and Oncology , Washington , DC , USA."", 'b Columbia University Medical Center, Herbert Irving Division of Child & Adolescent Oncology , New York , NY , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150612,England,Child Neuropsychol,Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence,9512515,,IM,"['Adult', '*Attention', 'Child', '*Cognition', 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/*education', 'Executive Function', 'Humans', '*Memory, Short-Term', 'Neoplasms/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Neuropsychology', 'Pediatrics', 'Survivors/*psychology']",,,2015/06/14 06:00,2016/09/30 06:00,['2015/06/14 06:00'],"['2015/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/09297049.2015.1049941 [doi]'],ppublish,Child Neuropsychol. 2016;22(5):509-36. doi: 10.1080/09297049.2015.1049941.

In this article, we discuss important practice points that may impact upon questions of therapy of primary and metastatic GIST, with the hope that the questions addressed in this rare solid tumor can serve as examples of what can be achieved with kinase-directed therapies in other cancers. We present cases that highlight some of the key issues in GIST management and afterward discuss both points of consensus and controversial issues in what is now recognized as one of the most common forms of sarcoma. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) has become sophisticated with the availability of three approved agents in many countries and 15 years of experience with primary and metastatic disease.

Identification of circulating markers associated with BLBC could have promise in detecting and managing this deadly disease. METHODS: Using samples from the Polish Breast Cancer study, a high-quality population-based case-control study of breast cancer, we screened 10,000 antigens on protein arrays using 45 BLBC patients and 45 controls, and identified 748 promising plasma autoantibodies (AAbs) associated with BLBC. ELISA assays of promising markers were performed on a total of 145 BLBC cases and 145 age-matched controls. Sensitivities at 98% specificity were calculated and a BLBC classifier was constructed. RESULTS: We identified 13 AAbs (CTAG1B, CTAG2, TP53, RNF216, PPHLN1, PIP4K2C, ZBTB16, TAS2R8, WBP2NL, DOK2, PSRC1, MN1, TRIM21) that distinguished BLBC from controls with 33% sensitivity and 98% specificity. We also discovered a strong association of TP53 AAb with its protein expression (P = 0.009) in BLBC patients. In addition, MN1 and TP53 AAbs were associated with worse survival [MN1 AAb marker HR = 2.25, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-4.91; P = 0.04; TP53, HR = 2.02, 95% CI, 1.06-3.85; P = 0.03]. We found limited evidence that AAb levels differed by demographic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: These AAbs warrant further investigation in clinical studies to determine their value for further understanding the biology of BLBC and possible detection. IMPACT: Our study identifies 13 AAb markers associated specifically with BLBC and may improve detection or management of this deadly disease.",['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Wang, Jie', 'Figueroa, Jonine D', 'Wallstrom, Garrick', 'Barker, Kristi', 'Park, Jin G', 'Demirkan, Gokhan', 'Lissowska, Jolanta', 'Anderson, Karen S', 'Qiu, Ji', 'LaBaer, Joshua']","['Wang J', 'Figueroa JD', 'Wallstrom G', 'Barker K', 'Park JG', 'Demirkan G', 'Lissowska J', 'Anderson KS', 'Qiu J', 'LaBaer J']","['Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona.', 'Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona.', 'Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona.', 'Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona.', 'M.

Through an unbiased genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis, we have found that 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, 5-LO) which is a key enzyme of leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis, is a direct target gene of p53 and its expression is induced by genotoxic stress via actinomycin D (Act.D) or etoposide (Eto) treatment. 5-LO and LTs play a role in immunological diseases as well as in tumorigenesis and tumor growth. p53 binds to a specific binding site consisting of a complete p53 consensus-binding motif in ALOX5 intron G which is located about 64kbp downstream of the transcriptional start site. We confirmed the strong binding of p53 to the 5-LO target site in ChIP-qPCR experiments. Expression analyses by qRT-PCR and immunoblot further revealed that genotoxic stress induces the ALOX5 mRNA and protein expression in a p53-dependent manner. Knockdown of p53 in U2OS cells leads to a downregulation of 5-LO mRNA and protein expression. In addition, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays indicate the direct binding of 5-LO to p53 protein. Furthermore, we found that 5-LO can inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 suggesting that 5-LO acts in a negative feedback loop to limit induction of p53 target genes.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While the UAB study followed SBR workers, risk calculations can be adapted to estimate both occupational and general population risks. The data from the UAB SBR study offer an opportunity to quantitatively evaluate the association between cumulative exposure to BD and different types of cancer, accounting for the number of tasks involving high-intensity exposures to BD as well as confounding associated with the exposures to the multiple other chemicals in the SBR industry. Quantitative associations of BD exposure and cancer, specifically leukemia, can be further characterized by leukemia type, including potential associations with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and the groups of lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms. Collectively, these multiple evaluations lead to a comprehensive analysis that makes use of all of the available information and is consistent with the risk assessment goals of the USEPA and other regulatory agencies, and in line with the recommendations of the USEPA Science Advisory Board. While a range of cancer risk values can result from these multiple factors, a preferred case for occupational and general population risk is highlighted. Cox proportional hazards models are used to fit exposure-response models to the most recent UAB data. The slope of the model with cumulative BD ppm-years as the predictor variable is not statistically significantly greater than zero for CML, AML, or, when any one of eight exposure covariates is added to the model, for all leukemias combined. The slope for CLL is statistically significantly different from zero. The slope for myeloid neoplasms is not statistically significantly greater than zero while the slope for lymphoid neoplasms is statistically significantly greater than zero. The excess risk for the general population is largest for lymphoid neoplasms. The best estimates of the environmental concentrations (ECs) associated with an excess risk of 1/100,000 by age 70 years for lymphoid neoplasms, all leukemias, and CLL are EC(1/100,000)'s equal to 0.06, 0.16 and 0.38 ppm, respectively. The best estimates of the occupational BD exposure from 20 to 65 years of age associated with an excess risk of 1/10,000 by age 70 years for lymphoid neoplasms, all leukemias, and CLL are the EC(1/10,000)'s of 2.7, 7.3 and 15.1 ppm, respectively.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Our findings implicate a supporting role for fatty acid metabolism in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell survival. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, a major transcriptional regulator of fatty acid oxidation, was recently shown to be upregulated in CLL. To evaluate PPARalpha as a potential therapeutic target, we developed a highly selective, potent small molecule antagonist of PPARalpha, NXT629. NXT629 inhibited agonist-induced transcription of PPARalpha-regulated genes, demonstrating target engagement in CLL cells. Furthermore, NXT629 induced apoptosis of CLL cells even in the presence of a protective microenvironment. To mimic the proliferative lymphoid compartment of CLL, we examined the activity of NXT629 on CLL cells that were stimulated to proliferate in vitro. NXT629 reduced the number of leukemia cells undergoing cell division. In addition, in two xenograft mouse models of CLL (one a model for nondividing and one for dividing CLL), NXT629 reduced the number of viable CLL cells in vivo. Overall, these results suggest that fatty acid metabolism promotes survival and proliferation of primary CLL cells and that inhibiting PPARalpha gene regulation could be a new therapeutic approach to treating CLL.",,"['Messmer, Davorka', 'Lorrain, Kymmy', 'Stebbins, Karin', 'Bravo, Yalda', 'Stock, Nicholas', 'Cabrera, Geraldine', 'Correa, Lucia', 'Chen, Austin', 'Jacintho, Jason', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Yan, Xiao Jie', 'Spaner, David', 'Prasit, Peppi', 'Lorrain, Daniel']","['Messmer D', 'Lorrain K', 'Stebbins K', 'Bravo Y', 'Stock N', 'Cabrera G', 'Correa L', 'Chen A', 'Jacintho J', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Yan XJ', 'Spaner D', 'Prasit P', 'Lorrain D']","['Inception Sciences, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Inception Sciences, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Inception Sciences, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Inception Sciences, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Inception Sciences, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Inception Sciences, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Inception Sciences, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Inception Sciences, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Inception Sciences, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, New York, United States of America.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, New York, United States of America.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Inception Sciences, San Diego, California, United States of America.', 'Inception Sciences, San Diego, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150609,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (NXT629)', '0 (PPAR alpha)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'PPAR alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage', 'Transcriptional Activation']",PMC4559529,,2015/06/13 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/06/13 06:00'],"['2015/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2015.00139 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2015.00139 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2015 Jun 9;21:410-9. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2015.00139.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an evolutionally conserved protein that shares high similarity across all species. TBL1XR1 is essential for transcriptional repression mediated by unliganded nuclear receptors (NRs) and othe regulated transcription factors (TFs). However, it can also act as a transcription activator through the recruitment of the ubiquitin-conjugating/19S proteasome complex that mediates the exchange of corepressors for coactivators. TBL1XR1 is required for the activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways. TBL1XR1 germline mutations and recurrent mutations are linked to intellectual disability. Upregulation of TBL1XR1 is observed in a variety of solid tumors, which is associated with advanced tumor stage, metastasis and poor prognosis. A variety of genomic alterations, such as translocation, deletion and mutation have been identified in many types of neoplasms. Loss of TBL1XR1 in B-lymphoblastic leukemia disrupts glucocorticoid receptor recruitment to chromatin and results in glucocorticoid resistance. However, the mechanisms of other types of genomic changes in tumorogenesis are still not clear. A pre-clinical study has shown that the disruption of the interaction between TBL1X and beta-catenin using a small molecule can inhibit the growth of AML stem and blast cells both in vitro and in vivo.

This study aimed to investigate the roles of LRF in chondrogenic differentiation of primary human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). DESIGN: LRF was overexpressed in BMSC by lentiviral transduction. Chondrogenic differentiation of BMSC was induced by high-density pellet culture. Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to investigate changes in protein and mRNA levels, respectively, during chondrogenesis. Safranin-O staining, immunohistochemistry, and glycoaminoglycan contents were used to assess cartilage matrix deposition. BMSC proliferation was determined by mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and cell counting. Cell cycle profiling was performed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: LRF overexpression effectively inhibited protein and mRNA expression of chondrocyte markers and cartilage matrix deposition during chondrogenesis of BMSC. Endogenous LRF expression was constitutively high in undifferentiated BMSC but remained low in primary articular chondrocytes. Endogenous LRF protein was downregulated in a time-dependent manner during chondrogenesis. BMSCs overexpressing LRF had higher proliferation rates and cell population in the S phase. LRF suppressed p53 expression during chondrogenesis and this might prevent differentiating chondrocytes from entering a quiescent state. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that LRF is important for stimulating stem cell proliferation and cell cycle progression.

Recently, much attention has been given to nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems loaded with dual drugs to improve current disease therapies by overcoming toxicity. In the present study, we document to explore an approach to conjugate gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with protein toxin (NKCT1), a protein toxin from the Indian cobra (Naja kaouthia) venom, and to establish its antileukemic activity. GNP was prepared by NaBH4 reduction method. UV-vis spectroscopy of GNP showed the absorbance at 530 nm for plasma resonance. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) size of GNPs was 2-8 nm and the GNP-NKCT1 was 68-122 nm. CD spectra of GNP-NKCT1 showed change in percentage of beta-turn as compared with NKCT1. GNP-NKCT1 significantly inhibited leukemic cell growth in dose- and time-dependent manner by two- to threefold more than NKCT1. For human leukemic lymphoma cell line and human myelogenous leukemic cell line, the IC50 dose was found to be 1.2 and 0.75 mug/ml, respectively, observed by trypan blue exclusion method and tetrazolium bromide reduction assay. Flow cytometric analysis showed appreciable number of both cell lines in early and late apoptotic stages and arrested cell cycle in the G1 phase by GNP-NKCT1. Resilient power of leukemic cell line after wound healing and migration or invasive power of the cell line was significantly low in GNP-NKCT1-treated plate than the control plate. These analyses reveal that GNP-NKCT1 possesses significant and selective anticancer activity, likely by inducing programmed cell death through mitochondrial and/or lysosomal pathway.",,"['Bhowmik, Tanmoy', 'Saha, Partha Pratim', 'Dasgupta, Anjan', 'Gomes, Antony']","['Bhowmik T', 'Saha PP', 'Dasgupta A', 'Gomes A']","['Laboratory of Toxinology & Experimental Pharmacodynamics, Department of Physiology, University of Calcutta, 92 APC Road, Kolkata, 700009 India.', 'Laboratory of Toxinology & Experimental Pharmacodynamics, Department of Physiology, University of Calcutta, 92 APC Road, Kolkata, 700009 India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Calcutta, 35 Ballygunge Circular Road, Ballygunge, Kolkata, 700019 India.', 'Laboratory of Toxinology & Experimental Pharmacodynamics, Department of Physiology, University of Calcutta, 92 APC Road, Kolkata, 700009 India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20130410,Austria,Cancer Nanotechnol,Cancer nanotechnology,101516978,,,,PMC4451861,,2013/01/01 00:00,2013/01/01 00:01,['2015/06/13 06:00'],"['2013/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2013/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12645-013-0036-5 [doi]', '36 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Nanotechnol. 2013;4(1-3):39-55. doi: 10.1007/s12645-013-0036-5.

Cisplatin-DMSO adduct formation was studied by continuously monitoring the increase in absorption peaks for 30 minutes using UV-spectrophotometer. RESULTS: 0.1-0.3% DMSO markedly reduced the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin in K562 cells. Cisplatin-DMSO adduct formation was detected using UV-spectrophotometer. Continuous increase in UV absorbance between 250nm-290nm was observed when cisplatin (0.5mg/ml) and DMSO (10%) were mixed.

Recent studies suggest that IKZF1 is also involved in myeloid differentiation. To investigate whether IKZF1 deletions also play a role in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, we screened a panel of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia samples for deletions of the IKZF1 locus using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and for mutations using direct sequencing. Three patients were identified with a single amino acid variant without change of IKZF1 length. No frame-shift mutations were found. Out of 11 patients with an IKZF1 deletion, 8 samples revealed a complete loss of chromosome 7, and 3 cases a focal deletion of 0.1-0.9Mb. These deletions included the complete IKZF1 gene (n=2) or exons 1-4 (n=1), all leading to a loss of IKZF1 function. Interestingly, differentially expressed genes in monosomy 7 cases (n=8) when compared to non-deleted samples (n=247) significantly correlated with gene expression changes in focal IKZF1-deleted cases (n=3). Genes with increased expression included genes involved in myeloid cell self-renewal and cell cycle, and a significant portion of GATA target genes and GATA factors.

Interleukin receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase that mediates signaling downstream to Toll-like (TLR) and Interleukin-1 Receptors (IL1R). Our data demonstrated that IRAK1 is overexpressed in all subtypes of T-ALL, compared to normal human thymic subpopulations, and is functional in T-ALL cell lines. Genetic knock-down of IRAK1 led to apoptosis, cell cycle disruption, diminished proliferation and reversal of corticosteroid resistance in T-ALL cell lines.

In this context, we report that the spliceosome modulator sudemycin induces selective cytotoxicity in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells when compared with healthy lymphocytes and tumor cells from other B-lymphoid malignancies, with a slight bias for CLL cases with mutations in spliceosome-RNA processing machinery. Consistently, sudemycin exhibits considerable antitumor activity in NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma-/- (NSG) mice engrafted with primary cells from CLL patients. The antileukemic effect of sudemycin involves the splicing modulation of several target genes important for tumor survival, both in SF3B1-mutated and -unmutated cases. Thus, the apoptosis induced by this compound is related to the alternative splicing switch of MCL1 toward its proapoptotic isoform. Sudemycin also functionally disturbs NF-kappaB pathway in parallel with the induction of a spliced RELA variant that loses its DNA binding domain. Importantly, we show an enhanced antitumor effect of sudemycin in combination with ibrutinib that might be related to the modulation of the alternative splicing of the inhibitor of Btk (IBTK). In conclusion, we provide first evidence that the spliceosome is a relevant therapeutic target in CLL, supporting the use of splicing modulators alone or in combination with ibrutinib as a promising approach for the treatment of CLL patients.",,"['Xargay-Torrent, Silvia', 'Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Rosich, Laia', 'Montraveta, Arnau', 'Roldan, Jocabed', 'Rodriguez, Vanina', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Lagisetti, Chandraiah', 'Webb, Thomas R', 'Lopez-Otin, Carlos', 'Campo, Elias', 'Colomer, Dolors']","['Xargay-Torrent S', 'Lopez-Guerra M', 'Rosich L', 'Montraveta A', 'Roldan J', 'Rodriguez V', 'Villamor N', 'Aymerich M', 'Lagisetti C', 'Webb TR', 'Lopez-Otin C', 'Campo E', 'Colomer D']","[""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Center for Chemical Biology, Biosciences Division, SRI International, Menlo Park, California, USA.', 'Center for Chemical Biology, Biosciences Division, SRI International, Menlo Park, California, USA.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Universidad de Oviedo - IUOPA, Oviedo, Spain.', ""Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],['R01 CA140474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0', '(5-((4-(5-(7,7-dimethyl-1,6-dioxaspiro(2.5)octan-5-yl)-3-methylpenta-2,4-dien-1-y', 'l)cyclohexyl)amino)-5-oxopent-3-en-2-yl methylcarbamate)', '0 (Cyclohexylamines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cyclohexylamines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'RNA Splicing', 'Spiro Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Spliceosomes/drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4673195,,2015/06/13 06:00,2016/08/05 06:00,['2015/06/13 06:00'],"['2015/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['4212 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4212 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Sep 8;6(26):22734-49. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.4212.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['SF3B1', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib', 'spliceosome', 'sudemycin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In another experiment, we compared Hsp90 levels with percentage of hCD45+ cells in blood, bone marrow, liver and spleen of animals weekly sacrificed. Hsp90 levels proved to be a superior method for the earlier detection of ALL engraftment and correlated linearly to ALL burden and progression in all compartments, even at minimal residual disease levels.

Despite their well-established target, the sodium/potassium (Na(+)/K(+))-ATPase, downstream mechanisms remain poorly elucidated. UNBS1450 is a hemi-synthetic cardenolide derived from 2''-oxovorusharin extracted from the plant Calotropis procera, which is effective against various cancer cell types with an excellent differential toxicity. By comparing adherent and non-adherent cancer cell types, we validated Mcl-1 as a general and early target of UNBS1450. A panel of CGs including cardenolides ouabain, digitoxin and digoxin as well as bufadienolides cinobufagin and proscillaridin A allowed us to generalize our findings. Our results show that Mcl-1, but not Bcl-xL nor Bcl-2, is rapidly downregulated prior to induction of apoptosis. From a mechanistic point of view, we exclude an effect on transcription and demonstrate involvement of a pathway affecting protein stability and requiring the proteasome in the early CG-induced Mcl-1 downregulation, without the involvement of caspases or the BH3-only protein NOXA. Strategies aiming at preventing UNBS1450-induced Mcl-1 downregulation by overexpression of a mutated, non-ubiquitinable form of the protein or the use of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 inhibited the compound's ability to induce apoptosis.

Recently, hematopoietic stem cell therapy provides promising outcomes. In this study we examined the clinical effect of HLA-mismatched hematopoietic stem cell infusion combined with chemotherapy as a postremission therapy to improve the survival and reduce the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). METHOD: Thirty patients who achieved complete remission were divided into two groups and received different therapeutic regimes. Patients in combined therapy group received stem cell infusion with the chemotherapy. The patients' clinical indexes were monitored in both groups to evaluate therapy responses. Furthermore, the collected cells used in the therapy were also tested for their tumoricidal activity toward U937 cell lines. RESULTS: The combined therapy exhibited an improved effect than conventional chemotherapy. There were no delays in hematopoietic recovery and GVHD after the intense treatment. This method prolonged the 2.5-year disease-free survival as well as overall survival, and increased the therapeutic effect for patients in good/intermediate prognosis. Moreover, the donor microchimerism was detected in four female patients who had male donors. The experimental study revealed that HLA-mismatched hematopoietic stem cell could induce U937 cells death and the tumoricidal activity enhanced proportionally with the increase in effector-target ratio. CONCLUSION: HLA-mismatched hematopoietic stem cell infusion combined with chemotherapy improved the clinical outcomes and prevented severe GVHD.

Improved tracking of minimal residual disease (MRD) holds the promise of timely treatment adjustments to preempt relapse. Current surveillance techniques detect circulating blasts that coincide with advanced disease and poorly reflect MRD during early relapse. Here, we investigate exosomes as a minimally invasive platform for a microRNA (miRNA) biomarker. We identify a set of miRNA enriched in AML exosomes and track levels of circulating exosome miRNA that distinguish leukemic xenografts from both non-engrafted and human CD34+ controls. We develop biostatistical models that reveal circulating exosomal miRNA at low marrow tumor burden and before circulating blasts can be detected. Remarkably, both leukemic blasts and marrow stroma contribute to serum exosome miRNA.

The putative cell has been interpreted as an immature neutrophil based on the intense expression of myeloperoxidase. METHODS: To better understand the nature of the infiltrate and potential mechanisms leading to this distinct form of cutaneous inflammatory cell influx, thirteen cases of histiocytoid Sweet's syndrome, encountered in the routine and consult practice of one of the authors, were studied. The clinical features and microscopic findings are summarized. RESULTS: The study comprised eight men and five women aged from 23 to 80. There was a significant association with underlying myeloproliferative disease. In particular, five patients had underlying myelodysplastic syndrome. One patient had unspecified chronic myeloproliferative disorder and another had AML. Two cases were triggered by drug therapy (Cox-2 inhibitors). One patient had familial Mediterranean fever. The eruption was asymptomatic and an aggressive clinical course was not observed in most cases. Skin biopsies were composed of striking angiocentric and intersititial mononuclear cell infiltrates, often accentuated in the deeper dermis and subcutaneous fat. There was marked leukocytoclasia. Neutrophils were sparce or absent. These cells were strongly positive for CD163 and either expressed CD16 or myeloperoxidase. Variable positivity for myeloid dendritic cell markers including CD11c, BDCA-3, TCL1 oncogene, MXA and CD123 was observed. CONCLUSION: The histiocytoid cells of histiocytoid Sweet's syndrome define a novel subset of activated monocytes.

The feline leukemia virus, subgroup C, receptor 1a (FLVCR1a) is a heme exporter expressed in almost all cell types, including intestinal cells. This work investigates the role of FLVCR1a in the intestine, taking advantage of an intestine-specific conditional Flvcr1a-knockout mouse and of FLVCR1a-depleted Caco2 cells. RESULTS: The data show that FLVCR1a does not participate in the absorption of dietary heme, whereas it is involved in the export of de novo synthesized heme from intestinal cells. The loss of Flvcr1a is associated with a decrease of intestinal cell proliferation and with alterations in the peculiar homeostasis of proliferating cells, including the maintenance of their redox status. The involvement of FLVCR1a in these processes renders this exporter crucial for the survival of mice in a model of ulcerative colitis. INNOVATION: These findings shed light on the role of heme export in the dietary heme absorption process and unravel a new role for heme export in the control of mucosal renewal and in proliferating cell redox status and metabolic activity, demonstrating a crucial role for FLVCR1a in maintaining intestinal homeostasis in both physiologic and pathologic situations. CONCLUSION: By exporting the excess of de novo synthesized heme from intestinal cells, FLVCR1a participates in the control of intestinal mucosa homeostasis.",,"['Fiorito, Veronica', 'Forni, Marco', 'Silengo, Lorenzo', 'Altruda, Fiorella', 'Tolosano, Emanuela']","['Fiorito V', 'Forni M', 'Silengo L', 'Altruda F', 'Tolosano E']","['1 Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino , Torino, Italy .', '2 EuroClone S.p.A Research Laboratory, Molecular Biotechnology Centre (MBC), University of Torino , Torino, Italy .', '1 Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino , Torino, Italy .', '1 Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino , Torino, Italy .', '1 Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino , Torino, Italy .']",['eng'],['GGP12082/Telethon/Italy'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150720,United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (FLVCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Flvcr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*metabolism', 'Intestines/cytology', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2015/06/13 06:00,2016/10/08 06:00,['2015/06/13 06:00'],"['2015/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/ars.2014.6216 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2015 Dec 20;23(18):1410-23. doi: 10.1089/ars.2014.6216.

The development of B cells is precisely regulated by a variety of factors via different mechanisms, including cytokine/cytokine receptors, signal transduction molecules, and transcription factors. Recent findings suggest that epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA, play critical roles in establishing B cell lineage-specific gene expression profiles to define and sustain B cell identity and function. Epigenetic modifications are also sensitive to external stimuli and might bridge genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis or control of B-cell-related immune disorders, such as autoimmune diseases, lymphoma, and leukemia. Better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms for regulating B cell development and involving B cell abnormal differentiation and function will shed light on the design of new therapeutic approaches to B-cell-related diseases, and potential candidates of epigenetic modulators may be identified to target epigenetic pathways to prevent or treat B cell disorders. We summarize the relevance of epigenetic marks and landscapes in the stages of B cell development, discuss the interaction of the transcriptional networks and epigenetic changes, and review the involvement of epigenetic risk in the pathogenesis of B-cell-related diseases.

The study analyzed peripheral blood from previously untreated patients with CLL, patients with relapsed or refractory disease under treatment and healthy blood donors using flow cytometry.

The highest numbers of both CD8+PD-1+ and CD4+PD-1+ cells were present in patients with relapsed/refractory disease. No distinct difference according to Binet stage was found. These facts support the hypothesis that tumor clones may switch effector CD8+ cells through the PD-1/PD-1L pathway into an immunotolerant state.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 76 consecutive patients were enrolled from September 2008 to April 2012. Complete blood counts and clinical evaluation were performed at enrolment, at month 3, 6, and then every 6 months. Anti-neutrophil antibodies were tested by GIFT method. RESULTS: Patients (49 chronic idiopathic- and 27 autoimmune neutropenia) were followed for a median of 5 years (range 24-84 months). At enrolment, neutropenia was mild in 44 patients (median neutrophils 1.27x10(3)/muL), moderate in 23 (median 0.8x10(3)/muL), and severe in 9 (median 0.4x10(3)/muL). Neutrophil counts showed a great inter-subject but no intra-subject variability, with lower values in autoimmune neutropenia, in males, and in MGUS cases. Over time, no grade >3 infections occurred; 13/49 chronic idiopathic and 6/27 autoimmune neutropenia patients experienced a grade 2 event, irrespective of mean and nadir neutrophil values. Bone marrow evaluation at enrolment showed reduced cellularity in 23% of cases, and dyserythropoietic features in 55%, with no definite hematologic diagnosis. During the follow-up, 5 cases were diagnosed with NK expansion, 4 with hairy cell leukemia, and 3 with myelodysplasia (1 myelomonocytic leukemia, 1 refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia, and 1 multilineage dysplasia), with a median time to evolution of 30 months. CONCLUSION: Chronic idiopathic and autoimmune neutropenia, although usually benign, deserve hematological follow-up with a bone marrow evaluation at diagnosis and a re-evaluation in the presence of worsening neutropenia, appearance of additional cytopenias, and lymphocytosis.","['Copyright (c) 2015 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

However, therapeutic effects of radotinib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that radotinib significantly decreases the viability of AML cells in a dose-dependent manner. Kasumi-1 cells were more sensitive to radotinib than NB4, HL60, or THP-1 cell lines. Furthermore, radotinib induced CD11b expression in NB4, THP-1, and Kasumi-1 cells either in presence or absence of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). We found that radotinib promoted differentiation and induced CD11b expression in AML cells by downregulating LYN. However, CD11b expression induced by ATRA in HL60 cells was decreased by radotinib through upregulation of LYN. Furthermore, radotinib mainly induced apoptosis of CD11b+ cells in the total population of AML cells. Radotinib also increased apoptosis of CD11b+ HL60 cells when they were differentiated by ATRA/dasatinib treatment. We show that radotinib induced apoptosis via caspase-3 activation and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) in CD11b+ cells differentiated from AML cells.

The majority of cases of MBL have the immunophenotype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MBL can be categorized as either low count or high count based on whether the B-cell count is above or below 0.5 x 10(9)/L. Low-count MBL can be detected in approximately 5% of adults over the age of 40 years when assessed using standard-sensitivity flow cytometry assays. A number of biological and genetic characteristics distinguish low-count from high-count MBL. Whereas low-count MBL rarely progresses to CLL, high-count MBL progresses to CLL requiring therapy at a rate of 1% to 2% per year. High-count MBL is distinguished from Rai 0 CLL based on whether the B-cell count is above or below 5 x 10(9)/L.

FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab) is the current standard treatment option for younger patients with CLL. For older patients and for patients with renal dysfunction, bendamustine and rituximab may be a better option. For older patients with comorbidities who may not be able to tolerate intensive CIT, the combination treatment of chlorambucil and obinutuzumab or ofatumumab is an option. For patients with del(17p), ibrutinib is the treatment of choice.

However, there are now increasingly active treatment options available for CLL patients with favorable toxicity profiles and convenient administration schedules. This raises the critical issue of whether or not attainment of cure remains a necessary goal. It is now less clear that treatment with curative intention and with significant toxicity is required for long-term survival in CLL. In addition, the demonstrated safety and activity of genetically modified chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells present the opportunity of harnessing the power of the immune system to kill CLL cells without the need for SCT. We attempt to define the role of SCT in the era of targeted therapies and discuss questions that remain to be answered.

Study subjects received induction treatment that comprised concurrent vincristine, daunorubicin, prednisolone, and nilotinib. After achieving complete hematologic remission (HCR), subjects received either 5 courses of consolidation, followed by 2-year maintenance with nilotinib, or allo-HCT. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed at HCR, and every 3 months thereafter. The molecular responses (MRs) were defined as MR3 for BCR-ABL1/G6PDH ratios </=10(-3) and MR5 for ratios <10(-5). Ninety evaluable subjects, ages 17 to 71 years, were enrolled in 17 centers. The HCR rate was 91%; 57 subjects received allo-HCT. The cumulative MR5 rate was 94%; the 2-year hematologic relapse-free survival (HRFS) rate was 72% for 82 subjects that achieved HCR, and the 2-year overall survival rate was 72%. Subjects that failed to achieve MR3 or MR5 were 9.1 times (P = .004) or 6.3 times (P = .001) more prone to hematologic relapse, respectively, than those that achieved MR3 or MR5. MRD statuses just before allo-HCT and at 3 months after allo-HCT were predictive of 2-year HRFS. Adverse events occurred mainly during induction, and most were reversible with dose reduction or transient interruption of nilotinib. The combination of nilotinib with high-dose cytotoxic drugs was feasible, and it effectively achieved high cumulative complete molecular remission and HRFS rates. The MRD status at early postremission time was predictive of the HRFS.

Recurrent cooperating genetic events that may contribute to HCL pathogenesis or affect the clinical course of HCL are currently not described. Therefore, we performed whole exome sequencing to explore the mutational landscape of purine analog refractory HCL. In addition to the disease-defining BRAFV600E mutations, we identified mutations in EZH2, ARID1A, and recurrent inactivating mutations of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1B (p27). Targeted deep sequencing of CDKN1B in a larger cohort of HCL patients identify deleterious CDKN1B mutations in 16% of patients with HCL (n = 13 of 81). In 11 of 13 patients the CDKN1B mutation was clonal, implying an early role of CDKN1B mutations in the pathogenesis of HCL. CDKN1B mutations were not found to impact clinical characteristics or outcome in this cohort. These data identify HCL as having the highest frequency of CDKN1B mutations among cancers and identify CDNK1B as the second most common mutated gene in HCL.

In 2011 a protocol for the rapid diagnosis of IFD by filamentous fungi was implemented in Valparaiso Region. OBJECTIVES: To describe cases of IFD by filamentous fungi of the Valparaiso Region, since the implementation of rapid diagnosis and to compare results with the period 2004-2009. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Descriptive and prospective study conducted in two public hospitals: Carlos van Buren at Valparaiso and Gustavo Fricke at Vina del Mar. We selected patients with a diagnosis of filamentous fungal diseases considering the EORTC/MSG criteria. Demographics, underlying diseases, risk factors for EFI, galactomannan (GM) results in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage, cultures and biopsies, treatment and overall lethality rates at 30 days were registered. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were detected, 6 with proven and 12 probable IFD. Nine were diagnosed by GM, 8 by culture and two with both methods. In cases which the agent (9/18) was isolated from Rhizopus oryzae was the most frequent. When comparing overall lethality with the period 2004-2009, there was a reduction of 47.8%, which was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to data previously published in the region, demographic and comorbidities of patients with IFD caused by filamentous fungi are similar, however the currently rapid diagnosis protocol has improved survival of patients and lethality experienced overall decrease.",,"['Cruz, Rodrigo', 'Alvarez, Patricio', 'Provoste, Felipe', 'Ducasse, Karen', 'Gonzalez, Marcela', 'Wilson, Gonzalo', 'Diaz, Javier']","['Cruz R', 'Alvarez P', 'Provoste F', 'Ducasse K', 'Gonzalez M', 'Wilson G', 'Diaz J']",,['spa'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Chile,Rev Chilena Infectol,Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,9305754,"['0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)']",IM,"['Chile', 'Female', 'Fungi/*classification', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*diagnosis/microbiology/mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic']",,,2015/06/13 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/06/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0716-10182015000300012 [pii]', '10.4067/S0716-10182015000300012 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Chilena Infectol. 2015 Apr;32(2):221-4. doi: 10.4067/S0716-10182015000300012.,,,,,,,,,,"Enfermedad fungica invasora (EFI) por hongos filamentosos en la Region de Valparaiso, Chile, desde la implementacion del diagnostico rapido de laboratorio.",,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of data that can address its clinical utility and value, integration of pharmacogenetic testing in the healthcare system is not straightforward. This Technology Assessment assesses the evidence on the benefits and harms of three pharmacogenetic tests employed for three different diseases pertinent to the Medicare beneficiary population: variations in CYP2D6 and response to tamoxifen in breast cancer; variations in KRAS and response to cetuximab and panitumumab in colorectal cancer and variations in BCR-ABL1 and response to imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib in chronic myeloid leukemia.

The objective of this study was to obtain a more precise measure of acute leukemia risk associated with NBN rs1805794, rs2735383, rs709816 polymorphisms. METHODS: Using PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases, we undertook a systematic literature search up to September 1, 2014. Eligible studies were singled out from 31 possibly related publications by two investigators. Based on the extracted NBN genotypes, we calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) by use of the random effects model proposed by DerSimonian and Laird. RESULTS: We finally derived 3,065 subjects for meta-analysis of rs1805794, and found that carriage of the CC genotype was associated with approximately 1.70-fold increased risk of acute leukemia (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.17-2.36; OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.23-2.54). A 25% higher risk was also identified among the individuals with the C allele (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.03-1.51). Among 1,553 subjects for rs2735383, no significant association was indicated in the investigated comparison models. Nor did the analysis of 1,485 samples for rs709816 suggest any noteworthy connection. CONCLUSIONS: Carriage of rs1805794 polymorphism in the NBN gene may be associated with the occurrence of acute leukemia.

METHODS: Cells in logarithmic growth phase were divided into negative control group and experimental group (cells were treated with atorvastatin with intervention concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 mumol/L respectively) and cultured for 24 hours. Changes in apoptosis and cell cycle of leukemic cells were detected utilizing the Flow Cytometry. Changes in the expression of TLR4/MYD88/NF-kappaB and PI3K/AKT signal pathway related genes were detected utilizing Real-time PCR and Western Blot method. RESULTS: Atorvastatin inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in K562, HL-60 and Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner. K562, HL-60 and Jurkat cells in G0/G1 phase increased and that in S phase decreased after being treated with atorvastatin for 24 hours compared with that in control group, suggesting that the atorvastatin can retard the three cells in the G0/G1 phase. The study find that the basal expressions of TLR4, MYD88 and NF-kappaB gene in K562, HL-60 and Jurkat cells are obviously down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner after being treated with atorvastatin with different concentrations. This down-regulation action of atorvastatin to the expression of the TLR4, MYD88 and NF-kappaB gene becomes more obvious with the increase of the drug level. In addition, the PI3K, AKT and their phosphorylation levels in the above cells down-regulate obviously in a dose-dependent manner after being treated with atorvastatin. This down-regulation action of atorvastatin to the PI3K, AKT and their phosphorylation levels become more obvious with the increase of the drug level.

Studies in neonatal rats have shown that H-I acutely expands the numbers of neural precursors (NPs) within the subventricular zone (SVZ). The aim of these studies was to establish which NPs expand after H-I and to determine how leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) insufficiency affects their response. During recovery from H-I, the number of Ki67(+) cells in the medial SVZ of the injured hemisphere increased. Similarly, the number and size of primary neurospheres produced from the injured SVZ increased approximately twofold versus controls, and, upon differentiation, more than twice as many neurospheres from the damaged brain were tripotential, suggesting an increase in neural stem cells (NSCs). However, multimarker flow cytometry for CD133/LeX/NG2/CD140a combined with EdU incorporation revealed that NSC frequency diminished after H-I, whereas that of two multipotential progenitors and three unique glial-restricted precursors expanded, attributable to changes in their proliferation. By quantitative PCR, interleukin-6, LIF, and CNTF mRNA increased but with significantly different time courses, with LIF expression correlating best with NP expansion. Therefore, we evaluated the NP response to H-I in LIF-haplodeficient mice. Flow cytometry revealed that one subset of multipotential and bipotential intermediate progenitors did not increase after H-I, whereas another subset was amplified. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that neonatal H-I alters the composition of the SVZ and that LIF is a key regulator for a subset of intermediate progenitors that expand during acute recovery from neonatal H-I.",['Copyright (c) 2015 the authors 0270-6474/15/358855-11$15.00/0.'],"['Buono, Krista D', 'Goodus, Matthew T', 'Guardia Clausi, Mariano', 'Jiang, Yuhui', 'Loporchio, Dean', 'Levison, Steven W']","['Buono KD', 'Goodus MT', 'Guardia Clausi M', 'Jiang Y', 'Loporchio D', 'Levison SW']","['Department of Neurology and Neuroscience, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103-1709, and ICON Central Laboratories, Farmingdale, New York 11735.', 'Department of Neurology and Neuroscience, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103-1709, and.', 'Department of Neurology and Neuroscience, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103-1709, and.', 'Department of Neurology and Neuroscience, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103-1709, and.', 'Department of Neurology and Neuroscience, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103-1709, and.', 'Department of Neurology and Neuroscience, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103-1709, and levisosw@njms.rutgers.edu.']",['eng'],"['NS-051157/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH-59950/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD052064/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH059950/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-052064/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 NS051157/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Functional Laterality', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Lateral Ventricles/pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neural Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Neuroglia/physiology', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism']",PMC4461690,,2015/06/13 06:00,2015/08/20 06:00,['2015/06/12 06:00'],"['2015/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['35/23/8855 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2868-12.2015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2015 Jun 10;35(23):8855-65. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2868-12.2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cerebral palsy', 'cytokines', 'glial progenitors', 'gliogenesis', 'inflammation', 'stem cells']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1264-7309'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As previously demonstrated in our laboratory, Alpha-lipoic acid (LA), a co-factor for metabolic enzymes, suppresses the tumor growth. In this study, we have researched the mechanisms that are responsible for the activity of LA. METHODS: We have studied the mechanisms of LA in two ovarian cancer cell lines, a cisplatin sensitive one, IGROV1 and its resistant counterpart, IGROV1-R10. These cells have been exposed to lipoic acid at various concentrations. Cell proliferation, cell cycle repartition and nuclear staining with DAPI were recorded. Western blot analyses were performed to detect various proteins implied in apoptotic cell death pathways. To investigate the formation of ROS, the oxidation of CM-DCFH2-DA were also determined. FINDINGS: LA suppressed growth proliferation and induced apoptosis in both ovarian cell lines. Moreover, LA provoked a down regulation of two anti-apoptotic proteins, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL protein and a strong induction of the BH3-only protein Bim.

High proviral load is one major risk factor for disease development. HTLV-1 encodes Tax oncoprotein, which activates transcription from viral long terminal repeats (LTR) and various types of cellular promoters. Counteracting Tax function might have prophylactic and therapeutic benefits. In this work, we report on the suppression of Tax activation of HTLV-1 LTR by SIRT1 deacetylase. The transcriptional activity of Tax on the LTR was largely ablated when SIRT1 was overexpressed, but Tax activation of NF-kappaB was unaffected. On the contrary, the activation of the LTR by Tax was boosted when SIRT1 was depleted. Treatment of cells with resveratrol shunted Tax activity in a SIRT1-dependent manner. The activation of SIRT1 in HTLV-1-transformed T cells by resveratrol potently inhibited HTLV-1 proviral transcription and Tax expression, whereas compromising SIRT1 by specific inhibitors augmented HTLV-1 mRNA expression. The administration of resveratrol also decreased the production of cell-free HTLV-1 virions from MT2 cells and the transmission of HTLV-1 from MT2 cells to uninfected Jurkat cells in coculture. SIRT1 associated with Tax in HTLV-1-transformed T cells. Treatment with resveratrol prevented the interaction of Tax with CREB and the recruitment of CREB, CRTC1, and p300 to Tax-responsive elements in the LTR. Our work demonstrates the negative regulatory function of SIRT1 in Tax activation of HTLV-1 transcription. Small-molecule activators of SIRT1 such as resveratrol might be considered new prophylactic and therapeutic agents in HTLV-1-associated diseases. IMPORTANCE: Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes a highly lethal blood cancer or a chronic debilitating disease of the spinal cord. Treatments are unsatisfactory, and vaccines are not available. Disease progression is associated with robust expression of HTLV-1 genes. Suppressing HTLV-1 gene expression might have preventive and therapeutic benefits. It is therefore critical that host factors controlling HTLV-1 gene expression be identified and characterized. This work reveals a new host factor that suppresses HTLV-1 gene expression and a natural compound that activates this suppression. Our findings not only provide new knowledge of the host control of HTLV-1 gene expression but also suggest a new strategy of using natural compounds for prevention and treatment of HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Treatment planning for patients with MDS is a complex process, and we sought to better characterize hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) outcomes and the factors that play into decision-making regarding referral of adults with MDS for definitive therapy with HCT. Patients enrolled in a population-based study of MDS between April 2010 and January 2013 who underwent HCT within the first year after enrollment were included in this analysis. Age- and risk-matched MDS patient controls also enrolled during that time period were used as a comparison. Survival was significantly better in the HCT group (48 vs. 21 %, log-rank p value 0.009). Non-HCT patients were more likely to have comorbidities, and HCT patients were more likely to have a college degree and an income >$80,000. All three of these variables were independently associated with HCT, but none impacted survival. Patients with MDS in our study who underwent HCT had better survival than a comparable group of patients who did not undergo HCT. With refined treatment techniques, more patients may be able to be considered for this therapy. More work needs to be done to determine why education and income appear to impact the decision to pursue HCT, but these factors may impact referral to an academic center where aggressive therapy like HCT is more likely to be considered.",,"['Smith, Angela R', 'Warlick, Erica D', 'Roesler, Michelle A', 'Poynter, Jenny N', 'Richardson, Michaela', 'Nguyen, Phuong', 'Cioc, Adina', 'Hirsch, Betsy', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Smith AR', 'Warlick ED', 'Roesler MA', 'Poynter JN', 'Richardson M', 'Nguyen P', 'Cioc A', 'Hirsch B', 'Ross JA']","['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, 420 Delaware Street SE; MMC 484, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA, smith719@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['K05 CA157439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142714/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150611,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality/trends', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', '*Population Surveillance', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4725732,['NIHMS751025'],2015/06/13 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/06/12 06:00'],"['2015/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-015-2422-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Oct;94(10):1667-75. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2422-z.

Host immune responses, in particular cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), influence the proliferation and survival of ATL cells and HTLV-1-infected cells. We generated recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVVs) expressing HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factor (HBZ) or Tax to study the immunogenic potential of these viral proteins. Vaccination with rVV expressing Tax or HBZ induced specific T-cell responses, although multiple boosters were needed for HBZ. HBZ-stimulated T cells killed HBZ peptide-pulsed T cells and CD4(+) T cells from HBZ transgenic (HBZ-Tg) mice. The anti-lymphoma effect of the CTLs targeting HBZ was tested in mice inoculated with a lymphoma cell line derived from an HBZ-Tg mouse. Transfer of splenocytes from HBZ-immunized mice increased the survival of the lymphoma cell-inoculated mice, suggesting that the anti-HBZ CTLs have a protective effect. The rVV could also induce specific T-cell responses to HBZ and Tax in HTLV-1-infected rhesus monkeys. On the basis of the results of rVV-vaccinated mice and macaques, we identified a candidate peptide (HBZ157-176) for vaccine development. Dendritic cells pulsed with this peptide could generate HBZ-specific CTLs from human CD8(+) T cells. This study demonstrates that HBZ could be a target for immunotherapy of patients with ATL.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Sugata, Kenji', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Mitobe, Yuichi', 'Miura, Michi', 'Miyazato, Paola', 'Kohara, Michinori', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Sugata K', 'Yasunaga J', 'Mitobe Y', 'Miura M', 'Miyazato P', 'Kohara M', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan;', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan;', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan;', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan;', 'Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan;']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150610,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/chemistry/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/chemistry/*immunology', 'Vaccinia virus/immunology', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/*immunology']",,,2015/06/13 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/06/12 06:00'],"['2015/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30977-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-04-641118 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Aug 27;126(9):1095-105. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-04-641118.

Until 1990, therapy for CLL was based on alkylating agents, chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide, which did not impact meaningfully on overall survival. The more recent therapeutic regimens, built on combination chemoimmunotherapy, achieve complete responses in 40-50% of cases. However, these regimens are limited in their applicability mostly to the treatment of younger and physically fit patients due to their associated toxicity. Furthermore, since disease progression and drug resistance are considered inevitable, CLL remains incurable. Fortunately, significant progress in the understanding of CLL biology has enabled the development of new molecular drugs targeting the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, such as ibrutinib and idelalisib, which have shown impressive results in patients with relapsed/refractory disease or with TP53 mutation/deletion. Furthermore, obinutuzumab, a type II anti-CD20 antibody, which results in direct cell death and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, also has proven efficacy when used in combination with chlorambucil in previously untreated and unfit patients. All these three new drugs have recently received FDA approval for the treatment of CLL.

Several agents targeting FLT3 have been developed, but their limited clinical activity suggests that the inhibition of other factors contributing to the malignant phenotype is required. We examined gene expression data sets as well as primary specimens and found that the expression of GLI2, a major effector of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, was increased in FLT3-ITD compared to wild-type FLT3 AML. To examine the functional role of the Hh pathway, we studied mice in which Flt3-ITD expression results in an indolent myeloproliferative state and found that constitutive Hh signaling accelerated the development of AML by enhancing signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling and the proliferation of bone marrow myeloid progenitors. Furthermore, combined FLT3 and Hh pathway inhibition limited leukemic growth in vitro and in vivo, and this approach may serve as a therapeutic strategy for FLT3-ITD AML.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Lim, Yiting', 'Gondek, Lukasz', 'Li, Li', 'Wang, Qiuju', 'Ma, Hayley', 'Chang, Emily', 'Huso, David L', 'Foerster, Sarah', 'Marchionni, Luigi', 'McGovern, Karen', 'Watkins, David Neil', 'Peacock, Craig D', 'Levis, Mark', 'Smith, Bruce Douglas', 'Merchant, Akil A', 'Small, Donald', 'Matsui, William']","['Lim Y', 'Gondek L', 'Li L', 'Wang Q', 'Ma H', 'Chang E', 'Huso DL', 'Foerster S', 'Marchionni L', 'McGovern K', 'Watkins DN', 'Peacock CD', 'Levis M', 'Smith BD', 'Merchant AA', 'Small D', 'Matsui W']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.', 'Cancer Developmental Biology, The Kinghorn Cancer Centre, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Darlinghurst, New South Wales 2010, Australia.', 'Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.

In addition, causal variant fine-mapping has demonstrated that autoimmune disease susceptibility variants for multiple sclerosis (MS) and ulcerative colitis are strongly enriched within binding sites for NFkappaB. We report that MS-associated variants proximal to NFkappaB1 and in an intron of TNFRSF1A (TNFR1) are associated with increased NFkappaB signaling after tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) stimulation. Both variants result in increased degradation of inhibitor of NFkappaB alpha (IkappaBalpha), a negative regulator of NFkappaB, and nuclear translocation of p65 NFkappaB. The variant proximal to NFkappaB1 controls signaling responses by altering the expression of NFkappaB itself, with the GG risk genotype expressing 20-fold more p50 NFkappaB and diminished expression of the negative regulators of the NFkappaB pathway: TNFalpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), B cell leukemia 3 (BCL3), and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (CIAP1). Finally, naive CD4 T cells from patients with MS express enhanced activation of p65 NFkappaB. These results demonstrate that genetic variants associated with risk of developing MS alter NFkappaB signaling pathways, resulting in enhanced NFkappaB activation and greater responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. As such, this suggests that rapid genetic screening for variants associated with NFkappaB signaling may identify individuals amenable to NFkappaB or cytokine blockade.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Housley, William J', 'Fernandez, Salvador D', 'Vera, Kenneth', 'Murikinati, Sasidhar R', 'Grutzendler, Jaime', 'Cuerdon, Nicole', 'Glick, Laura', 'De Jager, Phillip L', 'Mitrovic, Mitja', 'Cotsapas, Chris', 'Hafler, David A']","['Housley WJ', 'Fernandez SD', 'Vera K', 'Murikinati SR', 'Grutzendler J', 'Cuerdon N', 'Glick L', 'De Jager PL', 'Mitrovic M', 'Cotsapas C', 'Hafler DA']","['Department of Neurology and Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.', 'Department of Neurology and Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.', 'Department of Neurology and Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.', 'Department of Neurology and Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.', 'Department of Neurology and Immunobiology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.', ""Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Sevearl of them are associated with mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases or cytokine receptor associated tyrosine kinases rendering them independent of cytokine-mediated regulation. Classically they have been broadly divided into BCR-ABL1 fusion + ve (Ph + ve) or -ve (Ph-ve) MPNs. Identification of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase as a driver of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and successful application of small molecule inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases in the clinic have triggered the search for kinase dependent pathways in other Ph-ve MPNs. In the past few years, identification of mutations in JAK2 associated with a majority of MPNs raised the hopes for similar success with specific targeting of JAK2. However, targeting JAK2 kinase activity has met with limited success. Subsequently, mutations in genes other than JAK2 have been identified. These mutations specifically associate with certain MPNs and can drive cytokine independent growth. Therefore, targeting alternate molecules and pathways may be more successful in management of MPNs. Among other pathways, phosphatidylinositol -3 kinase (PI3K) has emerged as a promising target as different cell surface receptor induced signaling pathways converge on the PI3K signaling axis to regulate cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, and survival.

Ongoing research concerning the strategy for inhibiting the abnormally high activity of the ABCB1 transporter is critically needed. In the present study, we sought to elucidate the interaction between ABCB1 transporter and butorphanol. Our results showed that butorphanol significantly antagonized ABCB1-mediated drug efflux and increased the intracellular drug concentration by inhibiting the transport activity of ABCB1 in leukemia cells. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that butorphanol did not alter the protein expression or localization of ABCB1 in HL60/VCR and K562/ADR cells. Furthermore, homology modeling indicated that butorphanol could fit into the large drug-binding cavity of ABCB1 and form a binding conformation.

Despite recent advances in cancer chemotherapy, it remains a mainstay of therapy since its discovery in the early second half of the previous century. Moreover, low-dose methotrexate is a gold standard antirheumatic drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, systemic scleroderma and other autoimmune disorders. Side effects of methotrexate treatment are well known and described; however, their occurrence may often be unpredictable due to lack of specific biomarkers of toxicity. Methotrexate plasma levels are routinely monitored by therapeutic drug monitoring, nevertheless, occurrence and concentrations of its metabolites are not measured. During methotrexate treatment 7- hydroxymethotrexate and 2,4- diamino- N10- mehylpteroic acid appear in plasma. The latter can further be hydroxylated and glucuronidated resulting in five possible extracellular methotrexate metabolites. In addition, methotrexate is intracellularly converted to its active polyglutamylated forms. Therapeutic efficacy is dependent on formation of methotrexate polyglutamates as it keeps intracellular pool of the drug and enhances its affinity towards various target enzymes. In this study, we describe pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of methotrexate metabolites. We also review methotrexate blood brain barrier transport to cerebrospinal fluid regarding its use in the prevention of leukemic central nervous system involvement and management of methotrexate toxicity with the use of carboxypeptidase- G2.

With GC treatment, GR levels in C1 cells showed no obvious changes. In C7 cells, the mRNA levels of GRalpha, GRbeta and GRgamma first increased and then decreased, whereas GR-P mRNA had a continued rising trend. C7 cells had a higher GRalpha/GRgamma, lower GRalpha/GR-P and GRgamma/GR-P ratios than C1 cells (P < 0.01). In adult ALL patients, GRgamma mRNA varied in different ALL stages (complete remission CR 15.82 vs. relapsed 8.21 vs. initial 1.93 P < 0.05). It also did in the ratios between GR isoforms that GRalpha/GRgamma and GRalpha/GR-P in initial patients were higher than relapsed and CR (P < 0.05), while GRgamma/GR-P in CR was higher than initial and relapsed patients (P < 0.05). GR-P mRNA in T-ALL patients was much higher than that in B-ALL patients (P < 0.05). Peripheral blood hemoglobin (HB) was positively correlated with GRalpha mRNA and GR-P mRNA (P < 0.05), while white blood cells (WBC) negatively correlated with GRgamma mRNA (P < 0.05). The present study demonstrates that GR autoinduction is more important to GC sensitivity than its basal level expression. GC sensitivity is also significantly correlated with GRalpha mRNA and mildly associated with GRbeta mRNA expression. Both GRgamma mRNA and the ratios between GR isoforms (GRalpha/GRgamma, GRalpha/GR-P and GRgamma/GR-P) are correlated with ALL stages.

The tumor-primed NK cells (TpNK) lyse NK resistant Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) blasts expressing signal 2 ligands. We conducted a clinical trial to determine the toxicity of TpNK cell infusions from haploidentical donors. 15 patients with high risk AML were screened, 13 enrolled and 7 patients treated. The remaining 6 either failed to respond to re-induction chemotherapy or the donor refused to undergo peripheral blood apheresis. The conditioning consisted of fludarabine and total body irradiation. This was the first UK trial of a cell therapy regulated as a medicine. The complexity of Good Clinical Practice compliance was underestimated and led to failures requiring retrospective independent data review. The lessons learned are an important aspect of this report.

At six months follow-up, three patients treated in Complete Remission (CR) remained in remission, one patient infused in Partial Remission had achieved CR1, two had relapsed and one had died. One year post-treatment one patient remained in CR. Four patients remained in CR after treatment for longer than their most recent previous CR. During the 2 year follow-up six of seven patients died; median overall survival was 400 days post infusion (range 141-910). This is the first clinical trial of an NK therapy in the absence of IL-2 or other cytokine support. The HLA-mismatched NK cells survived and expanded in vivo without on-going host immunosuppression and appeared to exert an anti-leukemia effect in 4/7 patients treated.

In this study, we characterized specific pathogenic features of Th17 cells in RA. By using nano-string technology, we analyzed transcription of 419 genes in the peripheral blood CCR6(+)CXCR3(-) CD4(+) cells of 14 RA patients and 6 healthy controls and identified 109 genes discriminating Th17 cells of RA patients from the controls. Th17 cells of RA patients had an aggressive pathogenic profile and in addition to signature cytokines IL-17, IL-23 and IL-21, and transcriptional regulators RAR-related orphan receptor gamma of T cells (RORgammat) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), they produced high levels of IL-23R, C-C chemokine ligand type 20 (CCL20), granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF ) and transcription factor Tbet required for synovial homing. We showed that Th17 cells are enriched with Helios-producing Foxp3- and IL2RA-deficient cells, indicating altered regulatory profile. The follicular T-helper (Tfh) cells presented a functional profile of adaptor molecules, transcriptional regulator Bcl-6 and B-cell activating cytokines IL-21, IL-31 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF ). We observed that anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment had a limited effect on the transcription signature of Th17 cells. Patients in remission retained the machinery of receptors (IL-23R and IL-1R1), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17F, IL-23, IL-21 and TNF ) and adaptor molecules (C-X-C chemokine receptor 5 [CXCR5] and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4]), essential for efficient transdifferentiation and accumulation of Th17 cells. This study convincingly shows that the peripheral blood CCR6(+)CXCR3(-) CD4(+) cells of RA patients harbor pathogenic subsets of Th17 and Tfh cells, which may transdifferentiate from Tregs and contribute to perpetuation of the disease.",,"['Andersson, Karin M E', 'Cavallini, Nicola Filluelo', 'Hu, Dan', 'Brisslert, Mikael', 'Cialic, Ron', 'Valadi, Hadi', 'Erlandsson, Malin C', 'Silfversward, Sofia', 'Pullerits, Rille', 'Kuchroo, Vijay K', 'Weiner, Howard L', 'Bokarewa, Maria I']","['Andersson KM', 'Cavallini NF', 'Hu D', 'Brisslert M', 'Cialic R', 'Valadi H', 'Erlandsson MC', 'Silfversward S', 'Pullerits R', 'Kuchroo VK', 'Weiner HL', 'Bokarewa MI']","['Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', ""Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', ""Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', ""Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", ""Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America."", 'Department of Rheumatology and Inflammation Research, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150604,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (IL17A protein, human)', '0 (IL17F protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Transdifferentiation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/immunology', 'Th17 Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Transcriptome/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*administration & dosage/immunology/metabolism']",PMC4607618,,2015/06/11 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2015.00057 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2015.00057 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2015 Jun 4;21:536-43. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2015.00057.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital in Northern India. PARTICIPANTS: 50 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PROCEDURE: Children were assessed for nutritional status (Weight for age Z-score, serum albumin, folate and B12) at presentation, and were followed-up during induction for bone marrow response, counts and outcome. Folate and B12 were repeated twice at monthly intervals after induction. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to determine the association of nutritional parameters with the outcome variables. RESULTS: Baseline undernutrition was observed in 66%, hypo-albuminemia in 32.6%, folate deficiency in 41.3% and B12 deficiency in 36.9% of included children. Significant decline in folate levels was noted on serial assays during chemotherapy (P=0.001). Folate deficient children had higher risk for delayed marrow recovery and counts on day 14 (P=0.007 and P=0.001). Hypoalbuminemia (P=0.04), B12 deficiency (P=0.001) and folate (P=0.03) deficiency were associated with toxic deaths during induction.

To further investigate this, we pooled individual level data from 12 case-control studies in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. Exposure data were harmonized into compatible formats. Pooled analyses were undertaken using multivariable unconditional logistic regression. The odds ratio (ORs) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with any pesticide exposure shortly before conception, during pregnancy and after birth were 1.39 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25, 1.55) (using 2,785 cases and 3,635 controls), 1.43 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.54) (5,055 cases and 7,370 controls) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.51) (4,162 cases and 5,179 controls), respectively. Corresponding ORs for risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were 1.49 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.16) (173 cases and 1,789 controls), 1.55 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.99) (344 cases and 4,666 controls) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.53) (198 cases and 2,655 controls), respectively. There was little difference by type of pesticide used. The relative similarity in ORs between leukemia types, time periods and pesticide types may be explained by similar exposure patterns and effects across the time periods in ALL and AML, participants' exposure to multiple pesticides, or recall bias. Although some recall bias is likely, until a better study design can be found to investigate the associations between home pesticide use and childhood leukemia in an equally large sample, it would appear prudent to limit the use of home pesticides before and during pregnancy, and during childhood.",['(c) 2015 UICC.'],"['Bailey, Helen D', 'Infante-Rivard, Claire', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Clavel, Jacqueline', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Roman, Eve', 'Magnani, Corrado', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Th Petridou, Eleni', 'Milne, Elizabeth', 'Dockerty, John D', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Armstrong, Bruce K', 'Rudant, Jeremie', 'Fritschi, Lin', 'Simpson, Jill', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Orsi, Laurent', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Kang, Alice Y', 'Schuz, Joachim']","['Bailey HD', 'Infante-Rivard C', 'Metayer C', 'Clavel J', 'Lightfoot T', 'Kaatsch P', 'Roman E', 'Magnani C', 'Spector LG', 'Th Petridou E', 'Milne E', 'Dockerty JD', 'Miligi L', 'Armstrong BK', 'Rudant J', 'Fritschi L', 'Simpson J', 'Zhang L', 'Rondelli R', 'Baka M', 'Orsi L', 'Moschovi M', 'Kang AY', 'Schuz J']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Section of Environment and Radiation, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Canada.', 'University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health, Berkeley, CA.', 'Inserm U1153, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Team (EPICEA), Villejuif, France.', 'Paris-Descartes University, UMRS-1153, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), Paris, France.', 'RNCE - National Registry of Childhood Cancers, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, United Kingdom.', 'German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR), The Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Centre, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, United Kingdom.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Traslazionale, Universita` del Piemonte Orientale, AOU Maggiore della Carita` e CPO, Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Epidemiology Clinical Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Athens, Greece.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', ""Dean's Department and Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand."", 'ISPO-Cancer Prevention and Research Institute, Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Unit, Florence, Italy.', 'Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Sax Institute, Ultimo, NSW, Australia.', 'Inserm U1153, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), Epidemiology of Childhood and Adolescent Cancers Team (EPICEA), Villejuif, France.', 'Paris-Descartes University, UMRS-1153, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), Paris, France.', 'RNCE - National Registry of Childhood Cancers, Villejuif, France.', 'Curtin University, School of Public Health, Perth, Australia.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, United Kingdom.', 'University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health, Berkeley, CA.', ""Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, Lalla Seragnoli, Policlinico Sant'Orsola Malpighi, Bologna, Italy."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, ""Pan.&Agl.

As one of the most energy consuming cellular processes, it is highly regulated by signaling pathways in response to changing cellular conditions. Many of the regulators of this process are aberrantly activated in various cancers. Recently two novel rRNA synthesis inhibitors, CX-5461 and BMH-21, have been shown to selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Here, we tested the effectiveness of pre-rRNA synthesis inhibitor CX-5461 on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with different cytogenetic abnormalities. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells are more sensitive to rRNA synthesis inhibition compared to normal bone marrow cells. CX-5461 treated cells undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis independent of their p53 status. More-over, CX5461, activates checkpoint kinases and arrests cells in G2 phase of cell cycle. Finally, overcoming this G2 arrest by inhibiting ATR kinase leads to robust cell killing.

With an increasing cancer rate worldwide there is an urgent quest for new anti-cancer drugs. In this study, we show that a group of dolabrane-type of diterpenes, collectively named tagalsins, isolated from the Chinese mangrove genus Ceriops has potent cytotoxicity on a panel of hematologic cancer cells. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms by which tagalsins kill malignant cells revealed that it induces a ROS-mediated damage of DNA. This event leads to apoptosis induction and blockage of cell cycle progression at S-G2 phase via activation of the ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2 check point pathway. We further show that tagalsins suppress growth of human T-cell leukemia xenografts in vivo. Tagalsins show only minor toxicity on healthy cells and are well tolerated by mice. Our study shows a therapeutic potential of tagalsins for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and a new source of anticancer drugs.","['(c) 2015 The Authors.

We previously demonstrated that a process involving glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta determines neutrophil apoptosis. As for this apoptotic process, an overdose of propofol (2,6-Diisopropylphenol; 25 mug/ml or 140 muM) also causes GSK-3beta-mediated macrophage apoptosis; however, the early deactivation of GSK-3beta with low-dose propofol has been shown. Therefore, we hypothesize that low-dose propofol may induce neutrophil survival via GSK-3beta inactivation. Following in vitro culture, the therapeutic concentration of propofol (10 mug/ml or 56 muM) treatment decreased constitutive apoptosis in isolated human primary neutrophils and in granulocyte-differentiated HL60 cells after all-trans retinoic acid (1 muM) treatment. The inactivation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/AKT and the activation of GSK-3beta results in myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) down-regulation, the loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and caspase-3 activation in these cells, which is accompanied by apoptosis. Notably, propofol treatment attenuates these effects in a PI3-kinase-regulated manner. We found that propofol initiates PI3-kinase/AKT-mediated GSK-3beta inactivation and Mcl-1 stabilization, rescuing the constitutive apoptosis in primary neutrophils and granulocyte-differentiated acute promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells.",,"['Hsing, Chung-Hsi', 'Chen, Chia-Ling', 'Lin, Wei-Chieh', 'Lin, Chiou-Feng']","['Hsing CH', 'Chen CL', 'Lin WC', 'Lin CF']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Chi Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan; Department of Anesthesiology, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Translational Research Center, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150610,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anesthetics, Intravenous)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",IM,"['Anesthetics, Intravenous/adverse effects/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Propofol/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism']",PMC4465642,,2015/06/11 06:00,2016/04/22 06:00,['2015/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0129693 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-05179 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jun 10;10(6):e0129693. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0129693. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the epidemiological information is not clear in Southeastern Asia, an area of potential high incidences of IFIs. To clarify it, we enrolled 298 non-M3 adult AML patients receiving induction chemotherapy without systemic anti-fungal prophylaxis from Jan 2004 to Dec 2009, when we applied a prospective diagnostic and treatment algorithm for IFIs. Their demographic parameters, IFI characters, and treatment outcome were collected for analysis. The median age of these patients was 51 years. Standard induction chemotherapy was used for 246 (82.6%) patients, and 66.8% of patients achieved complete remission (CR) or partial remission. The incidence of all-category IFIs was 34.6% (5.7% proven IFIs, 5.0% probable IFIs and 23.8% possible IFIs). Candida tropicalis was the leading pathogen among yeast, and lower respiratory tract was the most common site for IFIs (75.4%, 80/106). Standard induction chemotherapy and failure to CR were identified as risk factors for IFIs. The presence of IFI in induction independently predicted worse survival (hazard ratio 1.536 (1.100-2.141), p value = 0.012). Even in those who survived from the initial IFI insults after 3 months, the presence of IFIs in induction still predicted a poor long-term survival.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether gender and ethnic differences in incidence and survival of LN subtypes existed using the Singapore Cancer Registry (SCR) from 1998 to 2012. We derived age standardised incidence rates (ASIRs) by the direct standardisation method and 5-year relative survival (RSR) by the Ederer II method and period approach. Five-year observed survival (OS) was obtained for each ethnicity. Malays had the highest ASIR of total LNs among the three ethnicities for each time period. The largest increase in 5-year RSR subtypes was follicular lymphoma from 43.8% in 1998-2002 to 82.3% in 2008-2012; followed by chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) from 48.1% in 1998-2002 to 77.9% in 2008-2012. Although males had higher incidence than females in each time period, females had greater 5-year RSR for follicular lymphoma (89.8% in 2008-2012 for females vs. 76.6% in 2008-2012 for males) and CLL/SLL (78.7% in 2008-2012 for females vs. 76.7% in 2008-2012 for males). All three ethnicities experienced an overall increase in 5-year OS for mature B-cell lymphoma, with Indians experiencing the greatest increase (37.1% in 1998-2002 to 61.1% in 2008-2012), followed by Malays (30.8% in 1998-2002 to 48.7% in 2008-2012) and then Chinese (36.4% in 1998-2002 to 51.3% in 2008-2012).

Recently, it was shown that Bax and Bak are also required for mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)-dependent necrosis, where, in their non-oligomeric state, they enhance permeability characteristics of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Necroptosis is another form of regulated necrosis involving the death receptors and receptor interacting protein kinases (RIP proteins, by Ripk genes). Here, we show cells or mice deficient for Bax/Bak or cyclophilin D, a protein that regulates MPTP opening, are resistant to cell death induced by necroptotic mediators. We show that Bax/Bak oligomerization is required for necroptotic cell death and that this oligomerization reinforces MPTP opening. Mechanistically, we observe mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein and cofilin-1 translocation to the mitochondria following necroptosis induction, while expression of the mitochondrial matrix isoform of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), is significantly reduced. Some of these effects are lost with necroptosis inhibition in Bax/Bak1 double null, Ppif-/-, or Ripk3-/- fibroblasts. Hence, downstream mechanisms of cell death induced by necroptotic stimuli utilize both Bax/Bak to generate apoptotic pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane as well as MPTP opening in association with known mitochondrial death modifying proteins.",,"['Karch, Jason', 'Kanisicak, Onur', 'Brody, Matthew J', 'Sargent, Michelle A', 'Michael, Demetria M', 'Molkentin, Jeffery D']","['Karch J', 'Kanisicak O', 'Brody MJ', 'Sargent MA', 'Michael DM', 'Molkentin JD']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['P01 HL080101/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150610,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Bak1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclophilin D)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (PPIF protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ripk3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cyclophilin D', 'Cyclophilins/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4465034,,2015/06/11 06:00,2016/04/22 06:00,['2015/06/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0130520 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-52944 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jun 10;10(6):e0130520. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0130520. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The finding of three or more extra copies of the RUNX1 gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is internationally used to define an iAMP21. Genomic profiling of chromosome 21 has been suggested for assisting diagnostic case identification. Due to limitations of comparative genomic hybridization, in terms of a routine application as first line-screening tests we evaluated the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) SALSA P327_A1 and P327_B1 probe sets for detecting chromosome 21 copy number alterations in Brazilian childhood BCP-ALL. RESULTS: In 74 out of 368 patients gain of genetic material was detected. For data confirmation RUNX1 directed FISH was performed. Cells with >/=5 RUNX1 signals (n = 9) were considered as ""true iAMP21"" while <5 RUNX1 signals (n = 41) were counted as evidence for additional copies of intact chromosomes 21. All patients with an iAMP21 had high MLPA peak ratios (>/=1.8), while the majority of patients with <5 RUNX1 presented low MLPA peak ratios (<1.8). Observed differences gained statistical strength by comparing probes located within the common region of amplification. Next, a principal component analysis was performed in order to illustrate distribution of cases according to their MLPA peak profile in two dimensions. Cases with an iAMP21 mostly clustered together, however additional cases with <5 RUNX1 signals or no available FISH data located in proximity. CONCLUSIONS: MLPA qualified as a high throughput technique that could be employed in future studies for a critical comparison with data obtained by FISH, especially in cases where metaphase nuclei are not available. Taking submicroscopic aberrations into account examined by MLPA, cases exhibiting an ""iAMP21 like"" peak ratio profile but <5 RUNX1 signals should be considered as candidates for this chromosomal abnormality.",,"['Fuka, Gerhard', 'Farias-Vieira, Tallita M', 'Hummel, Leticia', 'Blunck, Caroline B', 'Santoro, Julio C', 'Terra-Granado, Eugenia', 'Barbosa, Thayana Conceicao', 'Emerenciano, Mariana', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['Fuka G', 'Farias-Vieira TM', 'Hummel L', 'Blunck CB', 'Santoro JC', 'Terra-Granado E', 'Barbosa TC', 'Emerenciano M', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20231-050 Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20231-050 Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20231-050 Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20231-050 Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20231-050 Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20231-050 Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20231-050 Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20231-050 Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rua Andre Cavalcanti, 37, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20231-050 Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150610,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,PMC4460763,,2015/06/11 06:00,2015/06/11 06:01,['2015/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-015-0147-2 [doi]', '147 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2015 Jun 10;8:35. doi: 10.1186/s13039-015-0147-2. eCollection 2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL)', 'Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)', 'Intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21)', 'Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide chemotherapy of this cancer induces the PML moiety to organize nuclear bodies, where the oncoprotein is degraded. This process requires the participation of two SUMO paralogs (SUMO1 and SUMO2) to promote PML ubiquitylation mediated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 and reorganization of PML nuclear bodies. We demonstrated that the ubiquitylation of PML required the SUMO deconjugation machinery, primarily the deconjugating enzyme SENP1, and was suppressed by expression of non-deconjugatable SUMO2. We hypothesized that constitutive SUMO2 conjugation and deconjugation occurred basally and that arsenic trioxide treatment caused the exchange of SUMO2 for SUMO1 on a fraction of Lys(65) in PML. On the basis of data obtained with mutational analysis and quantitative proteomics, we propose that the SUMO switch at Lys(65) of PML enhanced nuclear body formation, subsequent SUMO2 conjugation to Lys(160), and consequent RNF4-dependent ubiquitylation of PML. Our work provides insights into how the SUMO system achieves selective SUMO paralog modification and highlights the crucial role of SENPs in defining the specificity of SUMO signaling.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Fasci, Domenico', 'Anania, Veronica G', 'Lill, Jennie R', 'Salvesen, Guy S']","['Fasci D', 'Anania VG', 'Lill JR', 'Salvesen GS']","['Cell Death and Survival Networks Program, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.

However, the etiology of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is not clear. To study the possible pathogenetic mechanisms and treatment of this complication, we reported 11 cases of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after induction chemotherapy. After appropriate treatment, the clinical symptoms of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in most cases disappeared even though induction chemotherapy continued. During the 1-year follow-up, no recurrence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome was observed. Although the clinical and imaging features of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome may be diverse, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome should be recognized as a possible important complication of acute lymphoblastic leukemia when neurologic symptoms appear. In line with previous reports, our study also indicated that posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome was reversible when diagnosed and treated at an early stage. Thus, the occurrence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome should be considered and investigated to optimize the early induction scheme of acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment.",['(c) The Author(s) 2015.'],"['Tang, Ji-Hong', 'Tian, Jian-Mei', 'Sheng, Mao', 'Hu, Shao-Yan', 'Li, Yan', 'Zhang, Li-Ya', 'Gu, Qing', 'Wang, Qi']","['Tang JH', 'Tian JM', 'Sheng M', 'Hu SY', 'Li Y', 'Zhang LY', 'Gu Q', 'Wang Q']","[""Department of Neurology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", ""Department of Internal Medicine, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, Suzhou, China jianmei0512@163.com."", ""Radiology Department, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", ""Department of Neurology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", ""Department of Neurology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", ""Radiology Department, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, Suzhou, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150609,United States,J Child Neurol,Journal of child neurology,8606714,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/drug effects/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome/*etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/06/11 06:00,2016/11/01 06:00,['2015/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['0883073815589758 [pii]', '10.1177/0883073815589758 [doi]']",ppublish,J Child Neurol. 2016 Mar;31(3):279-84. doi: 10.1177/0883073815589758.

However, the regulatory control of the LIFR gene has remained largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the LIFR gene as a novel target of the RUNX1 transcription factor. The RUNX1 transcription factor is an essential regulator of hematopoiesis and is a frequent target of point mutations and chromosomal alterations in leukemia. RUNX1 regulates hematopoiesis through its control of genes important for hematopoietic cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, including a number of cytokines and cytokine receptors. LIFR is regulated by two alternate promoters: a placental-specific and a ubiquitously active general promoter. We show that both of these promoters are regulated by RUNX1. However, in myeloid cells LIFR expression is driven solely by the general LIFR promoter with our data indicating that the placental promoter is epigenetically silenced in these cells. While RUNX1 activates the LIFR general promoter, the oncogenic RUNX1-ETO fusion protein generated by the t(8;21) translocation commonly associated with acute myeloid leukemia represses promoter activity. The data presented here establish LIFR as a transcriptional target of RUNX1 and suggest that disruption of RUNX1 activity in myeloid cells may result in altered LIFR signaling in these cells.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Qadi, Abeer A', 'Taberlay, Phillippa C', 'Phillips, Jessica L', 'Young, Arabella', 'West, Alison C', 'Brettingham-Moore, Kate H', 'Dickinson, Joanne L', 'Holloway, Adele F']","['Qadi AA', 'Taberlay PC', 'Phillips JL', 'Young A', 'West AC', 'Brettingham-Moore KH', 'Dickinson JL', 'Holloway AF']","['Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.', 'Genomics and Epigenetics Division, The Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Darlinghurst, New South Wales 2010, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/physiology', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2015/06/11 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.25246 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2016 Jan;117(1):49-58. doi: 10.1002/jcb.25246.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['GENE REGULATION', 'LIFR', 'RUNX1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several groups of nanoparticles have shown promising applications in directing the stem cell fate. Herein, we investigated the cellular effects of layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (LDH NPs) on mouse ESCs (mESCs) and the associated molecular mechanisms. Mg-Al-LDH NPs with an average diameter of approximately 100 nm were prepared by hydrothermal methods. To determine the influences of LDH NPs on mESCs, cellular cytotoxicity, self-renewal, differentiation potential, and the possible signaling pathways were explored. Evaluation of cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase release, ROS generation and apoptosis demonstrated the low cytotoxicity of LDH NPs. The alkaline phosphatase activity and the expression of pluripotency genes in mESCs were examined, which indicated that exposure to LDH NPs could support self-renewal and inhibit spontaneous differentiation of mESCs under feeder-free culture conditions. The self-renewal promotion was further proved to be independent of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Furthermore, cells treated with LDH NPs maintained the potential to differentiate into all three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo through formation of embryoid bodies and teratomas. In addition, we observed that LDH NPs initiated the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, while treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could block the effects of LDH NPs on mESCs. The results confirmed that the promotion of self-renewal by LDH NPs was associated with activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Altogether, our studies identified a new role of LDH NPs in maintaining self-renewal of mouse ES cells which could potentially be applied in stem cell research.",,"['Wu, Youjun', 'Zhu, Rongrong', 'Zhou, Yang', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Wang, Wenrui', 'Sun, Xiaoyu', 'Wu, Xianzheng', 'Cheng, Liming', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Wang, Shilong']","['Wu Y', 'Zhu R', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhang J', 'Wang W', 'Sun X', 'Wu X', 'Cheng L', 'Zhang J', 'Wang S']","[""Tenth People's Hospital, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, PR China. zhangjing@tongji.edu.cn wsl@tongji.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150610,England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,"['0 (Hydroxides)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Hydroxides/*chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,,2015/06/11 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c5nr02339d [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2015 Jul 7;7(25):11102-14. doi: 10.1039/c5nr02339d.

However, the association between gender, BCR-ABL transcript type, and age with MMR is not well understood and often controversial. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 166 patients who have been treated with imatinib for up to 10 yr. RESULTS: Men had a lower MMR rate than women (63.3% vs. 81.6%, P = 0.006) and a shorter time to relapse (median 354 vs. 675 d, P = 0.049), while patients with b3a2 or with both b3a2 and b2a2 break point transcripts had higher MMR rate than those with b2a2 (81.8%, 77.1% vs. 60.7%, P = 0.023 for b3a2 vs. b2a2, P = 0.043 for both vs. b2a2). A striking difference was found between men with b2a2 and women with both b2a2 and b3a2 in terms of MMR rate (43.8% vs. 88.9%), MMR rate within 6 months (7.1% vs. 62.5%) and the time to MMR (median d 493 vs. 159, P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Both gender and BCR-ABL transcript, but not age, were significantly associated with the molecular response.

Several studies suggest that 2-(4-aminophenyl)-7-methoxybenzothiazole (7-OMe-APBT) may potentially induce apoptosis of cancer cells. Thus, the present study was conducted to explore the cytotoxic effect of 7-OMe-APBT on human leukemia U937 cells. The apoptosis of human leukemia U937 cells induced by 7-OMe-APBT was characterized by an increase in mitochondrial membrane depolarization, procaspase-8 degradation, and tBid production. Down-regulation of FADD blocked 7-OMe-APBT-induced procaspase-8 degradation and rescued the viability of 7-OMe-APBT-treated cells, suggesting the involvement of a death receptor-mediated pathway in 7-OMe-APBT-induced cell death. Increased TNF-alpha expression, TNFR2 expression, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were noted in 7-OMe-APBT-treated cells. Pretreatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor abolished 7-OMe-APBT-induced TNF-alpha and TNFR2 up-regulation. 7-OMe-APBT stimulated p38 MAPK/c-Jun-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of TNFR2, while the increased TNF-alpha mRNA stability led to TNF-alpha up-regulation in 7-OMe-APBT-treated cells. Treatment with 7-OMe-APBT up-regulated protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit alpha (PP2Acalpha) expression via the p38 MAPK/c-Jun/ATF-2 pathway, which, in turn, promoted tristetraprolin (TTP) degradation. Pretreatment with a protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor or TTP over-expression abrogated TNF-alpha up-regulation in 7-OMe-APBT-treated cells. Abolishment of TNF-alpha up-regulation or knock-down of TNFR1/TNFR2 by siRNA restored the viability of 7-OMe-APBT-treated cells. Taken together, our data indicate a connection between p38 MAPK-mediated TNF-alpha and TNFR2 up-regulation and 7-OMe-APBT-induced TNF-alpha-mediated death pathway activation in U937 cells. The same pathway also elucidates the mechanism underlying 7-OMe-APBT-induced death of human leukemia HL-60 cells.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Huang, Chia-Hui', 'Chen, Ying-Jung', 'Chao, Tzu-Yu', 'Liu, Wen-Hsin', 'Changchien, Jung-Jung', 'Hu, Wan-Ping', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Huang CH', 'Chen YJ', 'Chao TY', 'Liu WH', 'Changchien JJ', 'Hu WP', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Laboratory Medicine Division, Zuoying Branch of Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (2-(4-aminophenyl)-7-methoxybenzothiazole)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzothiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2015/06/11 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.25064 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2016 Jan;231(1):130-41. doi: 10.1002/jcp.25064.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response to pathogenic stimuli, this process causes T cells to proliferate rapidly and secrete high amounts of the cytokine IFN-gamma, leading to the Th1 proinflammatory phenotype. However, there are still unknown components of this differentiation pathway. We here demonstrated that the expression of the histone methyltransferase Mll1 is driven by IL-12 signaling through STAT4 in humans and mice and is critical for the proper differentiation of a naive T cell to a Th1 cell. Once MLL1 is up-regulated by IL-12, it regulates the proliferation of Th1 cells. As evidence of this, we show that Th1 cells from Mll1(+/-) mice are unable to proliferate rapidly in a Th1 environment in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, upon restimulation with cognate antigen Mll1(+/-), T cells do not convert to a Th1 phenotype, as characterized by IFN-gamma output. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in IFN-gamma production and proliferation in human peripheral blood stimulated with tetanus toxoid by use of a specific inhibitor of the MLL1/menin complex.

No data are available on the role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in reversing its negative prognostic role. We have reviewed the outcome of 142 patients with high risk AML who underwent allogeneic SCT in complete remission (n = 94) or with active disease (n = 48). Patients with ABCG2 overexpression at AML diagnosis have lower leukemia free survival (LFS) and increased cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) compared with ABCG2- patients (5-year LFS 50% vs. 65%, P = 0.01; 5-year CIR 46% vs. 27%, P = 0.003). Five-year overall survival was not significantly different between ABCG2+ and ABCG2- patients (39% vs. 51%, P = 0.1). However, if we consider only disease-related deaths, ABCG2 maintains its negative role (64% vs. 78%, P = 0.018). The negative impact of ABCG2 overexpression was higher in patients undergoing SCT in CR compared with patients receiving transplant with active disease. Conditioning regimen did not abrogate the effect of ABCG2 overexpression, as CIR was higher in ABCG2+ patients receiving both myeloablative (44% vs. 22%, P = 0.018) or reduced intensity conditioning (50% vs. 32%, P = 0.03). In conclusion, ABCG2 overexpression at AML diagnosis identifies a subset of patients with poor outcome also after allogeneic SCT, mainly in terms of higher relapse rates. Prospective studies employing conditioning drugs or post-transplant strategies able to target ABCG2 are needed to maximize the curative potential of stem cell transplantation.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Damiani, Daniela', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Geromin, Antonella', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Cavallin, Margherita', 'Sperotto, Alessandra', 'Fanin, Renato']","['Damiani D', 'Tiribelli M', 'Geromin A', 'Michelutti A', 'Cavallin M', 'Sperotto A', 'Fanin R']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Udine, Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150722,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/06/11 06:00,2015/11/04 06:00,['2015/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24084 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Sep;90(9):784-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24084.

In particular, high glycolysis is critical for the generation and maintenance of PSCs. However, it is unknown how PSCs maintain and acquire this metabolic signature. In this study, we found that core pluripotency factors regulate glycolysis directly by controlling the expression of glycolytic enzymes. Specifically, Oct4 directly governs Hk2 and Pkm2, which are important glycolytic enzymes that determine the rate of glycolytic flux. The overexpression of Hk2 and Pkm2 sustains high levels of glycolysis during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Moreover, the maintenance of high glycolysis levels by Hk2 and Pkm2 overexpression hampers differentiation and preserves the pluripotency of ESCs in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor.

Inhibition of STAT5 induced apoptosis and sensitized these cells to the growth inhibition mediated by conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The present study attempted to identify molecules that are regulated by STAT5 in CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells by utilizing cDNA microarrays, comparing the gene expression profiles of control and STAT5A shRNA-transduced CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells. Interestingly, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 3A was downregulated after depletion of STAT5A in CD34(+)/CD38(-) AML cells. Reporter gene assays found that an increase in activity of DNMT3A occurred in response to activation of STAT5A in leukemia cells. On the other hand, dephosphorylation of STAT5A by AZ960 decreased this transcriptional activity. Further studies utilizing a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay identified a STAT5A-binding site on the promoter region of DNMT3A gene. Forced expression of STAT5A in leukemia cells caused hypermethylation on the promoter region of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, and downregulated its mRNA levels, as measured by methylation-specific and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that STAT5A positively regulates levels of DNMT3A, resulting in inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by epigenetic mechanisms in AML cells.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Overexpression is associated with an adverse prognosis in adults. In childhood, the genes have only been investigated in leukemias bearing MLL translocations. The aim of this study was to determine whether overexpression extends to leukemic subtypes other than the MLL-positive subtype in childhood. We use quantitative real-time PCR methodology to investigate gene expression in 100 children with acute leukemias and compare them to those of healthy controls. We show that abnormally high HOXA9 and MEIS1 gene expression is associated with a variety of leukemic subtypes, including various maturation stages of B-cell ALL and cytogenetic types other than the MLL-positive population, thus suggesting that the genes are implicated in the development of a broad range of leukemic subtypes in childhood.

Specific and potent inhibitors of the BCL-2 family, such as ABT-263 (navitoclax) and ABT-199, are only effective against some members of the BCL-2 family but do not target MCL-1, which is commonly amplified in tumors and associated with chemoresistance. In this report, the selectivity and potency of two putative MCL-1 inhibitors, dinaciclib and maritoclax, were assessed. Although both compounds induced Bax/Bak- and caspase-9-dependent apoptosis, dinaciclib was more potent than maritoclax in downregulating MCL-1 and also in inducing apoptosis. However, the compounds induced apoptosis, even in cells lacking MCL-1, suggesting multiple mechanisms of cell death. Furthermore, maritoclax induced extensive mitochondrial fragmentation, and a Bax/Bak- but MCL-1-independent accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), with an accompanying loss of complexes I and III of the electron transport chain.

We aimed to evaluate a new flow cytometric immunobead assay to detect BCR-ABL protein in a group of patients with CML. METHODS: We enrolled 49 patients with CML, whose qRT-PCR and/or cytogenetic analysis of Philadelphia chromosome aberration was available, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)-naive and (TKIs)-treated patients with various levels of response. Twenty Philadelphia-negative healthy individuals were also enrolled to obtain analytical negative controls. Peripheral blood samples were analyzed for BCR-ABL fusion protein by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The BCR-ABL fusion protein flow cytometric assay seemed efficacious to both diagnose the presence (P-value <0.0001) and distinguish the levels (P-value = 0) of the Philadelphia chromosome aberration. Groups of TKI-naive and TKI-treated patients as well as levels of molecular/cytogenetic response to TKI-therapy were effectively discriminated (P-value <0.01). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated the diagnostic value of the assay as excellent (AUC = 0.95, P-value = 0).

Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) has been implicated in cancer progression and is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers. However, the interaction between Mcl-1 and EMT in human gastric cancer (GC) is unclear. We investigated the impact of Mcl-1 expression levels on EMT and the underlying signaling pathways in human GC cells. We used the human GC cell lines, AGS and SNU638, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to evaluate the effects of Mcl-1 knockdown on cell adhesion, migration and invasion. Expression of Mcl-1 and other target genes was determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays and western blotting. The results revealed that expression levels of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein in the AGS and SNU638 cells were reduced following transfection with Mcl-1 siRNAs. Knockdown of Mcl-1 led to increased cellular adhesion to fibronectin and collagen. Expression levels of vimentin, MMP-2, MMP-9 and Snail protein were decreased following knockdown of Mcl-1. However, expression of E-cadherin was increased in the AGS cells following knockdown of Mcl-1. The expression of cancer stemness markers, such as CD44 and CD133, was not altered by knockdown of Mcl-1. Knockdown of Mcl-1 suppressed tumor cell migration and invasion in both human GC cell lines. Signaling cascades, including the beta-catenin, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and p38 pathways, were significantly blocked by knockdown of Mcl-1. Our results indicate that Mcl-1 expression induces EMT via beta-catenin, MEK1/2 and MAPK signaling pathways, which subsequently stimulates the invasive and migratory capacity of human GC cells.",,"['Lee, Wan-Sik', 'Kim, Nuri', 'Park, Young-Ran', 'Oh, Hyung-Hoon', 'Myung, Eun', 'Kim, Seung-Hun', 'Yu, Hyung-Min', 'Kim, Mi-Young', 'Oak, Chan-Young', 'Chung, Cho-Yun', 'Park, Hyung-Chul', 'Myung, Dae-Seong', 'Cho, Sung-Bum', 'Joo, Young-Eun']","['Lee WS', 'Kim N', 'Park YR', 'Oh HH', 'Myung E', 'Kim SH', 'Yu HM', 'Kim MY', 'Oak CY', 'Chung CY', 'Park HC', 'Myung DS', 'Cho SB', 'Joo YE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju 501-190, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150608,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology']",,,2015/06/11 06:00,2016/04/29 06:00,['2015/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2015.4040 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2015 Aug;34(2):1011-6. doi: 10.3892/or.2015.4040.

This dramatic improvement in the survival rate is an example of the advantage of modern medicine. APL is characterized by a balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocation fusing the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) gene on chromosome 15 with the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) gene on chromosome 17. It has been found that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) or arsenic trioxide (ATO) alone exerts therapeutic effect on APL patients with the PML-RARalpha fusion gene, and the combination of both drugs can act synergistically to further enhance the cure rate of the patients. Here, we provide an insight into the pathogenesis of APL and the mechanisms underlying the respective roles of ATRA and ATO. In addition, treatments that lead to more effective differentiation and apoptosis of APL cells, including leukaemia-initiating cells, and more thorough eradication of the disease will be discussed.

Mutations in ribosomal protein coding genes, mainly in RPS19, account for the majority of DBA cases. The molecular mechanisms underlying DBA pathogenesis are still not completely understood. Alternative spliced isoforms of FLVCR1 (feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1) transcript coding for non-functional proteins have been reported in some DBA patients. Consistently, a phenotype very close to DBA has been described in animal models of FLVCR1 deficiency. FLVCR1 gene codes for two proteins: the plasma membrane heme exporter FLVCR1a and the mitochondrial heme exporter FLVCR1b. The coordinated expression of both FLVCR1 isoforms regulates an intracellular heme pool, necessary for proper expansion and differentiation of erythroid precursors. Here, we investigate the role of FLVCR1 isoforms in a cellular model of DBA. RPS19-downregulated TF1 cells show reduced FLVCR1a and FLVCR1b mRNA levels associated with heme overload. The downregulation of FLVCR1 isoforms affects cell cycle progression and apoptosis in differentiating K562 cells, a phenotype similar to DBA. Taken together, these data suggest that alteration of heme metabolism could play a role in the pathogenesis of DBA.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The co-stimulation was attained using corresponding ligands: IgE binding antigen and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP1 alpha), respectively. However, this approach failed to trigger formation of nanotubes among rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells due to the lack of CCR1 on the cell surface (Int. Immunol. 2010, 22 (2), 113-128). RBL cells are frequently used as a model for mast cells and are best known for antibody-mediated activation via FcepsilonRI. This work reports the successful formation of membrane nanotubes among RBLs using only one stimulus, a hapten of 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) molecules, which are presented as nanostructures with our designed spatial arrangements. This observation underlines the significance of the local presentation of ligands in the context of impacting the cellular signaling cascades. In the case of RBL, certain DNP nanostructures suppress antigen-induced degranulation and facilitate the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton to form nanotubes. These results demonstrate an important scientific concept; engineered nanostructures enable cellular signaling cascades, where current technologies encounter great difficulties. More importantly, nanotechnology offers a new platform to selectively activate and/or inhibit desired cellular signaling cascades.",,"['Li, Jie-Ren', 'Ross, Shailise S', 'Liu, Yang', 'Liu, Ying X', 'Wang, Kang-Hsin', 'Chen, Huan-Yuan', 'Liu, Fu-Tong', 'Laurence, Ted A', 'Liu, Gang-Yu']","['Li JR', 'Ross SS', 'Liu Y', 'Liu YX', 'Wang KH', 'Chen HY', 'Liu FT', 'Laurence TA', 'Liu GY']","['daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of California, Davis, California 95616, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of California, Davis, California 95616, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of California, Davis, California 95616, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of California, Davis, California 95616, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of California, Davis, California 95616, United States.', 'double daggerDepartment of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California 95817, United States.', 'section signInstitute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'double daggerDepartment of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California 95817, United States.', 'section signInstitute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'parallelLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California 94550, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of California, Davis, California 95616, United States.']",['eng'],"['R01 AR056343/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA176850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R21CA176850-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150618,United States,ACS Nano,ACS nano,101313589,['0 (Haptens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*ultrastructure', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Structures/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Haptens/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Nanostructures/*chemistry', 'Rats']",PMC4758354,['NIHMS758956'],2015/06/10 06:00,2016/06/28 06:00,['2015/06/10 06:00'],"['2015/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acsnano.5b02270 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Nano. 2015 Jul 28;9(7):6738-46. doi: 10.1021/acsnano.5b02270.

Adiponectin is a multimeric protein of the white adipose tissue presenting anti-inflammatory, insulin-sensitizing, anti-atherogenic, cardioprotective, and anti-neoplastic properties. Its anti-neoplastic actions are manifested via two mechanisms: (i) direct action on tumor cells by enhancing receptor-mediated signaling pathways and (ii) indirect action by regulating inflammatory responses, influencing cancer angiogenesis, and modulating insulin sensitivity at the target tissue site. In the bone marrow milieu, adiponectin and its main receptors are expressed by the majority of bone marrow stromal cell populations influencing hematopoietic stem cells function. Adiponectin may represent a molecular mediator relating adiposopathy with leukemogenesis and myelomagenesis. Several epidemiological studies conducted to date relate hypoadiponectinemia to the risk of myeloid-derived hematopoietic cancer and multiple myeloma. Adiponectin may be a promising biomarker with potential diagnostic and prognostic utility in determining the likelihood of myeloma and leukemia progression in certain cohorts of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance patients and in myeloid hematologic malignancies, respectively. This review summarizes experimental and epidemiologic data regarding the role of adiponectin in hematologic malignancies in the context of adiposopathy. Enhancement of endogenous adiponectin, adiponectin replacement, or manipulation of adiponectin receptor sensitivity may be an attractive goal for prevention and an effective therapeutic strategy against hematopoietic cancer, specifically in overweight/obese individuals. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of the bone marrow microenvironment adiponectin in complex interactions involved in preleukemic and leukemic states.",,"['Dalamaga, Maria', 'Christodoulatos, Gerasimos S']","['Dalamaga M', 'Christodoulatos GS']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig,Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation,101538885,"['0 (Adiponectin)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Adiponectin/*metabolism', '*Adiposity', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Body Mass Index', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Obesity/*complications/metabolism/physiopathology']",,,2015/06/10 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/06/10 06:00'],"['2015/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/hmbci-2015-0016 [doi]', '/j/hmbci.ahead-of-print/hmbci-2015-0016/hmbci-2015-0016.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig. 2015 Jul;23(1):5-20. doi: 10.1515/hmbci-2015-0016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterization of THP-1 cells by immunofluorescence andWestern blot analysis confirmed the expression of all major ND10 components. THP-1 cells with a stable, individual knockdown of PML, hDaxx or Sp100 were generated. Importantly, depletion of the major ND10 proteins did not prevent the terminal cellular differentiation of THP-1 monocytes. After construction of a recombinant, endotheliotropic human cytomegalovirus expressing IE2-EYFP, we investigated whether the depletion of ND10 proteins affects the onset of viral IE gene expression. While after infection of differentiated, THP-1-derived macrophages as well as during differentiation-induced reactivation from latency an increase in the number of IE-expressing cells was readily detectable in the absence of the major ND10 proteins, no effect was observed in non-differentiated monocytes. We conclude that PML, hDaxx and Sp100 primarily act as cellular restriction factors during lytic HCMV replication and during the dynamic process of reactivation but do not serve as key determinants for the establishment of HCMV latency.",,"['Wagenknecht, Nadine', 'Reuter, Nina', 'Scherer, Myriam', 'Reichel, Anna', 'Muller, Regina', 'Stamminger, Thomas']","['Wagenknecht N', 'Reuter N', 'Scherer M', 'Reichel A', 'Muller R', 'Stamminger T']","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany. nadine.wagenknecht@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany. nina.reuter@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany. myriam.scherer@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany. aareiche@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany. regina.mueller@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany. thomas.stamminger@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150605,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Autoantigens/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Monocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', '*Virus Latency', '*Virus Replication']",PMC4488718,,2015/06/10 06:00,2016/04/01 06:00,['2015/06/10 06:00'],"['2015/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['v7062751 [pii]', '10.3390/v7062751 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2015 Jun 5;7(6):2884-907. doi: 10.3390/v7062751.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ND10', 'PML', 'cytomegalovirus', 'intrinsic immunity', 'latency', 'restriction factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcriptional activity of ERalpha is regulated by certain estrogen-receptor modulators. Hispolon, isolated from Phellinus linteus, a traditional medicinal mushroom called Sanghwang in Korea, has been used to treat various pathologies, such as inflammation, gastroenteric disorders, lymphatic diseases, and cancers. In this latter context, Hispolon has been reported to exhibit therapeutic efficacy against various cancer cells, including melanoma, leukemia, hepatocarcinoma, bladder cancer, and gastric cancer cells. However, ERalpha regulation by Hispolon has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the effects of Hispolon on the growth of breast cancer cells. We found that Hispolon decreased expression of ERalpha at both mRNA and the protein levels in MCF7 and T47D human breast cancer cells. Luciferase reporter assays showed that Hispolon decreased the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. Hispolon treatment also inhibited expression of the ERalpha target gene pS2.

In the future, the genetic landscape in cancer may have more clinical relevance than diagnosis based on tumor origin. This progress has emphasized PI3K/AKT/mTOR, among others, as a central signaling center of cancer development due to its governing control in cellular growth, survival, and metabolism. The discovery of high frequencies of mutations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in different cancer entities has sparked interest to inhibit elements of this pathway. In acute leukemia pharmacological interruption has yet to achieve desirable efficacy as targetable downstream mutations in PI3K/AKT/mTOR are absent. Nevertheless, mutations in membrane-associated genes upstream of PI3K/AKT/mTOR are frequent in acute leukemia and are associated with aberrant activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR thus providing a good rationale for further exploration. This review attempts to summarize key findings leading to aberrant activation and to reflect on both promises and challenges of targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR in acute leukemia.

It is one of the original forms of cancer immunotherapy and illustrates that lymphocytes can specifically recognize and eliminate aberrant, malignant cells. However, because of the high morbidity and mortality that is associated with alloSCT including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), refining the anti-leukemia immunity of alloSCT to target distinct antigens that mediate the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect could transform our approach to treating leukemia, and possibly other hematologic malignancies. Over the past few decades, many leukemia antigens have been discovered that can separate malignant cells from normal host cells and render them vulnerable targets. In concert, the field of T-cell engineering has matured to enable transfer of ectopic high-affinity antigen receptors into host or donor cells with greater efficiency and potency. Many preclinical studies have demonstrated that engineered and conventional T-cells can mediate lysis and eradication of leukemia via one or more leukemia antigen targets. This evidence now serves as a foundation for clinical trials that aim to cure leukemia using T-cells. The recent clinical success of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cells for treating patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia displays the potential of this new therapeutic modality. In this review, we discuss some of the most promising leukemia antigens and the novel strategies that have been implemented for adoptive cellular immunotherapy of lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. It is important to summarize the data for ACT of leukemia for physicians in-training and in practice and for investigators who work in this and related fields as there are recent discoveries already being translated to the patient setting and numerous accruing clinical trials.

The interdisciplinary field of comparative oncology offers a unique and strong opportunity to learn more about universal cancer risk and development through epidemiology, genetic and genomic investigations. Working across species, researchers from human and veterinary medicine can combine scientific findings to understand more quickly the origins of cancer and translate these findings to novel therapies to benefit both human and animals. This review begins with the genetic origins of canines and their advantage in cancer research. We next focus on recent findings in comparative oncology related to inherited, or genetic, risk for tumour development. We then detail the somatic, or genomic, changes within tumours and the similarities between species. The shared cancers between humans and dogs that we discuss include sarcoma (osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, histiocytic sarcoma, hemangiosarcoma), haematological malignancies (lymphoma, leukaemia), bladder cancer, intracranial neoplasms (meningioma, glioma) and melanoma. Tumour risk in other animal species is also briefly discussed.

Here we show that mice expressing a constitutive T-cell-specific ThPOK transgene (ThPOK(const) mice) develop thymic lymphomas. These tumors resemble human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in that they predominantly exhibit activating Notch1 mutations. Lymphomagenesis is prevented if thymocyte development is arrested at the DN3 stage by recombination-activating gene (RAG) deficiency, but restored by introduction of a T-cell receptor (TCR) transgene or by a single injection of anti-alphabetaTCR antibody into ThPOK(const) RAG-deficient mice, which promotes development to the CD4(+)8(+) (DP) stage. Hence, TCR signals and/or traversal of the DN (double negative) > DP (double positive) checkpoint are required for ThPOK-mediated lymphomagenesis. These results demonstrate a novel link between ThPOK, TCR signaling, and lymphomagenesis. Finally, we present evidence that ectopic ThPOK expression gives rise to a preleukemic and self-perpetuating DN4 lymphoma precursor population. Our results collectively define a novel role for ThPOK as an oncogene and precisely map the stage in thymopoiesis susceptible to ThPOK-dependent tumor initiation.",,"['Lee, Hyung-Ok', 'He, Xiao', 'Mookerjee-Basu, Jayati', 'Zhongping, Dai', 'Hua, Xiang', 'Nicolas, Emmanuelle', 'Sulis, Maria Luisa', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A', 'Testa, Joseph R', 'Kappes, Dietmar J']","['Lee HO', 'He X', 'Mookerjee-Basu J', 'Zhongping D', 'Hua X', 'Nicolas E', 'Sulis ML', 'Ferrando AA', 'Testa JR', 'Kappes DJ']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111;', 'University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112;', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111;', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111;', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111;', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111;', 'Institute of Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.', 'Institute of Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111;', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111; Dietmar.Kappes@fccc.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA006927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA153260/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150608,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Th-POK protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transgenes']",PMC4485124,,2015/06/10 06:00,2015/11/11 06:00,['2015/06/10 06:00'],"['2015/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1424104112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1424104112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Jun 23;112(25):7773-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1424104112.

Recent clinical trials demonstrated that chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) can effectively redirect T lymphocytes to eradicate lymphoid malignancies of B-cell origin. However, T-lineage neoplasms remain a more challenging task for CAR T cells due to shared expression of most targetable surface antigens between normal and malignant T cells, potentially leading to fratricide of CAR T cells or profound immunodeficiency. Here, we report that T cells transduced with a CAR targeting CD5, a common surface marker of normal and neoplastic T cells, undergo only limited fratricide and can be expanded long-term ex vivo. These CD5 CAR T cells effectively eliminate malignant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoma lines in vitro and significantly inhibit disease progression in xenograft mouse models of T-ALL.

Our results show that blasts from cases with an immature plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) phenotype exhibit an uncommon CD56- phenotype, coexisting with CD34+ non-pDC tumor cells, typically in the absence of extramedullary (e.g. skin) disease at presentation. Conversely, patients with a more mature blast cell phenotype more frequently displayed skin/extramedullary involvement and spread into secondary lymphoid tissues. Despite the dismal outcome, acute lymphoblastic leukemia-type therapy (with central nervous system prophylaxis) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation appeared to be the only effective therapies.

Herein, we evaluated the effects of metformin and aspirin, alone or in combination, on cell viability, migration, and apoptosis as well as the molecular changes in mTOR, STAT3 and apoptotic signaling pathways in PANC-1 and BxPC3 cells. Metformin and aspirin, at relatively low concentrations, demonstrated synergistically inhibitory effects on cell viability. Compared to the untreated control or individual drug, the combination of metformin and aspirin significantly inhibited cell migration and colony formation of both PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. Metformin combined with aspirin significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR and STAT3, and induced apoptosis as measured by caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Remarkably, metformin combined with aspirin significantly downregulated the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, and upregulated the pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Puma, as well as interrupted their interactions. The downregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 was independent of AMPK or STAT3 pathway but partially through mTOR signaling and proteasome degradation. In a PANC-1 xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated that the combination of metformin and aspirin significantly inhibited tumor growth and downregulated the protein expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in tumors.

Recently we demonstrated that leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 2 (LILRB2) and its murine homolog, paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PIRB), are expressed on hematopoietic stem cells and acute myeloid leukemia stem cells and function in maintenance of stemness. Herein, we determined that both LILRB2 and its soluble ligand ANGPTL2 are highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples, and levels are adversely related to patient prognosis. Inhibition of LILRB2 expression in NSCLC cell lines, such as A549 cells, resulted in a dramatic decrease in proliferation, colony formation, and migration. Mechanistic analyses indicated that ANGPTL2 binds LILRB2 to support the growth of lung cancer cells and that the SHP2/CaMK1/CREB axis controls the proliferation of lung cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that signaling involving ANGPTL2 and LILRB2 is important for lung cancer development and represents a novel target for treatment of this type of cancer.",,"['Liu, Xiaoye', 'Yu, Xiaoting', 'Xie, Jingjing', 'Zhan, Mengna', 'Yu, Zhuo', 'Xie, Li', 'Zeng, Hongxiang', 'Zhang, Feifei', 'Chen, Guoqiang', 'Yi, Xianghua', 'Zheng, Junke']","['Liu X', 'Yu X', 'Xie J', 'Zhan M', 'Yu Z', 'Xie L', 'Zeng H', 'Zhang F', 'Chen G', 'Yi X', 'Zheng J']","['Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Faculty of Basic Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Bingzhou Medical University, Taishan Scholar Program, Yantai, China.', 'Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Faculty of Basic Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (ANGPTL2 protein, human)', '0 (Angiopoietin-Like Protein 2)', '0 (Angiopoietin-like Proteins)', '0 (Angiopoietins)', '0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (LILRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (CAMK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Angiopoietin-Like Protein 2', 'Angiopoietin-like Proteins', 'Angiopoietins/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 1/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ligands', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC4673246,,2015/06/10 06:00,2016/06/16 06:00,['2015/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['4217 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4217 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Aug 28;6(25):21004-15. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.4217.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ANGPTL2/LILRB2 signaling', 'CaMK1', 'lung cancer', 'metastasis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among AML with normal karyotype (NK-AML) FLT3 activating mutation, internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), is present in about 30% of patients, conferring unfavorable outcome. Our previous data demonstrated specific up-regulation of miR-155 in FLT3-ITD+ AML. miR-155 is known to be directly implicated in normal hematopoiesis and in some pathologies such as myeloid hyperplasia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: To investigate about the potential influence of miR-155 de-regulation in FLT3-mutated AML we generated a transcription factors regulatory network and combined this with data from multiple sources that predict miR-155 interactions. From these analyses, we derived a sub-network, called ""miR-155 module"" that describes functional relationship among miR-155 and transcription factors in FLT3-mutated AML. We found that ""miR-155 module"" is characterized by the presence of six transcription factors as central hubs: four miR-155 regulators (JUN, RUNX1, FOSb, JUNB) and two targets of miR-155 (SPI1, CEBPB) all known to be ""master"" genes of myelopoiesis. We found, in FLT3-mutated AML, a significant down-regulation of miR-155 target genes CEBPB and SPI1 and up-regulation of miR-155 regulator genes JUN and RUNX1. We also showed that PKC412-related FLT3 inhibition, in MV4-11 cell line, causes down-regulation of miR-155 and increased level of mRNA and protein of miR-155 target SPI1. We showed in experiments of miR-155 mimic in K562 cell line, a high increase of miR-155 and an inverse correlation with the mRNA levels of its targets SPI1 and CEBPB. Moreover silencing of miR-155 in primary AMLs causes mRNA up-regulation of its target SPI1 and CEBPB. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that activating mutation of FLT3 in AML can lead, through the induction of JUN, to an increased expression of miR-155, which then causes down-regulation of SPI1 and CEBPB and consequently may causes block of myeloid differentiation.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A series of studies on disease-susceptibility genes and twins have demonstrated the association of genetic factors with autoimmunity and disease severity and the contribution of environmental factors to the induction of clinical features in this disease. Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli1), a member of Ets transcription factor family, is epigenetically suppressed in the lesional skin of SSc patients, suggesting that Fli1 is a potential predisposing factor of SSc reflecting the influence of environmental factors. Consistent with this idea, Fli1 deficiency induces SSc-like phenotypes in dermal fibroblasts and dermal microvascular endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro at molecular levels. Furthermore, Fli1 haploinsufficiency recapitulates tissue fibrosis, vascular activation and inflammation characteristic of SSc to a greater extent in bleomycin-treated mice. Importantly, bosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist with a potential disease-modifying effect on SSc vasculopathy, reverses the expression of Fli1 protein by increasing its protein stability. Therefore, Fli1 may serve as a predisposing factor of SSc and can be a promising therapeutic target of this incurable and devastating disease.

So far, no curative treatment concept has been developed for these patients. We identified the epigenetic reader bromodomain-containing protein-4 (BRD4) as novel drug target in aggressive SM (ASM) and MC leukemia (MCL). As assessed by immunohistochemistry and PCR, neoplastic MCs expressed substantial amounts of BRD4 in ASM and MCL. The human MCL lines HMC-1 and ROSA also expressed BRD4, and their proliferation was blocked by a BRD4-specific short hairpin RNA. Correspondingly, the BRD4-targeting drug JQ1 induced dose-dependent growth inhibition and apoptosis in HMC-1 and ROSA cells, regardless of the presence or absence of KIT D816V. In addition, JQ1 suppressed the proliferation of primary neoplastic MCs obtained from patients with ASM or MCL (IC50: 100-500 nm). In drug combination experiments, midostaurin (PKC412) and all-trans retinoic acid were found to cooperate with JQ1 in producing synergistic effects on survival in HMC-1 and ROSA cells.

We have previously reported high miR-126 expression levels to be associated with a LSC-gene expression profile. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-126 contributes to 'stemness' and is a viable target for eliminating the LSC in AML. Here we first validate the clinical relevance of miR-126 expression in AML by showing that higher expression of this microRNA (miR) is associated with worse outcome in a large cohort of older (60 years) cytogenetically normal AML patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. We then show that miR-126 overexpression characterizes AML LSC-enriched cell subpopulations and contributes to LSC long-term maintenance and self-renewal. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of therapeutic targeting of miR-126 in LSCs with novel targeting nanoparticles containing antagomiR-126 resulting in in vivo reduction of LSCs likely by depletion of the quiescent cell subpopulation. Our findings suggest that by targeting a single miR, that is, miR-126, it is possible to interfere with LSC activity, thereby opening potentially novel therapeutic approaches to treat AML

Many patients do not have fully HLA-matched donors, and the impact of HLA mismatch on RIC HCT has not been examined in large cohorts. We analyzed 2588 recipients of 8/8 HLA-high resolution matched (n = 2025) or single-locus mismatched (n = 563) unrelated donor (URD) RIC HCT from 1999 to 2011. Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome. Secondary endpoints included treatment-related mortality (TRM), relapse, disease-free survival (DFS), and acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Adjusted 1- and 3-year OS was better in 8/8- versus 7/8-matched recipients (54.7% versus 48.8%, P = .01, and 37.4% versus 30.9%, P = .005, respectively). In multivariate models 7/8 URD RIC HCT recipients had more grades II to IV acute GVHD (RR = 1.29, P = .0034), higher TRM (RR = 1.52, P < .0001), and lower DFS (RR = 1.12, P = .0015) and OS (RR = 1.25, P = .0001), with no difference in relapse or chronic GVHD. In subgroup analysis, inferior transplant outcomes were noted regardless of the HLA allele mismatched. Previously reported permissive mismatches at HLA-C (C*03:03/C*03:04) and HLA-DP1 (based on T cell-epitope matching) were not associated with better outcomes. Although feasible, single-locus mismatch in RIC URD HCT is associated with inferior outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

We assessed safety and efficacy of decitabine maintenance after allogeneic transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Decitabine maintenance may help eradicate minimal residual disease, decrease the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and facilitate a graft-versus-leukemia effect by enhancing the effect of T regulatory lymphocytes. Patients with AML/MDS in complete remission (CR) after allotransplantation started decitabine between day +50 and +100. We investigated 4 decitabine doses in cohorts of 4 patients: 5, 7.5, 10, and 15 mg/m(2)/day x 5 days every 6 weeks, for a maximum 8 cycles. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the maximum dose at which </= 25% of people experience dose-limiting toxicities during the first cycle of treatment. Twenty-four patients were enrolled and 22 were evaluable. All 4 dose levels were completed and no MTD was reached. Overall, decitabine maintenance was well tolerated. Grade 3 and 4 hematological toxicities were experienced by 75% of patients, including all patients treated at the highest dose level. Nine patients completed all 8 cycles and 8 of them remain in CR. Nine patients died from relapse (n = 4), infectious complications (n = 3), and GVHD (n = 2). Most occurrences of acute GVHD were mild and resolved without interruption of treatment; 1 patient died of acute gut GVHD. Decitabine maintenance did not clearly impact the rate of chronic GVHD. Although there was a trend of increased FOXP3 expression, results were not statistically significant. In conclusion, decitabine maintenance is associated with acceptable toxicities when given in the post-allotransplantation setting. Although the MTD was not reached, the dose of 10 mg/m(2) for 5 days every 6 weeks appeared to be the optimal dose rather than 15 mg/m(2), where most hematological toxicities occurred.","['Copyright (c) 2015 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In these applications, the complete disruption of the cellular membrane and a high lysis yield is essential. Here, we present a novel approach to lyse cells on-chip through the application of electric discharges from a corona handheld device. The method only requires a microfluidic chip and a low-cost corona device. We demonstrate the effective lysis of BHK and eGFP HCT 116 cells in the sub-second time range using an embedded microelectrode. We also show cell lysis of non-adherent K562 leukemia cells without the use of an electrode in the chip. Cell lysis has been assessed through the use of bright-field microscopy, high-speed imaging and cell-viability fluorescence probes. The experimental results show effective cell lysis without any bubble formation or significant heating.

Until now, there is no effective therapy for FeLV-infected cats. RNA interference-based antiviral therapy is a new concept. Specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) are designed complementary to the mRNA of a target region, and thus inhibit replication. Several studies have proven efficacy of siRNAs in inhibiting virus replication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory potential of siRNAs against FeLV replication in vitro. siRNAs against the FeLV env gene and the host cell surface receptor (feTHTR1) which is used by FeLV-A for entry as well as siRNA that were not complementary to the FeLV or cat genome, were tested. Crandell feline kidney cells (CrFK cells) were transfected with FeLV-A/Glasgow-1. On day 13, infected cells were transfected with siRNAs. As control, cells were mock-transfected or treated with azidothymidine (AZT) (5 mug/ml). Culture supernatants were analyzed for FeLV RNA using quantitative real-time RT-PCR and for FeLV p27 by ELISA every 24 hours for five days. All siRNAs significantly reduced viral RNA and p27 production, starting after 48 hours.

RESULTS: IL-1 and TNF-alpha mRNAs and IgG and IgA concentrations were higher in the endometriosis group, but the differences were not statistically significant. However, Bcl-6 mRNA level was significantly lower and Blimp-1 mRNA level was significantly higher in the endometriosis group with significant correlations among transcriptional factors, Igs, and cytokines (p < 0.05).

All subgroups except for isolated NPM1mut are associated with poor prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed 223 patients with CN AML, 156 of whom were treated with standard chemotherapy. For postremission therapy, patients with available donors underwent allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and the rest were treated with autologous HSCT or chemotherapy alone. We first compared the 4 conventional molecular subgroups, and then created another 4 subgroups based on WT1 expression: isolated NPM1mut, NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD-neg with low WT1 or high WT1, and FLT3-ITD-pos CN AML. We finally evaluated 89 patients who were treated with allo HSCT and achieved complete remission after standard chemotherapy. FLT3-ITD CN AML showed the worst outcome irrespective of NPM1mut, and isolated NPM1mut CN AML showed no significant differences compared with NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD-neg CN AML. In contrast, two newly stratified low-risk subgroups (NPM1wt/FLT3-ITD-neg with low WT1 and isolated NPM1mut CN AML) showed higher remission rates with superior overall survival (OS) compared with the other two high-risk subgroups, which showed a higher relapse rate even after allo HSCT. Further analysis showed that higher pre-HSCT expression of WT1 resulted in a higher relapse rate and poorer OS after allo HSCT. For CN AML, a risk-adapted approach using allo HSCT with novel agents should be evaluated with stratification specified by WT1.

PROCEDURE: We retrospectively analyzed 767 children who received TBI-based myeloablative allogeneic HSCT in complete remission (CR), using nationwide registry data of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. Combinations of chemotherapy were categorized as follows: cyclophosphamide (CY) (n = 74), melphalan (L-PAM) (n = 139), CY + etoposide (VP16) (n = 408), CY + cytarabine (AraC) (n = 73), and others (n = 73). RESULTS: Event-free survival (EFS) at 5 years after HSCT was 62.2% for CY, 71.4% for L-PAM, 67.6% for CY + VP16, 52.6% for CY + AraC, and 59.1% for others (P = 0.009). Further detailed comparison of LPAM and CY + VP16 demonstrated superior EFS for LPAM (83.2 +/- 6.7%), with a marked difference compared with CY + VP16 (66.7 +/- 4.9%) when limited to HSCT from a matched related donor (MRD), and this result was reproduced regardless of disease status (CR1 or CR2). However, EFS for CY + VP16 (68.3 +/- 2.8%) was comparable to that for LPAM (64.5 +/- 5.7%, P = 0.37) in HSCT from alternative donors, because higher non-relapse mortality attenuated the advantage of LPAM. CONCLUSIONS: For pediatric ALL in remission, LPAM could provide superior EFS for HSCT from MRD; however, compared to LPAM, CY + VP16 has similar EFS for HSCT from an alternative donor.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kato, Motohiro', 'Ishida, Hiroyuki', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Inagaki, Jiro', 'Kato, Keisuke', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Kaneko, Takashi', 'Cho, Yuko', 'Hashii, Yoshiko', 'Kurosawa, Hidemitsu', 'Takita, Junko', 'Hamamoto, Kazuko', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Sawada, Akihisa', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Kato, Koji']","['Kato M', 'Ishida H', 'Koh K', 'Inagaki J', 'Kato K', 'Goto H', 'Kaneko T', 'Cho Y', 'Hashii Y', 'Kurosawa H', 'Takita J', 'Hamamoto K', 'Inoue M', 'Sawada A', 'Suzuki R', 'Kato K']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Matsushita Memorial Hospital, Moriguchi, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Japan."", ""Division of Hemato-oncology/Regenerative Medicine, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center, Fuchu, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Hospital, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dokkyo University Hospital, Shimotsuga, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Izumi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Izumi, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150605,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods']",,,2015/06/09 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2015/06/09 06:00'],"['2015/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25602 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Oct;62(10):1844-50. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25602.

The medical justification for this treatment has not been objectively documented. We report a 27-year-old woman, diagnosed with CML at 10-week gestation, who developed severe dyspnea on exertion. A workup that included chest CT and echocardiography with a bubble study detected no cardiopulmonary pathology to explain her symptoms, and thus she was referred for leukapheresis. Prior to her first leukapheresis, which lowered her WBC from 154 x 10(3) /muL to 133 x 10(3) /muL, her oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) on room air decreased from 98 to 93% during 100 feet of slow ambulation and she was dyspneic. Just after the leukapheresis, her dyspnea on exertion was much improved and her SpO2 remained at 98% with repeat ambulation. Spirometry and lung volume studies obtained before and after her first leukapheresis demonstrated 32 and 31% improvements in forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s respectively, a 25% increase in functional residual capacity, and a 142% improvement in expiratory reserve volume. Residual volume decreased by almost 20%. Three times in a week, leukapheresis was continued until her WBC was controlled with interferon alpha-2b approximately 4 weeks later.

In mice, naive T cells (TN) cause more severe GVHD than memory T cells (TM). We hypothesized that selective depletion of TN from human allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts would reduce GVHD and provide sufficient numbers of hematopoietic stem cells and TM to permit hematopoietic engraftment and the transfer of pathogen-specific T cells from donor to recipient, respectively. METHODS: In a single-arm clinical trial, we transplanted 35 patients with high-risk leukemia with TN-depleted PBSC grafts following conditioning with total body irradiation, thiotepa, and fludarabine. GVHD prophylactic management was with tacrolimus immunosuppression alone. Subjects received CD34-selected PBSCs and a defined dose of TM purged of CD45RA+ TN. Primary and secondary objectives included engraftment, acute and chronic GVHD, and immune reconstitution. RESULTS: All recipients of TN-depleted PBSCs engrafted. The incidence of acute GVHD was not reduced; however, GVHD in these patients was universally corticosteroid responsive. Chronic GVHD was remarkably infrequent (9%; median follow-up 932 days) compared with historical rates of approximately 50% with T cell-replete grafts. TM in the graft resulted in rapid T cell recovery and transfer of protective virus-specific immunity. Excessive rates of infection or relapse did not occur and overall survival was 78% at 2 years. CONCLUSION: Depletion of TN from stem cell allografts reduces the incidence of chronic GVHD, while preserving the transfer of functional T cell memory.

Whereas mESCs are in an uncommitted naive state, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) represent a more advanced state, denoted as primed pluripotency. This burdens hESCs with a series of characteristics, which, in contrast to naive ESCs, makes them not ideal for key applications such as cell-based clinical therapies and human disease modeling. In this study, different small molecule combinations were applied during human ESC derivation. Hereby, we aimed to sustain the naive pluripotent state, by interfering with various key signaling pathways. First, we tested several combinations on existing, 2i (PD0325901 and CHIR99021)-derived mESCs. All combinations were shown to be equally adequate to sustain the expression of naive pluripotency markers. Second, these conditions were tested during hESC derivation. Overall, the best results were observed in the presence of medium supplemented with 2i, LIF, and the noncanonical Wnt signaling agonist Wnt5A, alone and combined with epinephrine. In these conditions, outgrowths repeatedly showed an ESC progenitor-like morphology, starting from day 3. Culturing these ""progenitor cells"" did not result in stable, naive hESC lines in the current conditions. Although Wnt5A could not promote naive hESC derivation, we found that it was sustaining the conversion of established hESCs toward a more naive state. Future work should aim to distinct the effects of the various culture formulations, including our Wnt5A-supplemented medium, reported to promote stable naive pluripotency in hESCs.",,"['Van der Jeught, Margot', 'Taelman, Jasin', 'Duggal, Galbha', 'Ghimire, Sabitri', 'Lierman, Sylvie', 'Chuva de Sousa Lopes, Susana M', 'Deforce, Dieter', 'Deroo, Tom', 'De Sutter, Petra', 'Heindryckx, Bjorn']","['Van der Jeught M', 'Taelman J', 'Duggal G', 'Ghimire S', 'Lierman S', 'Chuva de Sousa Lopes SM', 'Deforce D', 'Deroo T', 'De Sutter P', 'Heindryckx B']","['1 Ghent Fertility and Stem Cell Team (G-FaST), Department for Reproductive Medicine, Ghent University Hospital , 9000 Ghent, Belgium .', '4 These authors contributed equally to this work.', '1 Ghent Fertility and Stem Cell Team (G-FaST), Department for Reproductive Medicine, Ghent University Hospital , 9000 Ghent, Belgium .', '4 These authors contributed equally to this work.', '1 Ghent Fertility and Stem Cell Team (G-FaST), Department for Reproductive Medicine, Ghent University Hospital , 9000 Ghent, Belgium .', '1 Ghent Fertility and Stem Cell Team (G-FaST), Department for Reproductive Medicine, Ghent University Hospital , 9000 Ghent, Belgium .', '1 Ghent Fertility and Stem Cell Team (G-FaST), Department for Reproductive Medicine, Ghent University Hospital , 9000 Ghent, Belgium .', '1 Ghent Fertility and Stem Cell Team (G-FaST), Department for Reproductive Medicine, Ghent University Hospital , 9000 Ghent, Belgium .', '2 Department of Anatomy and Embryology, Leiden University Medical Center , 2300 Leiden, The Netherlands .', '3 Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ghent University , 9000 Ghent, Belgium .', '1 Ghent Fertility and Stem Cell Team (G-FaST), Department for Reproductive Medicine, Ghent University Hospital , 9000 Ghent, Belgium .', '1 Ghent Fertility and Stem Cell Team (G-FaST), Department for Reproductive Medicine, Ghent University Hospital , 9000 Ghent, Belgium .', '1 Ghent Fertility and Stem Cell Team (G-FaST), Department for Reproductive Medicine, Ghent University Hospital , 9000 Ghent, Belgium .']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Reprogram,Cellular reprogramming,101528176,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chir 99021)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)', '86K0J5AK6M (mirdametinib)', '9N3CBB0BIQ (Diphenylamine)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Diphenylamine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Epinephrine/pharmacology', 'Human Embryonic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wnt Proteins/pharmacology', 'Wnt-5a Protein']",PMC4487243,,2015/06/09 06:00,2016/03/11 06:00,['2015/06/09 06:00'],"['2015/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cell.2014.0085 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Reprogram. 2015 Jun;17(3):170-80. doi: 10.1089/cell.2014.0085.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed that non-CpG methylation disappeared upon B cell commitment, whereas CpG methylation changed extensively during B cell maturation, showing an accumulative pattern and affecting around 30% of all measured CpG sites. Early differentiation stages mainly displayed enhancer demethylation, which was associated with upregulation of key B cell transcription factors and affected multiple genes involved in B cell biology. Late differentiation stages, in contrast, showed extensive demethylation of heterochromatin and methylation gain at Polycomb-repressed areas, and genes with apparent functional impact in B cells were not affected. This signature, which has previously been linked to aging and cancer, was particularly widespread in mature cells with an extended lifespan.

In both de novo and therapy-related APL, the most frequent PML breakpoints are located within intron 6, and less frequently in intron 3; the precise mechanisms by which these breakpoints arise and preferentially in PML intron 6 remain unsolved. To investigate the intrinsic properties of the PML intron sequences in vivo, we designed Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains containing human PML intron 6 or intron 3 sequences inserted in yeast chromosome V and measured gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCR). This approach provided evidence that intron 6 had a superior instability over intron 3 due to an intrinsic property of the sequence and identified the 3' end of intron 6 as the most susceptible to break. Using yeast strains invalidated for genes that control DNA replication, we show that this differential instability depended at least upon Rrm3, a DNA helicase, and Mrc1, the human claspin homolog. GCR induction by hydrogen peroxide, a general genotoxic agent, was also dependent on genetic context. We conclude that: 1) this yeast system provides an alternative approach to study in detail the properties of human sequences in a genetically controlled situation and 2) the different susceptibility to produce DNA breaks in intron 6 versus intron 3 of the human PML gene is likely due to an intrinsic property of the sequence and is under replication fork genetic control.",,"['Chanet, Roland', 'Kienda, Guy', 'Heneman-Masurel, Amelie', 'Vernis, Laurence', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Guardiola, Philippe', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Huang, Meng-Er']","['Chanet R', 'Kienda G', 'Heneman-Masurel A', 'Vernis L', 'Cassinat B', 'Guardiola P', 'Fenaux P', 'Chomienne C', 'Huang ME']","['UMR3348 ""Genotoxic Stress and Cancer"", Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Orsay, France; Institut Curie, Centre de Recherche, Orsay, France.', 'UMR3348 ""Genotoxic Stress and Cancer"", Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Orsay, France; Institut Curie, Centre de Recherche, Orsay, France.', 'UMR3348 ""Genotoxic Stress and Cancer"", Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Orsay, France; Institut Curie, Centre de Recherche, Orsay, France.', 'UMR3348 ""Genotoxic Stress and Cancer"", Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Orsay, France; Institut Curie, Centre de Recherche, Orsay, France.', 'AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; Inserm UMRS-1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Plateforme SNP, Transcriptome & Epigenomique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Angers, France.', 'AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; Inserm UMRS-1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France; Inserm UMRS-1131, Hopital Saint-Louis, Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'UMR3348 ""Genotoxic Stress and Cancer"", Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Orsay, France; Institut Curie, Centre de Recherche, Orsay, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150608,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Breaks/drug effects', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Order', 'Genetic Loci', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', '*Introns', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",PMC4460018,,2015/06/09 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/06/09 06:00'],"['2015/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0129222 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-06022 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jun 8;10(6):e0129222. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0129222. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the early and sensitive detection of such mutations is an important prerequisite for future predictive CLL diagnostics in the clinical setting. MATERIAL & METHODS: Here, we describe a novel, target-specific next generation sequencing (NGS) approach, which combines multiplex PCR-based target enrichment and library generation with ultra-deep high-throughput parallel sequencing using a MiSeq platform. We designed a CLL specific target panel, covering hotspots or complete coding regions of 15 genes known to be recurrently mutated and/or related to B-cell receptor signaling. RESULTS: High-throughput sequencing was performed using as little as 40 ng of peripheral blood B-cell DNA from 136 CLL patients and a dilution series of two ATM- or TP53-mutated cell lines, the latter of which demonstrated a limit of mutation detection below 5%. Using a stringent functional assessment algorithm, 102 mutations in 8 genes were identified in CLL patients, including hotspot regions of TP53, SF3B1, NOTCH1, ATM, XPO1, MYD88, DDX3X and the B-cell receptor signaling regulator PTPN6. The presence of mutations was significantly associated with an advanced disease status und molecular markers of an inferior prognosis, such as an unmutated IGHV mutation status or positivity for ZAP70 by flow cytometry. CONCLUSION: In summary, targeted sequencing using an amplicon based library technology allows a resource-efficient and sensitive mutation analysis for diagnostic or exploratory purposes and facilitates molecular subtyping of patient sets with adverse prognosis.",,"['Vollbrecht, Claudia', 'Mairinger, Fabian Dominik', 'Koitzsch, Ulrike', 'Peifer, Martin', 'Koenig, Katharina', 'Heukamp, Lukas Carl', 'Crispatzu, Giuliano', 'Wilden, Laura', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Odenthal, Margarete', 'Herling, Carmen Diana', 'Buettner, Reinhard']","['Vollbrecht C', 'Mairinger FD', 'Koitzsch U', 'Peifer M', 'Koenig K', 'Heukamp LC', 'Crispatzu G', 'Wilden L', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Hallek M', 'Odenthal M', 'Herling CD', 'Buettner R']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Department of Translational Genomics, Cologne Center of Genomics, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Cologne-Bonn, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150608,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Gene Library', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Variation', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/standards', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC4459702,,2015/06/09 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/06/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0129544 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-54571 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jun 8;10(6):e0129544. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0129544. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (CEBPA) is a critical regulator of myeloid differentiation whose inactivation contributes to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mutations in C/EBPalpha occur in around 10% of AML cases, leading to the expression of a 30-kDa dominant negative isoform (C/EBPalpha-p30). In this study, we identified the oncogenic urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) lncRNA as a novel target of the C/EBPalpha-p30. We show that wild-type C/EBPalpha and C/EBPalpha-p30 isoform can bind the UCA1 promoter but have opposite effects on UCA1 expression. While wild-type C/EBPalpha represses, C/EBPalpha-p30 can induce UCA1 transcription. Notably, we also show that UCA1 expression increases in cytogenetically normal AML cases carrying biallelic CEBPA mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that UCA1 sustains proliferation of AML cells by repressing the expression of the cell cycle regulator p27kip1. Thus, we identified, for the first time, an oncogenic lncRNA functioning in concert with the dominant negative isoform of C/EBPalpha in AML.",,"['Hughes, James M', 'Legnini, Ivano', 'Salvatori, Beatrice', 'Masciarelli, Silvia', 'Marchioni, Marcella', 'Fazi, Francesco', 'Morlando, Mariangela', 'Bozzoni, Irene', 'Fatica, Alessandro']","['Hughes JM', 'Legnini I', 'Salvatori B', 'Masciarelli S', 'Marchioni M', 'Fazi F', 'Morlando M', 'Bozzoni I', 'Fatica A']","['Department of Biology and Biotechnology ""C.

Human and nonhuman RNA-seq reads were mapped onto human and pathogen reference genomes respectively using alignment tools Bowtie and BLAT. Pathogen infections and integrations were analyzed in adherence with the standards from published studies. Among the nine pathogens (Propionibacterium acnes, HPV, HCMV, XMRV, BKV, JCV, SV40, EBV, and HBV) we analyzed, Propionibacterium acnes genes were detected in all prostate tumor samples and all adjacent samples, but not in prostate samples from healthy individuals. SV40, HCMV, EBV and low-risk HPVs transcripts were detected in one tumor sample and two adjacent samples from Chinese prostate cancer patients, but not in any samples of western prostate cancer patients; XMRV, BKV and JCV sequences were not identified in our work; HBV, as a negative control, was absent from any samples. Moreover, no pathogen integration was identified in our study. While further validation is required, our analysis provides evidence of Propionibacterium acnes infections in human prostate tumors.

Cork Extracts Induce Apoptosis in Human Myeloid Leukaemia HL-60 Cells.,1180-7,10.1002/ptr.5364 [doi],"Quercus suber L. cork contains a diversity of phenolic compounds, mostly low molecular weight phenols. A rising number of reports support with convergent findings that polyphenols evoke pro-apoptotic events in cancerous cells. However, the literature related to the anti-cancer bioactivity of Q. suber L. cork extractives (QSE) is still limited. Herein, we aim to describe the antitumor potential displayed by cork extractives obtained by different extraction methods in the human promyelocytic leukaemia cells. In order to quantify the effects of QSE on cancer cells viability, phosphatidylserine exposure, caspase-3 activity, mitochondrial membrane potential and cell cycle were evaluated. The results indicated that the QSE present a time-dependent and dose-dependent cytotoxicity in the human promyelocytic leukaemia cells. Such a noxious effect leads these leukaemia cells to their death through apoptotic processes by altering the mitochondrial outer membrane potential, activating caspase-3 and externalizing phosphatidylserine. However, cells cycle progression was not affected by the treatments. This study contributes to open a new way to use this natural resource by exploiting its anti-cancer properties. Moreover, it opens new possibilities of application of cork by-products, being more efficient in the sector of cork-based agriculture.

Although GVHD mediated by the donor's T lymphocytes remains the most challenging toxicity of allo-HSCT, graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect targeting leukemic cells, has an important role in affecting the overall outcome of patients with AML. Here we comprehensively characterized the TCR repertoire in patients who underwent matched donor or haplo-cord HSCT using next-generation sequencing approach. Our study defines the functional kinetics of each TCRA and TCRB clone, and changes in T-cell diversity (with identification of CDR3 sequences) and the extent of clonal expansion of certain T-cells. Using this approach, our study demonstrates that higher percentage of cord-blood cells at 30 days after transplant was correlated with higher diversity of TCR repertoire, implicating the role of cord-chimerism in enhancing immune recovery. Importantly, we found that GVHD and relapse, exclusive of each other, were correlated with lower TCR repertoire diversity and expansion of certain T-cell clones. Our results highlight novel insights into the balance between GVHD and GVL effect, suggesting that higher diversity early after transplant possibly implies lower risks of both GVHD and relapse following the HSCT transplantation.",,"['Yew, P Y', 'Alachkar, H', 'Yamaguchi, R', 'Kiyotani, K', 'Fang, H', 'Yap, K L', 'Liu, H T', 'Wickrema, A', 'Artz, A', 'van Besien, K', 'Imoto, S', 'Miyano, S', 'Bishop, M R', 'Stock, W', 'Nakamura, Y']","['Yew PY', 'Alachkar H', 'Yamaguchi R', 'Kiyotani K', 'Fang H', 'Yap KL', 'Liu HT', 'Wickrema A', 'Artz A', 'van Besien K', 'Imoto S', 'Miyano S', 'Bishop MR', 'Stock W', 'Nakamura Y']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Health Intelligence Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Health Intelligence Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['K12 CA139160/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000430/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20150608,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics/immunology', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/immunology/therapy', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC4559843,,2015/06/09 06:00,2016/05/28 06:00,['2015/06/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2015133 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2015.133 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2015 Sep;50(9):1227-34. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2015.133.

In this context, they interact and cooperate in controlling tumor cell biology. Here, we propose a novel mechanism by which the PI3K/AKT pathway regulates NOTCH1 in T-ALL, starting from the evidence that the inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling induced by treatment with LY294002 or transient transfection with a dominant negative AKT mutant downregulates NOTCH1 protein levels and activity, without affecting NOTCH1 transcription. We showed that the withdrawal of PI3K/AKT signaling was associated to NOTCH1 phosphorylation in tyrosine residues and monoubiquitination of NOTCH1 detected by Ubiquitin capture assay. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and colocalization analysis further showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl interacts and monoubiquitinates NOTCH1, activating its lysosomal degradation. These results suggest that the degradation of NOTCH1 could represent a mechanism of control by which NOTCH1 receptors are actively removed from the cell surface. This mechanism is finely regulated by the PI3K/AKT pathway in physiological conditions. In pathological conditions characterized by PI3K/AKT hyperactivation, such as T-ALL, the excessive AKT signaling could lead to NOTCH1 signaling dysregulation. Therefore, a therapeutic strategy directed to PI3K/AKT in T-ALL could contemporaneously inhibit the dysregulated NOTCH1 signaling.

The recent discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel effector molecules of AR disclosed the existence of an intricate network between AR, miRNAs and downstream target genes. In this study DUCaP cells, characterized by high content of wild-type AR and robust AR transcriptional activity, were chosen as the main experimental model. By integrative analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and microarray expression profiling data, miRNAs putatively bound and significantly regulated by AR were identified. A direct AR regulation of miR-22, miR-29a, and miR-17-92 cluster along with their host genes was confirmed. Interestingly, endogenous levels of miR-22 and miR-29a were found to be reduced in PCa cells expressing AR. In primary tumor samples, miR-22 and miR-29a were less abundant in the cancerous tissue compared with the benign counterpart. This specific expression pattern was associated with a differential DNA methylation of the genomic AR binding sites. The identification of laminin gamma 1 (LAMC1) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) as direct targets of miR-22 and miR-29a, respectively, suggested a tumor-suppressive role of these miRNAs. Indeed, transfection of miRNA mimics in PCa cells induced apoptosis and diminished cell migration and viability.

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 43-year-old man presented with a painless testicular swelling. There was no previous history of malignancy or hematologic disease. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging examination showed an intratesticular mass extending to the surrounding scrotal tissues including the epididymis. Inguinal radical orchiectomy was followed by a macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of the tumor. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the strong positivity of the neoplastic cells for leucocyte common antigen (LCA), myeloperoxidase, CD-34 and CD-117. All imaging and laboratory tests for metastatic or hematologic disease, including a bone marrow biopsy, were negative, leading to the diagnosis of a primary granulocytic sarcoma of the testis. CONCLUSION: Although chloromas usually manifest in patients with a hematologic malignancy, isolated cases may occur. The low specificity of imaging and, occasionally, microscopic examination is challenging for the right diagnosis. The role of immunohistochemistry in conjunction with the clinical, imaging and laboratory findings is crucial to reach the correct diagnosis.",,"['Tsitouridis, I', 'Maskalidis, Ch', 'Pervana, St', 'Pazarli, E', 'Kariki, E P']","['Tsitouridis I', 'Maskalidis Ch', 'Pervana S', 'Pazarli E', 'Kariki EP']","['Radiology Department""Papageorgiou"" General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Radiology Department""Papageorgiou"" General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Pathology Department ""Papageorgiou"" General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Pathology Department ""Papageorgiou"" General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Radiology Department""Papageorgiou"" General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],,Greece,Hippokratia,Hippokratia,101296613,,,,PMC4453816,,2015/06/09 06:00,2015/06/09 06:01,['2015/06/09 06:00'],"['2015/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/09 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Hippokratia. 2014 Oct-Dec;18(4):366-9.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'chloroma', 'extramedullary myeloid cell tumor', 'granulocytic sarcoma', 'testis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A capsule formulation of the drug has recently received approval for use in this population for platinum-sensitive recurrent disease for maintenance therapy following platinum-based chemotherapy in Europe and as third- or fourth-line platinum-sensitive therapy in the USA. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the development of olaparib in OC with a focus on safety evaluation. Data are based on published literature and reports available from the olaparib development program database. EXPERT OPINION: Oral olaparib 400 mg twice daily has acceptable tolerability when administered as maintenance monochemotherapy in women with relapsed OC. The common toxicities - nausea/vomiting, fatigue and anemia - are mild or moderate in severity and appear consistent across subgroups (BRCA carriers/wild-type).

The pathogenesis of AML involves cytogenetic abnormalities, genetic mutations, and epigenetic anomalies. Although it is widely accepted that the cellular biology, gene expression, and epigenetic landscape of normal HSCs change with age, little is known about the interplay between the age at which the cell becomes leukemic and the resultant leukemia. Despite its rarity, childhood AML is a leading cause of childhood cancer mortality. Treatment is in general extrapolated from adult AML on the assumption that adult AML and pediatric AML are similar biological entities. However, distinct biological processes and epigenetic modifications in pediatric and adult AML may mean that response to novel therapies in children may differ from that in adults with AML. A better understanding of the key pathways involved in transformation and how these differ between childhood and adult AML is an important step in identifying effective treatment. This review highlights both the commonalities and differences between pediatric and adult AML disease biology with respect to age.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Apoptosis of cells in each group was observed using flow cytometry, procoagulant activity of APL and NB4 cells in each group was detected with recalcification time, and expressions of tissue factor (TF), thrombomodulin and annexin II of NB4 cells in each group were measured using ELISA method. The results showed that the apoptosis rate increased 4-8 times compared with blank control group after processing APL and NB4 cells with ATO and DNR; procoagulant activity decreased obviously; and expression of TF and annexin II of NB4 cells reduced significantly (P<0.05). We concluded that combination of ATO and DNR could promote APL and NB4 cell apoptosis effectively without aggravating blood coagulation disorders, which might improve coagulation function of APL by inhibiting coagulation and hyperfibrinolysis through reducing expression of TF and annexin II.

Its expression levels are affected by a polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene. Bovine leukemia virus is a retrovirus that infects cattle and develops two different infection profiles in the host. One profile is characterized by a high number of proviral copies integrated into the host genome and a strong immune response against the virus, while the most relevant property of the other profile is that the number of copies integrated into the host genome is almost undetectable and the immune response is very weak.

We performed a comprehensive analysis of the impact of IKZF1(del) in a large cohort of children (n=1223) with BCR-ABL1-negative BCP-ALL treated in the EORTC-CLG trial 58951. Patients with IKZF1(del) had a lower 8-year event-free survival (EFS, 67.7% versus 86.5%; hazard ratio (HR)=2.41; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.75-3.32; P<0.001). Importantly, despite association with high-risk features such as high minimal residual disease, IKZF1(del) remained significantly predictive in multivariate analyses. Analysis by genetic subtype showed that IKZF1(del) increased risk only in the high hyperdiploid ALLs (HR=2.57; 95% CI=1.19-5.55; P=0.013) and in 'B-other' ALLs, that is, lacking classifying genetic lesions (HR=2.22; 95% CI=1.45-3.39; P<0.001), the latter having then a dramatically low 8-year EFS (56.4; 95% CI=44.6-66.7).

Thus, IKZF1(del) retains independent prognostic significance in the context of current risk-adapted protocols, and is associated with a dismal outcome in 'B-other' ALL.

In this study, we found that BAALC induced cell-cycle progression of leukemia cells by sustaining extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity through an interaction with a scaffold protein MEK kinase-1 (MEKK1), which inhibits the interaction between ERK and MAP kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3/DUSP6). BAALC conferred chemoresistance in AML cells by upregulating ATP-binding cassette proteins in an ERK-dependent manner, which can be therapeutically targeted by MEK inhibitor. We also demonstrated that BAALC blocks ERK-mediated monocytic differentiation of AML cells by trapping Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in the cytoplasm and inhibiting its function in the nucleus. Consequently, MEK inhibition therapy synergizes with KLF4 induction and is highly effective against BAALC-high AML cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide a molecular basis for the role of BAALC in regulating proliferation and differentiation of AML cells and highlight the unique dual function of BAALC as an attractive therapeutic target against BAALC-high AML.",,"['Morita, K', 'Masamoto, Y', 'Kataoka, K', 'Koya, J', 'Kagoya, Y', 'Yashiroda, H', 'Sato, T', 'Murata, S', 'Kurokawa, M']","['Morita K', 'Masamoto Y', 'Kataoka K', 'Koya J', 'Kagoya Y', 'Yashiroda H', 'Sato T', 'Murata S', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Protein Metabolism, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Protein Metabolism, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150608,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1/*physiology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Protein Binding']",,,2015/06/09 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/06/09 06:00'],"['2015/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015137 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.137 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Nov;29(11):2248-56. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.137.

However, the mechanisms of how rapid shape changes are caused and how they lead to migration in the amoeboid mode are still unclear. In this study, we confined differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia cells between opposing surfaces of two pieces of polyacrylamide gels and characterized the mechanics of fibronectin-dependent mesenchymal versus fibronectin-independent amoeboid migration. On fibronectin-coated gels, the cells form lamellipodia and migrate mesenchymally. Whereas in the absence of cell-substrate adhesions through fibronectin, the same cells migrate by producing blebs and ""chimneying"" between the gel sheets. To identify the orientation and to quantify the magnitude of the traction forces, we found by traction force microscopy that expanding blebs push into the gels and generate anchoring stresses whose magnitude increases with decreasing gap size while the resulting migration speed is highest at an intermediate gap size. To understand why there exists such an optimal gap size for migration, we developed a computational model and showed that the chimneying speed depends on both the magnitude of intracellular pressure as well as the distribution of blebs around the cell periphery. The model also predicts that the optimal gap size increases with weakening cell membrane to actin cortex adhesion strength. We verified this prediction experimentally, by weakening the membrane-cortex adhesion strength using the ezrin inhibitor, baicalein. Thus, the chimneying mode of amoeboid migration requires a balance between intracellular pressure and membrane-cortex adhesion strength.",,"['Yip, Ai Kia', 'Chiam, Keng-Hwee', 'Matsudaira, Paul']","['Yip AK', 'Chiam KH', 'Matsudaira P']","['A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute, 30 Biopolis Street, #07-01 Matrix, Singapore 138671, Singapore. chiamkh@bii.a-star.edu.sg.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150608,England,Integr Biol (Camb),Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,101478378,"['0 (Acrylic Resins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (polyacrylamide gels)']",IM,"['Acrylic Resins', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mesoderm/cytology', '*Models, Biological', 'Pseudopodia/physiology', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Surface Properties']",,,2015/06/09 06:00,2016/07/29 06:00,['2015/06/09 06:00'],"['2015/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4ib00245h [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Biol (Camb). 2015 Oct;7(10):1196-211. doi: 10.1039/c4ib00245h.

Triazole antifungal drugs (AFD) are the main agents for the prevention/treatment of invasive fungal infection (IFI), a common complication during the treatment of ALL. This study investigated the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) between VCR and AFD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 68 children with ALL (39 boys and 29 girls, median age: 5 years) who were treated with VCR chemotherapy (a total of 136 cases, including both induction and reinduction phases) from January 2012 to December 2013 in our hospital. These cases were divided into 4 groups: the control group without AFD prevention/treatment (n=44), the Itra group receiving itraconazole oral solution (n=44), the Fluc group receiving intravenous fluconazole (n=42), and the Vori group receiving voriconazole oral tablets (n=6). The ADRs in each group was recorded and compared. RESULTS: The incidence of ADRs in the Itra and Vori groups were significantly higher compared with the Fluc and the control group (P<0.05). The incidence of ADRs in the Itra group was significantly higher than that in the Vori group, whereas there was no difference in the incidence between the Fluc and control group. CONCLUSIONS: Given the lower incidence of ADRs between VCR and fluconazole compared with voriconazole or itraconazole, it is relatively safer to use fluconazole in ALL patients receiving VCR chemotherapy.

We investigated (i) changes in the immunophenotypic, molecular, functional, morphological features associated with terminal differentiation into ASCs, (ii) the expression of factors involved in CLL pathogenesis, and (iii) the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in the differentiated cells. Our results show that differentiated CLL B-cells are able to display the transcriptional program of ASCs. Differentiation leads to depletion of the malignant program and deregulation of the apoptosis/survival balance.

The present review gathers recent findings on the occurrence, relevance, and dynamics of premalignant cells in the development of follicular lymphoma and CLL. RECENT FINDINGS: The frequency of circulating cells bearing the follicular lymphoma hallmark translocation t(14;18) in healthy persons is correlated to the risk of developing follicular lymphoma later in life. Chronic B-cell receptor stimulation induces cyclic re-entries of BCL2 B cells into germinal centers that propagate clonal evolution and early follicular lymphoma progression. The lymph node microenvironment is a key activation/proliferation niche for malignant cells in CLL, also active in its preclinical antecedent monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. SUMMARY: Considering recent studies of premalignant cells in both diseases and of their putative normal cell counterparts, we propose different models of premalignant evolution for the two pathologies. Before overt follicular lymphoma, t(14;18) B cells exploit the dynamics of memory B cells to re-enter multiple times into local or distant germinal centers, gather activation/proliferation signals, and gain additional mutations to progress to malignant lymphoma. In monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, CLL-like activated/memory B cells follow cycles of germinal center-independent activation/proliferation in lymph node. Finally, we discuss the next level genetic and functional analyses that should result in a better understanding of the origins and mechanisms of frequent relapses in follicular lymphoma and CLL.",,"['Milpied, Pierre', 'Nadel, Bertrand', 'Roulland, Sandrine']","['Milpied P', 'Nadel B', 'Roulland S']","[""aCentre d'Immunologie de Marseille Luminy, Aix-Marseille Universite bINSERM U1104 cCNRS UMR7280, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Germinal Center/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,2015/06/08 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/06/08 06:00'],"['2015/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000159 [doi]', '00062752-201507000-00017 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2015 Jul;22(4):388-96. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000159.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: HCL is an indolent B-cell leukaemia. Historically, HCL patients have achieved excellent response to purine nucleoside analogues and single purine analogue treatment with pentostatin or cladribine is currently the standard of care for initial treatment. Most patients achieve complete remission with this form of therapy. However, long-term follow-up has demonstrated that a large number of patients eventually develop relapsed disease. Relapse disease tends to be more difficult to treat and refractory to the same purine analogues. Development of relapsing and refractory disease after initially achieving complete remission with purine analogue treatment has generated a need for alternative therapies. SUMMARY: Identification of the BRAFV600E mutation in nearly 100% of HCL patients has provided rationale for inclusion of BRAF inhibitors into the therapeutic armamentarium to treat HCL. Clinical trials are currently underway measuring efficacy of vemurafenib in achieving clinical response in relapsed/refractory HCL and also toxicity.

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies employing conditional deletion mouse models indicate an important role of SIRT1 in maintenance of adult HSCs under conditions of stress. SIRT1 is significantly overexpressed in LSC populations from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with the FLT3-ITD mutation, and maintains their survival, growth and drug resistance, as previously described for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). SIRT1 can also enhance leukemia evolution and drug resistance by promoting genetic instability. Recent studies indicate an important role of SIRT1 in regulating autophagy in response to oxidative stress and nutrient requirements, and have elucidated complex mechanisms by which SIRT1 regulates epigenetic reprogramming of stem cells. SUMMARY: SIRT1 inhibition holds promise as a novel approach for ablation of LSCs in chronic phase CML or FLT3-ITD-associated AML.

The outcome of the procedure is strongly influenced by the quantity of injected cells, especially if low cell numbers are infused as frequently encountered with cord blood transplants. Ex-vivo expansion of cord blood HSPCs would increase cell numbers, thus accelerating engraftment and reducing infectious complications and transplant-related mortality. In addition, expansion would maximize accessibility to better HLA-matched units, further improving patients' outcome. Similarly, in-vitro maintenance or expansion of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) would enable research into the much awaited targeted therapies that spare normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we review recent findings on small molecules (excluding biologicals) regulating the activity of normal and leukemic stem cells and provide insights into basic science and clinical implications. RECENT FINDINGS: High-throughput screening of small molecules active on primary hematopoietic cells has led to the identification of two potent series of chemical compounds, best exemplified by StemRegenin1 and UM171, that both expand HSPCs. Current data suggest that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist StemRegenin1 is most active on primitive normal hematopoietic progenitors and LSCs and that UM171 expands long-term normal HSCs. SUMMARY: Small molecules are clinically useful and powerful tools for expanding HSPCs. They are also of potential value for dissecting the still elusive regulatory networks that govern self-renewal of human HSCs.",,"['Fares, Iman', 'Rivest-Khan, Laura', 'Cohen, Sandra', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Fares I', 'Rivest-Khan L', 'Cohen S', 'Sauvageau G']","['aMolecular Genetics of Stem Cells Laboratory, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), University of Montreal bDivision of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital cDepartment of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '0 (StemRegenin 1)', '0 (UM171 compound)']",IM,"['Cell Count', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2015/06/08 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/06/08 06:00'],"['2015/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000151 [doi]', '00062752-201507000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2015 Jul;22(4):309-16. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000151.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They favor recruitment of cofactors involved in epigenetic regulation, thereby defining patterns of gene expression in a development- and lineage-specific manner. Additionally, transcription factors can facilitate transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) formation and assembly on chromatin. Interestingly, a few lineage-specific transcription factors, including IKAROS, also regulate transcription elongation. IKAROS is a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in leukemia and associated with a poor prognosis. It forms a complex with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex and the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is required for productive transcription elongation.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells represent 1 cell type of particular interest for therapy of inflammatory conditions, as they are responsible for controlling unwanted immune responses. Initial clinical trials of adoptive transfer of Treg cells in patients with graft-versus-host disease were shown to be safe. However, obtaining sufficient numbers of highly pure and functional Treg cells with minimal contamination remains a challenge. We developed a novel approach to isolate ""untouched"" human Treg cells from healthy donors on the basis of negative selection using the surface markers CD49d and CD127. This procedure, which uses an antibody cocktail and magnetic beads for separation in an automated system (RoboSep), was scaled up and adapted to be compatible with good manufacturing practice conditions. With this setup we performed 9 Treg isolations from large-scale leukapheresis samples in a good manufacturing practice facility. These runs yielded sufficient numbers of ""untouched"" Treg cells for immediate use in clinical applications. The cell preparations consisted of viable highly pure FoxP3-positive Treg cells that were functional in suppressing the proliferation of effector T cells. Contamination with CD4 effector T cells was <10%. All other cell types did not exceed 2% in the final product. Remaining isolation reagents were reduced to levels that are considered safe. Treg cells isolated with this procedure will be used in a phase I clinical trial of adoptive transfer into leukemia patients developing graft-versus-host disease after stem cell transplantation.",,"['Haase, Doreen', 'Puan, Kia Joo', 'Starke, Mireille', 'Lai, Tuck Siong', 'Soh, Melissa Yan Ling', 'Karunanithi, Iyswariya', 'San Luis, Boris', 'Poh, Tuang Yeow', 'Yusof, Nurhashikin', 'Yeap, Chun Hsien', 'Phang, Chew Yen', 'Chye, Willis Soon Yuan', 'Chan, Marieta', 'Koh, Mickey Boon Chai', 'Goh, Yeow Tee', 'Bertin-Maghit, Sebastien', 'Nardin, Alessandra', 'Ho, Liam Pock', 'Rotzschke, Olaf']","['Haase D', 'Puan KJ', 'Starke M', 'Lai TS', 'Soh MY', 'Karunanithi I', 'San Luis B', 'Poh TY', 'Yusof N', 'Yeap CH', 'Phang CY', 'Chye WS', 'Chan M', 'Koh MB', 'Goh YT', 'Bertin-Maghit S', 'Nardin A', 'Ho LP', 'Rotzschke O']","[""*Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Biopolis daggerCell Therapy Facility, Blood Services Group, Health Science Authority (HSA) Departments of double daggerHematology parallelPathology, Singapore General Hospital (SGH), Singapore, Singapore section signDepartment of Haematology, St George's Hospital and Medical School, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)']",IM,"['Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Integrin alpha4/metabolism', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Leukemia/complications/immunology/*therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/transplantation']",,,2015/06/08 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/06/08 06:00'],"['2015/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000083 [doi]', '00002371-201507000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2015 Jul-Aug;38(6):250-8. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000083.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: K562 cells and MNCs were treated with various concentrations and treatment times of GA. Inhibitory rate was detected by use of the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Apoptosis was analyzed by morphological detection, Annexin-V/PI doubling staining, and TUNEL assays. The expression changes of pivotal proteins were evaluated by Western blotting. RESULTS: GA not only suppressed cell proliferation, but also induced apoptosis of K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. While it did not significantly inhibit cell proliferation of MNCs, it did induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. CCK-8 assay revealed that the proliferation of K562 cells was significantly inhibited when the concentration of GA was more than 0.5 muM. Morphological detection showed the nuclei became denser and more intense orange in K562 cells after GA treatment compared with the untreated group. The expression levels of BCL-2, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), c-myc, phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3K), and phosphorylation of serine-threonine kinase (p-AKT) were down-regulated by GA. CONCLUSIONS: GA significantly suppressed the proliferation of K562 cells, but has less effect on MNCs. The inhibition of K562 cells proliferation and apoptosis induced by GA might be related to the down-regulation of BCL-2, NF-kappaB, c-myc, PI3K, and p-AKT.",,"['Chen, Jinhao', 'Zhou, Min', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Xu, Jingyan', 'Ouyang, Jian']","['Chen J', 'Zhou M', 'Zhang Q', 'Xu J', 'Ouyang J']","['Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland).']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150602,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Xanthones)', '8N585K83U2 (gambogic acid)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Annexin A5', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Xanthones/*pharmacology']",PMC4463775,,2015/06/08 06:00,2016/02/27 06:00,['2015/06/08 06:00'],"['2015/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['893004 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.893004 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2015 Jun 2;21:1604-10. doi: 10.12659/MSM.893004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Germline TP53 mutation carriers are increasingly being identified as more genomic sequencing is performed in both clinical and research settings. There is a pressing clinical need for effective cancer risk management approaches in this group. RECENT FINDINGS: Current clinical surveillance guidelines mainly focus on breast and bowel cancer risk with little consideration for the other cancers common to the syndrome. Imaging technologies are such that the utilization of whole-body MRI imaging for surveillance is viable. Globally, several research groups have included whole-body MRI along with other diagnostic measures in formulating surveillance protocols for TP53 mutation carriers. Early reports suggest a survival benefit. SUMMARY: Surveillance protocols for TP53 mutation carriers have the potential to improve outcomes in individuals and families.

It also plays a role in the coagulation activation and several tumors including leukemia. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of HMGB1 in the diagnosis of DIC with leukemia. METHODS: 89 subjects with leukemia in Wuhan Union Hospital were prospectively recruited. Among them, 83 cases were suspected of DIC, while the other 6 were the negative controls. Their clinical data, laboratory tests and plasma samples were collected or measured respectively. Accordingly, we made scores for these subjects by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (JMHW) criteria. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that the plasma levels of HMGB1 were higher in the DIC group than non-DIC (115.16 ng/ml vs. 63.94 ng/ml, p=0.003). The similar results were achieved in infected or non-infected groups. And along with the increase of DIC scores, the levels of HMGB1 increased gradually (p=0.006). In addition, HMGB1 was an independent factor in the diagnosis of DIC with leukemia(p<0.05). The diagnostic sensitivity of HMGB1 was high (Se=90.32%), and there was a tendency of increased HMGB1 levels in the pre-DIC patients. Three of these six pre-DIC patients were diagnosed as DIC by the new revised scoring system which contained HMGB1. Finally, the HMGB1 levels were significantly higher in patients with organ failures (SOFA>/=2) than those without (118.76 vs. 72.75, p=0.032). CONCLUSION: The increased plasma levels of HMGB1 were related tightly to the diagnosis and severity of DIC in leukemia patients. Furthermore, the diagnostic sensitivity of HMGB1 was high. So HMGB1 in plasma is a helpful molecular marker, and can be added in the scoring system for the early diagnosis of DIC with leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously developed an assay to identify millions of integrations in multiplexed barcoded samples at base-pair resolution. The sheer amount of data produced by this approach makes the mapping of individual sites non-trivial without bioinformatics support. This article presents the Genomic Integration Site Tracker (GeIST), a command-line pipeline designed to map the integration sites produced by this assay and identify the samples from which they came. GeIST version 2.1.0, a more adaptable version of our original pipeline, can identify integrations of murine leukemia virus, adeno-associated virus, Tol2 transposons or Ac/Ds transposons, and can be adapted for other inserted elements. It has been tested on experimental data for each of these delivery vectors and fine-tuned to account for sequencing and cloning artifacts.

We recently developed a simple method to evaluate the modification of PML by As(3+) resulting in a change in solubility and the covalent binding of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). Here we semi-quantitatively investigated the SUMOylation of PML using HEK293 cells which were stably transfected with PML-VI (HEK-PML). Western blot analyses indicated that PML became insoluble in cold RadioImmunoPrecipitation Assay (RIPA) lysis buffer and was SUMOylated by both SUMO2/3 and SUMO1 by As(3+). Surprisingly SUMO1 monomers were completely utilized for the SUMOylation of PML. Antimony (Sb(3+)) but not bismuth (Bi(3+)), Cu(2+), or Cd(2+) biochemically modified PML similarly. SUMOylated PML decreased after removal of As(3+) from the culture medium. However, unSUMOylated PML was still recovered in the RIPA-insoluble fraction, suggesting that SUMOylation is not requisite for changing the RIPA-soluble PML into the RIPA-insoluble form. Immunofluorescence staining of As(3+)-exposed cells indicated that SUMO2/3 was co-localized with PML in the nuclear bodies. However, some PML protein was present in peri-nuclear regions without SUMO2/3. Functional Really Interesting New Gene (RING)-deleted mutant PML neither formed PML nuclear bodies nor was biochemically modified by As(3+). Conjugation with intracellular glutathione may explain the accessibility of As(3+) and Sb(3+) to PML in the nuclear region evading chelation and entrapping by cytoplasmic proteins such as metallothioneins.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This meta-analysis assesses the long-term neurocognitive functioning after chemotherapy-only regimens among survivors of childhood ALL. We conducted a systematic review to identify studies that evaluated long-term neurocognitive functioning following treatment of ALL by searching MEDLINE/PubMed, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and secondary sources. Studies were included if ALL survivors were in continuous first remission, did not receive any radiation, were at least >/=2 years off therapy or >/=5 years since diagnosis, and were compared with a healthy control group. Weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Ten nonexperimental studies met all eligibility criteria and included 509 patients and 555 controls. Meta-analysis demonstrated statistically significant moderate impairment across multiple neurocognitive domains evaluated, with intelligence most affected. Significant differences in standard deviation (SD) scores were found for Full Scale intelligence quotient (IQ) (-0.52 SD; 95% CI, -0.68 to -0.37), Verbal IQ (-0.54 SD; 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.40), and Performance IQ (-0.41 SD; 95% CI, -0.56 to -0.27); these SD scores correspond to changes in IQ of 6 to 8 points. Working memory, information processing speed, and fine motor domains were moderately, but statistically significantly, impaired. Meta-analysis of ALL survivors treated without cranial radiation demonstrated significant impairment in IQ and other neurocognitive domains.

Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that cancer cells escape anti-neoplastic mechanisms and benefit from pro-survival signals via the dysregulation of this system. The nuclear exporter chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) protein is the only protein in the karyopherin-beta protein family that contributes to the trafficking of numerous proteins and RNAs from the nucleus. It is considered to be an oncogenic, anti-apoptotic protein in transformed cells, since it reportedly functions as a gatekeeper for cell survival, including affecting p53 function, and ribosomal biogenesis. Furthermore, abnormally high expression of CRM1 is correlated with poor patient prognosis in various malignancies. Therapeutic targeting of CRM1 has emerged as a novel cancer treatment strategy, starting with a clinical trial with leptomycin B, the original specific inhibitor of CRM1, followed by development of several next-generation small molecules. KPT-330, a novel member of the CRM1-selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) class of compounds, is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for the therapy of various malignancies.

However, clinical application of naturally derived regulatory T cells has been severely hampered by their scarce availability and nonselectivity. To overcome these limitations, we took alternative approaches to generate Ag-specific induced Tregs (iTregs) and tested their efficacy and selectivity in the prevention of GVHD in preclinical models of bone marrow transplantation. We selected HY as a target Ag because it is a naturally processed, ubiquitously expressed minor histocompatibility Ag (miHAg) with a proven role in GVHD and GVL effect. We generated HY-specific iTregs (HY-iTregs) from resting CD4 T cells derived from TCR transgenic mice, in which CD4 cells specifically recognize HY peptide. We found that HY-iTregs were highly effective in preventing GVHD in male (HY(+)) but not female (HY(-)) recipients using MHC II-mismatched, parent-->F1, and miHAg-mismatched murine bone marrow transplantation models. Interestingly, the expression of target Ag (HY) on the hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic compartment alone was sufficient for iTregs to prevent GVHD. Furthermore, treatment with HY-iTregs still preserved the GVL effect even against pre-established leukemia. We found that HY-iTregs were more stable in male than in female recipients. Furthermore, HY-iTregs expanded extensively in male but not female recipients, which in turn significantly reduced donor effector T cell expansion, activation, and migration into GVHD target organs, resulting in effective prevention of GVHD. This study demonstrates that iTregs specific for HY miHAgs are highly effective in controlling GVHD in an Ag-dependent manner while sparing the GVL effect.","['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Li, Jun', 'Heinrichs, Jessica', 'Haarberg, Kelley', 'Semple, Kenrick', 'Veerapathran, Anandharaman', 'Liu, Chen', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong']","['Li J', 'Heinrichs J', 'Haarberg K', 'Semple K', 'Veerapathran A', 'Liu C', 'Anasetti C', 'Yu XZ']","['Department of Immunology, H.

However, these resources are limited in their content, such that non-traditional domains (eg, online forums and social media) have an opportunity to supplement the view of an individual's health. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a scalable framework to detect personal health status mentions on Twitter and assess the extent to which such information is disclosed. METHODS: We collected more than 250 million tweets via the Twitter streaming API over a 2-month period in 2014. The corpus was filtered down to approximately 250,000 tweets, stratified across 34 high-impact health issues, based on guidance from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We created a labeled corpus of several thousand tweets via a survey, administered over Amazon Mechanical Turk, that documents when terms correspond to mentions of personal health issues or an alternative (eg, a metaphor). We engineered a scalable classifier for personal health mentions via feature selection and assessed its potential over the health issues. We further investigated the utility of the tweets by determining the extent to which Twitter users disclose personal health status. RESULTS: Our investigation yielded several notable findings. First, we find that tweets from a small subset of the health issues can train a scalable classifier to detect health mentions. Specifically, training on 2000 tweets from four health issues (cancer, depression, hypertension, and leukemia) yielded a classifier with precision of 0.77 on all 34 health issues. Second, Twitter users disclosed personal health status for all health issues. Notably, personal health status was disclosed over 50% of the time for 11 out of 34 (33%) investigated health issues. Third, the disclosure rate was dependent on the health issue in a statistically significant manner (P<.001). For instance, more than 80% of the tweets about migraines (83/100) and allergies (85/100) communicated personal health status, while only around 10% of the tweets about obesity (13/100) and heart attack (12/100) did so. Fourth, the likelihood that people disclose their own versus other people's health status was dependent on health issue in a statistically significant manner as well (P<.001). For example, 69% (69/100) of the insomnia tweets disclosed the author's status, while only 1% (1/100) disclosed another person's status. By contrast, 1% (1/100) of the Down syndrome tweets disclosed the author's status, while 21% (21/100) disclosed another person's status. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to automatically detect personal health status mentions on Twitter in a scalable manner. These mentions correspond to the health issues of the Twitter users themselves, but also other individuals. Though this study did not investigate the veracity of such statements, we anticipate such information may be useful in supplementing traditional health-related sources for research purposes.",,"['Yin, Zhijun', 'Fabbri, Daniel', 'Rosenbloom, S Trent', 'Malin, Bradley']","['Yin Z', 'Fabbri D', 'Rosenbloom ST', 'Malin B']","['Dept. of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150605,Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,,IM,"['Data Collection', '*Disclosure', '*Health Status', 'Humans', '*Internet', '*Self Disclosure', '*Social Media']",PMC4526910,,2015/06/07 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2015/06/07 06:00'],"['2015/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['v17i6e138 [pii]', '10.2196/jmir.4305 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2015 Jun 5;17(6):e138. doi: 10.2196/jmir.4305.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['consumer health', 'infodemiology', 'information retrieval', 'machine learning', 'social media', 'twitter']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3075-1337', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0530-2510', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7455-2260', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3040-5175']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), which is catalysed primarily by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), participates in various biological processes, including cell cycle control. The results of the present study show an accumulation in G1 phase versus S phase of TK6 human lymphoblast cells treated with HQ for 48h compared with PBS-treated cells; after 72h of HQ treatment, the cells transitioned from G1 arrest to S phase arrest. We examined the expression of six genes related to the cell cycle or leukaemia to further explore the reason for this phenomenon. Among these genes, H-RAS was found to be associated with this phenomenon because its mRNA and protein expression decreased at 48h and increased at 72h. Experiments for PARP activity induction and inhibition revealed that the observed PARylation was positively associated with H-RAS expression. Moreover, in cells treated with HQ in conjunction with PARP-1 knockdown, expression of the H-RAS protein decreased and the number of cells in G1 phase increased. The degree of poly(ADP-ribosyl) modification of the H-RAS protein increased in cells treated with HQ for 72h, further supporting that changes in PARylation contributed to the rapid alteration of H-RAS protein expression, followed by abnormal progression of the cell cycle. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were employed to determine whether protein complexes were formed by PARP-1 and H-RAS proteins, and the direct interaction between these proteins indicated that PARylation regulated H-RAS expression. As detected by confocal microscopy, the H-RAS protein was found in the nucleus and cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal that H-RAS protein can be modified by PARylation.",['Copyright (c) 2015.

Cell intrinsic mechanisms of resistance have been previously reported, yet the majority of AML blasts are sensitive to atRA in vitro. Even in APL, single agent atRA induces remission without cure. The microenvironment expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)26, a retinoid-metabolizing enzyme was shown to determine normal hematopoietic stem cell fate. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is responsible for difference between in vitro sensitivity and in vivo resistance of AML to atRA-induced differentiation. We observed that the pro-differentiation effects of atRA on APL and non-APL AML cells as well as on leukemia stem cells from clinical specimens were blocked by BM stroma. In addition, BM stroma produced a precipitous drop in atRA levels. Inhibition of CYP26 rescued atRA levels and AML cell sensitivity in the presence of stroma. Our data suggest that stromal CYP26 activity creates retinoid low sanctuaries in the BM that protect AML cells from systemic atRA therapy. Inhibition of CYP26 provides new opportunities to expand the clinical activity of atRA in both APL and non-APL AML.",,"['Su, Meng', 'Alonso, Salvador', 'Jones, Jace W', 'Yu, Jianshi', 'Kane, Maureen A', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Ghiaur, Gabriel']","['Su M', 'Alonso S', 'Jones JW', 'Yu J', 'Kane MA', 'Jones RJ', 'Ghiaur G']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['K08 HL127269/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA015396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150605,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC4457893,,2015/06/06 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0127790 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-55408 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jun 5;10(6):e0127790. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0127790. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thymol and carvacrol, the major EO compounds of O. vulgare, have demonstrated their potential use as active additives. These new applications use high concentrations, thereby increasing the concern regarding their toxicological profile and especially their genotoxic risk. The aim of this work was to investigate the potential in vitro genotoxicity of thymol (0-250 muM) and carvacrol (0-2500 muM) at equivalent doses to those used in food packaging. The micronucleus (MN) test and the mouse lymphoma (MLA) assay on L5178Y/Tk(+/-) mouse lymphoma cells were used. The negative results for thymol with the MN with and without the S9 fraction and also with the MLA assay reinforce the view that this compound is not genotoxic in mammalian cells. However, carvacrol presented slight genotoxic effects, but only in the MN test at the highest concentration assayed (700 muM) and in the absence of metabolic activation. The lack of genotoxic response in the MLA assay after 4 and 24h of exposure indicates a low genotoxic potential for carvacrol. Alternatively, the general negative findings observed in both assays suggest that the MN results of carvacrol are marginal data without biological relevance. These results can be useful to identify the appropriate concentrations of these substances to be used as additives in food packaging.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Notch-high cells sorted from solid-tumor cell lines exhibited characteristics of cancer stem cells, which were inhibited by the MAb.

Further understanding of FLT3 signaling and discovery of novel regulators will therefore help to determine additional pharmacological targets in FLT3-driven AML. In this report, we identified BEX1 as a novel regulator of oncogenic FLT3-ITD-driven AML. We showed that BEX1 expression was down-regulated in a group of AML patients carrying FLT3-ITD. Loss of BEX1 expression resulted in poor overall survival (hazard ratio, HR = 2.242, p = 0.0011). Overexpression of BEX1 in mouse pro-B and myeloid cells resulted in decreased FLT3-ITD-dependent cell proliferation, colony and tumor formation, and in increased apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. BEX1 localized to the cytosolic compartment of cells and significantly decreased FLT3-ITD-induced AKT phosphorylation without affecting ERK1/2 or STAT5 phosphorylation.

Although there is no cure for CLL, the disease is treatable and current standard chemotherapy regimens have been shown to prolong survival. Recent advances in our understanding of the biology of CLL have led to the identification of numerous cellular and molecular markers with potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic significance. We have used the recently developed digital multiplexed gene-expression technique (DMGE) to analyze a cohort of 30 CLL patients for the presence of specific genes with known diagnostic and prognostic potential. Starting from a set of 290 genes we were able to develop a molecular signature, based on the analysis of 13 genes, which allows distinguishing CLL from normal peripheral blood and from normal B cells, and a second signature based on 24 genes, which distinguishes mutated from unmutated cases (LymphCLL Mut). A third classifier (LymphCLL Diag), based on a 44-gene signature, distinguished CLL cases from a series of other B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (n = 51).

To provide novel information concerning the mutational profile of this disease, we performed the whole-exome sequencing of a prospective series of 12 pPCL cases included in a Phase II multicenter clinical trial and previously characterized at clinical and molecular levels. We identified 1, 928 coding somatic non-silent variants on 1, 643 genes, with a mean of 166 variants per sample, and only few variants and genes recurrent in two or more samples. An excess of C > T transitions and the presence of two main mutational signatures (related to APOBEC over-activity and aging) occurring in different translocation groups were observed. We identified 14 candidate cancer driver genes, mainly involved in cell-matrix adhesion, cell cycle, genome stability, RNA metabolism and protein folding. Furthermore, integration of mutation data with copy number alteration profiles evidenced biallelically disrupted genes with potential tumor suppressor functions. Globally, cadherin/Wnt signaling, extracellular matrix and cell cycle checkpoint resulted the most affected functional pathways. Sequencing results were finally combined with gene expression data to better elucidate the biological relevance of mutated genes.

This combined treatment also synergistically induced NBT-reducing activity and non-specific esterase-positive cells as well as morphological changes to monocyte/macrophage-like cells. Vitamin K2 and cotylenin A cooperatively inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells in short-term and long-term cultures. This treatment also induced growth arrest at the G1 phase. Although 5 microg/ml cotylenin A or 5 microM vitamin K2 alone reduced c-MYC gene expression in HL-60 cells to approximately 45% or 80% that of control cells, respectively, the combined treatment almost completely suppressed c-MYC gene expression. We also demonstrated that the combined treatment of vitamin K2 and cotylenin A synergistically induced the expression of cyclin G2, which had a positive effect on the promotion and maintenance of cell cycle arrest.

It was originally recognized as an oncogene, and was frequently found to be amplified in prostate, ovarian and colorectal cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon carcinoma, esophageal cancer, dog lymphomas and breast cancer. In the present study, the complete RNPC1 gene was identified in a number of vertebrate genomes, suggesting that RNPC1 exists in all types of vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. In the different genomes, the gene had a similar 4 exon/3 intron organization, and all the genetic loci were syntenically conserved. The phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the RNPC1 gene from the mammalian, bird, reptile and teleost lineage formed a species-specific cluster. A total of 34 functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 14 SNPs causing missense mutations, 8 exonic splicing enhancer SNPs and 12 SNPs causing nonsense mutations, were identified in the human RNPC1 gene. RNPC1 was found to be expressed in bladder, blood, brain, breast, colorectal, eye, head and neck, lung, ovarian, skin and soft tissue cancer. In 14 of the 94 tests, an association between RNPC1 gene expression and cancer prognosis was observed. We found that the association between the expression of RNPC1 and prognosis varied in different types of cancer, and even in the same type of cancer from the different databases used. This suggests that the function of RNPC1 in these tumors may be multidimensional. The sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 5 (Sox5), runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), CCAAT displacement protein 1 (CUTL1), v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog (Rel)A, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma isoform 2 (PPARgamma2) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) regulatory transcription factor binding sites were identified in the upstream (promoter) region of the RNPC1 gene, and may thus be involved in the effects of RNPC1 in tumors.",,"['Ding, Zhiming', 'Yang, Hai-Wei', 'Xia, Tian-Song', 'Wang, Bo', 'Ding, Qiang']","['Ding Z', 'Yang HW', 'Xia TS', 'Wang B', 'Ding Q']","['Department of Neurosurgery, The Eastern Hospital of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510700, P.R.

However, its biological role in breast cancer has not been reported. To test whether WT1 SNPs can be used as a molecular marker in order to improve the risk stratification of breast cancer, we performed a case-control study including 709 female sporadic breast cancer patients and 749 female healthy control subjects in the Southeast China. Five WT1 SNPs (rs16754, rs3930513, rs5030141, rs5030317, rs5030320) were selected and determined by polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction to assess their associations with breast cancer risk. Results showed the distributions of the alleles of these WT1 SNPs were consistent with data from Chinese population as suggested by the International HapMap Project. Individuals with the minor alleles of rs16754, rs5030317 and rs5030320 showed a significant decrease of breast cancer risk in codominant model (OR = 0.6370, 95% CI: 0.4260-0.9520 for rs16754; OR = 0.5940, 95% CI: 0.3890-0.9070 for rs5030317; OR = 0.5870, 95% CI: 0.3850-0.8960 for 5030320, respectively) and recessive model. Stratified analyses showed the protective effects were more evident in the subjects with age </= 50 years or in pre-menopausal status. To explore the potential mechanism, we conducted bioinformatics genotype-phenotype correlation analysis, and found that the mRNA expression level for homozygous rare allele of WT1 gene was lower than that in wild-type and heterozygous group (P = 0.0021) in Chinese population. In summary, our findings indicated that minor alleles of rs16754, rs5030317 and rs5030320 are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer, suggesting that WT1 SNPs may be a potential biomarker of individualized prediction of susceptibility to breast cancer.

IL-34 has been shown to promote monocyte viability and proliferation as well as the differentiation of bone marrow cells into macrophage progenitors. Published work on IL-34 involves its effects on normal hematopoietic and osteoclast progenitors. However, it is not known whether IL-34 has biologic effects in cancer, including leukemia. Here we report that the biological effects of IL-34 include induction of differential expression of Interleukins-1alpha and -1beta as well as induction of differentiation of U937, HL-60 and THP-1 leukemia cell lines demonstrating monocyte-like characteristics. The ability of IL-34 to induce monocytic-like differentiation is supported by strong morphological and functional evidence. Cell surface markers of myeloid lineage, CD64 and CD86, remain constant while the levels of CD11b and CD71 decline with IL-34 treatment. IL-34 also induced increases in CD14 and CD68 expression, further supporting maturation toward monocytic character. IL-34-induced differentiated U937 and THP-1 cell lines exhibited biological functions such as endocytosis and respiratory burst activities. Collectively, we conclude that while IL-34 does not induce cell growth or proliferation, it is able to induce differentiation of leukemia cell lines from monoblastic precursor cells towards monocyte- and macrophage-like cells, mediated through the JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt pathways.

METHODS: Bone marrow biopsies were collected from newly diagnosed B-ALL patients (n = 43) between September 2011 and September 2014. Karyotyping was used to detect Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to detect BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. Immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry for leukemia. Patients with both CD66c expression and BCR-ABL1 were further assessed for MRD during treatment. RESULTS: Overall, 26/43 (60.5%) B-ALL patients were positive for BCR-ABL1 fusion gene expression, and all Ph positive cases (17/43; 39.5%) expressed BCR-ABL1 and CD66c. CD66c was expressed at significantly higher levels in BCR-ABL1 positive than negative patients (24/26, 92.3% vs. 11/17, 64.7%; P = 0.042), and furthermore, in all Ph positive cases (17/17, 100% vs. 18/26, 69.2%; P = 0.014). When BCR-ABL1 was set as the gold standard for the presence or absence of MRD after treatment, both CD66c alone and the MRD panel including CD66c demonstrated high diagnostic performance for the detection of MRD, with values of area under the receptor operation curve (ROC) of 0.881 vs. 0.891 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The stable expression pattern of CD66c has noteworthy clinical value in B-ALL not only in the recognition of abnormal leukemia cells at primary diagnosis but also in monitoring of MRD during the treatment, especially in patients without definitely cytogenetic or molecular abnormal, and thus, warrants further investigation as a routine clinical marker for MRD detection by flow cytometry.",,"['Tang, Gu-Sheng', 'Wu, Jun', 'Liu, Min', 'Chen, Hui', 'Gong, Shen-Glan', 'Yang, Jian-Min', 'Hu, Xiao-Xia', 'Wang, Jian-Min']","['Tang GS', 'Wu J', 'Liu M', 'Chen H', 'Gong SG', 'Yang JM', 'Hu XX', 'Wang JM']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Sterile Supply, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150315,United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,,PMC4448202,,2015/06/06 06:00,2015/06/06 06:01,['2015/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/06 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2015 Mar 15;7(3):632-9. eCollection 2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)', 'BCR-ABL1', 'CD66c', 'diagnostic performance', 'minimal residual disease (MRD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anti-proliferation effect of resveratrol-induced apoptosis on K562 cells were detected using MTT assay. Western blotting was performed for detecting changes of SphK1 expression in total cell protein and membrane/cytosol protein in K562 cells respectively after exposure to resveratrol. A biochemical assay was used to measure the activity of SphK after treatment of resveratrol, and then S1P and ceramide levels were examined using ELISA kits. Hochest 33258 staining and flow cytometry were applied to detect the apoptosis condition of K562 cells treated with resveratrol. Resveratrol inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis in K562 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. Western blotting revealed that resveratrol did not affect total SphK1 expression level in K562 cells, but significantly changed the translocation of SphK1, the membrane SphK1 was decreased while cytosol SphK1 level was elevated. The activity of SphK1 in resveratrol treated groups was decreased compared to control group with a significant decrease of S1P and increase of ceramide level. Furthermore, Hoechst 33258 staining and Annexin V-FITC analysis confirmed the notable apoptotic effect of resveratrol in its anti-leukemia process. Resveratrol-induced proliferation inhibition of K562 cells might be mediated through its modulation activity of SphK1 pathway by regulating S1P and ceramide levels, which then affected the proliferation and apoptosis process of leukemia cells.

The aetiology is still sheltered, although several factors are implicated in causality of AL subtypes. Childhood acute leukaemias are associated with genetic syndromes (5%) and ionising radiation as risk factors. Somatic genomic alterations occur during fetal life and are initiating events to childhood leukaemia. Genetic susceptibility has been explored as a risk factor, since environmental exposure of the child to xenobiotics, direct or indirectly, can contribute to the accumulation of somatic mutations. Hence, a systematic review was conducted in order to understand the association between gene polymorphisms and childhood leukaemia risk. The search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed, Lilacs, and Scielo, selecting articles published between 1995 and 2013. This review included 90 case-control publications, which were classified into four groups: xenobiotic system (n = 50), DNA repair (n = 16), regulatory genes (n = 15), and genome wide association studies (GWAS) (n = 9). We observed that the most frequently investigated genes were: NQO1, GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, CYP1A1, NAT2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, MDR1 (ABCB1), XRCC1, ARID5B, and IKZF1. The collected evidence suggests that genetic polymorphisms in CYP2E1, GSTM1, NQO1, NAT2, MDR1, and XRCC1 are capable of modulating leukaemia risk, mainly when associated with environmental exposures, such as domestic pesticides and insecticides, smoking, trihalomethanes, alcohol consumption, and x-rays. More recently, genome wide association studies identified significant associations between genetic polymorphisms in ARID5B e IKZF1 and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, but only a few studies have replicated these results until now. In conclusion, genetic susceptibility contributes to the risk of childhood leukaemia through the effects of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.",,"['Brisson, Gisele D', 'Alves, Liliane R', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['Brisson GD', 'Alves LR', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Programme, Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 20231050.', 'Pharmacy Service, Multiprofessional Residency Programme, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 20231050.', 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Programme, Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 20231050.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150514,England,Ecancermedicalscience,Ecancermedicalscience,101392236,,,,PMC4448992,,2015/06/06 06:00,2015/06/06 06:01,['2015/06/06 06:00'],"['2015/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3332/ecancer.2015.539 [doi]', 'can-9-539 [pii]']",epublish,Ecancermedicalscience. 2015 May 14;9:539. doi: 10.3332/ecancer.2015.539. eCollection 2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['environmental exposure', 'genetic polymorphism', 'genetic predisposition to disease', 'leukaemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Mcl-1 upregulation renders several types of cancers resistant to the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitors ABT-737 and ABT-263. The emerging importance of Mcl-1 in pathogenesis and drug resistance makes it a high-priority therapeutic target. In this study, we showed that inhibition of Mcl-1 with a novel pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor (-)BI97D6 potently induced apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. (-)BI97D6 induced hallmarks of mitochondrial apoptosis, disrupted Mcl-1/Bim and Bcl-2/Bax interactions, and stimulated cell death via the Bak/Bax-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, suggesting on-target mechanisms. As a single agent, this pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor effectively overcame AML cell apoptosis resistance mediated by Mcl-1 or by interactions with bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells. (-)BI97D6 was also potent in killing refractory primary AML cells. Importantly, (-)BI97D6 killed AML leukemia stem/progenitor cells while largely sparing normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. These findings demonstrate that pan-Bcl-2 inhibition by an Mcl-1-targeting inhibitor not only overcomes intrinsic drug resistance ensuing from functional redundancy of Bcl-2 proteins, but also abrogates extrinsic resistance caused by the protective tumor microenvironment.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Pan, Rongqing', 'Ruvolo, Vivian R', 'Wei, Jun', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Reed, John C', 'Pellecchia, Maurizio', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Ruvolo, Peter P']","['Pan R', 'Ruvolo VR', 'Wei J', 'Konopleva M', 'Reed JC', 'Pellecchia M', 'Andreeff M', 'Ruvolo PP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA.', 'Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA168517/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150604,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (BI97D6)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gossypol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4504949,,2015/06/06 06:00,2015/10/20 06:00,['2015/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31430-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-604975 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jul 16;126(3):363-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-604975.

Because CXCR4 expression is under the post-transcriptional control of microRNA-146a in normal and leukemic monocytic cells, we first investigated the impact of hypoxia on microRNA-146a and CXCR4 expression during monocytopoiesis and in acute monocytic leukemia. We then analyzed the effects of hypoxia on drug sensitivity of CXCR4-expressing leukemic cells. We found that microRNA-146a is a target of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha or -2alpha in relation to the stage of monocytopoiesis and the level of hypoxia, and demonstrated the regulation of the microRNA-146a/CXCR4 pathway by hypoxia in monocytes derived from CD34(+) cells. Thus, in myeloid leukemic cell lines, hypoxia-mediated control of the microRNA-146a/CXCR4 pathway depends only on the capacity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha to up-regulate microRNA-146a, which in turn decreases CXCR4 expression. However, at variance with normal monocytic cells and leukemic cell lines, in acute monocytic leukemia overexpressing CXCR4, hypoxia up-modulates microRNA-146a but fails to down-modulate CXCR4 expression. We then investigated the effect of hypoxia on the response of leukemic cells to chemotherapy alone or in combination with stromal-derived factor-1alpha. We found that hypoxia increases stromal-derived factor-1alpha-induced survival of leukemic cells by decreasing their sensitivity to anti-leukemic drugs. Altogether, our results demonstrate that hypoxia-mediated regulation of microRNA-146a, which controls CXCR4 expression in monocytic cells, is lost in acute monocytic leukemia, thus contributing to maintaining CXCR4 overexpression and protecting the cells from anti-leukemic drugs in the hypoxic bone marrow microenvironment.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Spinello, Isabella', 'Quaranta, Maria Teresa', 'Paolillo, Rosa', 'Pelosi, Elvira', 'Cerio, Anna Maria', 'Saulle, Ernestina', 'Lo Coco, Francesco', 'Testa, Ugo', 'Labbaye, Catherine']","['Spinello I', 'Quaranta MT', 'Paolillo R', 'Pelosi E', 'Cerio AM', 'Saulle E', 'Lo Coco F', 'Testa U', 'Labbaye C']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy catherine.labbaye@iss.it.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150604,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '1B37H0967P (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', '*Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Monocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*biosynthesis', 'U937 Cells']",PMC4800689,,2015/06/06 06:00,2016/03/22 06:00,['2015/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.120295 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.120295 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Sep;100(9):1160-71. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.120295.

However, there has been very limited coverage of interpretation of the personal genome sequencing data in terms of diseases. METHODS: In this paper we present the first computational analysis scheme for interpreting personal genome data by simultaneously considering the functional impact of damaging variants and curated disease-gene association data. This method is based on mutual information as a measure of the relative closeness between the personal genome and diseases. We hypothesize that a higher mutual information score implies that the personal genome is more susceptible to a particular disease than other diseases. RESULTS: The method was applied to the sequencing data of 50 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas. The utility of associations between a disease and the personal genome was explored using data of healthy (control) people obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project. The ranks of the disease terms in the AML patient group were compared with those in the healthy control group using ""Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute"" (C04.557.337.539.550) as the corresponding MeSH disease term. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was significantly larger for the AML patient data than for the healthy controls. This methodology could contribute to consequential discoveries and explanations for mining personal genome sequencing data in terms of diseases, and have versatility with respect to genomic-based knowledge such as drug-gene and environmental-factor-gene interactions.",,"['Na, Young-Ji', 'Sohn, Kyung-Ah', 'Kim, Ju Han']","['Na YJ', 'Sohn KA', 'Kim JH']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150529,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Disease/*genetics', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Medical Subject Headings', 'Mutation/genetics', 'ROC Curve', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",PMC4460593,,2015/06/06 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/06/06 06:00'],"['2015/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1755-8794-8-S2-S4 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-8-S2-S4 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2015;8 Suppl 2:S4. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-8-S2-S4.

We retrospectively reviewed outcomes of daunorubicin 60 mg/m(2)/day (DNR60) versus daunorubicin 90 mg/m(2)/day (DNR90) in adult AML patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed AML patients >/=18 years who received 7+3 with or without etoposide as frontline therapy from 1/1/2006 to 5/1/2013 were identified. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare characteristics. Kaplan-Meier curves were estimated for overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were developed to determine independent predictors for survival. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were included (DNR90=48 patients, DNR60=80 patients). The estimated 3-year OS rate in the DNR90 group was 56% (95% CI 38-70%), while in the DNR60 group was 34% (95% CI 23-44%). Multivariate analysis (MVA) in non-allotransplanted patients showed that unfavorable cytogenetics and worse performance status were associated with decreased OS while DNR intensification, etoposide use and site were associated with improved OS. In MVA of allotransplanted patients re-induction based on day-14 marrow was associated with worse OS. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our retrospective study, initial DNR based induction chemotherapy intensification improved OS in non-allotransplanted patients. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this preliminary finding.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

METHOD: Primary chondrocytes were isolated from wild type and SOCS-3-deficient (Socs3(Delta/Deltacol2)) mice and stimulated with oncostatin M (OSM), IL-6 plus the soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6/sIL-6R), IL-11 or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) for 4 h. Total RNA was extracted and gene expression was evaluated by microarray analysis. Validation of the microarray results was performed using Taqman probes on RNA derived from chondrocytes stimulated for 1, 2, 4 or 8 h. Gene ontology was characterized using DAVID (database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery). RESULTS: Multiple genes, including Bcl3, Junb, Tgm1, Angptl4 and Lrg1, were upregulated in chondrocytes stimulated with each gp130 cytokine. The gene transcription profile in response to OSM stimulation was pro-inflammatory and was highly correlated to IL-6/sIL-6R, rather than IL-11 or LIF. In the absence of SOCS-3, OSM and IL-6/sIL-6R stimulation induced an interferon (IFN)-like gene signature, including expression of IL-31ra and S100a9. CONCLUSION: While each gp130 cytokine induced a transcriptional response in chondrocytes, OSM- and IL-6/sIL-6R were the most potent members of this cytokine family. SOCS-3 plays an important regulatory role in this cell type, as it does in hematopoietic cells. Our results provide new insights into a hierarchy of gp130-induced transcriptional responses in chondrocytes that is normally restrained by SOCS-3 and suggest therapeutic inhibition of OSM may have benefit over and above antagonism of IL-6 during inflammatory arthritis.","['Copyright (c) 2015 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

METHODS: T and Th lymphocyte subsets in CCyR patients treated with HHT (n = 15) or IM (n = 16) were assayed with flow cytometry. RESULTS: It was found that there were no differences in T lymphocyte subset proportions at the time of achieving CCyR0 and also no difference in the CD8+T cell proportions at the 12th month after CCyR (CCyR12), between the 2 groups. The values of CD3+T, CD4+T, CD8+T, CD4+T/CD8+T, Th1 and Th2 cells were 54.21% +/- 6.12% vs. 44.32% +/- 4.85%, 29.83% +/- 5.53% vs. 22.27% +/- 3.22%, 24.66 +/- 4.91 vs. 25.41% +/- 5.72% , 1.11 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.19, 10.23% +/- 4.24% vs. 8.34% +/- 3.45% and 11.12% +/- 3.91% vs. 13.67% +/- 4.78%, respectively in the HHT group and IM group at CCyR12, which meant that the proportions of CD3+T, CD4+T and Th1 cells and the ratio of CD4+T to CD8+T cells were higher and the CD8+T and Th2 cell proportions were lower in the HHT group than in the IM group.

Here we demonstrate that MLN4924 induces apoptosis in AML cell lines and clinical samples via a mechanism distinct from those observed in other malignancies. Inactivation of E3 cullin ring ligases (CRLs) through NAE inhibition causes accumulation of the CRL substrate c-Myc, which transactivates the PMAIP1 gene encoding Noxa, leading to increased Noxa protein, Bax and Bak activation, and subsequent apoptotic changes. Importantly, c-Myc knockdown diminishes Noxa induction; and Noxa siRNA diminishes MLN4924-induced killing. Because Noxa also neutralizes Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 paralog often upregulated in resistant AML, further experiments have examined the effect of combining MLN4924 with BH3 mimetics that target other anti-apoptotic proteins. In combination with ABT-199 or ABT-263 (navitoclax), MLN4924 exerts a synergistic cytotoxic effect. Collectively, these results provide new insight into MLN4924-induced engagement of the apoptotic machinery that could help guide further exploration of MLN4924 for AML.",,"['Knorr, K L B', 'Schneider, P A', 'Meng, X W', 'Dai, H', 'Smith, B D', 'Hess, A D', 'Karp, J E', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Knorr KL', 'Schneider PA', 'Meng XW', 'Dai H', 'Smith BD', 'Hess AD', 'Karp JE', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['F30CA183507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA183507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166741/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA70095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM65841/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM065841/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA15083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150605,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'S3AZD8D215 (pevonedistat)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",PMC4816118,,2015/06/06 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,['2015/06/06 06:00'],"['2015/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201574 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2015.74 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2015 Dec;22(12):2133-42. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2015.74.

The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype, which lacks expression of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, afflicts 15% of patients and is refractory to current targeted therapies. Like many cancers, TNBC cells often deregulate programmed cell death by upregulating anti-apoptotic proteins of the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family. One family member, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), is commonly amplified in TNBC and correlates with a poor clinical prognosis. Here we show the effect of silencing Mcl-1 and Bcl-2-like protein 1 isoform 1 (Bcl-xL) expression on viability in a panel of seventeen TNBC cell lines. Cell death was observed in a subset upon Mcl-1 knockdown. In contrast, Bcl-xL knockdown only modestly reduced viability, indicating that Mcl-1 is a more important survival factor. However, dual silencing of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL reduced viability in most cell lines tested. These proliferation results were recapitulated by BH3 profiling experiments. Treatment with a Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 peptide had only a moderate effect on any of the TNBC cell lines, however, co-dosing an Mcl-1-selective peptide with a peptide that inhibits Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 was effective in each line tested. Similarly, the selective Bcl-xL inhibitor WEHI-539 was only weakly cytotoxic across the panel, but sensitization by Mcl-1 knockdown markedly improved its EC50. ABT-199, which selectively inhibits Bcl-2, did not synergize with Mcl-1 knockdown, indicating the relatively low importance of Bcl-2 in these lines. Mcl-1 sensitivity is not predicted by mRNA or protein levels of a single Bcl-2 family member, except for only a weak correlation for Bak and Bax protein expression. However, a more comprehensive index composed of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, Bim, Bak and Noxa protein or mRNA expression correlates well with Mcl-1 sensitivity in TNBC and can also predict Mcl-1 dependency in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.",,"['Goodwin, C M', 'Rossanese, O W', 'Olejniczak, E T', 'Fesik, S W']","['Goodwin CM', 'Rossanese OW', 'Olejniczak ET', 'Fesik SW']","['Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 GM007628/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '2P50CA098131-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK058404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA098131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '11566/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'DK058404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150605,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4816117,,2015/06/06 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,['2015/06/06 06:00'],"['2014/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201573 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2015.73 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2015 Dec;22(12):2098-106. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2015.73.

The oncogenic activity of eIF4E driven by the Mnk kinases is a convergent determinant of the two cascades, suggesting that targeting the Mnk/eIF4E axis may provide therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of cancer. Herein, a potent and selective Mnk2 inhibitor (MNKI-85) and a dual-specific Mnk1 and Mnk2 inhibitor (MNKI-19), both derived from a thienopyrimidinyl chemotype, were selected to explore their antileukemic properties. MNKI-19 and MNKI-85 are effective in inhibiting the growth of AML cells that possess an M5 subtype with FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutation. Further mechanistic studies show that the downstream effects with respect to the selective Mnk1/2 kinase inhibition in AML cells causes G1 cell cycle arrest followed by induction of apoptosis. MNKI-19 and MNKI-85 demonstrate similar Mnk2 kinase activity and cellular antiproliferative activity but exhibit different time-dependent effects on cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Collectively, this study shows that pharmacologic inhibition of both Mnk1 and Mnk2 can result in a more pronounced cellular response than targeting Mnk2 alone. However, MNKI-85, a first-in-class inhibitor of Mnk2, can be used as a powerful pharmacologic tool in studying the Mnk2/eIF4E-mediated tumorigenic mechanism. In conclusion, this study provides a better understanding of the mechanism underlying the inhibition of AML cell growth by Mnk inhibitors and suggests their potential utility as a therapeutic agent for AML.","['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Teo, Theodosia', 'Lam, Frankie', 'Yu, Mingfeng', 'Yang, Yuchao', 'Basnet, Sunita K C', 'Albrecht, Hugo', 'Sykes, Matthew J', 'Wang, Shudong']","['Teo T', 'Lam F', 'Yu M', 'Yang Y', 'Basnet SK', 'Albrecht H', 'Sykes MJ', 'Wang S']","['Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, Centre for Cancer Biology, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, Centre for Cancer Biology, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, Centre for Cancer Biology, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, Centre for Cancer Biology, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, Centre for Cancer Biology, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, Centre for Cancer Biology, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, Centre for Cancer Biology, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Centre for Drug Discovery and Development, Sansom Institute for Health Research, Centre for Cancer Biology, and School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia shudong.wang@unisa.edu.au.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150604,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0', '(4-((4-fluoro-2-isopropoxyphenyl)amino)-5-methylthieno(2,3-d)pyrimidine-6-carboxy', 'lic acid)', '0', '(4-((4-fluoro-2-isopropoxyphenyl)amino)-N-(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methylthieno(2,3-d)p', 'yrimidine-6-carboxamide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MKNK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (MKNK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2015/06/06 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/06/06 06:00'],"['2015/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.115.098012 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.115.098012 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2015 Aug;88(2):380-9. doi: 10.1124/mol.115.098012.

Detection of del(20q) in patients following cytotoxic therapies raises concerns for an emerging therapy-related myeloid neoplasm. In this study, we identified 92 patients who acquired isolated del(20q) in their bone marrow following cytotoxic therapies for malignant neoplasms. Seventy-six patients showed interstitial and sixteen patients showed terminal 20q deletion. The median interval from prior cytotoxic therapies to detection of del(20q) was 58 months (range, 5-213 months). With a median follow-up of 23 months (range, 1-183 months), 21 (23%) patients developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasm and 71 (77%) patients did not. In patients who developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, del(20q) presented in a higher percentage of metaphases (60 vs 25%, P<0.0001); persisted for a longer period of time (24 vs 10 months, P=0.0487); and was more often a terminal deletion (33 vs 13%, P=0.0006) compared with patients who did not develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasm. Clonal evolution was only detected in patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (4 patients, 19%). We conclude that del(20q) emerging after cytotoxic therapy represents an innocuous finding in more than two-thirds of patients.

Despite the essential role of the retroviral core, its high polymorphism has hindered high-resolution structural analyses. Here, we report the x-ray structure of the native capsid (CA) protein from bovine leukemia virus. CA is organized as hexamers that deviate substantially from sixfold symmetry, yet adjust to make two-dimensional pseudohexagonal arrays that mimic mature retroviral cores. Intra- and interhexameric quasi-equivalent contacts are uncovered, with flexible trimeric lateral contacts among hexamers, yet preserving very similar dimeric interfaces making the lattice. The conformation of each capsid subunit in the hexamer is therefore dictated by long-range interactions, revealing how the hexamers can also assemble into closed core particles, a relevant feature of retrovirus biology.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Obal, G', 'Trajtenberg, F', 'Carrion, F', 'Tome, L', 'Larrieux, N', 'Zhang, X', 'Pritsch, O', 'Buschiazzo, A']","['Obal G', 'Trajtenberg F', 'Carrion F', 'Tome L', 'Larrieux N', 'Zhang X', 'Pritsch O', 'Buschiazzo A']","['Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Unit of Protein Biophysics, Mataojo 2020, 11400, Montevideo, Uruguay.

However, the contribution of Stat3 in MPN evoked by JAK2V617F remains unknown. To determine the role of Stat3 in JAK2V617F-induced MPN, we generated Stat3-deficient Jak2V617F-expressing mice. Whereas expression of Jak2V617F resulted in a polycythemia vera-like disease characterized by increased red blood cells (RBCs), hematocrit, neutrophils and platelets in the peripheral blood of Jak2V617F knock-in mice, deletion of Stat3 slightly reduced RBC and hematocrit parameters and modestly increased platelet numbers in Jak2V617F knock-in mice. Moreover, deletion of Stat3 significantly increased the neutrophil counts/percentages and markedly reduced the survival of mice expressing Jak2V617F. These phenotypic manifestations were reproduced upon bone marrow (BM) transplantation into wild-type animals. Flow cytometric analysis showed increased hematopoietic stem cell and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor populations in the BM and spleens of Stat3-deficient Jak2V617F mice. Stat3 deficiency also caused a marked expansion of Gr-1+/Mac-1+ myeloid cells in Jak2V617F knock-in mice. Histopathologic analysis revealed marked increase in granulocytes in the BM, spleens and livers of Stat3-deficient Jak2V617F-expressing mice.

BACKGROUND: We investigated haemostatic function and endothelial biomarkers before and after platelet transfusion in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood was sampled before, 1 and 24 h after platelet transfusion. Primary and secondary haemostasis was evaluated by whole blood aggregometry (Multiplate) and thromboelastography (TEG). Endothelial biomarkers (sICAM-1, syndecan-1, sThrombomodulin, sVE-Cadherin) and platelet activation biomarkers (sCD40L, TGF-beta) were investigated along with haematology/biochemistry analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included. Despite continued low platelet counts, platelet transfusion normalised the median values of most TEG parameters and slightly increased platelet aggregation (all P < 0.05).

This malignancy is often characterized by abnormalities of chromosome 7, including large deletions or chromosomal loss. A variety of studies suggest that decreased expression of the EZH2 gene located at 7q36.1 is critical in disease pathogenesis. This histone methyltransferase has been implicated in transcriptional repression through modifying histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3k27). However, the critical target genes of EZH2 and their regulatory roles remain unclear. METHOD: To characterize the subset of EZH2 target genes that might contribute to t-AML pathogenesis, we developed a novel computational analysis to integrate tissue-specific histone modifications and genome-wide transcriptional regulation. Initial integrative analysis utilized a novel ""seq2gene"" strategy to explore largely the target genes of chromatin immuneprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) enriched regions. By combining seq2gene with our Phenotype-Genotype-Network (PGNet) algorithm, we enriched genes with similar expression profiles and genomic or functional characteristics into ""biomodules"". RESULTS: Initial studies identified SEMA3A (semaphoring 3A) as a novel oncogenic candidate that is regulated by EZH2-silencing, using data derived from both normal and leukemic cell lines as well as murine cells deficient in EZH2. A microsatellite marker at the SEMA3A promoter has been associated with chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity. Notably, our subsequent studies in primary t-AML demonstrate an expected up-regulation of SEMA3A that is EZH2-modulated. Furthermore, we have identified three biomodules that are co-expressed with SEMA3A and up-regulated in t-AML, one of which consists of previously characterized EZH2-repressed gene targets. The other two biomodules include MAPK8 and TATA box targets. Together, our studies suggest an important role for EZH2 targets in t-AML pathogenesis that warrants further study. CONCLUSION: These developed computational algorithms and systems biology strategies will enhance the knowledge discovery and hypothesis-driven analysis of multiple next generation sequencing data, for t-AML and other complex diseases.",,"['Yang, Xinan Holly', 'Wang, Bin', 'Cunningham, John M']","['Yang XH', 'Wang B', 'Cunningham JM']",,['eng'],"['R21 CA167305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR029030-01/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150529,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,['0 (Histones)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Neoplasm', '*Genome, Human', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*genetics']",PMC4460748,,2015/06/06 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/06/06 06:00'],"['2015/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1755-8794-8-S2-S6 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-8-S2-S6 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2015;8 Suppl 2:S6. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-8-S2-S6.

However, intrinsic or acquired chemoresistance to temozolomide remains the greatest obstacle to the successful treatment of human GBM. The principal mechanism responsible for this resistance is largely unknown. In the present study, we showed that expression of transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in glioma cells correlated with temozolomide chemoresistance in human glioma cells. Overexpression of TAZ promoted temozolomide resistance in U-87MG cells, whereas knockdown of TAZ expression sensitized temozolomide-resistant U-251MG cells to temozolomide. Further, TAZ inhibits temozolomide induced apoptosis via upregulation of MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1) and high expression of TAZ predicts a poor prognosis for GBM patients. In conclusion, our results suggest that TAZ had a critical role in the resistance to temozolomide in glioma cells, and it may provide a promising target for improving the therapeutic outcome of temozolomide-resistant gliomas.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: To systemically review all cases diagnosed as low grade lymphoma of orbit and lacrimal gland within a 2 year period at a specialist ophthalmic centre. To ascertain the frequency of diagnostic errors in this group of cases, in particular to look for known pitfalls associated with follicular colonisation by marginal zone lymphoma and the recently identified atypical variant of follicular lymphoma (FL). A series of 21 cases were reviewed. RESULTS: We identified two diagnostic errors; one case of extra nodal marginal zone lymphoma (ENMZL) which showed follicular colonisation and was misinterpreted as a FL and a case of missed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We identified no cases of atypical FL. CONCLUSION: Within the orbit and lacrimal gland the term ""low grade lymphoma"" encompasses the following types of lymphoma: ENMZL, FL, MCL and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). The typical and atypical immunophenotype of these entities is discussed.

TNFAIP3/A20 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that is thought to be a negative regulator of autophagy in cell lines. However, the role of TNFAIP3 in autophagy remains unclear. To determine whether TNFAIP3 regulates autophagy in CD4 T cells, we first analyzed Tnfaip3-deficient naive CD4 T cells in vitro. We demonstrated that Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells exhibited reduced MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) puncta formation, increased mitochondrial content, and exaggerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These results indicate that TNFAIP3 promotes autophagy after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in CD4 T cells. We then investigated the mechanism by which TNFAIP3 promotes autophagy signaling. We found that TNFAIP3 bound to the MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) complex and that Tnfaip3-deficient cells displayed enhanced ubiquitination of the MTOR complex and MTOR activity. To confirm the effects of enhanced MTOR activity in Tnfaip3-deficient cells, we analyzed cell survival following treatment with Torin1, an MTOR inhibitor. Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells exhibited fewer cell numbers than the control cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the impaired survival of Tnfaip3-deficient cells was ameliorated with Torin1 treatment in vitro and in vivo. The effect of Torin1 was abolished by Atg5 deficiency.

In particular enzymes of the glutathion-S-transferase (GST) family represent a well-known detoxification mechanism, which limit the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs in tumor cells. Specifically, GST of the class P1 (GSTP1-1) is overexpressed in colorectal tumor cells and renders them resistant to various drugs. Thus, GSTP1-1 has become an important therapeutic target. We have recently shown that thiazolides, a novel class of anti-infectious drugs, induce apoptosis in colorectal tumor cells in a GSTP1-1-dependent manner, thereby bypassing this GSTP1-1-mediated drug resistance. In this study we investigated in detail the underlying mechanism of thiazolide-induced apoptosis induction in colorectal tumor cells. Thiazolides induce the activation of p38 and Jun kinase, which is required for thiazolide-induced cell death. Activation of these MAP kinases results in increased expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologs Bim and Puma, which inducibly bind and sequester Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL leading to the induction of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Of interest, while an increase in intracellular glutathione levels resulted in increased resistance to cisplatin, it sensitized colorectal tumor cells to thiazolide-induced apoptosis by promoting increased Jun kinase activation and Bim induction. Thus, thiazolides may represent an interesting novel class of anti-tumor agents by specifically targeting tumor resistance mechanisms, such as GSTP1-1.",,"['Brockmann, A', 'Bluwstein, A', 'Kogel, A', 'May, S', 'Marx, A', 'Tschan, M P', 'Brunner, T']","['Brockmann A', 'Bluwstein A', 'Kogel A', 'May S', 'Marx A', 'Tschan MP', 'Brunner T']","['1] Chair of Biochemical Pharmacology, Department of Biology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany [2] Konstanz Research School Chemical Biology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.', 'Chair of Biochemical Pharmacology, Department of Biology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.', 'Chair of Biochemical Pharmacology, Department of Biology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.', 'Chair of Biochemical Pharmacology, Department of Biology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.', '1] Konstanz Research School Chemical Biology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany [2] Chair of Organic Chemistry/Cellular Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', '1] Chair of Biochemical Pharmacology, Department of Biology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany [2] Konstanz Research School Chemical Biology, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150604,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",PMC4669824,,2015/06/05 06:00,2016/02/19 06:00,['2015/06/05 06:00'],"['2015/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2015137 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.137 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 Jun 4;6:e1778. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2015.137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although maternal IL-6 is though t to be a possible mediator relating MIA induced these neuropsychiatric disorders, the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Previously, we reported that the maternal leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-placental ACTH-fetal LIF signaling relay pathway (maternal-fetal LIF signal relay) promotes neurogenesis of fetal cerebrum in rats. Here we report that the maternal-fetal LIF signal relay in mice is suppressed by injection of polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid into dams, which induces MIA at 12.5 days post-coitum. Maternal IL-6 levels and gene expression of placental suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3) increased according to the severity of MIA and gene expression of placental Socs3 correlated with maternal IL-6 levels. Furthermore, we show that MIA causes reduction of LIF level in the fetal cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in the decreased neurogenesis in the cerebrum. These findings suggest that maternal IL-6 interferes the maternal-fetal LIF signal relay by inducing SOCS3 in the placenta and leads to decreased neurogenesis.",,"['Tsukada, Tsuyoshi', 'Simamura, Eriko', 'Shimada, Hiroki', 'Arai, Takuma', 'Higashi, Nobuaki', 'Akai, Takuya', 'Iizuka, Hideaki', 'Hatta, Toshihisa']","['Tsukada T', 'Simamura E', 'Shimada H', 'Arai T', 'Higashi N', 'Akai T', 'Iizuka H', 'Hatta T']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Ishikawa 920-0293, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150604,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Brain/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetus/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Immunity', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Placenta/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC4456156,,2015/06/05 06:00,2016/05/11 06:00,['2015/06/05 06:00'],"['2015/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0129011 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-00698 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jun 4;10(6):e0129011. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0129011. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe a procedure that allows amplification of the total transcript of a single prokaryotic cell for in-depth analysis. This is performed by using a laser-capture microdissection instrument for single-cell isolation, followed by reverse transcription via Moloney murine leukemia virus, degradation of chromosomal DNA with McrBC and DpnI restriction enzymes, single-stranded cDNA (ss-cDNA) ligation using T4 polynucleotide kinase and CircLigase, and polymerization of ss-cDNA to double-stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) by Phi29 polymerase.

Thus, Notch signaling promotes CLL cell survival at least in part by sustaining Mcl-1 expression. In CLL cells, an enhanced Notch activation also contributes to the increase in Mcl-1 expression and cell survival induced by IL-4.Mcl-1 downregulation by Notch targeting is not due to reduced transcription or degradation by caspases, but in part, to increased degradation by the proteasome. Mcl-1 downregulation by Notch targeting is also accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), suggesting that this protein is another target of Notch signaling in CLL cells.Overall, we show that Notch signaling sustains CLL cell survival by promoting Mcl-1 expression and eIF4E activity, and given the oncogenic role of these factors, we underscore the therapeutic potential of Notch inhibition in CLL.",,"['De Falco, Filomena', 'Sabatini, Rita', 'Del Papa, Beatrice', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Di Ianni, Mauro', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Baldoni, Stefano', 'Screpanti, Isabella', 'Marconi, Pierfrancesco', 'Rosati, Emanuela']","['De Falco F', 'Sabatini R', 'Del Papa B', 'Falzetti F', 'Di Ianni M', 'Sportoletti P', 'Baldoni S', 'Screpanti I', 'Marconi P', 'Rosati E']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Biosciences and Medical Embryology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Biosciences and Medical Embryology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, Hematology Section, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy."", 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Biosciences and Medical Embryology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Biosciences and Medical Embryology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch2/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4599289,,2015/06/05 06:00,2016/04/30 06:00,['2015/06/05 06:00'],"['2015/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['4116 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4116 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Jun 30;6(18):16559-72. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.4116.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'Notch', 'cell survival', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'eIF4E']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report downregulation of the miR-181a/b gene cluster in APL blasts and NB4 leukemia cells upon ATRA treatment as a key event in the drug response. We found that miR-181a/b expression was activated by the PML/RARalpha oncogene in cells and transgenic knock-in mice, an observation confirmed and extended by evidence of enhanced expression of miR-181a/b in APL patient specimens. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated attenuation of miR-181a/b expression in NB4 cells was sufficient to reduce colony-forming capacity, proliferation, and survival. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-181a/b targets the ATRA-regulated tumor suppressor gene RASSF1A by direct binding to its 3'-untranslated region. Enforced expression of miR-181a/b or RNAi-mediated attenuation of RASSF1A inhibited ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation via regulation of the cell-cycle regulator cyclin D1. Conversely, RASSF1A overexpression enhanced apoptosis. Finally, RASSF1A levels were reduced in PML/RARalpha knock-in mice and APL patient samples.

DATA SOURCES: A literature search of EMBASE (1947 to April 2015), Medline (1946 to April 2015), PubMed (1996 to April 2015), the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinicaltrials.gov, the Food and Drug Administration, and relevant meeting abstracts was conducted using the terms blinatumomab, BiTE, bispecific T-cell engager, MT103, MEDI-538, and Blincyto. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Human and animal studies describing the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety of blinatumomab for precursor B-ALL were identified. DATA SYNTHESIS: Blinatumomab is a first-in-class bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody derived from a B-lineage specific antitumor mouse monoclonal antibody that binds to both CD19 of B-cells and CD3 of T-cells. A pivotal phase II trial demonstrated that response rates were high in a refractory or relapsed patient population, with 43% achieving complete remission (CR). Median relapse-free survival was 5.9 months for those with CR or CR with incomplete hematological recovery. Median overall survival was 6.1 months, and 60% of patients achieved minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity. The most common adverse events included pyrexia, neurological events, headache, febrile neutropenia, peripheral edema, nausea, hypokalemia, constipation, and anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Blinatumomab is a novel BiTE therapeutic monoclonal antibody that has shown promising results in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL or those achieving a CR with persistent MRD.

To better understand the end-of-life decision-making process among oncology specialists, we compared the cancer treatment recommendations, and attitudes and beliefs toward palliative care between hematologic and solid tumor specialists. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly surveyed 120 hematologic and 120 solid tumor oncology specialists at our institution. Respondents completed a survey examining various aspects of end-of-life care, including palliative systemic therapy using standardized case vignettes and palliative care proficiency. RESULTS: Of 240 clinicians, 182 (76%) clinicians responded. Compared with solid tumor specialists, hematologic specialists were more likely to favor prescribing systemic therapy with moderate toxicity and no survival benefit for patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 4 and an expected survival of 1 month (median preference 4 versus 1, in which 1 = strong against treatment and 7 = strongly recommend treatment, P < 0.0001). This decision was highly polarized. Hematologic specialists felt less comfortable discussing death and dying (72% versus 88%, P = 0.007) and hospice referrals (81% versus 93%, P = 0.02), and were more likely to feel a sense of failure with disease progression (46% versus 31%, P = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, hematologic specialty [odds ratio (OR) 2.77, P = 0.002] and comfort level with prescribing treatment to ECOG 4 patients (OR 3.79, P = 0.02) were associated with the decision to treat in the last month of life. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant differences in attitudes and beliefs toward end-of-life care between hematologic and solid tumor specialists, and identified opportunities to standardize end-of-life care.","['(c) The Author 2015.

To address this problem, TLR7-responses of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells were studied in the presence and absence of a human stromal cell-line derived from a leukemic spleen. CLL cells alone produced high levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and proliferated in response to TLR7-agonists. A signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 -activating stromal factor, identified as interleukin (IL)-6, was found to upregulate microRNA (miR)-17 and miR-19a, target TLR7 and TNFA messenger RNA, and induce a state of tolerance to TLR7-agonists in CLL cells. Overexpression of the miR-17-92 cluster tolerized CLL cells directly and miR-17 and miR-19a antagomiRs restored TLR7-signaling. Inhibition of IL-6 signaling with antibodies or small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitors reversed tolerization and increased TLR7-stimulated CLL cell numbers in vitro and in NOD-SCIDgammac (null) mice.

Overexpression of the thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR; encoded by CRLF2) occurs in a subset of adults and children with B-ALL and confers a high risk of relapse. Recent data suggest the TSLPR signaling axis is functionally important, suggesting that TSLPR would be an ideal immunotherapeutic target. We constructed short and long CARs targeting TSLPR and tested efficacy against CRLF2-overexpressing B-ALL. Both CARs demonstrated activity in vitro, but only short TSLPR CAR T cells mediated leukemia regression. In vivo activity of the short CAR was also associated with long-term persistence of CAR-expressing T cells. Short TSLPR CAR treatment of mice engrafted with a TSLPR-expressing ALL cell line induced leukemia cytotoxicity with efficacy comparable with that of CD19 CAR T cells. Short TSLPR CAR T cells also eradicated leukemia in 4 xenograft models of human CRLF2-overexpressing ALL. Finally, TSLPR has limited surface expression on normal tissues.

The underlying dysregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is interconnected with abnormal mitochondrial biogenesis and function. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), elevated ROS are implicated in clonal outgrowth and drug resistance. The pro-survival oncogene T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1) is causally linked to the high threshold towards classical apoptosis in CLL. We investigated how aberrant redox characteristics and bioenergetics of CLL are impacted by TCL1 and if this is therapeutically exploitable. METHODS: Bio-organometallic chemistry provided compounds containing a cytosine nucleobase, a metal core (ferrocene, ruthenocene, Fe(CO)3), and a 5'-CH2O-TDS substituent. Four of these metal-containing nucleoside analogues (MCNA) were tested for their efficacy and mode of action in CLL patient samples, gene-targeted cell lines, and murine TCL1-transgenic splenocytes. RESULTS: The MCNA showed a marked and selective cytotoxicity towards CLL cells. MCNA activity was equally observed in high-risk disease groups, including those of del11q/del17p cytogenetics and of clinical fludarabine resistance. They overcame protective stromal cell interactions. MCNA-evoked PARP-mediated cell death was non-autophagic and non-necrotic as well as caspase- and P53-independent. This unconventional apoptosis involved early increases of ROS, which proved indispensible based on mitigation of MCNA-triggered death by various scavengers. MCNA exposure reduced mitochondrial respiration (oxygen consumption rate; OCR) and induced a rapid membrane depolarization (PsiM). These characteristics distinguished the MCNA from the alkylator bendamustine and from fludarabine. Higher cellular ROS and increased MCNA sensitivity were linked to TCL1 expression. The presence of TCL1 promoted a mitochondrial release of in part caspase-independent apoptotic factors (AIF, Smac, Cytochrome-c) in response to MCNA. Although basal mitochondrial respiration (OCR) and maximal respiratory capacity were not affected by TCL1 overexpression, it mediated a reduced aerobic glycolysis (lactate production) and a higher fraction of oxygen consumption coupled to ATP-synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Redox-active substances such as organometallic nucleosides can confer specific cytotoxicity to ROS-stressed cancer cells. Their P53- and caspase-independent induction of non-classical apoptosis implicates that redox-based strategies can overcome resistance to conventional apoptotic triggers. The high TCL1-oncogenic burden of aggressive CLL cells instructs their particular dependence on mitochondrial energetic flux and renders them more susceptible towards agents interfering in mitochondrial homeostasis.",,"['Prinz, Christian', 'Vasyutina, Elena', 'Lohmann, Gregor', 'Schrader, Alexandra', 'Romanski, Steffen', 'Hirschhauser, Christoph', 'Mayer, Petra', 'Frias, Corazon', 'Herling, Carmen D', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Schmalz, Hans-Gunther', 'Prokop, Aram', 'Mougiakakos, Dimitrios', 'Herling, Marco']","['Prinz C', 'Vasyutina E', 'Lohmann G', 'Schrader A', 'Romanski S', 'Hirschhauser C', 'Mayer P', 'Frias C', 'Herling CD', 'Hallek M', 'Schmalz HG', 'Prokop A', 'Mougiakakos D', 'Herling M']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signaling and Oncoproteome, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Koln-Bonn, and Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. christian_prinz@gmx.de.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signaling and Oncoproteome, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Koln-Bonn, and Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. elena.vasyutina@uk-koeln.de.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signaling and Oncoproteome, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Koln-Bonn, and Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. gregor.lohmann@uk-koeln.de.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signaling and Oncoproteome, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Koln-Bonn, and Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. alexandra.schrader@uk-koeln.de.', 'Division of Organic Chemistry, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. romansks@uni-koeln.de.', 'Division of Organic Chemistry, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. pghirschhaeuser@gmx.de.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signaling and Oncoproteome, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Koln-Bonn, and Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. petra.mayer@uk-koeln.de.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany. corazonfrias1@yahoo.com."", 'Department I of Internal Medicine, CIO Koln-Bonn, and CECAD, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. carmen.herling@uk-koeln.de.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, CIO Koln-Bonn, and CECAD, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. michael.hallek@uk-koeln.de.', 'Division of Organic Chemistry, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. schmalz@uni-koeln.de.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany. prokopa@kliniken-koeln.de."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany. dimitrios.mougiakakos@uk-erlangen.de.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signaling and Oncoproteome, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO) Koln-Bonn, and Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. marco.herling@uk-koeln.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150604,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Homeostasis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Necrosis', 'Nucleosides/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Oncogenes', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",PMC4453051,,2015/06/05 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2015/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12943-015-0378-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12943-015-0378-1 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2015 Jun 4;14:114. doi: 10.1186/s12943-015-0378-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fc gamma receptor (CD64) has been investigated in detail, and CD64-targeting immunotherapy has shown promising efficacy in the targeted ablation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML) and chronic myeloid leukemia cells (CML). Here we investigate for the first time the potential of FcalphaRI (CD89) as a new target antigen expressed by different myeloid leukemic cell populations. For specific targeting and killing, we generated a recombinant fusion protein comprising an anti-human CD89 single-chain Fragment variable and the well-characterized truncated version of the potent Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA'). Our novel therapeutic approach achieved in vitro EC50 values in range 0.2-3 nM depending on the applied stimuli, that is, interferon gamma or tumor necrosis factor alpha. We also observed a dose-dependent apoptosis-mediated cytotoxicity, which resulted in the elimination of up to 90% of the target cells within 72 hr. These findings were also confirmed ex vivo using leukemic primary cells from peripheral blood samples of three previously untreated patients. We conclude that CD89-specific targeting of leukemia cell lines can be achieved in vitro and that the efficient elimination of leukemic primary cells supports the potential of CD89-ETA' as a potent, novel immunotherapeutic agent.",['(c) 2015 UICC.'],"['Mladenov, Radoslav', 'Hristodorov, Dmitrij', 'Cremer, Christian', 'Hein, Lea', 'Kreutzer, Fabian', 'Stroisch, Tim', 'Niesen, Judith', 'Brehm, Hannes', 'Blume, Tobias', 'Brummendorf, Tim Henrik', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Thepen, Theophilus', 'Fischer, Rainer', 'Stockmeyer, Bernhard', 'Barth, Stefan', 'Stein, Christoph']","['Mladenov R', 'Hristodorov D', 'Cremer C', 'Hein L', 'Kreutzer F', 'Stroisch T', 'Niesen J', 'Brehm H', 'Blume T', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Jost E', 'Thepen T', 'Fischer R', 'Stockmeyer B', 'Barth S', 'Stein C']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapy, Institute for Applied Medical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Clinic, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Product Development, Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapy, Institute for Applied Medical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Clinic, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Product Development, Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapy, Institute for Applied Medical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Clinic, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapy, Institute for Applied Medical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Clinic, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapy, Institute for Applied Medical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Clinic, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapy, Institute for Applied Medical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Clinic, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Product Development, Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapy, Institute for Applied Medical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Clinic, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapy, Institute for Applied Medical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Clinic, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology (Internal Medicine IV), RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology (Internal Medicine IV), RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Product Development, Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Product Development, Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 Hematology/Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Integrative Biomedical Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine and Immunotherapy, Institute for Applied Medical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Clinic, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Product Development, Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150612,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Fc(alpha) receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)']",IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/immunology', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Bacterial Toxins/immunology', 'Exotoxins/immunology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology', 'U937 Cells', 'Virulence Factors/immunology']",,,2015/06/05 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/06/05 06:00'],"['2015/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29628 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Dec 1;137(11):2729-38. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29628.

The immunization protocol consisted of two doses of the corresponding poxvirus vector plus two doses of a combination of the poxvirus vector and a purified HIV-1 gp120 protein from clade C. This immunogenicity profile was also compared to that elicited by vaccine regimens consisting of two doses of the ALVAC vector expressing HIV-1 antigens from clades B/E (ALVAC-vCP1521) plus two doses of a combination of ALVAC-vCP1521 and HIV-1 gp120 protein from clades B/E (similar to the RV144 trial regimen) or clade C. The results showed that immunization of macaques with NYVAC-C stimulated at different times more potent HIV-1-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses and induced a trend toward higher-magnitude HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell immune responses than did ALVAC-C. Furthermore, NYVAC-C induced a trend toward higher levels of binding IgG antibodies against clade C HIV-1 gp140, gp120, or murine leukemia virus (MuLV) gp70-scaffolded V1/V2 and toward best cross-clade-binding IgG responses against HIV-1 gp140 from clades A, B, and group M consensus, than did ALVAC-C. Of the linear binding IgG responses, most were directed against the V3 loop in all immunization groups. Additionally, NYVAC-C and ALVAC-C also induced similar levels of HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses. Interestingly, binding IgA antibody levels against HIV-1 gp120 or MuLV gp70-scaffolded V1/V2 were absent or very low in all immunization groups. Overall, these results provide a comprehensive survey of the immunogenicity of NYVAC versus ALVAC expressing HIV-1 antigens in nonhuman primates and indicate that NYVAC may represent an alternative candidate to ALVAC in the development of a future HIV-1 vaccine. IMPORTANCE: The finding of a safe and effective HIV/AIDS vaccine immunogen is one of the main research priorities. Here, we generated two poxvirus-based HIV vaccine candidates (NYVAC and ALVAC vectors) expressing the same clade C HIV-1 antigens in separate vectors, and we analyzed in nonhuman primates their immunogenicity profiles. The results showed that immunization with NYVAC-C induced a trend toward higher HIV-1-specific cellular and humoral immune responses than did ALVAC-C, indicating that this new NYVAC vector could be a novel optimized HIV/AIDS vaccine candidate for human clinical trials.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the geographical variation and the socio-demographic factors associated with childhood leukaemia in Manitoba. METHODS: Information on childhood leukaemia incidence between 1992 and 2008 was obtained from the Canadian Cancer Registry and the socio-demographic characteristics for the area of residence from the 2006 Canadian Census. Bayesian spatial Poisson mixed models were used to describe the geographical variation of childhood leukaemia and to determine the association between childhood leukaemia and socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: The south-eastern part of the province had a higher incidence of childhood leukaemia than other parts of the province. In the age and sex-adjusted Poisson regression models, areas with higher proportions of visible minorities and immigrant residents had higher childhood leukaemia incidence rate ratios. In the saturated Poisson regression model, the childhood leukaemia rates were higher in areas with higher proportions of immigrant residents. Unemployment rates were not a significant factor in leukaemia incidence. CONCLUSION: In Manitoba, areas with higher proportions of immigrants experience higher incidence rates of childhood leukaemia. We have identified geographical areas with higher incidence, which require further study and attention.","['(c) 2015 The Authors.

LIF has been reported to accelerate the primordial to primary follicle transition, the growth of cultured preantral follicles, and the maturation of oocytes. Previous reports on factors that regulate follicular growth have largely employed cultured follicles. However, there are several types of follicles and somatic cells in the ovary that are likely to interact with one another to regulate follicular growth. Therefore, a novel approach is essential for understanding the function of factors that regulate follicular growth in the ovary. In this study, we evaluated the function of LIF using cultured ovarian tissue. Ovarian tissue slices were cultured in the presence or absence of recombinant LIF and neutralizing anti-LIF antibody to enable continuous monitoring of follicular growth within the context of the ovary as well as analysis of the process of follicular growth. The results revealed that LIF inhibited the growth of primary, secondary, and antral follicles. Furthermore, we verified the inhibitory function of LIF using the neutralizing antibody, which accelerated follicular growth. These results suggest that LIF is likely to coordinate follicular growth in the ovary. The culture and analysis methods employed in this study are thus effective for clarifying the tissue-level functions of factors that regulate follicular growth within the ovary.","['(c) 2015 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.']","['Komatsu, Kouji', 'Koya, Tomoko', 'Wang, Jingwen', 'Yamashita, Mamoru', 'Kikkawa, Fumitaka', 'Iwase, Akira']","['Komatsu K', 'Koya T', 'Wang J', 'Yamashita M', 'Kikkawa F', 'Iwase A']","['Laboratory of Bell Research Centre-Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Collaborative Research, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan Bell Research Centre for Reproductive Health and Cancer, Department of Reproduction, Nagoya, Japan komatsu@kishokai.or.jp.', 'Bell Research Centre for Reproductive Health and Cancer, Department of Reproduction, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Bell Research Centre for Reproductive Health and Cancer, Department of Reproduction, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Bell Research Centre for Reproductive Health and Cancer, Department of Reproduction, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Bell Research Centre-Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Collaborative Research, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan Department of Maternal and Perinatal Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan akiwase@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150603,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Ovarian Follicle/*drug effects/growth & development', 'Ovary/*drug effects/growth & development', 'Tissue Culture Techniques']",,,2015/06/05 06:00,2016/04/07 06:00,['2015/06/05 06:00'],"['2015/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['biolreprod.115.128421 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.115.128421 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2015 Jul;93(1):18. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.115.128421.

Biopharmaceutical products such as ErA must be monitored for modifications such as deamidation, typically using ion-exchange chromatography (IEX). Analysis of clinical-grade ErA using native IEX resolves a number of enzymatically-active, acidic variants that were poorly characterised. METHODS: ErA IEX variants were isolated and fully characterised using capillary electrophoresis (cIEF), LC-MS and LC-MS/MS of proteolytic digests, and structural techniques including circular dichroism, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS). RESULTS: LC-MS, MS/MS and cIEF demonstrated that all ErA isolates consist mainly of enzyme lacking primary-sequence modifications (such as deamidation). Both SAXS and IM-MS revealed a different conformational state in the most prominent acidic IEX peak. However, SAXS data also suggested conformational differences between the main peak and major acidic variant were minor, based on comparisons with crystal structures. CONCLUSIONS: IEX data for biopharmaceuticals such as ErA should be thoroughly characterised, as the most common modifications, such as deamidation, may be absent.",,"['Gervais, David', 'King, Darryl', 'Kanda, Patrick', 'Foote, Nicholas', 'Elliott, Lucy', 'Brown, Phillip', 'Lee, Natacha O', 'Thalassinos, Konstantinos', 'Pizzey, Claire', 'Rambo, Robert', 'Minshull, Thomas C', 'Dickman, Mark J', 'Smith, Stuart']","['Gervais D', 'King D', 'Kanda P', 'Foote N', 'Elliott L', 'Brown P', 'Lee NO', 'Thalassinos K', 'Pizzey C', 'Rambo R', 'Minshull TC', 'Dickman MJ', 'Smith S']","['Porton Biopharma Limited, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP4 0JG, UK. dave.gervais@portonbiopharma.com.', 'Porton Biopharma Limited, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP4 0JG, UK.', 'Porton Biopharma Limited, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP4 0JG, UK.', 'Porton Biopharma Limited, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP4 0JG, UK.', 'Porton Biopharma Limited, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP4 0JG, UK.', 'Porton Biopharma Limited, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP4 0JG, UK.', 'Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, Darwin Building Room 101A, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, UK.', 'Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, Darwin Building Room 101A, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, UK.', 'Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, Didcot, Oxfordshire, OX11 0DE, UK.', 'Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, Didcot, Oxfordshire, OX11 0DE, UK.', 'ChELSI Institute, Dept of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin Street, Sheffield, S1 3JD, UK.', 'ChELSI Institute, Dept of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Sheffield, Mappin Street, Sheffield, S1 3JD, UK.', 'Porton Biopharma Limited, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP4 0JG, UK.']",['eng'],"['BB/H013849/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BB/L015382/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BB/M012166/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150604,United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*isolation & purification/standards', 'Asparaginase/*isolation & purification/standards', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/*enzymology', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Protein Conformation', '*Scattering, Small Angle', '*Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,,2015/06/05 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2015/06/05 06:00'],"['2015/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11095-015-1722-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11095-015-1722-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharm Res. 2015 Nov;32(11):3636-48. doi: 10.1007/s11095-015-1722-2.

Heterogeneity of leukaemic cells is determined by mutations which ultimately affect the cell cycle. We have developed and validated a biologically relevant, mathematical model of the cell cycle based on unique cell-cycle signatures, defined by duration of cell-cycle phases and cyclin profiles as determined by flow cytometry, for three leukaemia cell lines. The model was discretized for the different phases in their respective progress variables (cyclins and DNA), resulting in a set of time-dependent ordinary differential equations. Cell-cycle phase distribution and cyclin concentration profiles were validated against population chase experiments. Heterogeneity was simulated in culture by combining the three cell lines in a blinded experimental set-up. Based on individual kinetics, the model was capable of identifying and quantifying cellular heterogeneity. When supplying the initial conditions only, the model predicted future cell population dynamics and estimated the previous heterogeneous composition of cells. Identification of heterogeneous leukaemia clones at diagnosis and post-treatment using such a mathematical platform has the potential to predict multiple future outcomes in response to induction and consolidation chemotherapy as well as relapse kinetics.",['(c) 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

RESULTS: We present a network-oriented and data-driven bioinformatic approach that searches for association of genes and diseases based on the analysis of genome-wide expression data derived from microarrays or RNA-Seq studies. The approach aims to (i) identify gene sets associated to different pathological states analysed together; (ii) identify a minimum subset within these genes that unequivocally differentiates and classifies the compared disease subtypes; (iii) provide a measurement of the discriminant power of these genes and (iv) identify links between the genes that characterise each of the disease subtypes. This bioinformatic approach is implemented in an R package, named geNetClassifier, available as an open access tool in Bioconductor. To illustrate the performance of the tool, we applied it to two independent datasets: 250 samples from patients with four major leukemia subtypes analysed using expression arrays; another leukemia dataset analysed with RNA-Seq that includes a subtype also present in the previous set. The results show the selection of key deregulated genes recently reported in the literature and assigned to the leukemia subtypes studied. We also show, using these independent datasets, the selection of similar genes in a network built for the same disease subtype. CONCLUSIONS: The construction of gene networks related to specific disease subtypes that include parameters such as gene-to-gene association, gene disease specificity and gene discriminant power can be very useful to draw gene-disease maps and to unravel the molecular features that characterize specific pathological states. The application of the bioinformatic tool here presented shows a neat way to achieve such molecular characterization of the diseases using genome-wide expression data.",,"['Aibar, Sara', 'Fontanillo, Celia', 'Droste, Conrad', 'Roson-Burgo, Beatriz', 'Campos-Laborie, Francisco J', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M', 'De Las Rivas, Javier']","['Aibar S', 'Fontanillo C', 'Droste C', 'Roson-Burgo B', 'Campos-Laborie FJ', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'De Las Rivas J']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150526,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA']",PMC4460584,,2015/06/05 06:00,2016/03/30 06:00,['2015/06/05 06:00'],"['2015/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-16-S5-S3 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-16-S5-S3 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Genomics. 2015;16 Suppl 5:S3. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-16-S5-S3.

The activation mechanism of the most commonly occurring mutation, D816V in exon 17 of c-Kit, has been well-studied while other mutations remain fairly uncharacterized in this respect. In this study, we show that the constitutive activity of the exon 11 mutant V560D is weaker than the D816V mutant. Phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins induced by the ligand for c-Kit, stem cell factor, was stronger in c-Kit/V560D expressing cells than in cells expressing c-kit/D816V. Although cells expressing c-Kit/V560D showed increased ligand-independent proliferation and survival compared to wild-type c-Kit-expressing cells, these biological effects were weaker than in c-Kit/D816V-expressing cells. In contrast to cells expressing wild-type c-Kit, cells expressing c-Kit/V560D were independent of Src family kinases for downstream signaling. However, the independence of Src family kinases was not due to a Src-like kinase activity that c-Kit/D816V displayed. Point mutations that selectively block the association of PI3 kinase with c-Kit/V560D inhibited ligand-independent activation of the receptor, while inhibition of the kinase activity of PI3 kinase with pharmacological inhibitors did not affect the kinase activity of the receptor. This suggests a lipid kinase-independent key role of PI3 kinase in c-Kit/V560D-mediated oncogenic signal transduction. Thus, PI3 kinase is an attractive therapeutic target in malignancies induced by c-Kit mutations independent of its lipid kinase activity.",,"['Lindblad, Oscar', 'Kazi, Julhash U', 'Ronnstrand, Lars', 'Sun, Jianmin']","['Lindblad O', 'Kazi JU', 'Ronnstrand L', 'Sun J']","['Division of Translational Cancer Research and Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village 404C3, Scheelevagen 8, 22363, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research and Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village 404C3, Scheelevagen 8, 22363, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research and Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village 404C3, Scheelevagen 8, 22363, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research and Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village 404C3, Scheelevagen 8, 22363, Lund, Sweden. jianmin.sun@med.lu.se.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150604,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0', '(2-(1H-indazol-4-yl)-6-(4-methanesulfonylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-4-morpholin-4-ylth', 'ieno(3,2-d)pyrimidine)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (SU 6656)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,2015/06/05 06:00,2016/04/02 06:00,['2015/06/05 06:00'],"['2015/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00018-015-1944-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00018-015-1944-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2015 Nov;72(22):4399-407. doi: 10.1007/s00018-015-1944-9.

In addition, the in vitro effects of VP-16 on the lymphocytes proliferation, cytotoxic activity and on Th1/Th2 cytokine responses were assessed. In 31 children undergoing allo-HSCT, VP-16 plasma concentrations were determined up to 120 h after the infusion using the HPLC-UV method. For mentioned in vitro studies, VP-16 plasma concentrations observed on allo-HSCT day were used. In 84 % of children, VP-16 plasma concentrations (0.1-1.5 mug/mL) were quantifiable 72 h after the end of the drug infusion, i.e. when allo-HSCT should be performed. In 20 (65 %) children allo-HSCT was performed 4 days after the end of the drug infusion, and VP-16 was still detectable (0.1-0.9 mug/mL) in plasma of 12 (39 %) of them. Post-transplant ALL relapse occurred in four children, in all of them VP-16 was detectable in plasma (0.1-0.8 mug/mL) on allo-HSCT day, while there was no relapse in children with undetectable VP-16. In in vitro studies, VP-16 demonstrated impact on the proliferation activity of stimulated lymphocytes depending on its concentration and exposition time. The presence of VP-16 in plasma on allo-HSCT day may demonstrate an adverse effect on graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) reaction and increase the risk of post-transplant ALL relapse. Therefore, if 72 h after VP-16 administration its plasma concentration is still above 0.1 mug/mL then the postponement of transplantation for next 24 h should be considered to protect GvL effector cells from transplant material.",,"['Sobiak, Joanna', 'Kazimierczak, Urszula', 'Kowalczyk, Dariusz W', 'Chrzanowska, Maria', 'Styczynski, Jan', 'Wysocki, Mariusz', 'Szpecht, Dawid', 'Wachowiak, Jacek']","['Sobiak J', 'Kazimierczak U', 'Kowalczyk DW', 'Chrzanowska M', 'Styczynski J', 'Wysocki M', 'Szpecht D', 'Wachowiak J']","['Department of Physical Pharmacy and Pharmacokinetics, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Swiecickiego 6, 60-781, Poznan, Poland. jsobiak@ump.edu.pl.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Physical Pharmacy and Pharmacokinetics, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Swiecickiego 6, 60-781, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150604,Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Etoposide/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Th1-Th2 Balance/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC4572077,,2015/06/05 06:00,2016/06/21 06:00,['2015/06/05 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00005-015-0343-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00005-015-0343-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2015 Oct;63(5):385-95. doi: 10.1007/s00005-015-0343-0.

We studied the socio-demographic factors that influenced therapy success in a population in the northeast region of Brazil. METHODS: Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia from the state of Piaui were treated in only one reference center. Diagnosis was based on WHO 2008 criteria. Risk was assessed by Sokal, Hasford and EUTOS scores. Patients received 400 mg imatinib daily. We studied the influence of the following factors on the achievement of complete cytogenetic response within one year of treatment: age, clinical risk category, time interval between diagnosis and the start of imatinib treatment, geographic distance from the patient's home to the hospital, years of formal education and monthly income. RESULTS: Among 103 patients studied, the median age was 42 years; 65% of the patients had 2-9 years of formal education, and the median monthly income was approximately 100 US$. Imatinib was started in the first year after diagnosis (early chronic phase) in 69 patients. After 12 months of treatment, 68 patients had a complete cytogenetic response. The Hasford score, delay to start imatinib and years of formal education influenced the attainment of a complete cytogenetic response, whereas income and the distance from the home to the healthcare facility did not.

In addition to its role in cellular acidification, V-ATPase has been implicated in membrane fusion and exocytosis via its Vo domain. Results from the present study show that PRR is expressed in pituitary adenoma cells and regulates growth hormone (GH) release via V-ATPase-induced cellular acidification. Positive PRR immunoreactivity was detected more often in surgically resected, growth hormone-producing adenomas (GHomas) than in nonfunctional pituitary adenomas. GHomas strongly expressing PRR showed excess GH secretion, as evidenced by distinctly high plasma GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels, as well as an elevated nadir GH in response to the oral glucose tolerance test. Suppression of PRR expression in rat GHoma-derived GH3 cells using PRR siRNA resulted in reduced GH secretion and significantly enhanced intracellular GH accumulation. GH3 treatment with bafilomycin A1, a V-ATPase inhibitor, also blocked GH release, indicating mediation via impaired cellular acidification of V-ATPase. PRR knockdown decreased Atp6l, a subunit of the Vo domain that destabilizes V-ATPase assembly, increased intracellular GH, and decreased GH release.

All patients received a myeloablative conditioning consisting of thiotepa, busulfan, fludarabine (n=92) or TBI, fludarabine (n=56). The median age was 47 years (17-74); 47 patients were in first remission (CR1), 37 in second remission (CR2) and 64 had an active disease; all patients were first grafts. The diagnosis was acute leukemia (n=75), myelodisplastic syndrome (n=24), myelofibrosis (n=16), high-grade lymphoma (n=15) and others (n=18). GVHD prophylaxis consisted in PT-CY on days +3 and +5, cyclosporine (from day 0), and mycophenolate (from day +1). The median day for neutrophil engraftment was day +18 (13-32). The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD was 24%, and of grades III-IV GVHD 10%. The incidence of moderate-severe chronic GVHD was 12%. With a median follow-up for the surviving patients of 313 days (100-1162), the cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) is 13%, and the relapse-related death is 23%. The actuarial 22 months overall survival is 77% for CR1 patients, 49% for CR2 patients and 38% for patients grafted in relapse (P<0.001). Major causes of death were relapse (22%), GVHD (2%) and infections (6%).

Its virulence factors include cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene A (VacA) proteins. Cytokine release inducted by H. pylori colonization has an important role in pathogenesis of H. pylori. The severity of gastric pathologies depends on the H. pylori genotypes found in different geographical regions. We aimed to determine the relationship between different H. pylori genotypes and their effects on the cytokine release levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ureC, cagA, vacAs1/s2, vacAm1/m2, and blood group antigen-binding adhesion protein A2 (babA2) virulence related genes were investigated in 21 H. pylori strains. Genotyping of 21 strains were made due to the presence of cagA, vacAs1/s2, vacAm1/m2, and babA2 genes. The H. pylori strains were cultured together with THP-1 and neutrophil-differentiated Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) cells. The levels of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-10 in these cells were measured after co-culturing with H. pylori strains. RESULTS: The following five different genotypes were detected: Genotype1: cagA and vacAs1m2; Genotype2: cagA and vacAs1m1; Genotype3: cagA, vacAs1m2, and babA2; Genotype4: vacAs2m2; and Genotype5: cagA and vacAs2m2. All these genotypes significantly induced the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL 10, and TNF-alpha in THP-1 cells. Genotype 5 caused higher amounts of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10, whereas genotype 1 induced the highest levels of IL-8. In neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells, genotype 4 increased IL-6 levels and genotype 3 and 4 elevated IL-8 levels significantly. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that cytokine response of the host varies depending on the specific immune response of the host against different H. pylori strains.",,"['Caliskan, Reyhan', 'Sayi Yazgan, Ayca', 'Tokman, Hrisi Bahar', 'Sofyali, Emre', 'Erzin, Yusuf Ziya', 'Akgul, Ozer', 'Kurt, Aykut', 'Kalayci, Fatma', 'Ziver, Tevhide', 'Yuksel, Pelin', 'Bal, Kadir', 'Kocazeybek, Bekir']","['Caliskan R', 'Sayi Yazgan A', 'Tokman HB', 'Sofyali E', 'Erzin YZ', 'Akgul O', 'Kurt A', 'Kalayci F', 'Ziver T', 'Yuksel P', 'Bal K', 'Kocazeybek B']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey. bzeybek@istanbul.edu.tr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150602,Turkey,Turk J Gastroenterol,The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology,9515841,"['0 (Adhesins, Bacterial)', '0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (BabA protein, Helicobacter pylori)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (VacA protein, Helicobacter pylori)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', '0 (cagA protein, Helicobacter pylori)']",IM,"['Adhesins, Bacterial', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Bacterial', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', '*Genotype', 'HL-60 Cells/immunology/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Helicobacter pylori/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Virulence Factors']",,,2015/06/04 06:00,2016/03/24 06:00,['2015/06/04 06:00'],"['2015/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5152/tjg.2015.8058 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Gastroenterol. 2015 Jul;26(4):297-303. doi: 10.5152/tjg.2015.8058.

These oncogenic viruses, with the exception of HCV, require the host RNA splicing machinery in order to exercise their oncogenic activities, a strategy that allows the viruses to efficiently export and stabilize viral RNA and to produce spliced RNA isoforms from a bicistronic or polycistronic RNA transcript for efficient protein translation. Infection with a tumor virus affects the expression of host genes, including host RNA splicing factors, which play a key role in regulating viral RNA splicing of oncogene transcripts.

Using saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR and in vitro activity assays, we have identified fragment-sized inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) with distinct chemical scaffolds and mechanisms compared to nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) and nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitors (NRTIs). Three compounds were found to inhibit RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT in the micromolar range while retaining potency against RT variants carrying one of three major NNRTI resistance mutations: K103N, Y181C, or G190A. These compounds also inhibit Moloney murine leukemia virus RT but not the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Steady-state kinetic analyses demonstrate that one of these fragments is a competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 RT with respect to deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) substrate, whereas a second compound is a competitive inhibitor of RT polymerase activity with respect to the DNA template/primer (T/P), and consequently also inhibits RNase H activity. The dNTP competing RT inhibitor retains activity against the NRTI-resistant mutants K65R and M184V, demonstrating a drug resistance profile distinct from the nucleotide competing RT inhibitors indolopyridone-1 (INDOPY-1) and 4-dimethylamino-6-vinylpyrimidine-1 (DAVP-1). In antiviral assays, the T/P competing compound inhibits HIV-1 replication at a step consistent with an RT inhibitor. Screening of additional structurally related compounds to the three fragments led to the discovery of molecules with improved potency against HIV-1 RT.

Substantial interest in XMRV as a potentially new pathogenic human retrovirus was driven by reports that XMRV could be detected in a significant percentage of PC samples, and also in tissues from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). After considerable controversy, etiologic links between XMRV and these two diseases were disproven. XMRV was determined to have arisen during passage of a human PC tumor in immunocompromised nude mice, by activation and recombination between two endogenous murine leukemia viruses from cells of the mouse. The resulting XMRV had a xentropic host range, which allowed it replicate in the human tumor cells in the xenograft. This review describes the discovery of XMRV, and the molecular and virological events leading to its formation, XMRV infection in animal models and biological effects on infected cells. Lessons from XMRV for other searches of viral etiologies of cancer are discussed, as well as cautions for researchers working on human tumors or cell lines that have been passed through nude mice, includingpotential biohazards associated with XMRV or other similar xenotropic murine leukemia viruses (MLVs).",,"['Arias, Maribel', 'Fan, Hung']","['Arias M', 'Fan H']","['Cancer Research Institute and Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California , Irvine, CA 92697-3905, USA.', 'Cancer Research Institute and Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California , Irvine, CA 92697-3905, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA062203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140409,United States,Emerg Microbes Infect,Emerging microbes & infections,101594885,,,,PMC4008767,,2014/04/01 00:00,2014/04/01 00:01,['2015/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/emi.2014.25 [doi]'],ppublish,Emerg Microbes Infect. 2014 Apr;3(4):e. doi: 10.1038/emi.2014.25.

We previously reported that continuous hepatocyte apoptosis drives liver tumors in hepatocyte-specific Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 knockout mice. In this study, we further examine the underlying cellular mechanisms of generating tumors in apoptosis-prone liver. In cultured hepatocytes, the administration of ABT-737, a Bcl-xL/-2/-w inhibitor, led to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as activation of caspases. Mitochondria isolated from murine liver, upon administration of truncated-Bid, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, released cytochrome c and produced ROS, which was dependent on mitochondrial respiration. Hepatic apoptosis, regeneration, accumulation of oxidative damages, and tumorigenesis observed in hepatocyte-specific Mcl-1 knockout mice were substantially attenuated by further deficiency of Bax or Bid, suggesting that a balance of mitochondrial Bcl-2 family proteins governs generation of oxidative stress and other pathologies. Whole-exome sequencing clarified that C>A/G>T transversion, which is often caused by oxidative DNA damage in proliferating cells, was a frequently observed mutation pattern in liver tumors of Mcl-1 knockout mice. The administration of antioxidant L-N-acetylcysteine did not affect apoptosis, compensatory regeneration, or fibrotic responses but significantly reduced oxidative DNA damage and incidence and multiplicity of live tumors in Mcl-1 knockout mice. In conclusion, activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in hepatocytes accumulates intracellular oxidative damages, leading to liver tumorigenesis, independently of liver regeneration or fibrosis. This study supports a concept that antioxidant therapy may be useful for suppressing liver carcinogenesis in patients with chronic liver disease.",['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Hikita, Hayato', 'Kodama, Takahiro', 'Tanaka, Satoshi', 'Saito, Yoshinobu', 'Nozaki, Yasutoshi', 'Nakabori, Tasuku', 'Shimizu, Satoshi', 'Hayashi, Yoshito', 'Li, Wei', 'Shigekawa, Minoru', 'Sakamori, Ryotaro', 'Miyagi, Takuya', 'Hiramatsu, Naoki', 'Tatsumi, Tomohide', 'Takehara, Tetsuo']","['Hikita H', 'Kodama T', 'Tanaka S', 'Saito Y', 'Nozaki Y', 'Nakabori T', 'Shimizu S', 'Hayashi Y', 'Li W', 'Shigekawa M', 'Sakamori R', 'Miyagi T', 'Hiramatsu N', 'Tatsumi T', 'Takehara T']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan. takehara@gh.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150602,United States,Cancer Prev Res (Phila),"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101479409,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Bid protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/physiology', 'Carcinogenesis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/physiology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/physiology']",,,2015/06/04 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2015/06/04 06:00'],"['2015/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1940-6207.CAPR-15-0022-T [pii]', '10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-15-0022-T [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2015 Aug;8(8):693-701. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-15-0022-T.

Herein, we aim to determine whether digital expression profiling could detect chromosomal translocations in FFPE leukemic samples identified by RT-PCR, FISH, and/or karyotyping. METHODS: RNA was extracted from 28 FFPE bone marrow specimens from 19 patients diagnosed with leukemia. Eight patients were translocation t(9;22) positive, three inv(16)/t(16/16) positive, five translocation t(15;17) positive, and one translocation t(8;21) positive. Two patients (four specimens) were normal. The extracted RNA was hybridized to DNA reporter probes overnight at 65 degrees C, followed by purification of the labeled translocations. Six hundred fields of view were counted to enumerate the number of translocations. RESULTS: Digital expression profiling had 100% concordance with RT-PCR, FISH, or karyotyping analysis in the two normal individuals, eight translocation t(9;22) samples, five translocation t(15;17) samples, and one translocation t(8;21) sample. None of the inv(16) positive samples were detected. Digital expression profiling detected translocations with 0.014 p190 allelic burden. CONCLUSION: Digital expression profiling can be used to measure translocation t(9;22), t(15;17), and t(8;21) in FFPE samples and is useful when a confirmatory test from a FFPE sample is necessary.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Liew, M', 'Mao, R', 'Wittwer, C T', 'Salama, M E']","['Liew M', 'Mao R', 'Wittwer CT', 'Salama ME']","['ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150603,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,2015/06/04 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2015/06/04 06:00'],"['2014/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12388 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2015 Oct;37(5):690-8. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12388.

Strides have been made in both human and canine leukemia to improve classification and understanding of pathogenesis through immunophenotyping, yet classification and choosing appropriate therapy remains challenging. In this study, we assessed 123 cases of canine leukemia (28 ALLs, 24 AMLs, 25 B-CLLs, and 46 T-CLLs) using high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (oaCGH) to detect DNA copy number alterations (CNAs). For the first time, such data were used to identify recurrent CNAs and inclusive genes that may be potential drivers of subtype-specific pathogenesis. We performed predictive modeling to identify CNAs that could reliably differentiate acute subtypes (ALL vs. AML) and chronic subtypes (B-CLL vs. T-CLL) and used this model to differentiate cases with up to 83.3 and 95.8 % precision, respectively, based on CNAs at only one to three genomic regions. In addition, CGH datasets for canine and human leukemia were compared to reveal evolutionarily conserved copy number changes between species, including the shared gain of HSA 21q in ALL and approximately 25 Mb of shared gain of HSA 12 and loss of HSA 13q14 in CLL. These findings support the use of canine leukemia as a relevant in vivo model for human leukemia and justify the need to further explore the conserved genomic regions of interest for their clinical impact.",,"['Roode, Sarah C', 'Rotroff, Daniel', 'Avery, Anne C', 'Suter, Steven E', 'Bienzle, Dorothee', 'Schiffman, Joshua D', 'Motsinger-Reif, Alison', 'Breen, Matthew']","['Roode SC', 'Rotroff D', 'Avery AC', 'Suter SE', 'Bienzle D', 'Schiffman JD', 'Motsinger-Reif A', 'Breen M']","['Department of Molecular Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, 1060 William Moore Drive, Raleigh, NC, 27607, USA.', 'Bioinformatics Research Center, Department of Statistics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Cancer Genetics Program, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pathobiology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', ""Department of Oncological Sciences, Center for Children's Cancer Research, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA."", 'Bioinformatics Research Center, Department of Statistics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, 1060 William Moore Drive, Raleigh, NC, 27607, USA.

Due to theoretical advantages, idarubicin (IDA) might be the most effective and tolerable anthracycline. However, there is no evidence that would definitively prove the superiority of IDA over other anthracyclines. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of IDA versus other anthracyclines in induction therapy of newly diagnosed AML. SEARCH METHODS: We identified relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (from 1946 to 3 August 2014), EMBASE (from 1974 to 3 August 2014), Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (1978 to 3 August 2014), relevant conference proceedings and databases of ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs that compared IDA with other anthracyclines in induction therapy of newly diagnosed AML. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of studies according to methodological standards of the Cochrane Collaboration. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event data outcomes using the inverse variance method, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data outcomes using the Mantel-Haenszel method. We adopted a fixed-effect model and repeated the main meta-analysis by a random-effects model in a sensitivity analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 2017 references. Ultimately, 27 RCTs (including 22 two-armed RCTs and five three-armed RCTs) involving 9549 patients were eligible. The consolidation treatments adopted in the studies were comparable and had no impact on the results. Overall, the risk of bias of the studies was unclear to high.Eighteen RCTs (N = 6755) assessed IDA versus daunorubicin (DNR). The main meta-analyses showed that IDA compared with DNR prolonged overall survival (OS) (12 studies, 5976 patients; HR 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 0.96, P = 0.0008; high quality of evidence) and disease-free survival (DFS) (eight studies, 3070 patients; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96, P = 0.004; moderate quality of evidence), increased complete remission (CR) rate (18 studies, 6692 patients; RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.07, P = 0.009; moderate quality of evidence), and reduced relapse rate (four studies, 1091 patients; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, P = 0.02; moderate quality of evidence), although increased the risks of death on induction therapy (14 studies, 6349 patients; RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.36, P = 0.03; moderate quality of evidence) and grade 3/4 mucositis (five studies, 2000 patients; RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.44, P = 0.02; moderate quality of evidence). There was no evidence for difference in the risks of grade 3/4 cardiac toxicity (six studies, 2795 patients; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.37, P = 0.91; moderate quality of evidence) and other grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs). None of the studies reported on quality of life (QoL).Eight RCTs (N = 2419) evaluated IDA versus mitoxantrone (MIT). The main meta-analyses showed that there was no evidence for difference between arms in OS (six studies, 2171 patients; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.08, P = 0.69; high quality of evidence), DFS (four studies, 249 patients; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.10, P = 0.26; low quality of evidence), CR rate (eight studies, 2411 patients; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.03, P = 0.32;moderate quality of evidence), the risks of death on induction therapy (five studies, 2055 patients; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.38, P = 0.39; moderate quality of evidence) and relapse (three studies, 328 patients; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22, P = 0.89; moderate quality of evidence). There was no evidence for difference in the risks of grade 3/4 cardiac toxicity (one study, 160 patients; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.88, P = 0.65; low quality of evidence) and other grade 3/4 AEs. None of the studies reported on QoL.Two RCTs (N = 211) compared IDA with doxorubicin (DOX). Neither study assessed OS. One study showed that there was no evidence for difference in DFS (63 patients; HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.14, P = 0.12; low quality of evidence). The main meta-analysis for CR rate showed an improved CR rate with IDA (two studies, 187 patients; RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.59, P = 0.02; low quality of evidence). Neither study provided data for the risks of death on induction therapy and relapse. One trial showed that there was no evidence for difference in the risk of grade 3/4 cardiac toxicity (one study, 100 patients; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.39, P = 0.47; very low quality of evidence). Neither study reported on QoL.Two RCTs (N = 1037) evaluated IDA versus zorubicin (ZRB). Neither study assessed OS. One trial showed that there was no evidence for difference in DFS (one study, 155 patients; HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.88, P = 0.29; low quality of evidence). The main meta-analyses for CR and death on induction therapy both showed that there was no evidence for difference (CR rate: two studies, 964 patients; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.13, P = 0.31; low quality of evidence. risk of death on induction therapy: two studies, 964 patients; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.13, P = 0.17; moderate quality of evidence). Neither study reported the risks of relapse and grade 3/4 cardiotoxicity. One trial showed that IDA reduced the risk of grade 3/4 mucositis. Neither study reported on QoL. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Compared with DNR in induction therapy of newly diagnosed AML, IDA prolongs OS and DFS, increases CR rate and reduces relapse rate, although increases the risks of death on induction therapy and grade 3/4 mucositis. The currently available evidence does not show any difference between IDA and MIT used in induction therapy of newly diagnosed AML. There is insufficient evidence regarding IDA versus DOX and IDA versus ZRB to make final conclusions. Additionally, there is no evidence for difference on the effect of IDA compared with DNR, MIT, DOX or ZRB on QoL.",,"['Li, Xi', 'Xu, ShuangNian', 'Tan, Ya', 'Chen, JiePing']","['Li X', 'Xu S', 'Tan Y', 'Chen J']","['Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, 38 Gao Tanyan Street, Chongqing, China, 400038.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20150603,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'V25F9362OP (zorubicin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,2015/06/04 06:00,2016/02/11 06:00,['2015/06/04 06:00'],"['2015/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD010432.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015 Jun 3;(6):CD010432. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD010432.pub2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These immune checkpoints are hijacked by tumors to promote dysfunction of anti-tumor effector cells and consequently of tumor escape from the host immune system. AREAS COVERED: Programmed death-1/programmed death ligand (PD-1/PDL-1), a checkpoint pathway, has been extensively investigated in leukemia mouse models. Expression of PD-1 on the surface of activated immune cells and of its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, on leukemic blasts has been documented. Clinical trials with PD-1 inhibitors in patients with hematological malignancies are ongoing with promising clinical responses. EXPERT OPINION: Therapy of hematological cancers with antibodies blocking inhibitory receptors is expected to be highly clinically effective. Checkpoint inhibitory receptors and their ligands are co-expressed on hematopoietic cells found in the leukemic milieu. Several distinct immunological mechanisms are likely to be engaged by antibody-based checkpoint blockade. Co-expression of multiple inhibitory receptors on hematopoietic cells offers an opportunity for combining blocking antibodies to achieve more effective therapy. Up-regulation of receptor/ligand expression in the leukemic milieu may provide a blood marker predictive of response. Finally, chemotherapy-induced up-regulation of PD-1 on T cells after conventional leukemia therapy creates a solid rationale for application of checkpoint blockade as a follow-up therapy.",,"['Sehgal, Alison', 'Whiteside, Theresa L', 'Boyiadzis, Michael']","['Sehgal A', 'Whiteside TL', 'Boyiadzis M']","['University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology , 5150 Centre Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 , USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA168628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0ICA168628/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20150603,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'B7-H1 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Genes, cdc/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Escape/drug effects/immunology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology']",PMC4778424,['NIHMS723950'],2015/06/04 06:00,2016/02/11 06:00,['2015/06/04 06:00'],"['2015/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2015.1051028 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2015;15(8):1191-203. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2015.1051028.

The aim of our study was to investigate the functional role of both miR-101 and MCL-1 in the sensitivity of human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to paclitaxel. We found that the expression of miR-101 was strongly decreased in triple-negative breast cancer tissues and cell lines. The expression of miR-101 was not associated with clinical stage or lymph node infiltration in TNBC. Ectopic overexpression of miR-101 inhibit growth and induced apoptosis in vitro and suppressed tumorigenicity in vivo. MCL-1 was significantly overexpressed in most of the TNBC tissues and cell lines. Luciferase assay results confirmed MCL-1 as a direct target gene of miR-101. MiR-101 inhibited MCL-1 expression in TNBC cells and transplanted tumors. There was a negative correlation between the level of expression of miR-101 and MCL-1 in TNBC tissues. Suppression of MCL-1 enhanced the sensitivity of MDA-MB-435 cells to paclitaxel. Furthermore, miR-101 increased paclitaxel sensitivity by inhibiting MCL-1 expression.

Because the conditioning regimen of busulfan plus cyclophosphamide carries significant risks of toxicity, we evaluated the factors affecting survival after fludarabine replacement instead of cyclophosphamide. METHODS: The study included 55 patients who underwent allo-HSCT for AML and received busulfan, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin (ATG). RESULTS: Forty-eight patients received a myeloablative regimen; 7 patients received a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. The neutrophil and platelet engraftment times were 12 days (range 9 to 20) and 12 days (range 7 to 19), respectively. Graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) developed in 10% and 50% of the patients, respectively. Seven patients received donor lymphocyte infusion. Of them, 5 patients developed grade I or II GvHD, one grade IV GvHD. The median follow-up period was 20.6 months. The predicted progression-free survival (PFS) at 1 and 3 years after transplantation was 78% and 74%, respectively. The overall survival (OS) at 1, 3, and 5 years was 76%, 74%, and 62%, respectively. Treatment-related mortality (infection in 1 patient, GvHD in 2 patients) occurred in 3 patients (5.5%). Multivariate analysis revealed that OS and PFS were not influenced by age, dose of busulfan or ATG, or presence of cytomegalovirus antigenemia. Acute GvHD and pretransplantation minimal residual disease positivity negatively affected the transplant outcome. The presence of active disease at the time of transplantation was found as an independent risk factor for AML. CONCLUSIONS: Busulfan- and fludarabine-based conditioning regimens are effective for AML, and have acceptable toxicity, morbidity, and mortality.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

By global microRNA profiling of CLL cells stimulated or not stimulated by anti-IgM, significant up-regulation of microRNAs from the miR-132~212 cluster was observed both in IGHV gene unmutated (UM) and mutated (M) CLL cells. Parallel gene expression profiling identified SIRT1, a deacetylase targeting several proteins including TP53, among the top-ranked miR-132 target genes down-regulated upon anti-IgM exposure. The direct regulation of SIRT1 expression by miR-132 was demonstrated using luciferase assays. The reduction of SIRT1 mRNA and protein (P = 0.001) upon anti-IgM stimulation was associated with an increase in TP53 acetylation (P = 0.007), and the parallel up-regulation of the TP53 target gene CDKN1A. Consistently, miR-132 transfections of CLL-like cells resulted in down-regulation of SIRT1 and an induction of a TP53-dependent apoptosis.

In light of this association screening for cancer has been proposed in patients with primary VTE to identify an undiagnosed malignancy. METHOD: Descriptive, retrospective record review that includes 3244 patients from VA San Juan Caribbean system with diagnosis of lung (small and non-small cell), prostate, colon, rectum, liver, stomach, esophagus, pancreas and breast cancer, lymphoma or leukemia from 2005 to 2010 evaluated for primary VTE during five years prior to their malignancy diagnosis. Secondary outcomes evaluated were age and staging at the time of VTE diagnosis. The inclusion criteria were veterans with age 21 years old or more and with diagnosis of the above mentioned malignancies. The exclusion criteria were pregnancy five years to the diagnosis of malignancy, history of coagulopathy or use of anticoagulation at moment of the diagnosis of malignancy. RESULTS: 3244 records were reviewed. From the 2858 that met the inclusion criteria 22 (8%) had history of VTE five years before their malignancy, most of them (14%) with diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy. After we studied VTE by site of malignancy: 7% of pancreatic, 0.8% of prostate, 0.5% of colon, 0.6% of bladder, 0.8% of liver, 0.4% of lung, 1.1% of rectal cancer patients but none with leukemia, stomach, esophagus, breast cancer had VTE. Regarding patients with advanced metastatic cancer at the moment of their diagnosis, only 13% had a prior event of VTE. CONCLUSION: Although at this point there is no clear indication to screen for malignancy in patients presenting primary VTE our results point out an increased number of VTE in patients with subsequent pancreatic cancer.

Heterogeneous melanoma populations characterized by long-term growth and a high self-renewal capacity can be obtained in vitro in EGF(+)bFGF(+) medium whilst invasive potential of melanoma cells is increased in serum-containing cultures. In the present study, we have shown that originally these patient-derived melanoma populations exhibit variable expression of pro-survival genes from the BCL-2 family and inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), and differ in the baseline MCL-1 transcript stability as well. While being transferred to serum-containing medium, melanoma cells are well protected from death. Immediate adaptive response of melanoma cells selectively involves a temporary MCL-1 increase, both at mRNA and protein levels, and BCL-XL can complement MCL-1, especially in MITFlow populations. Thus, the extent of MCL-1 and BCL-XL contributions seems to be cell context-dependent. An increase in MCL-1 level results from a transiently enhanced stability of its transcript, but not from altered protein turnover. Inhibition of MCL-1 preceding transfer to serum-containing medium caused the induction of cell death in a subset of melanoma cells, which confirms the involvement of MCL-1 in melanoma cell survival during the rapid alteration of growth conditions. Additionally, immediate response to serum involves the transient increase in MITF expression and inhibition of ERK-1/2 activity.

We investigated the cytotoxic effects of miltirone toward sensitive and multidrug-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Miltirone inhibited multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 cells better than drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM wild-type cells, a phenomenon termed collateral sensitivity. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that miltirone induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, miltirone stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) disruption, which in turn induced DNA damage and activation of caspases and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Downregulation of CCNB1 (cyclin B1) and CDC2 mRNA and upregulation of CDKN1A (p21) mRNA were in accord with miltirone-induced G2/M arrest. Moreover, miltirone decreased cell adherence to fibronectin. Molecular docking revealed that miltirone bound to the ATP-binding site of IKK-beta. In conclusion, miltirone was collateral sensitive in multidrug-resistant P-gp-overexpressing cells, induced G2/M arrest, and triggered apoptosis via ROS-generated breakdown of MMP and DNA damage.

Although the drug possesses striking antitumor activities in vitro against human cancer cells and in vitro and in vivo against animal tumors, it also induces precancerous lesions in rat colon. Therefore, we tested the in vitro effect of orlistat on the expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a DNA repair enzyme that plays an essential role in the control of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Western blot analysis demonstrated that 2-day continuous exposure to 40 microM orlistat did not affect MGMT levels in a human melanoma cell line, but downregulated the repair protein by 30-70% in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in two leukemia and two colon cancer cell lines. On the other hand, orlistat did not alter noticeably MGMT mRNA expression. Differently from lomeguatrib (a false substrate, strong inhibitor of MGMT) orlistat did not reduce substantially MGMT function after 2-h exposure of target cells to the agent, suggesting that this drug is not a competitive inhibitor of the repair protein. Combined treatment with orlistat and lomeguatrib showed additive reduction of MGMT levels. More importantly, orlistat-mediated downregulation of MGMT protein expression was markedly amplified when the drug was combined with a DNA methylating agent endowed with carcinogenic properties such as temozolomide. In conclusion, even if orlistat is scarcely absorbed by oral route, it is possible that this drug could reduce local MGMT-mediated protection against DNA damage provoked by DNA methylating compounds on gastrointestinal tract epithelial cells, thus favoring chemical carcinogenesis.",,"['Cioccoloni, Giorgia', 'Bonmassar, Laura', 'Pagani, Elena', 'Caporali, Simona', 'Fuggetta, Maria Pia', 'Bonmassar, Enzo', ""D'Atri, Stefania"", 'Aquino, Angelo']","['Cioccoloni G', 'Bonmassar L', 'Pagani E', 'Caporali S', 'Fuggetta MP', 'Bonmassar E', ""D'Atri S"", 'Aquino A']","[""Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome 'Tor Vergata', I-00133 Rome, Italy."", ""Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata-IRCCS, I-00167 Rome, Italy."", ""Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata-IRCCS, I-00167 Rome, Italy."", ""Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata-IRCCS, I-00167 Rome, Italy."", 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology (IFT), National Research Council (CNR), I-00133 Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology (IFT), National Research Council (CNR), I-00133 Rome, Italy.', ""Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata-IRCCS, I-00167 Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome 'Tor Vergata', I-00133 Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150529,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '95M8R751W8 (Orlistat)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (MGMT protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)', 'S79265T71M (lomeguatrib)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Modification Methylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dacarbazine/analogs & derivatives', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics', 'Orlistat', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Temozolomide', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2015/06/03 06:00,2016/05/25 06:00,['2015/06/03 06:00'],"['2015/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2015.3025 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2015 Aug;47(2):764-72. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2015.3025.

Although approved for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, it is still under investigation for different solid tumors including pancreatic cancer. The objective of this study was to analyze how RA affects pancreatic cancer stem cells and how its combination with chemotherapy could impact cell growth. METHODS: Using different pancreatic cancer cell lines, we evaluated the effect of RA alone or in combination with chemotherapy regulating cancer stem cells properties and pathways. RESULTS: Retinoic acid treatment reduces the expression of pancreatic stem cell markers CD24, CD44, CD133, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 but not c-Met. Although gemcitabine treatment increases the expression of some of these markers especially CD44 when it is combined with RA, a notable reduction in all of them is observed. Retinoic acid induces a G0/G1 arrest and combined with gemcitabine increases the apoptotic effect produced by chemotherapy probably as a consequence of a regulation of specific stem cell transcription factors.

METHODS: Questionnaire measures of HRQoL and psychometric assessments were completed by 110 children on 3 occasions over 24 months. Of these 110, 72 were within 3 years of diagnosis of a cerebellar tumor (37 standard-risk medulloblastoma, 35 low-grade cerebellar astrocytoma), and 38 were in a nontumor group. HRQoL, executive function, health status, and behavioral difficulties were also assessed by parents and teachers as appropriate. Regression modeling was used to relate HRQoL z scores to age, sex, socioeconomic status, and 5 domains of functioning: Cognition, Emotion, Social, Motor and Sensory, and Behavior. RESULTS: HRQoL z scores were significantly lower after astrocytoma than those in the nontumor group and significantly lower again in the medulloblastoma group, both by self-report and by parent-report. In regression modeling, significant child-related predictors of poorer HRQoL z scores by self-report were poorer cognitive and emotional function (both z scores) and greater age (years) at enrollment (B = 0.038, 0.098, 0.136, respectively). By parent-report, poorer cognitive, emotional and motor or sensory function (z score) were predictive of lower subsequent HRQoL of the child (B = 0.043, 0.112, 0.019, respectively), while age at enrollment was not.

This hypothesis is based on the higher prevalence of TT Virus infection in patients with leukemia compared with controls. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of TT Virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infections in patients with leukemia and healthy controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this cross sectional study, 95 patients with leukemia and 100 healthy controls who were admitted to the Namazi Hospital affiliated to the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, were enrolled between years 2012 and 2013. Blood samples treated with EDTA were collected from each patient with leukemia and controls. The existence of TT Virus infection was analyzed using the semi-nested PCR method. The immunological prevalence of HBV and HCV infections were evaluated using HBs-Ag and HCV-Ab ELISA based protocols, respectively. Active CMV infection was also evaluated using an immunofluorescence method. Also risk factors of leukemia and viral infections were statistically analyzed in patients with leukemia. RESULTS: The TT Virus infection was significantly found in 40 of 95 (42.1%) and 12 of 100 (12%) patients with leukemia and controls, respectively. The HBs-Ag and HCV-Ab were detected in 27 of 95 (28.4%) and 18 of 69 (26.1%) patients with leukemia but were not found in the controls.

Genomic microarray techniques detect recurrent copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) in addition to copy number aberrations. However, the clinical utility has not been fully established. Therefore, in the current study, the authors examined the prognostic impact of acquired cnLOH in patients with AML, including complete remission (CR) rate, duration of CR, and overall survival (OS). METHODS: A total of 112 consecutive patients with AML who were undergoing chromosome genomic array testing (CGAT) at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance were included in the current study. DNA from the bone marrow or blood was analyzed with a microarray platform with both single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes and non-SNP probes to identify acquired cnLOH. Results were correlated with cytogenetic, molecular, immunophenotypic, and other clinicopathological findings. RESULTS: Patients with cnLOH demonstrated a shorter duration of CR (hazard ratio, 1.87; P =.04) and worse OS (HR, 1.82; P = .03). Multivariate analyses confirmed the independent predictive value of cnLOH for early disease recurrence (P =.02). These results largely reflected those in patients with intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetics. Most strikingly, 13q cnLOH was found to demonstrate a 6.64-fold higher rate of disease recurrence (P =.006) and 3.45-fold worse OS (P = .02) and was enriched with the FLT3-ITD (Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication) mutation. CONCLUSIONS: CnLOH has important prognostic significance in patients with AML. CGAT can replace imbalance fluorescence in situ hybridization and the authors recommend the routine use of CGAT to detect cnLOH, particularly among patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics.",['(c) 2015 American Cancer Society.'],"['Gronseth, Christine M', 'McElhone, Scott E', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Kroeger, Kathleen A', 'Sandhu, Vicky', 'Fero, Matthew L', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Fang, Min']","['Gronseth CM', 'McElhone SE', 'Storer BE', 'Kroeger KA', 'Sandhu V', 'Fero ML', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Estey EH', 'Fang M']","['Cytogenetics Department, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'Cytogenetics Department, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Statistics Department, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Cytogenetics Department, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150529,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/06/03 06:00,2015/11/05 06:00,['2015/06/03 06:00'],"['2015/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29475 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Sep 1;121(17):2900-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29475.

METHODS: A population-based surveillance on Candida BSI was conducted from May 2010 to April 2011 in 29 Spanish hospitals. Antifungal susceptibility testing (EUCAST methodology) was centrally performed. The characteristics and outcome of C. tropicalis BSI episodes were compared with those due to other species. RESULTS: Fifty-nine out of 752 episodes (7.8%) were due to C. tropicalis (annual incidence: 0.62 cases per 100,000 population). Resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole was found in 23.2% and 26.8% of isolates. Breakthrough BSI occurred in 10.5% of episodes. Risk factors for C. tropicalis BSI were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.01; P-value = 0.05), underlying leukaemia (OR: 4.77; P-value = 0.001) and chronic lung disease (OR: 2.62; P-value = 0.002). There were no differences in clinical failure (persistent BSI for >/=72 h after initiation of therapy and/or 30-day all-cause mortality) between C. tropicalis (39.6%) and non-C. tropicalis groups (45.6%). The appropriateness of antifungal therapy or the fluconazole MIC values had no significant impact on outcome, whereas early central venous catheter removal exerted a protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: C. tropicalis BSI was associated with advanced age, haematological malignancy and respiratory comorbidity. We found no correlation between the unexpectedly high resistance rate to azoles observed and outcome.","['Copyright (c) 2015 The British Infection Association.

However, the comparable rates of 6-MP myelotoxicity, but rarity of TPMT variants, in Asians suggest that major determinants have yet to be discovered in this population. We genotyped 92 Japanese paediatric ALL patients for NUDT15 rs116855232, a 6-MP toxicity-related locus discovered in Asians. Logistic regression and survival analysis were used to evaluate its association with leucopenia, hepatotoxicity, 6-MP dose reduction, therapy interruption and event-free survival. The allele frequency of rs116855232 was 0.16, and leucopenia was more common in carriers of the T allele (odds ratio, 7.20; 95% confidence interval, 2.49-20.80; P = 2.7 x 10(-4) ). As leucopenia results in 6-MP dose reduction, we observed average doses during maintenance therapy of 40.7, 29.3 and 8.8 mg/m(2) for patients with CC, CT and TT genotypes, respectively (P < 0.001). Hepatotoxicity was observed only in CC genotype patients. Event-free survival did not significantly differ by NUDT15 genotype. rs116855232 is an important determinant of 6-MP myelotoxicity in Japanese children with ALL and may represent the most robust toxicity-related locus in Asians to date.

We hypothesized that CBD may decrease GVHD incidence and severity after alloHCT. We conducted a phase II study. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and a short course of methotrexate. Patients transplanted from an unrelated donor were given low-dose anti-T cell globulin. CBD 300 mg/day was given orally starting 7 days before transplantation until day 30. Forty-eight consecutive adult patients undergoing alloHCT were enrolled. Thirty-eight patients (79%) had acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and 35 patients (73%) were given myeloablative conditioning. The donor was either an HLA-identical sibling (n = 28), a 10/10 matched unrelated donor (n = 16), or a 1-antigen-mismatched unrelated donor (n = 4). The median follow-up was 16 months (range, 7 to 23). No grades 3 to 4 toxicities were attributed to CBD. None of the patients developed acute GVHD while consuming CBD. In an intention-to-treat analysis, we found that the cumulative incidence rates of grades II to IV and grades III to IV acute GVHD by day 100 were 12.1% and 5%, respectively. Compared with 101 historical control subjects given standard GVHD prophylaxis, the hazard ratio of developing grades II to IV acute GVHD among subjects treated with CBD plus standard GVHD prophylaxis was .3 (P = .0002). Rates of nonrelapse mortality at 100 days and at 1 year after transplantation were 8.6% and 13.4%, respectively. Among patients surviving more than 100 days, the cumulative incidences of moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD at 12 and 18 months were 20% and 33%, respectively. The combination of CBD with standard GVHD prophylaxis is a safe and promising strategy to reduce the incidence of acute GVHD. A randomized double-blind controlled study is warranted.

Study endpoints included hematopoietic recovery, graft failure, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, and mortality. TAC+MTX was used more frequently in older patients and, in recent years, in both SIB and URD groups. In multivariate analysis, TAC+MTX was associated with a lower risk of mortality in URD recipients and with slightly earlier absolute neutrophil count recovery in SIB recipients. Other outcomes did not differ statistically between the 2 regimens. No firm conclusions were reached regarding the relative merits of TAC+MTX versus CSP+MTX after hematopoietic cell transplantation for acquired aplastic anemia.

The hallmark of cancer treatment has been conventional chemotherapy. Chemotherapeutic drugs are designed to target not only rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, but also certain normal cells, such as intestinal epithelium. Over the past several years, a new generation of cancer treatment has come to the forefront, i.e, targeted cancer therapies. Like conventional chemotherapy, targeted cancer therapies use pharmacological agents that inhibit growth, increase cell death and restrict the spread of cancer. As the name suggests, targeted therapies interfere with specific proteins involved in tumorigenesis. Rather than using broad base cancer treatments, focusing on specific molecular changes which are unique to a particular cancer, targeted cancer therapies may be more therapeutically beneficial for many cancer types, including lung, colorectal, breast, lymphoma and leukemia. Moreover, recent advances have made it possible to analyze and tailor treatments to an individual patient's tumor. There are three main types of targeted cancer therapies; 1) monoclonal antibodies, 2) small molecule inhibitors and 3) immunotoxins.

This paper looks at the association between maternal use of systemic antibacterial medications during pregnancy and childhood cancer risk in the offspring using the prospective data on medication. METHODS: A population-based follow-up study was carried out using Danish and Swedish register data. Exposure was maternal redemption of a prescription for a systemic antibacterial in the 3 months prior to pregnancy and during pregnancy (exposure window) documented in the national prescription registers, and offspring were followed up from birth to a cancer diagnosis, death, emigration, day before 15th birthday or end of follow-up, whichever came first. Timing, dosage, specific medication types and types of childhood cancer were also considered. RESULTS: Mothers of 35.1% (n = 506,194) of the children filled at least one prescription for systemic antibacterials during the exposure window. Exposed children had a hazard ratio of 1.08 (95% confidence interval: 0.97, 1.20) compared with unexposed children. Statistically significant results were found for some specific medications (for example, 'other antibacterials'/Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code J01X) and combinations of cancer types and specific medications (leukaemia and other antibacterials, and hepatic cancers and tetracyclines). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that most antibacterial drugs used during pregnancy were not related to childhood cancer risk in the offspring. However, some may be associated with the development of some specific types of childhood cancers. Our findings need to be replicated in an independent data source.","['Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Momen, Natalie C', 'Olsen, Jorn', 'Gissler, Mika', 'Kieler, Helle', 'Haglund, Bengt', 'Li, Jiong']","['Momen NC', 'Olsen J', 'Gissler M', 'Kieler H', 'Haglund B', 'Li J']","['Section for Epidemiology, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Denmark.', 'Section for Epidemiology, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'THL National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Nordic School of Public Health NHV, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Section for Epidemiology, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150529,England,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,9208369,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/06/03 06:00,2016/05/05 06:00,['2015/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pds.3806 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2015 Aug;24(8):821-9. doi: 10.1002/pds.3806.

Previous studies imply a possibility that a transcriptional factor Pax6, a key player of brain and sensory organ development, could be involved in spermatogenesis, but neither expression nor function of Pax6 in the adult testis has been examined yet. In the present study, we described for the first time Pax6 expression dynamics in the adult mouse testis. Using cell-type-specific markers, the expression of Pax6 was detected in 67.0% of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (Plzf)-positive type A spermatogonia. The expression of Pax6 was also observed in p63-positive spermatocytes and round spermatids. We did not detect any expression of Pax6 in Sox9-positive Sertoli cells or in elongated spermatids and mature sperm. High-resolution analyses revealed that Pax6 formed a single dot-like structure during mid-phase of the pachytene spermatocyte. This dot-like structure co-localized with gammaH2A.X demarcating XY body, a domain in which X and Y chromosomes are silenced and compartmentalized.

We investigated the antileukemia efficacy of a novel peptidic CXCR4 antagonist, LY2510924, in preclinical models of AML. LY2510924 rapidly and durably blocked surface CXCR4 and inhibited stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)alpha-induced chemotaxis and prosurvival signals of AML cells at nanomolar concentrations more effectively than the small-molecule CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. In vitro, LY2510924 chiefly inhibited the proliferation of AML cells with little induction of cell death and reduced protection against chemotherapy by stromal cells. In mice with established AML, LY2510924 caused initial mobilization of leukemic cells into the circulation followed by reduction in total tumor burden. LY2510924 had antileukemia effects as monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy. Gene expression profiling of AML cells isolated from LY2510924-treated mice demonstrated changes consistent with loss of SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 signaling and suggested reduced proliferation and induction of differentiation, which was proved by showing the attenuation of multiple prosurvival pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and beta-catenin and myeloid differentiation in vivo.

High-dose cytarabine (HDCA) can be added to CY/TBI for an intensified regimen; however, its additional effects have not yet been completely elucidated. Therefore, we conducted a cohort study to compare the prognosis of HDCA/CY/TBI (n = 617) and CY/TBI (n = 312) in CBT for AML/MDS, using a Japanese transplant registry database. The median age was 40 years, and 86.2% of the patients had AML; high-risk disease was observed in 56.2% of the patients. The median follow-up period after CBT was approximately 3.5 years. Overall survival was significantly superior in the HDCA/CY/TBI group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.69; P < .01), and tumor-related mortality was lower (HR, 0.50; P < .01).

Incidence of infectious episodes showed no significant difference. Nonrelapse mortality was not increased by the addition of HDCA. Higher-dose CA (12 rather than 8 g/m(2)) was more effective, particularly in patients at high-risk for disease.

Nevertheless, the specific molecular mechanisms governing chromatin remodeling in CLL are unknown. Here we report the genetic and functional characterization of somatic mutations affecting the chromatin remodeler CHD2, one of the most frequently mutated genes in CLL (5.3%) and in monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL, 7%), a B-cell expansion that can evolve to CLL. Most of the mutations affecting CHD2, identified by whole-exome sequencing of 456 CLL and 43 MBL patients, are either truncating or affect conserved residues in functional domains, thus supporting a putative role for CHD2 as a tumor suppressor gene. CHD2 mutants show altered nuclear distribution, and a chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) mutant affected in its DNA-binding domain exhibits defective association with active chromatin. Clinicobiological analyses show that most CLL patients carrying CHD2 mutations also present mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (IGHVs), being the most frequently mutated gene in this prognostic subgroup. This is the first study providing functional evidence supporting CHD2 as a cancer driver and opens the way to further studies of the role of this chromatin remodeler in CLL.",['(c) 2015 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Rodriguez, David', 'Bretones, Gabriel', 'Quesada, Victor', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Arango, Javier R', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Ramsay, Andrew J', 'Baumann, Tycho', 'Quiros, Pedro M', 'Navarro, Alba', 'Royo, Cristina', 'Martin-Subero, Jose I', 'Campo, Elias', 'Lopez-Otin, Carlos']","['Rodriguez D', 'Bretones G', 'Quesada V', 'Villamor N', 'Arango JR', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Ramsay AJ', 'Baumann T', 'Quiros PM', 'Navarro A', 'Royo C', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Campo E', 'Lopez-Otin C']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain;', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain;', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain;', ""Unidad de Hematopatologia, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica and Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain; and."", 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain;', ""Unidad de Hematopatologia, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica and Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain; and."", 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain;', ""Unidad de Hematopatologia, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica and Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain; and."", 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain;', ""Unidad de Hematopatologia, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica and Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain; and."", ""Unidad de Hematopatologia, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica and Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain; and."", ""Unidad de Hematopatologia, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica and Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain; and."", ""Unidad de Hematopatologia, Servicio de Anatomia Patologica and Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain; and Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain;']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150601,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CHD2 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,,2015/06/03 06:00,2015/10/07 06:00,['2015/06/03 06:00'],"['2014/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31457-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-604959 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jul 9;126(2):195-202. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-604959.

METHODS: Western blot analyses were performed to investigate the differential expression of JAK2, STAT3, phosphor-STAT3 (Tyr705 & Ser727) and phosphor-JAK2 proteins after matrine treatment in K562 cells with or without human recombinant interleukin 6 (IL-6) pretreatment. The expression of STAT3 response gene products such as Bcl-xL, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc, were investigated by Western blot and quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Expression of IL-6, a potent upstream activating factor of JAK/STAT3 pathway, was analyzed by both real time qRT-PCR and ELISA. RESUTLS: Western blot revealed that matrine treatment resulted in a strong down-regulation of phosphor-STAT3 both in Tyr705 and Ser727 sites or phosphor-JAK2 proteins expression without significant effects on the total STAT3 and JAK2 proteins. The expression of phosphor-Tyr705 STAT3 and phosphor-Ser727 STAT3 was decreased to 0.370 +/- 0.172 in K562 cells treated with 0.5 mg/ml matrine for 48 h, respectively, from 0.690 +/- 0.119 and 1.150 +/- 0.263 in control cells, accompanied with a dramatical down-regulation of phosphor-JAK2 from 0.670 +/- 0.137 to 0.049 +/- 0.057 (P<0.05). In addition, it was found that the expression of Bcl-xL, Cyclin D1, c-Myc was decreased both at the transcription and protein level in K562 cells after matrine treatment. Matrine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the expression level of IL-6 in K562 cells from (35.1 +/- 1.93) to (10.74 +/- 1.83) and (8.66 +/- 1.24) pg/ml at the dose of 0.5 and 0.8 mg/ml, respectively (p<0.05). Matrine treatment could diminish the up-regulation of STAT3, JAK2, phosphor-STAT3 and phosphor-JAK2 protein following pretreatment with IL-6 in K562 cells. CONCLUSION: Matrine exerts its anti-leukemia effect by interfering with the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The inhibition of IL-6 expression may play a pivotal role in the disruption of JAK/STAT pathway by matrine.",,"['Ma, Lingdi', 'Zhu, Zhichao', 'Sun, Xiao', 'Jiang, Lijia', 'Bai, Yu', 'Lu, Xuzhang', 'Zhou, Min', 'Qian, Sixuan', 'Li, Jianyong']","['Ma L', 'Zhu Z', 'Sun X', 'Jiang L', 'Bai Y', 'Lu X', 'Zhou M', 'Qian S', 'Li J']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Quinolizines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'N390W430AC (matrine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'K562 Cells', 'Quinolizines', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC7342599,,2015/06/03 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2015/06/03 06:00'],"['2015/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2015.05.015 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2015 May;36(5):422-6. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2015.05.015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 12 Ph/BCR-ABL(+) AML cases from Feb, 2006 to Dec, 2013, with classic myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-MBC) as control, and followed-up the survival in these two cohorts of patients. RESULTS: The median age of 12 Ph/BCR-ABL(+) AML was 27.5 years, 10 cases (83.3%) showed non/mild splenomegaly, and mainly comprised of M(2) and M(4) subtypes according to FAB classification. The median number of basophils and megakaryocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow was lower than that of CML-CBC patients. All the cases expressed myeloid antigens, 8 cases (66.7%) expressed CD34, 11 cases were detected with t(9;22), 5 cases (45.5%) with additional chromosomal abnormalities, including 1 case of inv(16). All the cases had BCR-ABL transcripts at diagnosis:3(25.0%) cases were e1a2 type and the remaining was b2a2/b3a2type, among which 1 case coexpressed CBFbeta-MYH11. Two out of 6 cases existed AML-like mutations:1 case of CEBPA and the other of FLT3-TKD. For all the patients, 7 cases achieved complete remission (CR), including 6 out of 7 cases receiving induction chemotherapy combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) achieved CR, and 1 out of 3 cases receiving chemotherapy alone achieved CR. The median overall survival was 16.5 months, that of allo-HSCT group was 33.5 months, which was higher than that of non-HSCT group (5.5 months). CONCLUSION: The expression of e1a2 type BCR-ABL, the coexpression of fusion genes which were more common in AML, the existence of AML-like mutations were all indications of a de novo Ph/BCR-ABL(+) AML.

METHODS: The lineage(-) (Lin(-)) cells of ER-CreADAR1(lox/lox) mice and their ADAR1(lox/lox) counterparts were enriched by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and then transduced with retrovirus carrying MSCV- MLL/AF9-IRES-GFP fusion gene. The efficiency of transduction was detected by flow cytometry, and equal number of GFP(+) cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice. The recipient mice were treated with tamoxifen at 48 hours after transplantation to induce ADAR1 knockout and divided into following groups: experimental group (ER-Cre;ADAR1(lox/lox)+tamoxifen), control groups ((1)ER-Cre;ADAR1(lox/lox)+vechile, (2)ADAR1(lox/lox)+tamoxifen, (3)ADAR1(lox/lox)+vechile). The percentage of GFP(+) cells in peripheral blood was examined at 10, 15 and 20 days respectively after transplantation and the survival of the recipient mice was observed. In vitro study, ER-Cre;ADAR1(lox/lox) and ADAR1(lox/lox) AML cells were cultured and the apoptosis rates of these cells 48 hours after 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment were examined. RESULTS: The ADAR1 deletion MLL-AF9 AML mouse model was successfully established. Deletion of ADAR1 could decrease the percentage of GFP(+) cells in the peripheral blood and significantly prolong the survival rate of recipient miceP<0.05. In vitro study showed that the cultured total cell number, percentage of GFP(+) cells decreased and the apoptosis rate of AML cells increased. CONCLUSION: Ablation of ADAR1 could delay the progression of AML in recipient mice.

The frequency of these lymphomas varies geographically, with the highest incidence in parts of Asia. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is usually made using the World Health Organization classification. The ability of hematopathologists to reproducibly diagnosis aggressive PTCL is lower than that for aggressive B-cell lymphomas, with a range of 72%-97% for the aggressive PTCLs. RISK STRATIFICATION: Patients with aggressive PTCL are staged using the Ann Arbor Classification. Although somewhat controversial, positron emission tomography scans seem to be useful as they are in aggressive B-cell lymphomas. The most commonly used prognostic index is the International Prognostic Index. The specific subtype of aggressive PTCL is an important risk factor, with the best survival seen in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma-particularly young patients with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive subtype. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma is the only subgroup to have a good response to a CHOP-like regimen. Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma has a prolonged disease-free survival in only ~20% of patients, but younger patients who have an autotransplant in remission seem to do better. PTCL-not otherwise specified is not one disease. Anthracycline-containing regimens have disappointing results, and a new approach is needed. Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma localized to the nose and nasal sinuses seems to be best treated with radiotherapy-containing regimens. Enteropathy-associated PTCL and hepatosplenic PTCL are rare disorders with a generally poor response to therapy, although selected patients with enteropathy-associated PTCL seem to benefit from intensive therapy.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Armitage, James O']",['Armitage JO'],"['University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Child', 'Enteropathy-Associated T-Cell Lymphoma/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognosis', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radiography', 'Risk']",,,2015/06/03 06:00,2015/09/02 06:00,['2015/06/03 06:00'],"['2015/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24076 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Jul;90(7):665-73. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24076.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this is often accompanied by a loss of normal CD19+ B cells and humoral immunity. Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor-1 (ROR1) is expressed on sub-populations of B-cell malignancies and solid tumors, but not by healthy B cells or normal post-partum tissues. Thus, adoptive transfer of T cells specific for ROR1 has potential to eliminate tumor cells and spare healthy tissues. To test this hypothesis, we developed CARs targeting ROR1 in order to generate T cells specific for malignant cells. Two Sleeping Beauty transposons were constructed with 2nd generation ROR1-specific CARs signaling through CD3zeta and either CD28 (designated ROR1RCD28) or CD137 (designated ROR1RCD137) and were introduced into T cells. We selected for T cells expressing CAR through co-culture with gamma-irradiated activating and propagating cells (AaPC), which co-expressed ROR1 and co-stimulatory molecules. Numeric expansion over one month of co-culture on AaPC in presence of soluble interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-21 occurred and resulted in a diverse memory phenotype of CAR+ T cells as measured by non-enzymatic digital array (NanoString) and multi-panel flow cytometry. Such T cells produced interferon-gamma and had specific cytotoxic activity against ROR1+ tumors. Moreover, such cells could eliminate ROR1+ tumor xenografts, especially T cells expressing ROR1RCD137.

Leukemia accounts for about 30% of all childhood cancer but its etiology is still mostly unknown. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of available scientific evidence on the association between breastfeeding and childhood leukemia. DATA SOURCES: A thorough search for articles published between January 1960 and December 2014 researching the association between breastfeeding and childhood leukemia was conducted on PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus (performed in July and December 2014), supplemented by manual searches of reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: To be included in the meta-analyses, studies had to be case control; include breastfeeding as a measured exposure and leukemia as a measured outcome; include data on breastfeeding duration in months; and be published in a peer-reviewed journal with full text available in English. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The search identified 25 relevant studies, 18 of which met all inclusion criteria. No publication bias or heterogeneity among these 18 studies were detected. The quality of each study that met the inclusion criteria was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Multiple meta-analyses were conducted using the random effect model on raw data in the StatsDirect statistical program. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: No or short duration of breastfeeding and the incidence of childhood leukemia. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of all 18 studies indicated that compared with no or shorter breastfeeding, any breastfeeding for 6 months or longer was associated with a 19% lower risk for childhood leukemia (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.89). A separate meta-analysis of 15 studies indicated that ever breastfed compared with never breastfed was associated with an 11% lower risk for childhood leukemia (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.94), although the definition of never breastfed differed between studies. All meta-analyses of subgroups of the 18 studies showed similar associations. Based on current meta-analyses results, 14% to 19% of all childhood leukemia cases may be prevented by breastfeeding for 6 months or more. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Breastfeeding is a highly accessible, low-cost public health measure. This meta-analysis that included studies not featured in previous meta-analyses on the subject indicates that promoting breastfeeding for 6 months or more may help lower childhood leukemia incidence, in addition to its other health benefits for children and mothers.",,"['Amitay, Efrat L', 'Keinan-Boker, Lital']","['Amitay EL', 'Keinan-Boker L']","['School of Public Health, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel.', 'School of Public Health, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel2Ministry of Health, Israel Center for Disease Control, Ramat Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20150601,United States,JAMA Pediatr,JAMA pediatrics,101589544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Breast Feeding/*statistics & numerical data', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk', 'Statistics as Topic']",,,2015/06/02 06:00,2015/08/20 06:00,['2015/06/02 06:00'],"['2015/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['2299705 [pii]', '10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1025 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Pediatr. 2015 Jun;169(6):e151025. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1025.

Metaphase-based cytogenetic tests, such as G-Band karyotyping, are among the most effective to detect CLL and provide significant prognostic information. However, the use of metaphase cytogenetics is currently problematic due to the low mitotic index of most CLL cells in vitro cultures. Even when metaphases can be generated in the presence of traditional B-cell mitogen LPS, the quality is often poor and aberrations escape detection. PURPOSE: We hypothesized that immuno-stimulatory interleukin-2(IL-2) plus cytosine-phosphodiester-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) can work as a novel B-cell mitogen to stimulate bone marrow cultures which result in a higher mitotic index than regular standard bone marrow cultures stimulated with LPS. This will increase the clonal chromosomal aberration detection rate in patients with CLL. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from CLL patients were divided and parallel cultures were set up using LPS and CpG Oligonucleotide/ IL-2 (IL-2/CpG) as mitogens, respectively. Mitotic index was read under the microscope blindly by three different readers (SQ, LV, RM). G-banding, and Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) were performed to confirm and compare abnormalities. RESULTS: The readings showed that mitotic index in IL-2/CpG stimulated bone marrow cultures was seven times higher than that of standard LPS bone marrow cultures with an average standard deviation of ""0.92'"" and CI of 95%, p less than 0.05. G-Banding and Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) showed the same abnormalities in IL-2/CpG found in LPS Bone marrow cultures. CONCLUSION: According to the results, IL-2/CpG cultures should be used in the cytogenetic lab for chromosomal analysis instead of LPS due to the higher mitotic index that helps in reducing false negative results. Further research should be done in order to lower false negative CLL detection results.",,"['Qdaisat, Sadeem', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Qdaisat, Aiham', 'Harper Allen, Elizabeth', 'Qdaisat, Tareq', 'Gu, Jun', 'Hopwood, Vicki']","['Qdaisat S', 'Zhao M', 'Qdaisat A', 'Harper Allen E', 'Qdaisat T', 'Gu J', 'Hopwood V']","['The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, School of Health Professions.

In this study, we found that the cellular localization of PKB/Akt kinase affects the maintenance of CSCs. When Akt tagged with nuclear localization signal (Akt-NLS) was overexpressed in SKBR3 and MDA-MB468 cells, these cells showed a 10-15% increase in the number of cells with CSCs enhanced ALDH activity and demonstrated a CD44(+High)/CD24(-Low) phenotype. This effect was completely reversed in the presence of Akt-specific inhibitor, triciribine. Furthermore, cells overexpressing Akt or Akt-NLS were less likely to be in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle by inactivating p21(Waf1/Cip1) and exhibited increased clonogenicity and proliferation as assayed by colony-forming assay (mammosphere formation). Thus, our data emphasize the importance the intracellular localization of Akt has on stemness in human breast cancer cells. It also indicates a new robust way for improving the enrichment and culture of CSCs for experimental purposes. Hence, it allows for the development of simpler protocols to study stemness, clonogenic potency, and screening of new chemotherapeutic agents that preferentially target cancer stem cells.

Here, we first analyzed a case of cord blood allograft rejection in which DSA and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) specific for donor HLA-B*54:01 were detected at the time of graft rejection. Both the DSA and CTL inhibited colony formation by unrelated bone marrow mononuclear cells sharing HLA-B*54:01, suggesting that the humoral and cellular immune responses were involved in the graft rejection. Interestingly, the DSA and CTL were also detected in cryopreserved pre-transplant patient blood, raising a hypothesis that the presence of anti-HLA Abs could be an indicator for corresponding HLA-specific T cells. We then evaluated the existence of HLA-specific CD8(+) T cells in other patient blood specimens having anti-HLA class I Abs. Interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assays clearly confirmed the existence of corresponding HLA-specific T-cell precursors in three of seven patients with anti-HLA Abs. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that integrated humoral and cellular immunity recognizing the same alloantigen of the donor can mediate graft rejection in DSA-positive patients undergoing HLA-mismatched allo-SCT.

We reviewed data from 1177 consecutive patients 40 years old receiving a hematopoietic cell transplant at one center during 1999-2009. Transplant indication was predominately leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Overall, 104 patients were found to have clinically significant arrhythmia: 43 before and 61 after transplant. Post-transplant arrhythmias were most frequently atrial fibrillation (N=30), atrial flutter (N=7) and supraventricular tachycardia (N=11). Subjects with an arrhythmia post transplant were more likely to have longer median hospital stays (32 days vs 23, P=<0.001), a greater probability of an intensive care unit admission (52% vs 7%; P<0.001), greater probability of in-hospital deaths (28% vs 3%, P<0.001), and greater probability of death within 1 year of transplant (41% vs 15%; P<0.001) compared with patients without arrhythmia at any time. In a multivariate model including age at transplant, diagnosis, history of pretransplant arrhythmia, and transplant-related variables, post-transplant arrhythmia was associated with a greater risk for death within a year of transplant (odds ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval: 2.1, 5.9; P<0.001).

Although recent progress in treatment has been achieved, lack of response, drug resistance and relapse remain major problems. The tumor suppressor p53 is rarely mutated in melanoma, yet it is inactive in the majority of cases due to dysregulation of upstream pathways. Thus, we screened for compounds that can activate p53 in melanoma cells. Here we describe effects of the small molecule MJ25 (2-{[2-(1,3-benzothiazol-2-ylsulfonyl)ethyl]thio}-1,3-benzoxazole), which increased the level of p53-dependent transactivation both as a single agent and in combination with nutlin-3. Furthermore, MJ25 showed potent cytotoxicity towards melanoma cell lines, whilst having weaker effects against human normal cells. MJ25 was also identified in an independent screen as an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), an important selenoenzyme in the control of oxidative stress and redox regulation. The well-characterized TrxR inhibitor auranofin, which is FDA-approved and currently in clinical trials against leukemia and a number of solid cancers, displayed effects comparable with MJ25 on cells and led to eradication of cultured melanoma cells at low micromolar concentrations. In conclusion, auranofin, MJ25 or other inhibitors of TrxR1 should be evaluated as candidate compounds or leads for targeted therapy of malignant melanoma.",,"['Sachweh, Marijke C C', 'Stafford, William C', 'Drummond, Catherine J', 'McCarthy, Anna R', 'Higgins, Maureen', 'Campbell, Johanna', 'Brodin, Bertha', 'Arner, Elias S J', 'Lain, Sonia']","['Sachweh MC', 'Stafford WC', 'Drummond CJ', 'McCarthy AR', 'Higgins M', 'Campbell J', 'Brodin B', 'Arner ES', 'Lain S']","['Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Oncology and Molecular Medicine, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, Tayside, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Oncology and Molecular Medicine, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, Tayside, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Benzoxazoles)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MJ25 compound)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '207SMY3FQT (Vemurafenib)', '3H04W2810V (Auranofin)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (TXNRD1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (Thioredoxin Reductase 1)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Auranofin/pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Benzoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Reductase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology', 'Thioredoxin Reductase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vemurafenib']",PMC4599284,,2015/06/02 06:00,2016/04/30 06:00,['2015/06/02 06:00'],"['2014/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['4108 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4108 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Jun 30;6(18):16488-506. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.4108.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['auranofin', 'malignant melanoma', 'p53', 'thioredoxin reductase 1', 'vemurafenib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accurate detection of this chromosomal rearrangement is vital due to its association with a favorable prognosis. Variants of t(8;21)(q22;q22) involving chromosomes 8, 21 and other chromosomes account for approximately 3% of all t(8;21)(q22;q22) in AML. Variants in some cases present as hidden translocations, and in such cases it is often difficult to confirm the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22) by conventional cytogenetic analysis alone. The molecular detection of the AML1-ETO fusion gene is possible by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or dualcolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes specific for AML1 and ETO. The mechanism described for variant formation is one step or two steps. We report a case of AML with a masked variant translocation. Conventional cytogenetics and FISH study was carried out on a bone marrow sample of the patient at diagnosis. Karyotype result at diagnosis revealed t(8;11)(q22;p15) by G-banding. FISH nalysis disclosed a 3-way translocation involving chromosomes 8, 11, and 21 and identified a masked variant t(8;21)(q22;q22) using AML1-ETO probe and whole chromosome paint probes (WCP) 8 and 11 with a one-step mechanism. FISH analysis with the AML1 and ETO probes is extremely valuable in cases of AML-M2 because of its ability to reveal masked t(8;21) (q22;q22) translocations and thus quickly confirm the diagnosis, allowing patients to be assigned to the correct risk group in terms of treatment. Simple variants of the t(8;21) translocation involving chromosome 8 and a chromosome other than number 21 are rare. Our case illustrates the challenge of recognizing complex aberrations that occur with variant t(8;21) and further reinforces the utility of FISH applications on metaphase for more accurate characterization of chromosome abnormalities which can lead to more precise therapeutic stratification.",,"['Trivedi, Pina J', 'Brahmbhatt, Manisha M', 'Patel, Dharmesh M', 'Shukla, Shilin N', 'Patel, Prabhudas S']","['Trivedi PJ', 'Brahmbhatt MM', 'Patel DM', 'Shukla SN', 'Patel PS']","['The Gujurat Cancer and Research Institute Asarwa, Ahmedabad, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,,,2014/01/01 00:00,2014/01/01 00:01,['2015/06/02 06:00'],"['2015/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2014;40(1):11-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reveal that this pathway links P2RY6 to the induction of autophagy, and we decipher the signaling network that links the CSF1 receptor to P2RY6-mediated autophagy and monocyte differentiation. In addition, we show that the physiological P2RY6 ligand UDP and the specific P2RY6 agonist MRS2693 can restore normal monocyte differentiation through reinduction of autophagy in primary myeloid cells from some but not all chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients.

Platelet dysfunction precipitated by dasatinib has been demonstrated in multiple in vitro and in vivo studies; however, there is currently no correlative data that definitively associates this with clinically significant bleeding. In this case, we report a patient with chronic-phase CML receiving dasatinib who developed significant gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to angiodysplasia in the absence of a severe thrombocytopaenia or coagulopathy. Platelet function testing on the PFA-100 assay and formal platelet aggregometry demonstrated impaired platelet aggregation, however, upon cessation of dasatinib, platelet function normalised and the bleeding resolved without further intervention.

Vector enveloped with E1001 does not transduce T-cell lines used in standard HIV-1-based RCL assays, making current RCL testing formats unsuitable for testing VP02. We therefore developed a novel assay to test for RCL in clinical lots of VP02. This assay, which utilizes a murine leukemia positive control virus and a 293F cell line expressing the E1001 receptor DC-SIGN, meets a series of evaluation criteria defined in collaboration with US regulatory authorities and demonstrates the ability of the assay format to amplify and detect a hypothetical RCL derived from VP02 vector components.

METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was carried out during the period of Dec 29, 2014 to Feb 5, 2015, totaling 37 days. The survey was conducted on the platform provided by DXY (www.dxy.cn), which is the largest medical and paramedical related website in China. An email was sent to all DXY registered users to invite them to participate in a 5-minute survey. The participants were asked to nominate up to four important medical innovations in China mainland since Xinhai revolution. The participant could select 'zero' which means he/she felt there was no important medical innovations, or he/she did not know important medical innovations. It was noted that important medical innovations refer to (I) those with practical and almost immediate significance to improve healthcare; (II) should not only be introducing western technique to China, but those involve major improvement of existing western techniques count; (III) should not be those with important theoretical discovery but did not have almost immediate significance to improve healthcare. RESULTS: In total 1,513 DXY users participated in the voting. Totally 489 (32.3%), 441 (29.1%), 342 (22.6%), 150 (9.9%), 91 (6.0%) participants provided 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 nominations respectively. (I) Artemisine (Qinghaosu) for malaria treatment (Project 523 team, 1972); (II) arsenic Trioxide (As2O3) for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treatment (ZHANG Ting-Dong and colleagues, 1970s); (III) limb re-plantation (CHEN Zhong-Wei and colleagues, 1963); (IV) all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for APL treatment (WANG Zhen-Yi and colleagues, 1988); and (V) Wu's mask for plague prevention (WU Lien-The, 1910), were voted as the top five innovations in China mainland since Xinhai revolution, with 375, 96, 91, 53, and 8 votes respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this voting exercise, five achievements were voted as top innovations in China mainland since Xinhai revolution.

G4 DNA structures fold from repetitive guanine sequences, and increasing experimental evidence connects G4 sequence motifs with specific gene rearrangements. The human transcription factor 3 (TCF3) gene (also termed E2A) is subject to genetic instability associated with severe disease, most notably a common translocation event t(1;19) associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The sites of instability in TCF3 are not randomly distributed, but focused to certain sequences. We asked if G4 DNA formation could explain why TCF3 is prone to recombination and mutagenesis. Here we demonstrate that sequences surrounding the major t(1;19) break site and a region associated with copy number variations both contain G4 sequence motifs. The motifs identified readily adopt G4 DNA structures that are stable enough to interfere with DNA synthesis in physiological salt conditions in vitro. When introduced into the yeast genome, TCF3 G4 motifs promoted gross chromosomal rearrangements in a transcription-dependent manner. Our results provide a molecular rationale for the site-specific instability of human TCF3, suggesting that G4 DNA structures contribute to oncogenic DNA breaks and recombination.",,"['Williams, Jonathan D', 'Fleetwood, Sara', 'Berroyer, Alexandra', 'Kim, Nayun', 'Larson, Erik D']","['Williams JD', 'Fleetwood S', 'Berroyer A', 'Kim N', 'Larson ED']","['School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University Normal, IL, USA.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University Normal, IL, USA.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University Normal, IL, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Houston, TX, USA.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University Normal, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['R15 CA182978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20150511,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC4426816,,2015/06/02 06:00,2015/06/02 06:01,['2015/06/02 06:00'],"['2015/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2015.00177 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2015 May 11;6:177. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2015.00177. eCollection 2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['G-quadruplex', 'G4', 'PBX1', 'TCF3', 't(1;19)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK-cell function is finely tuned by receptors that transduce inhibitory or activating signals, such as killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, NK Group 2 member D (NKG2D), NKG2A/CD94, NKp46, and others, and recognize both foreign and self-antigens expressed by NK-susceptible targets. Recent insights into NK-cell developmental intermediates have translated into a more accurate definition of culture conditions for the in vitro generation and propagation of human NK cells. In this respect, interleukin (IL)-15 and IL-21 are instrumental in driving NK-cell differentiation and maturation, and hold great promise for the design of optimal NK-cell culture protocols. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells possess phenotypic and functional hallmarks of both T cells and NK cells. Similar to T cells, they express CD3 and are expandable in culture, while not requiring functional priming for in vivo activity, like NK cells. CIK cells may offer some advantages over other cell therapy products, including ease of in vitro propagation and no need for exogenous administration of IL-2 for in vivo priming. NK cells and CIK cells can be expanded using a variety of clinical-grade approaches, before their infusion into patients with cancer.

This drawback necessitates the fabrication of 3-D scaffolds that have cell adhesion-mediated drug-resistant properties similar to in vivo niches. We therefore aimed at exploiting the known property of polyurethane (PU)/poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) in forming a micro-nanofibrous structure to fabricate unique, not presented before, as far as we are aware, 3-D micro-nanofibrous scaffold composites using a thermally induced phase separation technique. Among the different combinations of PU/PLLA composites generated, the unique PU/PLLA 60:40 composite displayed micro-nanofibrous morphology similar to decellularized bone marrow with increased protein and fibronectin adsorption. Culturing of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) KG1a cells in FN-coated PU/PLLA 60:40 shows increased cell adhesion and cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance to the drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin without changing the original CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD33(-) phenotype for 168 hours compared to fibronectin tissue culture plate systems. Molecularly, as seen in vivo, increased chemoresistance is associated with the upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and the cell cycle regulatory protein p27(Kip1) leading to cell growth arrest. Abrogation of Bcl2 activity by the Bcl2-specific inhibitor ABT 737 led to cell death in the presence of both cytarabine and daunorubicin, demonstrating that the cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance induced by Bcl2 and p27(Kip1) in the scaffold was similar to that seen in vivo.

Our goals were to establish definitions of cause-specific death after unrelated-donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (URD-HCT), to estimate discordance between reported and adjudicated cause-specific death, and to identify factors contributing to inconsistency in cause-specific death determination. A consensus panel adjudicated cause-specific death in 1484 patients who died within 1 year after HCT, derived from 3532 acute leukemia or myelodysplasia patients after URD-HCT from 2000 to 2011 reported by 151 US transplant centers to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Deaths were classified as disease-related or transplant-related. The panel agreed with >99% of deaths reported by centers as disease-related and 80% reported as transplant-related. Year of transplant (cohort effect) and disease status significantly influenced agreement between the panel and centers. Sensitivity analysis of deaths < 100 days post-transplant yielded the lowest agreement between the panel and centers for myelodysplastic syndrome patients. Standard predefined criteria for adjudicating cause-specific death led to consistent application to similar clinical scenarios and clearer delineation of cause-specific death categories.

AREAS COVERED: The advent of modern sequencing technologies has allowed the identification of genetic mutations in genes encoding for specific enzymes involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The authors review recent data demonstrating the involvement of mutations in genes encoding for epigenetic players and their complex combination with somatic genetic mutations in the pathogenesis of AML. They also discuss the prognostic and therapeutic implications of these findings. EXPERT OPINION: Current clinical and preclinical studies are underscoring the importance of targeting epigenetic modifiers as new biomarkers for a better prognostic risk stratification and therapeutic evaluation of intermediate-risk patients. Combining data from traditional and modern methodologies will allow a definition of the complex networks of epigenetic changes and molecular interactions between candidate epitargets and key regulators of hematopoiesis. It will thus be possible to achieve an overview of potential aberrant mechanisms driving leukemogenesis in different classes of AML patients.

Here, we report that inhibition of IAP proteins by the small-molecule Smac mimetic BV6 acts together with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACIs) such as MS275 or SAHA to trigger cell death in AML cell lines in a synergistic manner, as underscored by calculation of combination index (CI). Also, BV6 and HDACIs cooperate to trigger DNA fragmentation, a marker of apoptotic cell death, and to suppress long-term clonogenic survival of AML cells. In contrast, equimolar concentrations of BV6 and MS275 or SAHA do not synergize to elicit cell death in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), emphasizing some tumor cell selectivity of this combination treatment. Addition of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha-blocking antibody Enbrel significantly reduces BV6/MS275-induced cell death in the majority of AML cell lines, indicating that autocrine/paracrine TNFalpha signaling contributes to cell death. Remarkably, the broad-range caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) fails to rescue MV4-11, Molm13 and OCI-AML3 cells and even enhances BV6/MS275-mediated cell death, whereas zVAD.fmk reduces BV6/MS275-induced cell death in NB4 cells. Annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining reveals that BV6/MS275 cotreatment predominately increases the percentage of double-positive cells. Of note, the Receptor-Interacting Protein (RIP)1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) or the Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like protein (MLKL) inhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA) significantly reduce BV6/MS275-induced cell death in the presence of zVAD.fmk, suggesting that BV6/MS275 cotreatment triggers necroptosis when caspases are inhibited. Thus, BV6 acts in concert with HDACIs to induce cell death in AML cells and can bypass apoptosis resistance, at least in several AML cell lines, by engaging necroptosis as an alternative route of regulated cell death. The identification of a novel synergism of BV6 and HDACIs has important implications for the development of new treatment strategies for AML.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The toxicity was explored in terms of mitochondrial damage, DNA damage, oxidative DNA damage, cell death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Particle characteristics and copper release were specifically investigated in order to gain an improved understanding of prevailing toxic mechanisms. The Cu NPs revealed higher toxicity compared with both CuO NPs and dissolved copper (CuCl2), as well as a more rapid copper release compared with CuO NPs. Mitochondrial damage was induced by Cu NPs already after 2 h exposure. Cu NPs induced oxidation at high levels in an acellular ROS assay, and a small increase of intracellular ROS was observed. The increase of DNA damage was limited. CuO NPs did not induce any mitochondrial damage up to 6 h of exposure. No acellular ROS was induced by the CuO NPs, and the levels of intracellular ROS and DNA damage were limited after 2 h exposure. Necrosis was the main type of cell death observed after 18 h exposure to CuO NP and dissolved copper.",['Copyright (c) 2015.

Here, we showed that macrophages cell-derived exosomes can function as vehicles to deliver exogenous miR-21 inhibitor into BGC-823 gastric cancer cells. Exosomes loaded with miR-21 inhibitor significantly increased miR-21 levels in BGC-823, but miR-21 inhibitor loaded in exosomes exerted an opposite effect. miRNA transfected with exosomes had less cellular toxicity to host cells compared to conventional transfection methods. The miR-21 inhibitor loaded exosomes promoted the migration ability and reduced apoptosis of BGC-823 gastric cancer cells. These observations indicate that miR-21 acts as a tumor promoter by targeting the PDCD4 gene and preventing apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through inhibition of PDCD4 expression. Furthermore, exosome -mediated miR-21 inhibitor delivery resulted in functionally more efficient inhibition and less cellular toxicity compared to conventional transfection methods.

A variety of upstream genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia lead to overexpression of HOXA9, which is a strong predictor of poor prognosis. In many cases, HOXA9 has been shown to be necessary for maintaining leukemic transformation; however, the molecular mechanisms through which it promotes leukemogenesis remain elusive. Recent work has established that HOXA9 regulates downstream gene expression through binding at promoter distal enhancers along with a subset of cell-specific cofactor and collaborator proteins. Increasing efforts are being made to identify both the critical cofactors and target genes required for maintaining transformation in HOXA9-overexpressing leukemias.

METHODS: Data on number of deaths from cancer in children aged under 15 years were derived from Vital Statistics in Japan and the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database for comparison countries. Trends in mortality were examined by fitting a joinpoint regression model. RESULTS: For all cancers combined, the mortality rate during 2010-2013 was 19.9 per 1,000,000 population for boys and 17.5 for girls in Japan. Mortality from all cancers combined decreased significantly from 1980 to 2003 for boys and from 1980 to 2001 for girls. Afterwards, the rates remained stable for both sexes. Mortality from leukemia declined over the entire study period by 4.6% per year (p<0.05) in boys and 4.3% per year (p<0.05) in girls.

Sustained efforts to explore the potential of new agents for effective therapy are critical in the context of development of drug resistance especially in cancers like chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The present study evaluated the effect of zerumbone on CML-K562 cells. The cell viability of zerumbone-treated K562 cells was detected by MTT assay, and morphological changes were observed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Staining with Hoechst 33258, acridine orange/ethidium bromide, and AnnexinV-FITC were used to detect apoptosis. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca(2+), and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were measured using Dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), Fluo-3AM, and Rhodamine-123, respectively. Western blot analysis was carried out to detect key proteins involved in apoptosis. Zerumbone inhibited K562 cell proliferation with an IC50 value of 3.5 mug/mL and colony formation capability (P < 0.001). Interestingly, zerumbone did not affect the growth of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hPBLs). Distinct morphological changes observed by light microscopy and fluorescent staining with Hoechst-33258, AO/EtBr, annexin V-FITC, and cytotoxicity evaluation by comet assay indicated induction of DNA damage and apoptosis. This was further confirmed by demonstration of pro-caspase-3, -9 activation and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage on western blots. Apoptosis induction was found to be mitochondria mediated, involving increased free intracellular Ca(2+), ROS, and upregulation of soluble histone H2AX.

In this population-based study, we analyzed rates of SPM in adult patients with MCL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected adult (>/=18 years) patients with MCL as first primary malignancy diagnosed during January 1992 to December 2011 from National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) 13 database. We used multiple standardized incidence ratio (MP-SIR) session of SEER(*) stat software to calculate the risk of second primary malignancies. RESULTS: Among 3,149 patients, 261 (8.29%) developed 287 second primary malignancies with observed/expected (O/E) ratio of 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI=1.17-1.48, p<0.001). The median time to SPM from the time of diagnosis was 47 months (range=6 months to 17.91 years). The significant excess risks were observed for skin, excluding basal and squamous cancer, (N=22, O/E=2.24, CI=1.4-3.39, p<0.001), thyroid malignancy (O/E=3, CI=1.1-6.52, p<0.01), acute myeloid leukemia (O/E=7.74, CI=4.54-13.94, p<0.001), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (O/E=7.27, CI=4.44-11.23, p<0.001) and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (O/E=3.79, CI=2.64-5.27, p<0.001). The risk of malignancies of brain, thyroid, rectum and anal canal were higher within the first two years of diagnosis of MCL. Risk of skin cancer, excluding basal and squamous cancer, was higher after two years of latency. CONCLUSION: There is significantly higher risk of second primary malignancies in patients with mantle cell lymphoma compared to the general population.

For the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, combination therapies with histone deacetylase inhibitors, which up-regulate ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-related enzymes, produce a beneficial effect. However, the mechanisms underlying the effect of bortezomib are not completely understood. We hypothesized that bortezomib causes excessive accumulation of aberrant proteins, which augments endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to death of malignant cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The NB4 cell line established from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) expressing the promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA) fusion protein was used to assess changes in cell viability and apoptosis caused by bortezomib, as well as alterations in PML-RARA and UPS-related enzymes via western blotting and immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: Bortezomib time- and dose-dependently reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis. Bortezomib significantly increased the abundance of ubiquitinated-PML-RARA (Ub-PML-RARA), ubiquitin-conjugating human enzyme 8 (UbcH8), and Ub-UbcH8, indicating that UbcH8 is the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for PML-RARA. Moreover, UbcH8 abundance was dose-dependently increased in the culture supernatant of bortezomib-treated cells. CONCLUSION: UbcH8 may have a utility as a biomarker of treatment response to bortezomib in patients with APL. Furthermore, bortezomib impairs the UPS that controls normal protein homeostasis by causing excessive accumulation of PML-RARA augmenting ER stress and leading to APL cell death. The study provides a rationale for incorporating proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of diseases expressing aberrant proteins. Furthermore, monitoring of UPS-related enzymes might have use in predicting the treatment response to proteasome inhibitors and in assessing their therapeutic effects.","['Copyright(c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Takenokuchi, Mariko', 'Miyamoto, Kazuhide', 'Saigo, Katsuyasu', 'Taniguchi, Taizo']","['Takenokuchi M', 'Miyamoto K', 'Saigo K', 'Taniguchi T']","['Faculty of Pharmacological Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan tmariko@himeji-du.ac.jp.', 'Faculty of Pharmacological Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmacological Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmacological Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (UBE2L6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Boronic Acids/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyrazines/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/genetics']",,,2015/05/31 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2015/05/31 06:00'],"['2015/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['35/6/3307 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2015 Jun;35(6):3307-16.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ER stress', 'PML-RARA', 'Proteasome inhibitor', 'ubiquitin-proteasome system']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although IL-6 and its signaling pathways are promising targets, orally available small-molecule drugs specific for IL-6 have not been developed. To discover IL-6 antagonists, we screened our in-house chemical library and identified LMT-28, a novel synthetic compound, as a candidate IL-6 blocker. The activity, mechanism of action, and direct molecular target of LMT-28 were investigated. A reporter gene assay showed that LMT-28 suppressed activation of STAT3 induced by IL-6, but not activation induced by leukemia inhibitory factor. In addition, LMT-28 downregulated IL-6-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT3, gp130, and JAK2 protein and substantially inhibited IL-6-dependent TF-1 cell proliferation. LMT-28 antagonized IL-6-induced TNF-alpha production in vivo. In pathologic models, oral administration of LMT-28 alleviated collagen-induced arthritis and acute pancreatitis in mice. Based on the observation of upstream IL-6 signal inhibition by LMT-28, we hypothesized IL-6, IL-6Ralpha, or gp130 to be putative molecular targets. We subsequently demonstrated direct interaction of LMT-28 with gp130 and specific reduction of IL-6/IL-6Ralpha complex binding to gp130 in the presence of LMT-28, which was measured by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Taken together, our data suggest that LMT-28 is a novel synthetic IL-6 inhibitor that functions through direct binding to gp130.","['Copyright (c) 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Hong, Soon-Sun', 'Choi, Jung Ho', 'Lee, Sung Yoon', 'Park, Yeon-Hwa', 'Park, Kyung-Yeon', 'Lee, Joo Young', 'Kim, Juyoung', 'Gajulapati, Veeraswamy', 'Goo, Ja-Il', 'Singh, Sarbjit', 'Lee, Kyeong', 'Kim, Young-Kook', 'Im, So Hee', 'Ahn, Sung-Hoon', 'Rose-John, Stefan', 'Heo, Tae-Hwe', 'Choi, Yongseok']","['Hong SS', 'Choi JH', 'Lee SY', 'Park YH', 'Park KY', 'Lee JY', 'Kim J', 'Gajulapati V', 'Goo JI', 'Singh S', 'Lee K', 'Kim YK', 'Im SH', 'Ahn SH', 'Rose-John S', 'Heo TH', 'Choi Y']","['Department of Drug Development, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 400-712, Republic of Korea;', 'Natural Medicine Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Chungbuk 363-883, Republic of Korea;', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-713, Republic of Korea;', 'Laboratory of Pharmacoimmunology, Integrated Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, The Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon 420-743, Republic of Korea;', 'Laboratory of Pharmacoimmunology, Integrated Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, The Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon 420-743, Republic of Korea;', 'Laboratory of Pharmacoimmunology, Integrated Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, The Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon 420-743, Republic of Korea;', 'Department of Drug Development, College of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon 400-712, Republic of Korea;', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-713, Republic of Korea;', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-713, Republic of Korea;', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-713, Republic of Korea;', 'College of Pharmacy, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang 410-820, Republic of Korea;', 'Natural Medicine Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Chungbuk 363-883, Republic of Korea;', 'College of Pharmacy, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 305-764, Republic of Korea;', 'College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-701, Republic of Korea; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Kiel, Kiel 24098, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacoimmunology, Integrated Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, The Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon 420-743, Republic of Korea; thhur92@catholic.ac.kr ychoi@korea.ac.kr.', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-713, Republic of Korea; thhur92@catholic.ac.kr ychoi@korea.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150529,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LMT-28)', '0 (Oxazolidinones)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Arthritis, Experimental/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Oxazolidinones/*pharmacology', 'Pancreatitis/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology']",,,2015/05/31 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2015/05/31 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1402908 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1402908 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Jul 1;195(1):237-45. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1402908.

Here, we sought to identify small molecule inhibitors of Stat5a/b for lead optimization and therapy development for prostate cancer and Bcr-Abl-driven leukemias. In silico screening of chemical structure databases combined with medicinal chemistry was used for identification of a panel of small molecule inhibitors to block SH2 domain-mediated docking of Stat5a/b to the receptor-kinase complex and subsequent phosphorylation and dimerization. We tested the efficacy of the lead compound IST5-002 in experimental models and patient samples of two known Stat5a/b-driven cancers, prostate cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The lead compound inhibitor of Stat5-002 (IST5-002) prevented both Jak2 and Bcr-Abl-mediated phosphorylation and dimerization of Stat5a/b, and selectively inhibited transcriptional activity of Stat5a (IC50 = 1.5mumol/L) and Stat5b (IC50 = 3.5 mumol/L). IST5-002 suppressed nuclear translocation of Stat5a/b, binding to DNA and Stat5a/b target gene expression. IST5-002 induced extensive apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, impaired growth of prostate cancer xenograft tumors, and induced cell death in patient-derived prostate cancers when tested ex vivo in explant organ cultures. Importantly, IST5-002 induced robust apoptotic death not only of imatinib-sensitive but also of imatinib-resistant CML cell lines and primary CML cells from patients. IST5-002 provides a lead structure for further chemical modifications for clinical development for Stat5a/b-driven solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.",['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Liao, Zhiyong', 'Gu, Lei', 'Vergalli, Jenny', 'Mariani, Samanta A', 'De Dominici, Marco', 'Lokareddy, Ravi K', 'Dagvadorj, Ayush', 'Purushottamachar, Puranik', 'McCue, Peter A', 'Trabulsi, Edouard', 'Lallas, Costas D', 'Gupta, Shilpa', 'Ellsworth, Elyse', 'Blackmon, Shauna', 'Ertel, Adam', 'Fortina, Paolo', 'Leiby, Benjamin', 'Xia, Guanjun', 'Rui, Hallgeir', 'Hoang, David T', 'Gomella, Leonard G', 'Cingolani, Gino', 'Njar, Vincent', 'Pattabiraman, Nagarajan', 'Calabretta, Bruno', 'Nevalainen, Marja T']","['Liao Z', 'Gu L', 'Vergalli J', 'Mariani SA', 'De Dominici M', 'Lokareddy RK', 'Dagvadorj A', 'Purushottamachar P', 'McCue PA', 'Trabulsi E', 'Lallas CD', 'Gupta S', 'Ellsworth E', 'Blackmon S', 'Ertel A', 'Fortina P', 'Leiby B', 'Xia G', 'Rui H', 'Hoang DT', 'Gomella LG', 'Cingolani G', 'Njar V', 'Pattabiraman N', 'Calabretta B', 'Nevalainen MT']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'School of Pharmacy, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Urology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Urology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Activation of p53 follows a major pathway by which normal tissues respond to DNA-damaging agents, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, that result in injuries and pathological consequences. This pathway is separate from the tumor suppressor pathway of p53. We have previously reported that use of low-dose arsenic (LDA) temporarily and reversibly suppresses p53 activation, thereby ameliorating normal tissue toxicity from exposure to 5-fluorouracil and X rays. We have also demonstrated that LDA-mediated protection requires functional p53 and thus is selective to normal tissues, as essentially every cancer cell has dysfunctional p53. Here we tested the protective efficacy of LDA for bone marrow tissue against radioimmunotherapy through animal experiments. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Mice were subjected to LDA pretreatment for 3 days, followed by treatment with Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan. Both dose course (10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 muCi) and time course (6, 24, and 72 hours and 1 and 2 weeks) experiments were performed. The response of bone marrow cells to LDA was determined by examining the expression of NFkappaB, Glut1, and Glut3. Staining with hematoxylin and eosin, gamma-H2AX, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used to examine morphology, DNA damage response, and apoptotic cell populations. RESULTS: Elevated levels of NFkappaB, Glut1, and Glut3 were observed in bone marrow cells after LDA treatment. Bone marrow damage levels induced by Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan were greatly reduced by LDA pretreatment. Consistent with this observation, significantly less DNA damage and fewer apoptotic cells were accumulated after Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan treatment in LDA-pretreated mice. Furthermore, in the mouse xenograft model implanted with human Karpas-422 lymphoma cells, LDA pretreatment did not have any detectable effect on either tumor growth or Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan (200 muCi)-induced tumor suppression.

In this study, we demonstrate that miR-150 and miR-223 specifically target the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) 3' untranslated region, reducing STAT1 expression and dampening STAT1-dependent signaling in human T cells. The effects of miR-150 and miR-223 on endogenous STAT1 were confirmed using inducible cell lines. Our studies also showed that miR-150 expression is upregulated by interleukin-2 signaling in adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells. HTLV-I-transformed and ATL-derived cells have reduced levels of miR150 and miR223 expression, which coincide with increased STAT1 expression and STAT1-dependent signaling. Knockdown of STAT1 by short hairpin RNA demonstrated that the constitutive activation of STAT1 is required for the continuous proliferation of HTLV-I-transformed cells. Our studies further demonstrate that increased expression of STAT1 in ATL cells is associated with higher levels of major histocompatibility complex class I expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that the pressure exerted by natural killer (NK) cells in vivo can edit leukemic tumor cells by forcing an increased expression of major histocompatibility complex class I to escape immune clearance. STAT1-expressing tumor cells produce more aggressive tumors because they cannot be eliminated by NK cells. Our results suggest that therapeutic approaches using combined targeting of STAT1 and MHC class I may be an effective approach to activate NK cell-mediated clearance of ATL tumor cells.",['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

While a small fraction of cases of childhood leukemia might be partially attributable to some diseases or ionizing radiation exposure, the role of industrial and urban pollution also needs to be assessed. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the possible effect of residential proximity to both industrial and urban areas on childhood leukemia, taking into account industrial groups and toxic substances released. METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study of childhood leukemia in Spain, covering 638 incident cases gathered from the Spanish Registry of Childhood Tumors and for those Autonomous Regions with 100% coverage (period 1990-2011), and 13,188 controls, individually matched by year of birth, sex, and autonomous region of residence. Distances were computed from the respective subject's residences to the 1068 industries and the 157 urban areas with >/=10,000 inhabitants, located in the study area. Using logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for categories of distance to industrial and urban pollution sources were calculated, with adjustment for matching variables. RESULTS: Excess risk of childhood leukemia was observed for children living near (</=2.5 km) industries (OR=1.31; 95%CI=1.03-1.67) - particularly glass and mineral fibers (OR=2.42; 95%CI=1.49-3.92), surface treatment using organic solvents (OR=1.87; 95%CI=1.24-2.83), galvanization (OR=1.86; 95%CI=1.07-3.21), production and processing of metals (OR=1.69; 95%CI=1.22-2.34), and surface treatment of metals (OR=1.62; 95%CI=1.22-2.15) - , and urban areas (OR=1.36; 95%CI=1.02-1.80).

Moreover, Yessotoxin (YTX) modulates its expression and activates different cell death pathways. In K-562 tumor cell line, YTX induces apoptosis and autophagy after 24 and 48 h of incubation, respectively, and the toxin carries out its action through the phosphodiesterase 4A (PDE4A). Therefore, the levels of two subtypes of PKC, conventional (cPKC) and delta isotype of novel PKC (PKCdelta) were studied at these times after YTX incubation. Also their involvement in the cell death activated by the toxin and their relationship with PDE4A was checked. The expression of cPKC and PKCdelta in cytosol, plasma membrane and nucleus was studied in normal and PDE4A-silenced cells. Furthermore, cell viability of normal cells, as well as cPKC-, PKCdelta- and PDE4A-silenced cells was tested by Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. As a result, PKCdelta showed a key role in K-562 cell survive, since without this protein, K-562 cell decreased their viability. Furthermore, modulation of PKCs by YTX treatment was observed, however, the changes in the expression of these proteins are independent of cell death activated by the toxin.

However, previous work in mice and humans had indicated that CD4 T cells transiently lose antigen sensitivity when cellular contacts are lost (eg, by entering the circulation). Using the simple and robust protocol for resetting T cells to original reactivity (RESTORE; ie, preculturing PBMCs for 2 days at a high cell density before initiation of antigenic stimulation), we show that CD8 T-cell responses to viral and tumor-associated antigens are greatly underestimated in blood, and sometimes even remain undetected, if conventional, unprocessed PBMC cultures are used. The latter finding is particularly striking with regard to the appearance of Wilms tumor 1 protein-specific CD8 T-cell responses in leukemia patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The dramatic increase in antigen sensitivity of ""restored"" CD8 T cells is associated with phosphorylation of proximal T-cell receptor signaling components, and with the upregulation of genes involved in aerobic glycolysis, thereby increasing T-cell functionality. The RESTORE protocol permits a more meaningful monitoring of CD8 memory T-cell responses to viral infections and tumors and vaccination success. Furthermore, when generating T-cell lines for adoptive T-cell therapy, it avoids the loss of those clones, which strictly depend on the primed status conferred by cellular interactions in the tissue context for their initial reactivation by antigen.

Levels of membrane MCT1 and intracellular procaspase-9 were decreased in rmEMMPRINex-treated cells in comparison to controls. However, the expression of activated caspase-9 was undetectable. rmEMMPRINex also induced DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in U937 cells.

There is evidence that serum taken after chemotherapy comprises factors stimulating proliferation and self-renewal of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)--however, the nature of these feedback signals is yet unclear. Here, we addressed the question if specific microRNAs (miRNAs) or metabolites are affected after high dose chemotherapy. Serum taken from the same patients before and after chemotherapy was supplemented for in vitro cultivation of HSPCs. Serum taken after chemotherapy significantly enhanced HSPC proliferation, better maintained a CD34(+) immunophenotype, and stimulated colony forming units. Microarray analysis revealed that 23 miRNAs changed in serum after chemotherapy--particularly, miRNA-320c and miRNA-1275 were down-regulated whereas miRNA-3663-3p was up-regulated. miRNA-320c was exemplarily inhibited by an antagomiR, which seemed to increase proliferation. Metabolomic profiling demonstrated that 44 metabolites were less abundant, whereas three (including 2-hydroxybutyrate and taurocholenate sulphate) increased in serum upon chemotherapy. Nine of these metabolites were subsequently tested for effects on HSPCs in vitro, but none of them exerted a clear concentration dependent effect on proliferation, immunophenotype and colony forming unit formation. Taken together, serum profiles of miRNAs and metabolites changed after chemotherapy. Rather than individually, these factors may act in concert to recruit HSPCs into action for hematopoietic regeneration.",,"['Walenda, Thomas', 'Diener, Yvonne', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Morin-Kensicki, Elizabeth', 'Goecke, Tamme W', 'Bosio, Andreas', 'Rath, Bjorn', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Bissels, Ute', 'Wagner, Wolfgang']","['Walenda T', 'Diener Y', 'Jost E', 'Morin-Kensicki E', 'Goecke TW', 'Bosio A', 'Rath B', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Bissels U', 'Wagner W']","['Helmholtz Institute for Biomedical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Metabolon, Inc., Durham, NC, 27519, United States of America.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, German.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Department for Orthopedics, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Institute for Biomedical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150529,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN424 microrna, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/drug therapy', 'Serum']",PMC4449031,,2015/05/30 06:00,2016/04/26 06:00,['2015/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0128231 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-49038 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 29;10(5):e0128231. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0128231. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,['GEO/GSE57570'],,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we investigated PLK1 as therapeutic target using rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) as a model. Here, we identify a novel synthetic lethal interaction of PLK1 inhibitors and microtubule-destabilizing drugs in preclinical RMS models and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of this synergism. PLK1 inhibitors (i.e., BI 2536 and BI 6727) synergistically induce apoptosis together with microtubule-destabilizing drugs (i.e., vincristine (VCR), vinblastine (VBL) and vinorelbine (VNR)) in several RMS cell lines (combination index <0.9) including a patient-derived primary RMS culture. Importantly, PLK1 inhibitors and VCR cooperate to significantly suppress RMS growth in two in vivo models, including a mouse xenograft model, without causing additive toxicity. In addition, no toxicity was observed in non-malignant fibroblast or myoblast cultures. Mechanistically, BI 2536/VCR co-treatment triggers mitotic arrest, which initiates mitochondrial apoptosis by inactivation of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, followed by BAX/BAK activation, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of caspase-dependent or caspase-independent effector pathways. This conclusion is supported by data showing that BI 2536/VCR-induced apoptosis is significantly inhibited by preventing cells to enter mitosis, by overexpression of BCL-2 or a non-degradable MCL-1 mutant, by BAK knockdown, ROS scavengers, caspase inhibition or endonuclease G silencing. This identification of a novel synthetic lethality of PLK1 inhibitors and microtubule-destabilizing drugs has important implications for developing PLK1 inhibitor-based combination treatments.",,"['Hugle, M', 'Belz, K', 'Fulda, S']","['Hugle M', 'Belz K', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150529,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (BI 2536)', '0 (BI 6727)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pteridines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pteridines/*toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tubulin Modulators/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4816114,,2015/05/30 06:00,2016/08/30 06:00,['2015/05/30 06:00'],"['2015/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201559 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2015.59 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2015 Dec;22(12):1946-56. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2015.59.

HNA-2 is coded by CD177 gene that associates with human myeloproliferative disorders. HNA-2 deficient individuals are prone to produce HNA-2 alloantibodies that cause a number of disorders including transfusion-related acute lung injury and immune neutropenia. In addition, the percentages of HNA-2 positive neutrophils vary significantly among individuals and HNA-2 expression variations play a role in human diseases such as myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and gastric cancer. The underlying genetic mechanism of HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations has remained a mystery. In this study, we identified a novel CD177 nonsense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP 829A>T) that creates a stop codon within the CD177 coding region. We found that all 829TT homozygous individuals were HNA-2 deficient. In addition, the SNP 829A>T genotypes were significantly associated with the percentage of HNA-2 positive neutrophils. Transfection experiments confirmed that HNA-2 expression was absent on cells expressing the CD177 SNP 829T allele. Our data clearly demonstrate that the CD177 SNP 829A>T is the primary genetic determinant for HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations.

To design a more effective flavonoid antitumor agent, we altered the flavonoid backbone with substitutions of piperazine and methoxy groups to synthesize a novel flavonoid derivative, LZ-207. The anticancer effect of LZ-207 against HCT116 colon cancer cells and the underlying mechanism of this effect were explored in this study. Specifically, LZ-207 exhibited inhibitory effects on growth and viability in several human colon cancer cell lines and induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells both in vitro and in vivo. LZ-207 treatment also suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and the phosphorylation of IkappaB and IKKalpha/beta in a dose-dependent manner in both HCT116 cells and human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells. Moreover, LZ-207 also reduced the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in LPS-induced THP-1 cells, and this effect was confirmed at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, LZ-207 significantly inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation that was elicited by LPS-induced THP-1 cells in a co-culture system. These findings elucidated some potential molecular mechanisms for preventing inflammation-driven colon cancer using the newly synthesized flavonoid LZ-207 and suggested the possibility of further developing novel therapeutic agents derived from flavonoids.",,"['Sun, Jie', 'Li, Fanni', 'Zhao, Yue', 'Zhao, Li', 'Qiao, Chen', 'Li, Zhiyu', 'Guo, Qinglong', 'Lu, Na']","['Sun J', 'Li F', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhao L', 'Qiao C', 'Li Z', 'Guo Q', 'Lu N']","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150529,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Flavones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (LZ-207)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Flavones/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4449173,,2015/05/30 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0127282 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-45116 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 May 29;10(5):e0127282. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0127282. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, studies concerning its pathogenic role in leukemia are scarce. Our study shows that TWIST-1 is overexpressed in bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses demonstrate that TWIST-1 promotes cell growth, colony formation and drug resistance of AML and CML cell lines. Furthermore, TWIST-1 is aberrantly highly expressed in CD34+CD38- leukemia stem cell candidates and its expression declines with differentiation. Down-modulation of TWIST-1 in myeloid leukemia CD34+ cells impairs their colony-forming capacity. Mechanistically, c-MPL, which is highly expressed in myeloid leukemia cells and associated with poor prognosis, is identified as a TWIST-1 coexpressed gene in myeloid leukemia patients and partially contributes to TWIST-1-mediated leukemogenic effects. Moreover, patients with higher TWIST-1 expression have shorter overall and event-free survival (OS and EFS) in AML. Multivariate analysis further demonstrates that TWIST-1 overexpression is a novel independent unfavourable predictor for both OS and EFS in AML. These data highlight TWIST-1 as a new candidate gene contributing to leukemogenesis of myeloid leukemia, and propose possible new avenues for improving risk and treatment stratification in AML.",,"['Wang, Nan', 'Guo, Dan', 'Zhao, Yang-Yang', 'Dong, Cheng-Ya', 'Liu, Xiao-Yan', 'Yang, Bin-Xia', 'Wang, Shu-Wei', 'Wang, Lin', 'Liu, Qing-Guo', 'Ren, Qian', 'Lin, Yong-Min', 'Ma, Xiao-Tong']","['Wang N', 'Guo D', 'Zhao YY', 'Dong CY', 'Liu XY', 'Yang BX', 'Wang SW', 'Wang L', 'Liu QG', 'Ren Q', 'Lin YM', 'Ma XT']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (TWIST1 protein, human)', '0 (Twist-Related Protein 1)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Young Adult']",PMC4673244,,2015/05/30 06:00,2016/06/16 06:00,['2015/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['4007 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.4007 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Aug 28;6(25):20977-92. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.4007.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['TWIST-1', 'c-MPL', 'leukemia stem cell', 'myeloid leukemia', 'prognostic factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between May 2011-July 2013, 165 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients (age 18-70 years) with intermediate/adverse-risk cytogenetics were randomized 2:1 to receive FLAM or 7+3 (cytarabine 100 mg/m(2)/day continuous infusion days 1-7 and daunorubicin 90 mg/m(2) days 1-3), across 10 institutions.

Since its introduction in 1947, MTX-containing chemotherapeutic regimens have proven instrumental in achieving curative effects in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, drug resistance phenomena pose major obstacles to efficacious ALL chemotherapy. Moreover, clinically relevant molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance remain largely obscure. Several alterations in MTX metabolism, leading to impaired accumulation of this cytotoxic agent in tumor cells, have been classified as determinants of MTX resistance. However, the relation between MTX resistance and long-term clinical outcome of ALL has not been shown previously. METHODS: We have collected clinical data for 235 childhood ALL patients, for whom samples taken at the time of diagnosis were also broadly characterized with respect to MTX resistance. This included measurement of concentrations of MTX polyglutamates in leukemic cells, mRNA expression of enzymes involved in MTX metabolism (FPGS, FPGH, RFC, DHFR, and TS), MTX sensitivity as determined by the TS inhibition assay, and FPGS activity. RESULTS: Herein we demonstrate that higher accumulation of long-chain polyglutamates of MTX is strongly associated with better overall (10-year OS: 90.6 vs 64.1%, P = 0.008) and event-free survival (10-year EFS: 81.2 vs 57.6%, P = 0.029) of ALL patients. In addition, we assessed both the association of several MTX resistance-related parameters determined in vitro with treatment outcome as well as clinical characteristics of pediatric ALL patients treated with MTX-containing combination chemotherapy. High MTX sensitivity was associated with DNA hyperdiploid ALL (P < 0.001), which was linked with increased MTX accumulation (P = 0.03) and elevated reduced folate carrier (RFC) expression (P = 0.049) in this subset of ALL patients. TEL-AML1 fusion was associated with increased MTX resistance (P = 0.023). Moreover, a low accumulation of MTX polyglutamates was observed in MLL-rearranged and TEL-AML1 rearranged ALL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the central role of MTX in ALL treatment thereby expanding our understanding of the molecular basis of clinical differences in treatment response between ALL individuals. In particular, the identification of patients that are potentially resistant to MTX at diagnosis may allow for tailoring novel treatment strategies to individual leukemia patients.",,"['Wojtuszkiewicz, Anna', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'van Woerden, Nicole L', 'Dubbelman, Boas', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Sonneveld, Edwin', 'Pieters, Rob', 'van de Ven, Peter M', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Cloos, Jacqueline']","['Wojtuszkiewicz A', 'Peters GJ', 'van Woerden NL', 'Dubbelman B', 'Escherich G', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Sonneveld E', 'Pieters R', 'van de Ven PM', 'Jansen G', 'Assaraf YG', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Cloos J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VUmc Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Room CCA 4.28, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VUmc Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Room CCA 4.28, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VUmc Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Room CCA 4.28, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG), The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Rheumatology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VUmc Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Room CCA 4.28, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VUmc Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Room CCA 4.28, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.cloos@vumc.nl.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. j.cloos@vumc.nl.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150529,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4455979,,2015/05/30 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2015/05/30 06:00'],"['2015/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-015-0158-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-015-0158-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2015 May 29;8:61. doi: 10.1186/s13045-015-0158-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed to investigate the effects of telomerase inhibitor MST-312, a chemically modified derivative of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), on acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. Our results showed that MST-312 exerted a dose-dependent short-term cytotoxic effect on APL cells, with G2/M cell cycle arrest. Moreover, MST-312 induced apoptosis of APL cells in caspase-mediated manner. Telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay revealed significant reduction in telomerase activity of APL cells following short-term exposure to MST-312. Interestingly, MST-312-induced telomerase inhibition was coupled with suppression of NF-kappaB activity as evidenced by inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and its degradation and decreased NF-kappaB DNA binding activity. In addition, gene expression analysis showed downregulation of genes regulated by NF-kappaB, such as antiapoptotic (survivin, Bcl-2, Mcl-1), proliferative (c-Myc), and telomerase-related (hTERT) genes. Importantly, MST-312 did not show any apoptotic effect in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In conclusion, our data suggest that dual inhibition of telomerase activity and NF-kappaB pathway by MST-312 represents a novel treatment strategy for APL.",,"['Fatemi, Ahmad', 'Safa, Majid', 'Kazemi, Ahmad']","['Fatemi A', 'Safa M', 'Kazemi A']","['Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. a.kazemi@iums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150529,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MST 312)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Catechin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis']",,,2015/05/30 06:00,2016/04/07 06:00,['2015/05/30 06:00'],"['2015/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-3575-z [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-3575-z [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 Nov;36(11):8425-37. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-3575-z.

Doxy and mino induced cell death in exposure-dependent manner. While annexin V/propidium iodide staining was consistent with apoptosis, the morphological changes in Giemsa staining were more equivocal. A pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK partially reverted cell death morphology, but concurrently completely prevented PARP cleavage. Mitochondrial involvement was detected as dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome C release. DNA double strand breaks detected with gammaH2AX antibody and caspase-2 activation were found early after the treatment start, but caspase-3 activation was a late event. Decrement of Bcl-xL protein levels and electrophoretic shift of Bcl-xL molecule were induced by both drugs. Phosphorylation of Bcl-xL at serine 62 was ruled out. Similarly, Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase levels were decreased. Lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine restored Bcl-xL and Bcr/Abl protein levels and inhibited caspase-3 activation. Thus, the cytotoxicity of doxy and mino in K562 cells is mediated by DNA damage, Bcl-xL deamidation and lysosomal degradation with activation of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.",['Copyright (c) 2015 The Authors.

However, the mechanism by which TN initiates apoptosis remains poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effect of TN on the apoptotic pathway in U937 cells. We show that TN induces apoptosis in association with caspase-3 activation, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and downregulation of survivin expression. P38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and the generation of ROS signaling pathway play crucial roles in TN-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. We hypothesized that TN-induced activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway is responsible for cell death. To test this hypothesis, we selectively inhibited MAPK during treatment with TN. Our data demonstrated that inhibitor of p38 (SB), but not ERK (PD) or JNK (SP), partially maintained apoptosis during treatment with TN. Pre-treatment with NAC and GSH markedly prevented cell death, suggesting a role for ROS in this process. Ectopic expression of survivin in U937 cells attenuated TN-induced apoptosis by suppression of caspase-3 cleavage, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release in U937 cells.

Figuring out the exact mechanism is important for further clinical treatment. 5-ALA-GNPs and human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells were used to study delivery function and SOG by GNPs. The SRE of SOG enabled by GNPs was explored by protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)-GNPs conjugate through electrostatic bonding.Cell experiments show that the GNPs can improve the efficiency of PDT, which is due to the vehicle effect of GNPs. PpIX-GNPs conjugate experiments demonstrated that SOG can be improved about 2.5 times over PpIX alone. The experiments and theoretical results show that the local field enhancement (LFE) via localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of GNPs is the major role; the LFE was dependent on the irradiation wavelength and the GNP's size. The LFE increased with an increase of the GNP size (2R </= 50 nm). However, the LSPR function of the GNPs was not found in cell experiments. Our study shows that in 5-ALA-conjugated GNPs PDT, the delivery function of GNPs is the major role.",,"['Zhang, Zhenxi', 'Wang, Sijia', 'Xu, Hao', 'Wang, Bo', 'Yao, Cuiping']","['Zhang Z', 'Wang S', 'Xu H', 'Wang B', 'Yao C']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biomed Opt,Journal of biomedical optics,9605853,"['0 (Nanocapsules)', '0 (Nanoconjugates)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)']",IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Gold/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Nanocapsules/administration & dosage/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Nanoconjugates/administration & dosage/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Photosensitizing Agents/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/05/30 06:00,2016/03/08 06:00,['2015/05/30 06:00'],"['2014/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['2300900 [pii]', '10.1117/1.JBO.20.5.051043 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Opt. 2015 May;20(5):51043. doi: 10.1117/1.JBO.20.5.051043.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from dermal fibroblasts of a patient with FPD/AML possessing a nonsense mutation R174X in the RUNX1 gene. Consistent with the clinical characteristics of the disease, FPD iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells were significantly impaired in undergoing megakaryocytic differentiation and subsequent maturation, as determined by colony-forming cell assay and surface marker analysis. Notably, when we corrected the RUNX1 mutation using transcription activator-like effector nucleases in conjunction with a donor plasmid containing normal RUNX1 cDNA sequences, megakaryopoiesis and subsequent maturation were restored in FPD iPSC-derived hematopoietic cells. These findings clearly indicate that the RUNX1 mutation is robustly associated with thrombocytopenia in patients with FPD/AML, and transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated gene correction in iPSCs generated from patient-derived cells could provide a promising clinical application for treatment of the disease.","['Copyright (c) 2015 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Observational, descriptive study. We included patients over 16 years of age, with confirmed diagnosis of leukemia from the Hematology and Dermatology Departments of the outpatient clinic and from in-patients. Patients with bone marrow transplantation were excluded. A complete history and physical examination of the skin and appendages was performed, with biopsy and cultures if required. The cutaneous manifestations were classified as infection or drug-related, leukemic infiltration, associated dermatosis to leukemia and non-specific lesions. Descriptive statistics was employed. RESULTS: We included 142 patients (62 females, 80 males) with the following diagnoses: acute myeloid leukemia (n=36), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=52), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=21), chronic lymphocitic leukemia (n=30) and hairy cells leukemia (n=3). 42% of patients (n=60) presented some dermatoses.

However, the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of Bmi-1 in breast cancer remains unclear. After analysis of the ArrayExpress dataset GSE45666, we comparatively detected the expression levels of miR-495 in 9 examined breast cancer cell lines, normal breast epithelial cells and 8 pairs of fresh clinical tumor samples. Furthermore, to evaluate the effect of miR-495 on the progression of breast cancer, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were transduced to stably overexpress miR-495. The 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay, colony formation assays, 5-Bromo-2-deoxyUridine labeling and immunofluorescence, anchorage-independent growth ability assay, flow cytometry analysis, and luciferase assays were used to test the effect of miR-495 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. Xenografted tumor model was also used to evaluate the effect of miR-495 in breast cancer. Herein, we found that miR-495, a predicted regulator of Bmi-1, was frequently downregulated in malignant cells and tissues of breast. Upregulation of miR-495 significantly suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenicity via G1-S arrest. Further analysis revealed that miR-495 targeted Bmi-1 through its 3' untranslated region. Moreover, Bmi-1 could neutralize the suppressive effect of miR-495 on cell proliferation and tumorigenicity of breast cancer in vivo. These data suggested that miR-495 could inhibit the G1-S phase transition that leads to proliferation and tumorigenicity inhibition by targeting and suppressing Bmi-1 in breast cancer.",,"['Wang, Lan', 'Liu, Jun-Ling', 'Yu, Liang', 'Liu, Xiang-Xia', 'Wu, Hong-Mei', 'Lei, Fang-Yong', 'Wu, Shu', 'Wang, Xi']","['Wang L', 'Liu JL', 'Yu L', 'Liu XX', 'Wu HM', 'Lei FY', 'Wu S', 'Wang X']","['From the Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Courses, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University (LW, H-MW); Department of Medical Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (JLL); Department of Vascular and Breast Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou (LY); Department of Plastic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (X-XL); State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China (F-YL, SW); State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Department of Experimental Research, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (XW).']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MIRN495 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN495 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/physiology"", 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Phase Transition', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation/*physiology']",PMC4616407,,2015/05/29 06:00,2015/08/12 06:00,['2015/05/29 06:00'],"['2015/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000000718 [doi]', '00005792-201505050-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2015 May;94(21):e718. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000000718.,,['Medicine (Baltimore). 2015 Aug;94(31):1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells are also capable of mounting an immune response against tumor cells after education through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. NK cell regulation is mediated through IFN-gamma and IL-15, important cytokines which can drive NK cell expansion in vivo. Previous studies have shown effective infusion of allogeneic NK cells after lymphodepleting regimens with induction of remission of poor prognosis acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Challenges remain in the expansion of these NK cells once infused and in their education to recognize tumor targets. A principal mechanism of tumor recognition is through KIR mismatch in cells lacking self MHC I molecules. Activating KIRs exist, though their ligands are unknown at this time. Impacting NK cell expansion and education in vivo has been challenging, and thus far clinical applications of NK cells have shown promise in helping to maintain remission in humans, though this remission has not been maintained. Future efforts to utilize NK cells clinically are focusing on developing more consistency in successful expansion of NK cell and educating them to recognize their tumor targets.

Molecular abnormalities are reported in about 90 % of patients with CMML. ASXL1 and SETBP1 mutations, but not TET2 or SFRS2 mutations are reported to be associated with prognosis. METHODS: We studied frequency of TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1 and SETBP1 mutations in 145 patients with CMML using Sanger sequencing, and determined the prognostic factors for OS. We also identified the predictive value of ASXL1 mutations (frameshift and nonsense mutations) through comparing the Mayo Prognostic Model with the Mayo Molecular Model. RESULTS: Forty-seven (32 %) had a mutation in TET2, 42 (29 %), a mutation in SRSF2, 65 (45 %), a mutation (nonsense and frame-shift) in ASXL1 and 26 (18 %), a mutation in SETBP1. Significant variables in multivariable analysis of survival included ASXL1 (HR = 1.99 [1.20-3.28]; P = 0.007), hemoglobin <100 g/L (HR = 2.42 [1.40-4.19]; P = 0.002) and blood immature myeloid cells (IMCs) (HR = 2.08 [1.25-3.46]; P = 0.005).

Chromosome rearrangements are common among NPC patients. Although the mechanism underlying the chromosome rearrangements in NPC is unclear, various mechanisms including activation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD) were proposed to contribute to chromosome rearrangements in leukaemia. Activation of CAD can be initiated by multiple agents, including oxidative stress, which is well implicated in carcinogenesis. CAD is the main enzyme that causes DNA fragmentation during apoptosis, and CAD is also implicated in promoting cell differentiation. In view of the role of oxidative stress in carcinogenesis and CAD activation, and since CAD was suggested to contribute to chromosome rearrangement in leukaemia, we hypothesise that oxidative stress-induced CAD activation could be one of the mechanisms that leads to chromosome rearrangements in NPC. METHODS: SUNEI cells were treated with various concentrations of H2O2 for different period of time to ensure that cells undergo H2O2-induced MLL gene cleavage. Transfections with hCAD, mCAD, mutant hCAD, or cotransfection with hCAD and mICAD, and cotransfection with mutant hCAD and mICAD were performed. Gene expression was confirmed by Western blotting and MLL gene cleavage was assessed by inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR). RESULTS: Treatment with H2O2 clearly induces cleavages within the MLL gene which locates at 11q23, a common deletion site in NPC. In order to investigate the role of CAD, CAD was overexpressed in SUNE1 cells, but that did not result in significant changes in H2O2-induced MLL gene cleavage. This could be because CAD requires ICAD for proper folding. Indeed, by overexpressing ICAD alone or co-expressing ICAD with CAD, Western blotting showed that CAD was expressed. In addition, ICAD overexpression also suppressed H2O2-induced MLL gene cleavage, suggesting a possible role of CAD in initiating chromosome cleavage during oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress mediated by H2O2 induces cleavage of the MLL gene, most likely via the caspase-activated DNase, CAD, and CAD expression requires ICAD. Since the MLL gene is located at 11q23, a common deletion site in NPC, thus stress-induced CAD activation may represent one of the mechanisms leading to chromosome rearrangement in NPC.",,"['Boon, Siaw Shi', 'Sim, Sai-Peng']","['Boon SS', 'Sim SP']","['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Kota Samarahan, Sarawak Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Kota Samarahan, Sarawak Malaysia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150524,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC4446063,,2015/05/29 06:00,2015/05/29 06:01,['2015/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-015-0205-1 [doi]', '205 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2015 May 24;15:54. doi: 10.1186/s12935-015-0205-1. eCollection 2015.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAD', 'Chromosome breaks', 'ICAD', 'MLL', 'Nasopharyngeal carcinoma', 'Oxidative stress']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ITMTX can cause chemical meningitis characterized by vomiting, headache, and fever lasting 2-5 days with spontaneous resolution of symptoms which differentiates this syndrome from bacterial meningitis. OBJECTIVE: This prospective observational study was carried out to determine incidence of post-ITMTX syndrome in patients receiving prophylactic ITMTX as part of Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged 15-50 years receiving BFM 90 or BFM 95 protocol for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma were followed up for post-ITMTX syndrome, defined as vomiting, headache and fever between 38 degrees and 39 degrees C following ITMTX. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients received a total of 297 courses of ITMTX. Of the 297 doses of ITMTX, 20 episodes (6.7%) of post-ITMTX syndrome were observed. The incidence of post-ITMTX syndrome was highest after the second dose of ITMTX (24%). The most common symptom of post-ITMTX syndrome was headache which was seen in 17 (85%) patients. Seventeen (85%) patients had vomiting, 10 (50%) patients had fever, and 4 (20%) patients had backache. Meningeal signs were present in 2 (10%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Post-ITMTX syndrome is not uncommon in adult patients receiving prophylactic ITMTX for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Patients develop a toxic syndrome closely mimicking acute bacterial meningitis but spontaneous recovery is seen without any neurological sequelae.",,"['Jacob, Linu A', 'Sreevatsa, Aparna', 'Chinnagiriyappa, Lakshmaiah K', 'Dasappa, Lokanatha', 'Suresh, T M', 'Babu, Govind']","['Jacob LA', 'Sreevatsa A', 'Chinnagiriyappa LK', 'Dasappa L', 'Suresh TM', 'Babu G']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Ann Indian Acad Neurol,Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology,101273955,,,,PMC4445198,,2015/05/29 06:00,2015/05/29 06:01,['2015/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0972-2327.150586 [doi]', 'AIAN-18-206 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Indian Acad Neurol. 2015 Apr-Jun;18(2):206-9. doi: 10.4103/0972-2327.150586.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ITMTX intrathecal methotrexate', 'MTX methotrexate', 'post ITMTX syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MGD006 is a bispecific CD3xCD123 dual-affinity re-targeting (DART) molecule that binds T lymphocytes and cells expressing CD123, an antigen up-regulated in several hematological malignancies including AML. MGD006 mediates blast killing in AML samples, together with concomitant activation and expansion of residual T cells. MGD006 is designed to be rapidly cleared, and therefore requires continuous delivery. In a mouse model of continuous administration, MGD006 eliminated engrafted KG-1a cells (an AML-M0 line) in human PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell)-reconstituted NSG/beta2m(-/-) mice at doses as low as 0.5 mug/kg per day for ~7 days. MGD006 binds to human and cynomolgus monkey antigens with similar affinities and redirects T cells from either species to kill CD123-expressing target cells. MGD006 was well tolerated in monkeys continuously infused with 0.1 mug/kg per day escalated weekly to up to 1 mug/kg per day during a 4-week period. Depletion of circulating CD123-positive cells was observed as early as 72 hours after treatment initiation and persisted throughout the infusion period. Cytokine release, observed after the first infusion, was reduced after subsequent administrations, even when the dose was escalated. T cells from animals with prolonged in vivo exposure exhibited unperturbed target cell lysis ex vivo, indicating no exhaustion. A transient decrease in red cell mass was observed, with no neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. These studies support clinical testing of MGD006 in hematological malignancies, including AML.","['Copyright (c) 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Chichili, Gurunadh R', 'Huang, Ling', 'Li, Hua', 'Burke, Steve', 'He, Leilei', 'Tang, Qin', 'Jin, Linda', 'Gorlatov, Sergey', 'Ciccarone, Valentina', 'Chen, Francine', 'Koenig, Scott', 'Shannon, Michele', 'Alderson, Ralph', 'Moore, Paul A', 'Johnson, Syd', 'Bonvini, Ezio']","['Chichili GR', 'Huang L', 'Li H', 'Burke S', 'He L', 'Tang Q', 'Jin L', 'Gorlatov S', 'Ciccarone V', 'Chen F', 'Koenig S', 'Shannon M', 'Alderson R', 'Moore PA', 'Johnson S', 'Bonvini E']","['MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'MacroGenics Inc., 9640 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850, USA. bonvinie@macrogenics.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD3 Complex/*metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,2015/05/29 06:00,2016/04/12 06:00,['2015/05/29 06:00'],"['2015/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['7/289/289ra82 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa5693 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2015 May 27;7(289):289ra82. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa5693.,,,,,,,,['Ann Transl Med. 2017 Feb;5(4):80.

METHODS: We live-trapped 72 feral cats from two different habitat types: an urban area (n = 48) and a rural agricultural area (n = 24). We compared blood values and the prevalence of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and haemotropic Mycoplasma infection in feral cats from the two contrasting habitats. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in several blood values (haematocrit, red blood cells, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine) depending on the habitat type and/or sex of the cat. Two individuals from the urban area were seropositive for FIV (3.0%), and eight (12.1%) were positive for FeLV infection (five from an urban habitat and three from a rural habitat). Haemoplasma infection was more common. Based on molecular analysis, 38 cats (54.3%) were positive for haemoplasma, with a significantly higher infection rate in cats from rural habitats (70.8%) compared with urban cats (47.8%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our study recorded haematological and serum biochemical values, and prevalence of selected pathogens in feral cat populations from two different habitat types. A subset of important laboratory parameters from rural cats showed values under or above the corresponding reference intervals for healthy domestic cats, suggesting potential differences in the health status of feral cats depending on the habitat type. Our findings provide information about the association between 1) blood values (haematological and serum biochemistry parameters) and 2) prevalence of selected pathogen infections and different habitat types; this may be important for veterinarians who work with feral and/or stray cats and for overall cat welfare management.",['(c) ISFM and AAFP 2015.'],"['Hwang, Jusun', 'Gottdenker, Nicole', 'Min, Mi-Sook', 'Lee, Hang', 'Chun, Myung-Sun']","['Hwang J', 'Gottdenker N', 'Min MS', 'Lee H', 'Chun MS']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA College of Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea jdchun@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150527,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,,IM,"['Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Animals, Wild', 'Cat Diseases/blood/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Cats', 'Ecosystem', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/isolation & purification', 'Lentivirus Infections/blood/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Mycoplasma/isolation & purification', 'Mycoplasma Infections/blood/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Prevalence', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Rural Population', 'Tumor Virus Infections/blood/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Urban Population']",,,2015/05/29 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2015/05/29 06:00'],"['2015/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1098612X15587572 [pii]', '10.1177/1098612X15587572 [doi]']",ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2016 Jun;18(6):443-51. doi: 10.1177/1098612X15587572.

However, there are conflicting data as to whether IKZF1 is an independent risk factor if minimal residual disease (MRD) and other copy number alterations also are taken into account. We investigated 334 paediatric BCP ALL, diagnosed 1992-2013 and treated according to Nordic Society for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL protocols, with known IKZF1 status based on either single nucleotide polymorphism array (N = 218) or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (N = 116) analyses. IKZF1, found in 15%, was associated with inferior 10-year probabilities of event-free (60% vs. 83%; P < 0.001) and overall survival (pOS; 73% vs. 89%; P = 0.001). Adjusting for known risk factors, including white blood cell (WBC) count and MRD, IKZF1 was the strongest independent factor for relapse and death. IKZF1 was present in 27% of cases with non-informative cytogenetics ('BCP-other') and a poor 10-year pOS was particularly pronounced in this group (58% vs. 90%; P < 0.001). Importantly, neither MRD nor WBC count predicted events in the IKZF1-positive cases. Co-occurrence of pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) deletions in Xp22.33/Yp11.32 (P2RY8-CRLF2) and IKZF1 increased the risk of relapse (75% vs. 30% for cases with only IKZF1; P = 0.045), indicating that BCP-other ALL with both P2RY8-CRLF2 and IKZF1 constitutes a particularly high-risk group.",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Olsson, Linda', 'Ivanov Ofverholm, Ingegerd', 'Noren-Nystrom, Ulrika', 'Zachariadis, Vasilios', 'Nordlund, Jessica', 'Sjogren, Helene', 'Golovleva, Irina', 'Nordgren, Ann', 'Paulsson, Kajsa', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Barbany, Gisela', 'Johansson, Bertil']","['Olsson L', 'Ivanov Ofverholm I', 'Noren-Nystrom U', 'Zachariadis V', 'Nordlund J', 'Sjogren H', 'Golovleva I', 'Nordgren A', 'Paulsson K', 'Heyman M', 'Barbany G', 'Johansson B']","['Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery and Centre for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Paediatrics, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery and Centre for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Medical and Clinical Genetics, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery and Centre for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery and Centre for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories Region Skane, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150527,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Receptor, PAR-1)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Cohort Studies', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel/genetics', 'Receptor, PAR-1/genetics', 'Sweden', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2015/05/29 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/29 06:00'],"['2015/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13514 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Sep;170(6):847-58. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13514.

RESULTS: The positivity rates of CDX2 mRNA and protein expressions in AML group were 84.78% and 76.92%, respectively, but no CDX2 mRNA or protein expression were detected in control group (P<0.01). The expressions of beta-catenin mRNA and protein were detected in all the patients in both groups but its expressions in AML group were significantly higher (P<0.01). The expressions of CDX2 and beta-catenin mRNA were significantly correlated with WBC counts and LDH levels (P<0.01). The expression of CDX2 mRNA was not detected and the expression of beta-catenin mRNA was decreased to normal level in AML patients with complete remission, while the expressions of CDX2 and beta-catenin mRNA were increased again in those with disease relapse.

One of the methods used for computing topological characteristics of a space at different spatial resolutions is persistent homology. This concept can also be applied to network theory, and more specifically to protein-protein interaction networks, where the number of rings in an individual cancer network represents a measure of complexity. RESULTS: We observed a linear correlation of R = -0.55 between persistent homology and 5-year survival of patients with a variety of cancers. This relationship was used to predict the proteins within a protein-protein interaction network with the most impact on cancer progression. By re-computing the persistent homology after computationally removing an individual node (protein) from the protein-protein interaction network, we were able to evaluate whether such an inhibition would lead to improvement in patient survival. The power of this approach lied in its ability to identify the effects of inhibition of multiple proteins and in the ability to expose whether the effect of a single inhibition may be amplified by inhibition of other proteins. More importantly, we illustrate specific examples of persistent homology calculations, which correctly predict the survival benefit observed effects in clinical trials using inhibitors of the identified molecular target. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that computational approaches such as persistent homology may be used in the future for selection of molecular therapies in clinic. The technique uses a mathematical algorithm to evaluate the node (protein) whose inhibition has the highest potential to reduce network complexity. The greater the drop in persistent homology, the greater reduction in network complexity, and thus a larger potential for survival benefit. We hope that the use of advanced mathematics in medicine will provide timely information about the best drug combination for patients, and avoid the expense associated with an unsuccessful clinical trial, where drug(s) did not show a survival benefit.",,"['Benzekry, Sebastian', 'Tuszynski, Jack A', 'Rietman, Edward A', 'Lakka Klement, Giannoula']","['Benzekry S', 'Tuszynski JA', 'Rietman EA', 'Lakka Klement G']","['Inria team MC2, Institut de Mathematiques de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. sebastien.benzekry@inria.fr.', 'UMR CNRS 5251, University of Bordeaux, 351 cours de la Liberation, Talence, Cedex, 33405, France. sebastien.benzekry@inria.fr.', 'Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, 116 St and 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R3, Canada. jtus@phys.ualberta.ca.', 'Department of Physics, University of Alberta, 116 St and 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R3, Canada. jtus@phys.ualberta.ca.', 'Newman-Lakka Institute, Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, 75 Kneeland St, Boston, MA, 02111, USA. erietman@gmail.org.', 'Newman-Lakka Institute, Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, 75 Kneeland St, Boston, MA, 02111, USA. glakkaklement@tuftsmedicalcenter.org.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, 755 Washington St, Boston, MA, 02116, USA. glakkaklement@tuftsmedicalcenter.org.', 'Newman Lakka Institute for Personalized Cancer Care, Rare Tumors and Vascular Anomalies Center, Chef, Academic & Research Affairs, Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, 800 Washington Street, Box 14, Boston, MA, 02111, USA. glakkaklement@tuftsmedicalcenter.org.']",['eng'],"['U54 CA149233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA149233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150528,England,Biol Direct,Biology direct,101258412,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/therapy', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*therapy', 'Probability', '*Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC4445818,,2015/05/29 06:00,2016/02/09 06:00,['2015/05/29 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13062-015-0058-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13062-015-0058-5 [pii]']",epublish,Biol Direct. 2015 May 28;10:32. doi: 10.1186/s13062-015-0058-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated factors affecting the outcome of azacitidine treatment in 196 'real-world' patients, retrospectively collected by two Italian cooperative groups. METHODS: The study included 184 MDS and 12 low blast count acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Azacitidine was administered at the standard dose of 75 mg/m(2)/d for 7 d (SD) in 163 patients and 100 mg/d for 5-7 d in 33 patients. RESULTS: After a median of 4.5 azacitidine cycles (range 7-15 cycles), 182 patients were evaluable for response. Nineteen percent achieved complete remission (CR), 17% partial remission (PR), and 21% hematological improvement (HI). The disease was stable or progressive in 29% and 14% of patients, respectively. The probability of response was significantly higher in patients who received the 75 mg/m(2)/7 d compared with 100 mg through 5-7 d dose (CR/PR/HI: 63 vs. 29%, P = 0.0005). Median overall survival was 17.1 months. Low MDS-CI and achievement of CR/PR/HI were significant predictors of survival in the multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that maximal azacitidine efficacy is associated with the standard dose and with prolonged treatment, beyond 4-6 cycles, with the goal of also improving the 'quality' of response. Lower MDS-CI and IPSS-R scores, hematologic response and disease stability, are associated with longer survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed multidetector computed tomography features including lymph node size, shape, enhancement patterns, and anatomical distribution, in 106 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, untreated tuberculosis (55 patients; 52%) or leukemia (51 patients; 48%). In patients with leukemia, 32 (62.7%) had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 19 (37.3%) had acute leukemias; of these, 10 (19.6%) had acute myeloid leukemia, and 9 (17.6%) had acute lymphocytic leukemia. RESULTS: The lower para-aortic (30.9% for tuberculosis, 63.2% for acute leukemias and 87.5% for chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and inguinal (9.1% for tuberculosis, 57.9% for acute leukemias and 53.1% for chronic lymphocytic leukemia) lymph nodes were involved more frequently in the three types of leukemia than in tuberculosis (both with p <0.017). Tuberculosis showed peripheral enhancement, frequently with a multilocular appearance, in 43 (78.2%) patients, whereas patients with leukemia (78.9% for acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, 87.5% for chronic lymphocytic leukemia) demonstrated predominantly homogeneous enhancement (both with p <0.017). For the diagnosis of tuberculosis, the analysis showed that a peripheral enhancement pattern had a sensitivity of 78.2%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 88.7%. For the diagnosis of leukemia, the analysis showed that a homogeneous enhancement pattern was associated with a sensitivity of 84.3%, a specificity of 94.5%, and an accuracy of 89.6%.

Coumarins are natural polyphenolic compounds with important pharmacological activities, which are present in many dietary plants and herbal remedies. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate natural and synthetic coumarin derivatives with considerable anticancer capacity against three human cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We synthesized 27 coumarin derivatives (mostly having 4-methyl moiety) and examined their cytotoxic effect on three human cancer cell lines, K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), LS180 (colon adenocarcinoma), and MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) by MTT reduction assay. Screened compounds included 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarins (7-HMCs), 7-acetoxy-4-methylcoumarins (7-AMCs), and different dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (DHMC) and diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin (DAMC) derivatives. Some compounds with methoxy, amine, and bromine substitutions were also examined. RESULTS: 7,8-DHMCs bearing alkyl groups at C3 position were the most effective subgroup, and of which, the most potent is compound 11, with an n-decyl chain at C3, which had IC50 values of 42.4, 25.2, and 25.1 microM against K562, LS180, and MCF-7 cells, respectively. The second most active subgroup was 7,8-DAMCs containing ethoxycarbonylmethyl and ethoxycarbonylethyl moieties at C3 position. Compound 27 (6-bromo-4-bromomethyl-7-hydroxycoumarin), the only derivative containing bromine also showed reasonable cytotoxic activities (IC50 range: 32.7-45.8 microM). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of 4-methylcoumarins shows that further investigation of these derivatives may lead to the discovery of novel anticancer agents.",,"['Miri, Ramin', 'Nejati, Maryam', 'Saso, Luciano', 'Khakdan, Fatemeh', 'Parshad, Badri', 'Mathur, Divya', 'Parmar, Virinder S', 'Bracke, Marc E', 'Prasad, Ashok K', 'Sharma, Sunil K', 'Firuzi, Omidreza']","['Miri R', 'Nejati M', 'Saso L', 'Khakdan F', 'Parshad B', 'Mathur D', 'Parmar VS', 'Bracke ME', 'Prasad AK', 'Sharma SK', 'Firuzi O']","['a Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran .', 'a Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran .', 'b Department of Physiology and Pharmacology ""Vittorio Erspamer"" , Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy .', 'a Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran .', 'c Bioorganic Laboratory, Department of Chemistry , University of Delhi , Delhi , India , and.', 'c Bioorganic Laboratory, Department of Chemistry , University of Delhi , Delhi , India , and.', 'c Bioorganic Laboratory, Department of Chemistry , University of Delhi , Delhi , India , and.', 'd Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research , University Hospital, University of Gent , Gent , Belgium.', 'd Laboratory of Experimental Cancer Research , University Hospital, University of Gent , Gent , Belgium.', 'c Bioorganic Laboratory, Department of Chemistry , University of Delhi , Delhi , India , and.', 'c Bioorganic Laboratory, Department of Chemistry , University of Delhi , Delhi , India , and.', 'a Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , Iran .']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150527,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coumarins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coumarins/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2015/05/29 06:00,2016/09/22 06:00,['2015/05/29 06:00'],"['2015/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13880209.2015.1016183 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2016;54(1):105-10. doi: 10.3109/13880209.2015.1016183.

We therefore investigated 426 samples from patients with hypereosinophilia of unknown significance initially referred for screening of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA (FP) fusion gene also for KIT D816V and JAK2 V617F mutations. Overall, 86 (20%) patients tested positive: FP+ in 55 (12%), KIT D816V+ in 14 (3%), and JAK2 V617F+ in 17 (4%) patients, respectively. To gain better insight into clinical characteristics, we compared these cases with 31 additional and well-characterized KIT D816V+ eosinophilia-associated systemic mastocytosis (SM-eo) patients enrolled within the ""German Registry on Disorders of Eosinophils and Mast cells."" Significant differences included younger age, male predominance, and higher eosinophil counts for FP+ cases while abdominal lymphadenopathy, ascites, and serum tryptase levels >100 mug/l were characteristic for those with KIT D816V. Leukocytes, hemoglobin, and splenomegaly did not differ significantly. A median of three additional mutations, most frequently TET2 and SRSF2, were identified in 12/13 KIT D816V+ SM-eo patients with available material indicating a more complex molecular pathogenesis. Median survival was not reached for FP+ cases but was only 26 and 41 months for KIT D816V+ SM and JAK2 V617F+ MPN-eo, respectively. Eosinophilia of >/=2 x 10(9) /l was identified as discriminator for inferior survival in KIT D816V+ and/or JAK2 V617F+ patients (median survival 20 months vs. not reached, P = 0.002).

Because effective treatments are lacking, we studied tight targeting of blast crisis CML cells using adenoviral (Ad) vectors expressing a HSV-TK system under dual control of a specific SUZ12 promoter and an antioxidant response element (ARE). METHODS: A potential SUZ12 promoter fragment was designed with bioinformatics databases and identified with a luciferase assay. Next, we cloned the ARE element of the NQO1 gene and developed Ad vectors expressing TK kinase or luciferase under the dual control of a specific SUZ12 promoter and an ARE element. An in vitro transfection assay with Ad-ARE/SUZ12-Luc was used to determine promoter activity of ARE/SUZ12 regulatory element in blast crisis CML cells. After incubating human BP-CML-derived cells with Ad-ARE/SUZ12-TK and ganciclovir, Western blot, CCK8, Immunofluorescent assays and Annexin V assays were conducted to assess the efficacy of an ARE/SUZ12 dual-specific TK/GCV system for BP-CML cell lines. RESULTS: Here, luciferase data confirmed significantly higher and specificer promoter activity of the ARE/SUZ12 composite component in CML blast crisis-derived cell lines (K562, KCL22, and K562/G01) compared to HepG2 cells, and Ad-AS-TK/GCV system could exhibit enhanced apoptotic effects and decreased cell viability for BP-CML cell lines. Additionally, Ad-AS-TK/GCV system altered expression of cycle-related and apoptosis-related proteins in BP-CML cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, ARE/SUZ12 dual targeting TK/GCV system was effective in killing BP-CML cells. Moreover, efficacy and specificity of CML cell eradication were enhanced by synergistic effects of ARE/SUZ12 dual-specific regulation.

In reported small series, BMN in hematological malignancies is associated with poor prognosis. We sought to find the impact of BMN on clinical outcome in a relatively larger cohort of patients with acute leukemias. Overall we evaluated 1,691 patients; 1,051 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 640 with acute lymphocytic leukemia referred to our institution between 2002 and 2013. Patients with AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were evaluated separately to determine the incidence of BMN, associated clinical features and its prognostic significance. At initial diagnosis, BMN was observed in 25 (2.4%) patients with AML and 20 (3.2%) patients with ALL. In AML, BMN was significantly associated with French-American-British AML M5 morphology (32% vs. 10%, P = 0.002). The complete remission (CR) rate in AML with and without BMN was 32% and 59% respectively (P = 0.008). Likewise, CR rate in ALL with BMN was also inferior, 70% vs. 92% (P = 0.005). The median overall survival (OS) in AML with BMN was significantly poorer, 3.7 months compared to 14 months without BMN (P = 0.003). Similarly, the median OS in ALL with and without BMN was 61.7 and 72 months respectively (P = 0.33). BMN is not a rare entity in AML and ALL, but is infrequent. BMN in AML and in ALL is suggestive of inferior response and poor prognosis.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Badar, Talha', 'Shetty, Aditya', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Chen, Hsiang-Chun', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Daver, Naval', 'Dinardo, Courtney', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Badar T', 'Shetty A', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Cortes J', 'Konopleva M', 'Borthakur G', 'Pierce S', 'Huang X', 'Chen HC', 'Kadia T', 'Daver N', 'Dinardo C', ""O'Brien S"", 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Pathology/Lab Medicine, Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20150727,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Necrosis/complications/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4546505,['NIHMS704837'],2015/05/29 06:00,2015/11/04 06:00,['2015/05/29 06:00'],"['2015/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24074 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Sep;90(9):769-73. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24074.

This study was conducted directly on human blood smears (27 volunteers and 49 CLL patients) spread on standard glass slides according to a cytological protocol before the staining step. Visible excitation at 532 nm was chosen, instead of near infrared, in order to minimize the glass contribution in the Raman spectra. After Raman measurements, blood smears were stained using the May-Grunwald Giemsa procedure to correlate spectroscopic data classifications with cytological analysis. A first prediction model was built using support vector machines to discriminate between the two main leukocyte subpopulations (lymphocytes and polymorphonuclears) with sensitivity and specificity over 98.5%. The spectral differences between these two classes were associated to higher nucleic acid content in lymphocytes compared to polymorphonuclears. Then, we developed a classification model to discriminate between neoplastic and healthy lymphocyte spectra, with a mean sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 91% respectively. The main molecular differences between healthy and CLL cells were associated with DNA and protein changes.

Pertinent animal models link in vitro studies with the use of new agents in clinical trials. We generated a transgenic zebrafish expressing human NUP98-HOXA9 (NHA9), a fusion oncogene found in high-risk AML. Embryos developed a preleukemic state with anemia and myeloid cell expansion, and adult fish developed a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). We leveraged this model to show that NHA9 increases the number of hematopoietic stem cells, and that oncogenic function of NHA9 depends on downstream activation of meis1, the PTGS/COX pathway and genome hypermethylation through the DNA methyltransferase, dnmt1. We restored normal hematopoiesis in NHA9 embryos with knockdown of meis1 or dnmt1, as well as pharmacologic treatment with DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors or cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors. DNMT inhibitors reduced genome methylation to near normal levels. Strikingly, we discovered synergy when we combined sub-monotherapeutic doses of a histone deacetylase inhibitor plus either a DNMT inhibitor or COX inhibitor to block the effects of NHA9 on zebrafish blood development.

Many of the microenvironmental signals converge on RAC GTPases. Although it has become clear that RAC proteins fulfill important roles in the hematopoietic compartment, little has been revealed about the downstream effectors and molecular mechanisms. We observed that in BCR-ABL-transduced human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) depletion of RAC2 but not RAC1 induced a marked and immediate decrease in proliferation, progenitor frequency, cobblestone formation and replating capacity, indicative for reduced self-renewal. Cell cycle analyses showed reduced cell cycle activity in RAC2-depleted BCR-ABL leukemic cobblestones coinciding with an increased apoptosis. Moreover, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was observed upon RAC2 downregulation, paralleled by severe mitochondrial ultrastructural malformations as determined by automated electron microscopy. Proteome analysis revealed that RAC2 specifically interacted with a set of mitochondrial proteins including mitochondrial transport proteins SAM50 and Metaxin 1, and interactions were confirmed in independent co-immunoprecipitation studies. Downregulation of SAM50 also impaired the proliferation and replating capacity of BCR-ABL-expressing cells, again associated with a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential.

The primary objective of this study was to define the natural history and prognosis of patients with AML and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations and provide historical survival expectations. A total of 826 patients treated from 2010 to 2014 at a single institution were evaluated, including 167 patients (20%) with AML and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. Median age was 62 years (range 18-92). There were 59 IDH1-R132, 83 IDH2-R140, and 23 IDH2-R172 mutations. Clinicopathologic characteristics associated with IDH-mutations included older age, less frequent therapy-related status, and increased incidence of intermediate-risk cytogenetics, FLT3-ITD mutations, and NPM1 mutations. Remission rates (CR/CRi) by AML treatment status were: induction, 68%; Salvage-1 (S1), 42%; and Salvage-2 and beyond (S2+), 27%. No difference in response was identified by IDH mutation status. Similarly, overall survival (OS) was not dependent on IDH status within any cohort. The median OS was 15.4 months in induction, 8.7 months in S1, and 4.8 months in S2+. This analysis defines the clinical outcome associated with IDH-mutations in both the front-line and salvage AML treatment settings, and confirms that response rate and OS for both IDH-mutated and IDH wild-type AML patients is comparable. This provides contemporary data to be used for comparison with results of novel investigational (e.g., selective IDH inhibitor) strategies.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Agresta, Sam', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Routbort, Mark', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Mark Brandt', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['DiNardo CD', 'Ravandi F', 'Agresta S', 'Konopleva M', 'Takahashi K', 'Kadia T', 'Routbort M', 'Patel KP', 'Mark Brandt', 'Pierce S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

The present study aimed to examine the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of macrocalyxin A (MA), a novel deterpenid compound, on AML cells. It was identified that MA significantly inhibits kasumi1 cell proliferation in a time and dosedependent manner. Furthermore, low concentrations of MA were able to induce kasumi1 cell differentiation; however, high concentrations of MA induced kasumi1 cell apoptosis. MA was also able to increase the expression of mitochondrial membrane protein in a dosedependent manner while the Psim was reduced. Additionally, Bad expression in kasumi1 cells was increased when treated with MA, indicating that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway may be important in MAinduced kasumi1 cell apoptosis, where the mitochondrial permeability transition pore is opened and the DeltaPsim is reduced.

The thiopurine agent 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) used for ALL maintenance therapy has a key influence on clinical outcomes and relapse prevention. Genetic inheritance in thiopurine metabolism plays a major role in interindividual clinical response variability to thiopurines; however, most cases of thiopurine resistance remain unexplained. METHODS: We used lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from healthy donors, selected for their extreme thiopurine susceptibility. Thiopurine metabolism was characterized by the determination of TPMT and HPRT activity. We performed genome-wide expression profiling in resistant and sensitive cell lines with the goal of elucidating the mechanisms of thiopurine resistance. RESULTS: We determined a higher TPMT activity (+44%; P = 0.024) in resistant compared to sensitive cell lines, although there was no difference in HPRT activity. We identified a 32-gene transcriptomic signature that predicts thiopurine resistance. This signature includes the GTPBP4 gene coding for a GTP-binding protein that interacts with p53. A comprehensive pathway analysis of the genes differentially expressed between resistant and sensitive cell lines indicated a role for cell cycle and DNA mismatch repair system in thiopurine resistance. It also revealed overexpression of the ATM/p53/p21 pathway, which is activated in response to DNA damage and induces cell cycle arrest in thiopurine resistant LCLs. Furthermore, overexpression of the p53 target gene TNFRSF10D or the negative cell cycle regulator CCNG2 induces cell cycle arrest and may also contribute to thiopurine resistance. ARHGDIA under-expression in resistant cell lines may constitute a novel molecular mechanism contributing to thiopurine resistance based on Rac1 inhibition induced apoptosis and in relation with thiopurine pharmacodynamics. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying thiopurine resistance and suggests a potential research focus for developing tailored medicine.",,"['Chouchana, Laurent', 'Fernandez-Ramos, Ana Aurora', 'Dumont, Florent', 'Marchetti, Catherine', 'Ceballos-Picot, Irene', 'Beaune, Philippe', 'Gurwitz, David', 'Loriot, Marie-Anne']","['Chouchana L', 'Fernandez-Ramos AA', 'Dumont F', 'Marchetti C', 'Ceballos-Picot I', 'Beaune P', 'Gurwitz D', 'Loriot MA']","['INSERM UMR-S 1147, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France ; Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1147, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France ; Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France ; INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, 22 Rue Mechain, Paris, 75014 France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1147, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France ; Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France ; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Biochimie Metabolique, 149 Rue de Sevres, Paris, 75015 France.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1147, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France ; Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France ; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Biochimie Pharmacogenetique et Oncologie Moleculaire, 20 rue Leblanc, Paris, 75015 France.', 'Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'INSERM UMR-S 1147, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France ; Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, 45 rue des Saints-Peres, Paris, 75006 France ; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Biochimie Pharmacogenetique et Oncologie Moleculaire, 20 rue Leblanc, Paris, 75015 France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150418,England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,,,,PMC4443628,,2015/05/28 06:00,2015/05/28 06:01,['2015/05/28 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13073-015-0150-6 [doi]', '150 [pii]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2015 Apr 18;7(1):37. doi: 10.1186/s13073-015-0150-6. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported a novel hybrid NL-101, in which the side chain of bendamustine was replaced with the hydroxamic acid of HDACi vorinostat (SAHA). NL-101 exhibited efficient anti-proliferative activity on myeloid leukemia cells especially Kasumi-1 and NB4 cells, accompanied by S phase arrest and caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. Importantly, it presented both the properties of HDAC inhibition and DNA damaging, as assessed by the acetylation of histone H3 and DNA double-strand breaks marker gamma-H2AX. NL-101 also down-regulated the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL which was involved in the mitochondrial death pathway. Meanwhile, NL-101 induced apoptosis and DNA damage in primary cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.

This study detected four unannotated genetic alterations, of which the Q67X could be involved in MYBL2 dysfunction.

Thus, in the present study, the apoptotic mechanism of gallotannin was elucidated in DU145, PC-3, and M2182 prostate cancer cells in association with myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) signaling. Gallotannin exerted dose-dependent cytotoxicity in DU145, PC-3, and M2182 prostate cancer cells. Also, gallotannin showed apoptotic morphological features and increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling positive cells and sub-G1 accumulation in three prostate cancer cell lines. Consistently, gallotannin cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and attenuated the expression of procaspases 9 and 3 in three prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, gallotannin attenuated the expression of survival genes such as Mcl-1, B-cell lymphoma 2, and B-cell lymphoma 2 extra large in three prostate cancer cell lines. Interestingly, overexpression of Mcl-1 reversed the ability of gallotannin to cleave PARP and increase sub-G1 population in three prostate cancer cell lines. Conversely, silencing of Mcl-1 enhanced apoptosis by gallotannin in three prostate cancer cell lines by FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that inhibition of Mcl-1 and activation of caspases are critically involved in gallotannin-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.","['Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Park, Eunkyung', 'Kwon, Hee Young', 'Jung, Ji Hoon', 'Jung, Deok-Beom', 'Jeong, Arong', 'Cheon, Jinhong', 'Kim, Bonglee', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon']","['Park E', 'Kwon HY', 'Jung JH', 'Jung DB', 'Jeong A', 'Cheon J', 'Kim B', 'Kim SH']","['Graduate School of East-West Medical Science, Kyung Hee University, 1732 Deogyeong-daero, Giheung-gu, Yongin, 446-701, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, South Korea.', 'School of Korean Medicine, Pusan National University, Busandaehak-ro 49, Mulgeum-eup, Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, 626-870, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150527,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Hydrolyzable Tannins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Caspase 9/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrolyzable Tannins/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,,2015/05/28 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/28 06:00'],"['2015/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.5371 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2015 Aug;29(8):1225-36. doi: 10.1002/ptr.5371.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children's Oncology Group trials P9404 (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma; n = 537), P9425 (intermediate/high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma; n = 216), and P9426 (low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma; n = 255) were conducted between 1996 and 2001. Each trial randomly assigned patients to doxorubicin with or without dexrazoxane. The dexrazoxane:doxorubicin dose ratio was 10:1, and the cumulative protocol-specified doxorubicin dose was 100 to 360 mg/m(2). Dexrazoxane was given as an intravenous bolus before each doxorubicin dose. Data from all three trials were linked with the National Death Index to determine overall and cause-specific mortality by dexrazoxane status. RESULTS: Among 1,008 patients (507 received dexrazoxane) with a median follow-up of 12.6 years (range, 0 to 15.5 years), 132 died (67 received dexrazoxane). Overall mortality did not vary by dexrazoxane status (12.8% with dexrazoxane at 10 years v 12.2% without; hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.45). Findings were similar when each trial was examined separately. Dexrazoxane also was not significantly associated with differential causes of death. The original cancer caused 76.5% of all deaths (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.32) followed by second cancers (13.6% of deaths; HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.49 to 3.15). Specifically, dexrazoxane was not associated with deaths from acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplasia or cardiovascular events. CONCLUSION: Among pediatric patients with leukemia or lymphoma, after extended follow-up, dexrazoxane use did not seem to compromise long-term survival.",['(c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Chow, Eric J', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Schwartz, Cindy L', 'Doody, David R', 'Leisenring, Wendy M', 'Aggarwal, Sanjeev', 'Baker, K Scott', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Constine, Louis S', 'Freyer, David R', 'Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Armenian, Saro H']","['Chow EJ', 'Asselin BL', 'Schwartz CL', 'Doody DR', 'Leisenring WM', 'Aggarwal S', 'Baker KS', 'Bhatia S', 'Constine LS', 'Freyer DR', 'Lipshultz SE', 'Armenian SH']","[""Eric J.

Since elimination of the leukemic load is thought to be a prerequisite for treatment success, we here investigate toxicity and anti-leukemic activity of a clofarabine-AraC salvage protocol preceding transplant. In this retrospective analysis, we observed induction of objective remissions in 86% of patients receiving clofarabine-AraC as compared to 83% with sequential high dose AraC/mitoxantrone (S-HAM) and 50% after mitoxantrone/topotecane/AraC (MTC) salvage strategies. In addition, clofarabine conferred anti-leukemic activity to some patients who failed initial MTC or S-HAM therapy. For overall and leukemia-free survival, we identified cytogenetically defined adverse risk markers but not response to therapy to be a strong predictor.

No studies have investigated post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSS) in family caregivers of adult patients with acute leukemia using a matched sample. The current study examined PTSS in adult patients with acute leukemia and their family caregivers and investigated the factors associated with caregivers' PTSS. METHODS: A total of 163 patient-caregiver dyads completed questionnaires assessing their PTSS, psychological resilience, and perceived social support. Hierarchical linear regression was used to explore the related factors of caregivers' PTSS. RESULTS: More caregivers than patients met caseness criteria for PTSS (36.8% vs. 18.4%, p < 0.001). Among caregivers, being more closely related to the patients (e.g., spouses and parents), having patients with higher PTSS and having lower psychological resilience were independently associated with more severe PTSS. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers of acute leukemia patients had significantly more severe PTSS than did their patients. This study is the first to investigate PTSS among family caregivers of adult patients with acute leukemia and its related factors in a matched sample. More attention should be paid to the caregivers of patients with acute leukemia to minimize their PTSS and thus improve mental health of caregivers and reduce potential negative consequences for the patients themselves.","['Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Jia, Mutian', 'Li, Jie', 'Chen, Chunyan', 'Cao, Fenglin']","['Jia M', 'Li J', 'Chen C', 'Cao F']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Health Psychology, School of Nursing, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Health Psychology, School of Nursing, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150527,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Caregivers/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', '*Resilience, Psychological', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Support', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/etiology/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/05/28 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/05/28 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3851 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2015 Dec;24(12):1754-60. doi: 10.1002/pon.3851.

To circumvent these limitations, we synthesized a PI3K target based library of 18 triazole based derivatives and we identified a C-3 cyano analog of betulinic acid (CBA) with significant cell death effects with 5-7 fold higher potency than BA in various cancers. Importantly, no such report is available demonstrating the involvement of BA or its structural analogs in the modulation of PI3K pathway. Using, human leukemia HL-60 cells as a model, we for the first time report that CBA decreased expression of PI3K p110alpha, p85alpha, and pAKT in HL-60. Furthermore, we could find significant depletion of pGSK3beta, cyclin D1 and increased expression of p21/cip, p27/Kip proteins. CBA induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, increased sub-G0 DNA fraction and annexin V binding of the cells besides imparting the typical surface features of cell death. Also, this target specific inhibition was associated with mitochondrial apoptosis as was reflected by expression studies of various proteins together with reactive oxygen species generation and decline in mitochondrial trans membrane potential. The apoptotic effectors i.e., caspase 8 and caspase 9 were found to get upregulated besides PI3K associated DNA repair enzyme i.e., PARP cleavage was observed. Thus, our results elucidated that CBA or other BA based small molecules inhibit PI3K/AKT pathway with induction of subsequent cancer cell death which may be useful therapeutic strategy against leukemias and possibly other cancers.","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Majeed, Rabiya', 'Hussain, Aashiq', 'Sangwan, Payare L', 'Chinthakindi, Praveen K', 'Khan, Imran', 'Sharma, Parduman R', 'Koul, Surrinder', 'Saxena, Ajit K', 'Hamid, Abid']","['Majeed R', 'Hussain A', 'Sangwan PL', 'Chinthakindi PK', 'Khan I', 'Sharma PR', 'Koul S', 'Saxena AK', 'Hamid A']","['Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road Jammu, India.', 'Bioorganic Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road Jammu, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road Jammu, India.', 'Bioorganic Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road Jammu, India.', 'CSIR-Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research, Govt. of India, New Delhi, India.', 'Bioorganic Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road Jammu, India.', 'Bioorganic Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road Jammu, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road Jammu, India.', 'Bioorganic Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road Jammu, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road Jammu, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road Jammu, India.', 'CSIR-Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research, Govt. of India, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150527,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '4G6A18707N (betulinic acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Triazoles/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Triterpenes/*agonists/pharmacology']",,,2015/05/28 06:00,2016/09/23 06:00,['2015/05/28 06:00'],"['2015/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.22339 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2016 May;55(5):964-76. doi: 10.1002/mc.22339.

The characteristic phenotype includes co-expression of CD5 and CD23, along with dim expression of light chain and CD22/CD79b, with lack of FMC7. The immunophenotypic scoring system given by Matutes has been used to differentiate CLL from non-CLL chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. Various aberrancies have been described in CLL cases, including abnormal (dim or bright) expression of B cell markers and lineage infidel T cell, myelomonocytic, or rarely Natural killer (NK) cells markers. However, the aberrant co-expression of CD56 and CD57 has not yet been reported. METHOD AND RESULTS: We hereby report a case of 62-year female with a typical CLL phenotype and Matutes score of 5, showing the expression of CD56 and CD57.

One of the most significant challenges in flow cytometry is how to best ensure measurement quality and generate consistent and reproducible inter-laboratory and intra-laboratory results across multiple cytometer platforms and locations longitudinally over time. In a previous study, we developed a procedure for instrument standardization across four different flow cytometer platforms from the same manufacturer. CD19 quantification was performed on three of the standardized instruments relative to CD4 expression on T lymphocytes with a known amount of antibody bound per cell (ABC) as a quantification standard. Consistent and reliable measures of CD19 expression were obtained independent of fluorochrome used demonstrating the utility of this approach. In the present investigation, quantification of CD20 relative to CD4 reference marker was implemented within a single tube containing both antibodies. Relative quantification of CD20 was performed using anti-CD20 antibody (clone L27) in three different fluorochromes relative to anti-CD4 antibody (clone SK3).

However, development of new nanocarriers requires better understanding of the interactions between NPs and the immune system, allowing for the optimization of NP properties for effective drug delivery. Therefore, in the present study, we focused on the investigation of the interactions between biocompatible polymeric NPs and a murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) and a human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). NPs based on a liquid core with polyelectrolyte shells were prepared by sequential adsorption of polyelectrolytes (LbL) using AOT (docusate sodium salt) as the emulsifier and the biocompatible polyelectrolytes polyanion PGA (poly-l-glutamic acid sodium salt) and polycation PLL (poly l-lysine). The average size of the obtained NPs was 80 nm. Pegylated external layers were prepared using PGA-g-PEG (PGA grafted by PEG poly(ethylene glycol)). The influence of the physicochemical properties of the NPs (charge, size, surface modification) on viability, phagocytosis potential, and endocytosis was studied. Internalization of NPs was determined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Moreover, we evaluated whether addition of PEG chains downregulates particle uptake by phagocytic cells. The presented results confirm that the obtained PEG-grafted NPs are promising candidates for drug delivery.",,"['Lukasiewicz, Sylwia', 'Szczepanowicz, Krzysztof', 'Blasiak, Ewa', 'Dziedzicka-Wasylewska, Marta']","['Lukasiewicz S', 'Szczepanowicz K', 'Blasiak E', 'Dziedzicka-Wasylewska M']","['daggerDepartment of Physical Biochemistry, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, 30-387 Krakow, Poland.', 'double daggerJerzy Haber Institute of Catalysis and Surface Chemistry, PAS, 30-239 Krakow, Poland.', 'daggerDepartment of Physical Biochemistry, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, 30-387 Krakow, Poland.', 'daggerDepartment of Physical Biochemistry, Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, 30-387 Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150604,United States,Langmuir,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,9882736,"['0 (Biocompatible Materials)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Emulsifying Agents)', '10041-19-7 (Dioctyl Sulfosuccinic Acid)', '25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biocompatible Materials/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dioctyl Sulfosuccinic Acid/*chemistry', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Emulsifying Agents/*chemistry', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Particle Size', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*chemistry', 'Polylysine/*chemistry']",,,2015/05/28 06:00,2016/03/15 06:00,['2015/05/28 06:00'],"['2015/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b01226 [doi]'],ppublish,Langmuir. 2015 Jun 16;31(23):6415-25. doi: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b01226.

Tumors addicted to the BCL-2 family proteins for survival are now being targeted therapeutically. For example, navitoclax, a BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-W inhibitor, is currently in phase I/II clinical trials in numerous malignancies. However, the related family member, MCL-1, limits the efficacy of navitoclax and other chemotherapeutic agents. In the present study, we identify breast cancer cell lines that depend upon MCL-1 for survival and subsequently determine the mechanism of apoptosis mediated by the MCL-1 selective inhibitor A-1210477. We demonstrate that apoptosis resulting from a loss in MCL-1 function requires expression of the proapoptotic protein BAK. However, expression of BCL-XL can limit apoptosis resulting from loss in MCL-1 function through sequestration of free BIM. Finally, we demonstrate substantial synergy between navitoclax and MCL-1 siRNA, the direct MCL-1 inhibitor A-1210477, or the indirect MCL-1 inhibitor flavopiridol, highlighting the therapeutic potential for inhibiting BCL-XL and MCL-1 in breast cancer.",['(c)2015 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Xiao, Yu', 'Nimmer, Paul', 'Sheppard, George S', 'Bruncko, Milan', 'Hessler, Paul', 'Lu, Xin', 'Roberts-Rapp, Lisa', 'Pappano, William N', 'Elmore, Steven W', 'Souers, Andrew J', 'Leverson, Joel D', 'Phillips, Darren C']","['Xiao Y', 'Nimmer P', 'Sheppard GS', 'Bruncko M', 'Hessler P', 'Lu X', 'Roberts-Rapp L', 'Pappano WN', 'Elmore SW', 'Souers AJ', 'Leverson JD', 'Phillips DC']","['Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.
