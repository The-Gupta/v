In most cases, however, infected patients remain asymptomatic. The participation of the immune system in the pathogenesis of TSP/HAM has been suggested. In this study the IgG antibody response of HTLV-I-infected individuals has been investigated using both ELISA with a panel of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins and peptides known to be recognized by antibodies from patients with various systemic autoimmune diseases, and immunoprecipitation of ribonucleoproteins from HeLa cell extracts. The results were compared with the reactivity of sera from individuals with non-HTLV-I-related neurological diseases and healthy blood donors. Raised levels of autoantibodies reacting with several nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens were found in TSP/HAM and ATL patients. In asymptomatic HTLV-I-seropositive individuals, both the prevalence and level of IgG antibodies were lower and directed only against a restricted set of antigens. The mechanism of induction of these antibodies still remains obscure. However, the results show that a significant autoimmune response exists in these patients and it may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.",,,,,,,,,

Precursors form the neuroepithelium of the developing cortex and also from the adult sub-ventricular zone, can be cloned in vitro after stimulation with fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and have the potential to give rise to both neurons and glia. The generation of neurons from these clones can be stimulated by either a factor derived from an astrocyteprecursor line, Ast-1, or FGF-1. 2. Neuronal differentiation stimulated by FGF-1 can be inhibited by diacylglycerol-lipase inhibitor and mimicked by arachidonic acid, suggesting that the neuronal differentiation is signalled through the PCL gamma pathway. 3. The sequential expression of FGF-2 and FGF-1 within the developing forebrain neuroepithelium fits with the different functions the two FGF play in precursor regulation. 4. We have shown that the precursor response to FGF-1 is regulated by a heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) expressed within the developing neuroepithelium. Precursors restricted to the astrocyte cell lineage can be stimulated by epidermal growth factor or FGF-2; however, the differentiation into GFAP positive astrocytes appears to require a cytokine acting through the leukaemia inhibitory factor beta receptor.",,,,,,,,,

Uncontrolled expression of receptors from these early growth factors may contribute to a leukaemogenesis of such early B cell progenitors. We show here that early pre-pre-B cells, but not mature B cells, express the PDGF receptor-beta (PDGFR-beta). These receptors contain a protein tyrosine kinase domain which is activated upon ligation with PDGF in pre-pre-B cells. Further, pre-pre-B leukaemia cells seem to express more PDGFR-beta compared with their normal counterparts, suggesting a role for these receptors in growth promotion of leukaemia cells.",PMC1553398,,,,,,,,

In this study, the role of recombinant human interleukin-12 (rhIL-12) alone or in combination with other activation signals was studied in vitro. Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) alone caused marked stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from three CD3+ LGL leukemic patients, whereas rhIL-12 alone had less effect as measured in a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. The combination signals of anti-CD3 MoAb and rhIL-12 produced a proliferative response greater than anti-CD3 MoAb alone or rhIL-12 alone. Leukemic LGL, purified by CD8+ affinity chromatography, showed similar proliferative responses as PBMC from LGL leukemic patients, suggesting that the observed effect was indeed due to direct stimulation of leukemic LGL. Radiolabeled IL-12 binding studies demonstrated that anti-CD3 MoAb upregulated the number of IL-12 receptors per cell on PBMC from these patients. Neutralizing antibody to rhIL-12 partially blocked the proliferative response to anti-CD3 MoAb suggesting involvement of IL-12 in the pathway of activation of leukemic LGL via stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) (mimicking activation by antigen). These results show that IL-12 acts as a costimulatory cytokine for proliferation of leukemic LGL activated through the TCR in vitro.",,,,,,,,,

As previously reported, mice homozygous for a mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain fail to generate mature lymphocytes as well as their earliest described progenitors. In addition, our studies with mice heterozygous for this mutation establish the Ikaros gene as an essential regulator of T cell proliferation. Thymocytes display augmented TCR-mediated proliferative responses, and peripheral T cells are autoproliferative. A general lymphoproliferation precedes the T cell leukemia and lymphoma that rapidly develop in all heterozygotes. The first step toward leukemic transformation occurs within the maturing thymocyte population and is demarcated by clonal expansions and loss of the single Ikaros wild-type allele. From these studies, we propose that within developing and mature T lymphocytes, distinct thresholds of Ikaros activity are required to regulate proliferation. A decrease in Ikaros activity below the first threshold causes the rapid accumulation of T lymphoblasts, whereas a further decrease leads to neoplastic transformation.",,,,,,,,,

Moreover, we showed the expression of VEGF gene transcript in these normal fresh cells and cell lines. To elucidate biological functions of VEGF on hematopoiesis, we determined whether this growth factor has mitogenic activity to hematopoietic cells or the ability to suppress apoptotic cell death. The liquid culture and colony-formation assay revealed that VEGF suppressed apoptotic cell death of both CMK86 cells and normal hematopoietic stem cells caused by gamma-ray irradiation, although mitogenic activity of VEGF was not detected. The ability of VEGF to suppress apoptotic cell death was independent of the change of cell cycle distribution. These data suggest that VEGF may play an important role in survival or maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells due to the prevention of apoptotic cell death caused by some stresses such as ionizing radiation and that VEGF may give leukemia cells some abilities of resistance against radiotherapy in an autocrine or paracrine manner.",,,,,,,,,

Cytostatic and cytopathic effects were accompanied by a significant increase in the incidence of apoptosis, as determined by immunocytochemical analysis of DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, transduction of MG-63 cells with a retroviral vector bearing the suicide gene, herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HStk), induced cell death on treatment with ganciclovir, exhibiting pronounced bystander effects.

Twenty-four cases of childhood ALL were screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using 101 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, which are distributed among all autosomal chromosomes. For LOH analysis on both chromosomes 9 and 12, 54 childhood ALL samples were examined. The most frequent allelic loss was found on chromosomal arm 9p, where 20 of 50 (40%) informative samples showed LOH. Moreover, nearly 30% of samples that did not have either homozygous deletions or point mutations of the putative tumor suppressor genes CDKN2/INK4A/p16 and INK4B/p15 on chromosomal arm 9p had LOH at D9S171. Loss of chromosomal arm 12p was also frequent (26%). Mutational analysis suggested that the altered gene on 12p is not the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27/Kip1, which is also on 12p. Several other regions that had LOH included 1p, 4q, 5p, 6q, 7p, 8p, 9q, 10q, 13q, 17p, 17q, 18q, 19q, and 22q. Of 24 patients, 19 (79%) showed allelic loss on at least one chromosomal arm. Samples of two patients (8%) showed LOH on almost all chromosomes. Fractional allelic loss, calculated for each sample as the total number of chromosomal arms lost/total number of arms with information, showed a median value of 0.04 and a mean of 0.123 (range, 0 to 0.95). This fractional allelic loss is lower than those reported for many solid tumors. This analysis shows the extreme power of LOH analysis using microsatellite markers in childhood ALL.",,,,,,,,,

In a mitoxantrone-selected human leukemia cell line, HL-60/MX2, cellular topoisomerase II (topo II) catalytic activity is decreased, in association with the finding of reduced nuclear topo II alpha and beta protein levels. In addition, HL-60/MX2 cells contain a novel M(r) 160,000 topo II alpha-related protein that localizes predominantly to the cell cytoplasm (W. G. Harker et al., Biochemistry, 30: 9953-9961, 1991). In these studies, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the altered expression of the topo II alpha protein(s) in these cells. Three topo II alpha mRNAs, 7.2, 6.3, and 4.8 kb, were identified in the HL-60/MX2 cells, with the 6.3 and 4.8 kb transcripts being present in roughly equivalent amounts, while the 7.2-kb mRNA represents < 7% of the total topo II alpha-specific mRNA. Portions of the 3'-coding and 3'-untranslated regions were found to be missing from the 7.2- and 4.8-kb topo II alpha mRNAs by Northern blot analysis. Sequences encoding the 3' regions of the normal and truncated forms of the topo II alpha enzyme were obtained from the HL-60/MX2 cells through the use of a 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends strategy. Approximately 1321 nucleotides are missing from the 3'-coding and 3'-untranslated regions of the 4.8-kb mRNA and are replaced by 122 nucleotides that contain an in-frame stop codon and consensus polyadenylation signal. The translation product of the truncated 4388-bp topo II alpha transcript would have a predicted M(r) of 157,850, with 108 COOH-terminal amino acids being replaced by 13 novel residues. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that amino acids in the COOH-terminal region of topo II alpha were missing from the M(r) 160,000 HL-60/MX2 protein, and antisera generated to a synthetic peptide representing the 13 unique amino acids identified a M(r) 160,000 protein in nuclear extracts from these cells. PCR evaluation of the organization of the 3' region of the topo II alpha gene revealed that the 4.8-kb mRNA found in HL-60/MX2 cells diverges from that of the 6.3-kb mRNA at a consensus exon-intron splice donor site. The 122-bp novel nucleotides identified in the truncated transcript appear to originate from an adjacent intron as a result of altered RNA processing. These studies suggest that as a result of the disruption of the carboxy terminus of the topo II alpha protein and the putative nuclear targeting sequences identified therein, cellular localization of the protein is altered, which may confer a growth advantage for the HL-60/MX2 cells in the presence of mitoxantrone.",,,,,,,,,

Translation appeared to start from the ATG codon created in the six nucleotides of unknown origin, which were inserted into the LTR/akt junction. The deduced molecular size is approximately M(r) 59,000 due to the addition of 33 amino acid residues to the normally expressed c-AKT protein. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of M(r) 59,000 molecules in an RL male 1 lysate, and their expression at about ten times the level of normal AKT molecules of M(r) 56,000, which is consistent with the increased expression of akt mRNA demonstrated by Northern blot analysis.

However, due to the poor viability of patient-derived acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in vitro, determination of this parameter in clinical samples is associated with a number of difficulties. We have therefore developed an assay for reduced MTX accumulation, which controls for the metabolic state of the cell population under study by utilizing accumulation of the nucleoside thymidine as an independent indicator of this parameter. To establish this assay, we have utilized pediatric leukemic cell populations maintained as xenografts in nude mice, which, despite displaying sensitivity to MTX, demonstrated reduced accumulation of MTX when assayed using standard methodology. When accumulation of MTX by such cell populations was expressed, however, relative to their accumulation of thymidine, MTX accumulation was shown to be equal to that of drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM cells maintained in long-term culture. In contrast, significantly less MTX was accumulated, in this assay, by xenografted cell populations with demonstrated resistance to MTX. Identical results were obtained using either fresh or cryopreserved cells. The data thus indicate that by controlling for variable metabolic status of leukemic cells, it is possible to accurately assess MTX accumulation in leukemic samples displaying limited viability in culture.",,,,,,,,,

Here we report on the importance of specific elements within the pseudoknot. Some mutations in stem S1 that maintain base pairing have reduced frameshift efficiencies. This indicates that base pairing in itself is not sufficient. In contrast, frameshifting correlates qualitatively with the calculated stability of mutations in S2. The stems thus play different roles in the frameshift event. The nature of the base in L1 has little influence on frameshift efficiency. It is however required to bridge S2; deleting it lowers frameshifting from 23 to 9%. In L2, frameshift efficiency was not affected in a mutant that changed 10 to 12 bases. This makes it unlikely that the primary sequence of L2 plays a role in -1 frameshifting, in contrast to readthrough in Moloney murine leukemia virus (Wills N, Gesteland R, Atkins J, 1994, EMBO J 13:4137-4144). Deletions of 2 and 3 bases gave more frameshifting than the wild type, probably reflecting the increased stability of the pseudoknot due to a shorter loop L2. Deleting even more bases reduces frameshifting compared to wild-type levels. At this point, stress will build up in L2, and this will reduce overall pseudoknot stability.",PMC1369068,,,,,,,,

Indirect immunofluorescence experiments showed that the distribution of the three antigens in the final matrix closely resembled that detected in permeabilized cells, particularly when the stabilization was performed at 37 degrees C.

The receptor was tested immunocytochemically, in steroid binding assays, and by a mutation screening (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) of the receptor-cDNA. The receptor concentration, as measured by staining and steroid binding test, varied considerably but showed no clear correlation to clinical response. Using a highly sensitive mutation screening assay of the DNA- and the steroid-binding region, none of the treated patients revealed any mutation, suggesting that the glucocorticoid receptor in the CLL patients tested is not altered in these domains. In one individual who had not been treated before analysis a silent mutation was found in one receptor allele. The results suggest that mechanisms other than altered ligand or DNA binding of the receptor may be responsible for the lack of response to chemotherapy.

In fact, the SB lymphoblast cell line, while resistant to infection by wild-type amphotropic mouse leukemia virus (A-MLV), was infected by GaLV-SEATO. We constructed vectors containing GaLV components and compared the performance of genomes containing an enhancer and promoter derived either from the SEATO or SF strains of GaLV. The GaLV vector genomes were packaged in a Moloney (Mo)MLV core with either an A-MLV or GaLV SEATO envelope. We found that, in some cases, the vector genome appeared to be critical in obtaining optimal infection. For example, vectors with a GaLV SF-based genome infected the human HL60 cell line, whereas vectors with a GaLV SEATO-based genome did not. We also found that most, but not all, of the human cell lines tested were more susceptible to vectors packaged with the GaLV SEATO than A-MLV envelope. The source of the viral core was also important, in that some human cells appeared susceptible to infection only with GaLV genomes packaged in particles composed of a GaLV core and envelope. Our results show that GaLV-based packageable genomes can be expressed in target cells not efficiently infected by vectors containing MoMLV-based genomes. These results suggest that judicious combinations of retroviral genomes and structural components can significantly improve gene transfer into human cells.",,,,,,,,,

These modifications included the addition of sequences which are predicted to have stem-loop secondary structures and addition of a wild-type tRNA processing site. TAR decoy RNA expressed in CEM cells from modified tRNA-based expression cassettes yielded five- to 20-fold more TAR transcripts than unmodified tRNA-based expression cassettes. HIV replication, as measured by a flow cytometric method to quantify intracellular viral p24 expression, was significantly reduced in polyclonal populations of CEM cells expressing a modified tRNA-TAR transcript that contains a wild-type tRNA processing site and stem-loops 5' and 3' to the TAR sequence. Similar modifications to the tRNA expression cassette also increased the intracellular concentration of a random test oligonucleotide, indicating that this improved expression system may also be useful for antisense and ribozyme based gene inhibition strategies.",,,,,,,,,

To alter the host range of the vector particle, we developed a method to substitute the receptor-binding domain of the envelope protein of a retrovirus with an antigen-binding site of an antibody. To test whether such particles are competent for infection, we established a model system using an antigen-binding site of an antibody against the hapten dinitrophenol (DNP). Retroviral vector particles containing such chimeric envelope proteins were able to bind to and infect cells that were not infectable with wild-type virus after DNP was conjugated to the cell surface. They did not infect such cells without DNP conjugation. Control experiments with chimeric envelope proteins of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (eco-MLV) and spleen necrosis virus (SNV) indicate that the pathway of virus entry of scA-env-containing virus particles was different from that of wild-type virus.",,,,,,,,,

We investigated the mechanisms involved in these effects by studying the influence of morphine on the pathogenesis of murine Friend retrovirus infection. The response to this opiate varied greatly according to the treatment schedule. Daily intra-peritoneal administration of morphine (50 mg/kg) for 16 to 27 days attenuated pathological manifestations in infected animals without modifying the mortality rate. The protective effect increased proportionately with the duration of treatment, and depended on the time of treatment initiation relative to inoculation. Naloxone (10 mg/kg/day i.p.) inhibited the morphine-induced decrease in both splenomegaly and viral titer. Mifepristone--a glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor--had no significant effect on the morphine-induced attenuation of splenomegaly. The influence of the infection on acute morphine toxicity was also analysed, using a non lethal dose in noninfected mice (200 mg/kg). Susceptibility to morphine increased in parallel to the development of the infection, with mortality rates ranging from 20% on D14 to 90% on D21. Simultaneous administration of naloxone (20-100 mg/kg) reduced the mortality rate and postponed death. Administration of mifepristone, terfenadin, phentolamine or propranolol did not modify mortality at the used doses. These findings show that the influence of morphine on the development of Friend virus infection in mice depends on the conditions of administration. The transient protective effect seen in certain conditions of administration seems to be due essentially to the direct effects of morphine on its specific receptors.",,,,Effets de la morphine sur l'infection murine par le retrovirus de Friend.,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1976-1991 the Swiss Pediatric Oncology Group (SPOG) observed 610 children and adolescents who were diagnosed with ALL before the age of 15 years, and who were prospectively treated according to different study protocols. Immunophenotyping of B-progenitor- or T-lineage ALL was possible in 573 children. Leucocyte count, age, and sex were compared with regard to immunophenotype of lymphoid cells and to event-free survival on Kaplan Meier curves by statistical analyses including multivariate analysis and the Cox regression backward elimination test. RESULTS: Of the 573 patients who were immunophenotyped 86.4% had B-progenitor ALL and 13.6% T-lineage ALL. The differences between B-progenitor ALL and T-lineage ALL with respect to initial white blood cell count, age and gender were significant. A comparison of event-free survival in children with B-progenitor ALL versus T-lineage ALL revealed significant differences in boys (p < 0.001) but not in girls (p = 0.183). Statistical tests showed gender to be an independent risk factor. CONCLUSION: The long-term outcome following identical treatment of both genders was significantly better in girls with T-lineage ALL than in boys. Girls with T-lineage ALL, but not boys with T-lineage ALL, had a prognostic outcome similar to children with B-progenitor ALL.",,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the complete transfusion records up to July 1993 of all 213 patients diagnosed with acute leukemia at our institution over the 4-year period 1987 to 1990. The transfusion protocol called for all patients requiring transfusion of red cell and/or platelet concentrates to initially receive components that were not leukocyte reduced. Patients suspected clinically to be refractory to platelets were tested for anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies and those that tested positive were switched to HLA-matched platelets. RESULTS: Of 184 patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 133 (72%) required platelet support, whereas all 29 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were transfused with platelets. The incidence of clinically suspected refractoriness to non-leukocyte-reduced platelets, which was confirmed by a positive test for anti-HLA antibodies and which resulted in a switch to HLA-matched platelets, was nine of 29 (31%) for patients with AML but only three of 133 (2.3%) for patients with ALL. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that clinically significant platelet refractoriness requiring transfusion of HLA-matched platelets occurs infrequently in childhood ALL. For this group of patients, use of leukocyte-depleted cellular components for the purpose of preventing platelet refractoriness cannot be justified. This approach may be appropriate for children with AML.",,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Eighteen patients had 11q23 translocations or insertions detected by cytogenetic analysis (15 cases) or by FISH (3 cases); 10 patients had t(9;11), all of whom had M5a. Eight patients had other 11q23 translocations or insertions not involving chromosome 9[t(11q23)] (four each had M4 or M5 leukemias). Eighteen cases with M4/M5 did not have 11q23 abnormalities. MLL rearrangements were found in all patients with translocations or insertions of 11q23 who were studied. Clinically, children with t(9;11) were indistinguishable from other patients with M4-M5 leukemias. In contrast, the t(11q23) group was characterized by extreme hyperleukocytosis, CNS disease, and skin involvement. Patients with the t(9;11) had a better outcome when compared with patients in the t(11q23) group (EFS +/- SE at 3 years, 56 +/- 17% versus 10 +/- 10%, p = 0.04), and to all the remaining children with M4-M5 leukemias (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cytogenetic, FISH, and molecular analysis provides a highly sensitive strategy for detection of 11q23/MLL gene rearrangements in childhood M4-M5 leukemias. Our more precise classification of these patients allows a more accurate correlation with outcome. The favorable prognostic significance of the t(9;11) should be confirmed in prospective studies including a larger number of children as well as adults.",,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) treatment of explanted ganglia elevated levels of SPR mRNA. By contrast, dissociated cultures of purified sympathetic neurons, purified fibroblasts, and purified Schwann cells each expressed only low levels of SPR mRNA, and treatment with the cytokine did not alter levels of the receptor mRNA. Treatment of Schwann cell or fibroblast cultures with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) also did not alter SPR mRNA. However, treatment of pure neuronal cultures with LIF significantly elevated levels of the receptor mRNA. Further, SPR mRNA increased in pure sympathetic neurons cultured in the presence of conditioned medium from IL-1 beta treated fibroblasts or Schwann cells; this effect was blocked in the presence of LIF antibody. This suggests that the stimulatory effects of IL-1 beta on SPR mRNA in explants is mediated by LIF release. Axotomy of the SCG in vivo resulted in a significant increase in LIF mRNA. Further, axotomy resulted in a significant increase in SPR mRNA, suggesting that LIF may mediate the increase in SPR mRNA. In view of the known effects of substance P (SP) on inflammatory responses, these observations suggest that coordinated expression of SP and SPR mRNA in neurons after nerve injury may participate in inflammatory and repair processes in the ganglion.",,,,,,,,,

Analogues with two alkylating functions (e.g. compounds 7 and 14) are the most cytotoxic, with 7 being 1000-fold more potent than the clinical mustard chlorambucil against P388 leukemia in culture, as well as being more potent in vivo. Monofunctional analogues were also significantly more cytotoxic than chlorambucil, despite bearing much less reactive mustard species. These results support the concept that targeting nitrogen mustard alkylating agents to DNA by attachment to DNA-affinic carriers can greatly enhance cytotoxicity due to alkylation, and that even for such DNA-targeted mustards, crosslinking is a more toxic event than monoalkylation. Close analogues of 7 differing only in their radius of curvature, appear to alkylate and crosslink DNA in similar fashion, yet have widely differing cytotoxicities. The most cytotoxic compound (7) possesses a geometry most complementary to that of duplex DNA, suggesting that the most toxic lesions are those which result in least DNA distortion, thus being less easily recognised by DNA repair systems.",,,,,,,,,

The isolates from both the obvious cases of tuberculosis and the suspect cases were obtained through the State of Alabama TB Laboratory, but these isolates originated at a commercial laboratory, a community hospital laboratory, and at a university hospital. MTB isolates were fingerprinted by probing for the insertion sequence IS6110. With each of the three pairs of isolates (case and suspicious case), identical IS6110 banding patterns were found suggesting identical MTB strains.

The present study was, therefore, designed to investigate the effects of OCT and calcitriol on: the proliferation and functions of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells; osteoclast-like cell formation from hemopoietic blast cells in the absence of stromal cells as well as from unfractionated bone cells in the presence of stromal cells; bone resorption; and the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells via monocytes. 22-Oxacalcitriol and calcitriol inhibited [3H]thymidine (TdR) incorporation, alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen synthesis of MC3T3-E1 cells to a similar degree.

It is a chiral drug and only the trans-isomer is pharmacologically active. Isomerisation to the inactive cis-lactone occurs in plasma. The cis-lactone is often present in ultrafiltrates of plasma from patients treated with etoposide, therefore it is important to separate the isomers when free etoposide concentrations are assayed. There is reason to believe that free and cellular concentrations are more important for the effect of etoposide therapy than total plasma concentrations. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for quantification of etoposide and its cis-isomer in plasma, total and non-protein-bound concentrations, and in leukaemic cells is described. After addition of teniposide as internal standard the drugs were extracted with chloroform. Etoposide, its cis-isomer, teniposide and endogenous substances were separated isocratically on a Spherisorb phenyl reversed-phase column. Detection was performed fluorometrically, lambda ex/em = 230/330 nm. Non-protein-bound concentrations were determined after ultrafiltration. The detection limit for etoposide was 10 ng/ml plasma, 25 ng/ml ultrafiltrate and 10 ng/50 x 10(6) cells. The sensitivity of the assay for the cis-lactone was twice as high due to higher fluorescence. The protein binding of the cis-lactone in plasma from ten healthy blood donors was 54.5 +/- 4.8% (mean +/- S.D.). Thus, the free fraction was about ten-fold higher than that of the mother compound. The assay is convenient and sensitive enough for the determination of free and cellular fractions of etoposide.",,,,,,,,,

Using a B cell deficient mouse model in which mice receive either control rabbit immunoglobulin (RIgG) or rabbit anti-IgM mu chain from birth (B cell deficient), we evaluated whether B cells were necessary for T cell responses to MiHC and the induction of GHVD. Normal and B cell deficient C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice were primed with BALB.B (H-2b; MiHC incompatible) spleen cells and evaluated > 4 weeks later in vitro. While splenic or lymph node T cells obtained from BALB.B primed control C57BL/6 mice demonstrated strong in vitro proliferative responses to MiHC mismatched targets, B cell deficient hosts were markedly reduced to 14-42% of controls. Similarly, a strong MiHC specific cytolytic T cell response was observed in control C57BL/6 mice (53-100% specific cytotoxicity) whereas B cell depleted recipients had no activity (< or = 5% specific lysis). The role of B cells in GVHD was evaluated using a MiHC disparate mouse model (LP/J donor into C57BL/6 recipient). We found that 12% of B cell depleted recipient mice receiving B cell depleted donor cells developed GVHD compared to 50% of RIgG control mice.

We have analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a female bone marrow graft recipient, collected during graft rejection after a sex mismatched HLA-identical BMT. A CTL line was generated by stimulating recipient PBMC collected during graft rejection with donor PBMC and donor EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. From this CTL line a large number of clones of different specificity and phenotype was established by limiting dilution. These clones exhibited several mH antigen specificities, restricted by HLA-B7, -B27 or -DR2 as shown by differential recognition of family members and unrelated individuals sharing potential restriction elements. The CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ bulk culture was cloned, resulting in 50 HLA-B7 restricted CD3+CD4-CD8+CTL clones, three HLA-B27 restricted CD3+CD4-CD8+CTL clones, one HLA-DR2 restricted CD3+CD4+CD8-CTL clone and two additional HLA class II restricted CD3+CD4+CD8-CTL clones with a different specificity. One representative clone of each specificity was selected for further analysis. The CTL line and the HLA-B7 restricted CD8+CTL clone, but not the HLA class II restricted CD4+ CTL clone, inhibited the growth of donor hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). In conclusion, these results show that graft rejection after HLA-identical BMT may be mediated by multiple CTL clones that specifically recognize one mH antigen peptide presented by different HLA molecules or different mH antigens expressed on donor cells and that CTL, but not CD4+ CTL inhibited donor HPC growth.",,,,,,,,,

In the same combination, the graft of T-depleted bone marrow cells also results in no GVHD (TCD BM mice). Both groups of mice exhibit a host specific tolerance. In this paper, we examined whether a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect can still take place without lethal GVHD in LS and TCD BM mice. The i.v. injection of P815 tumor cells into these mice, 2-3 months after the graft, indicates an antitumor activity in LS mice but not in TCD BM mice. When the P815 cells were administered 1 day before irradiation and graft, the leukemic mortality was significantly delayed in mice reconstituted with BM and spleen cells from a preimmunized donor, but not in mice reconstituted with T cell-depleted BM. In LS mice, a subclinical GVHD develops, probably due to CTL alloreactivity against host mHAgs that is observed in vitro. Moreover, cell depletion of the donor inoculum before grafting indicates that the antitumor effect is exclusively mediated by CD8+ T cells. In summary, a beneficial GVL effect, mediated by CD8+ T cells, can be preserved without lethal GVHD.",,,,,,,,,

Twenty three patients died: 4 patients of leukemic relapse, 9 of infection, 2 of acute GVHD, 2 of multiorgan failure after chronic GVHD, 2 of a secondary tumour and 4 patients died of other causes. Several pre- and post-transplant characteristics were analyzed to determine predictive factors for survival, relapse and GVHD. The relapse rate was significantly influenced by the type of conditioning regimen with no relapse in the TBI, Ara C, melphalan group. The analysis of long-term sequelae shows that there are no severe complications in this last group. Our results confirm that allogeneic BMT can lead to long-term survival for children with ALL in second CR and suggest an advantage of using the TAM conditioning regimen in the eradication of the leukemic disease.",,,,,,,,,

However relapse remains a major problem. One approach to this is myeloablative chemotherapy with transplantation of autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). Immunological mechanisms have been suggested to play a role in the prevention of relapse after transplantation. We investigated the recovery of cellular immune functions after high-dose chemotherapy and PBPC transplantation in 5 patients with high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. All patients showed rapid reconstitution of natural killer (NK) and inducible lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)-activity 10-14 days after transplantation. Four of 5 patients showed higher levels of LAK-generation in the post-transplant period compared with levels prior to myeloablative treatment. Absolute lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood reached 1.0 x 10(9)/l between days 10 and 13 with a predominance of CD8+ cells and an inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. Four of 5 patients had a transient increase in CD56+ and CD16+ cell counts post-transplant. No change in the proportion of CD25+ cells was noted. These results show that PBPC transplantation leads to a rapid recovery of cellular immune functions after myeloablative chemotherapy and provides evidence for an increased presence of LAK precursor cells early in the post-transplant period which can be activated by IL-2 to exert high levels of cytotoxicity.,,,,,,,,,

We therefore studied monocyte activation after BMT in 36 patients (18 allografts and 18 autografts); plasma neopterin and in vitro secretion of superoxide, neopterin and TNF by peripheral blood monocytes were assessed. Monocyte respiratory burst was raised at regeneration but returned to near-normal within 7 days. Plasma neopterin, and in vitro secretion of neopterin and TNF, were greater than twice normal at regeneration and remained raised for up to 6 weeks after BMT. Plasma neopterin was higher following allogeneic BMT than autologous BMT and was independent of GVHD or VOD. Low levels were seen in one patient who failed to engraft. There is evidence of increased activation of monocytes at the time of and for several weeks after engraftment post-BMT. Abnormal monocyte activation may predispose to, rather than result from, the development of complications in the early post-transplant period.",,,,,,,,,

This fact excludes the majority of such patients from consideration for BMT at many centers. We sought to determine if prophylactic treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril prevents this deterioration in pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction. We treated six consecutive patients with initial left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) by radionuclide gated blood pool imaging (RGBP) of < 50% (42 +/- 7%) with enalapril 5 mg orally twice per day started 48 h prior to induction therapy and continued throughout the follow-up period. Serial RGBP imaging demonstrated an increase in LVEF in all patients to 54 +/- 6% (P < 0.005). No patient experienced clinical deterioration during a follow-up period of 18 +/- 11 months. We conclude that prophylactic treatment with enalapril may prevent deterioration in pre-existing mild left ventricular dysfunction during BMT.,,,,,,,,,

The median bilirubin on day 15 after transplant and the maximum bilirubin in the first 100 days were significantly higher in 155 patients with ABO-mismatched donors compared with 322 patients with ABO-matched donors. In univariate analysis, age > 16 years (P = 0.000006), ABO incompatibility (P = 0.0004), a conditioning regimen other than cyclophosphamide-total body irradiation (P = 0.0005) and a diagnosis other than acute leukemia (P = 0.01) were associated with a higher probability of developing elevated bilirubin. Incidence of clinically diagnosed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and transplant-related mortality, relapse rates and overall survival were not influenced by ABO incompatibility. The hyperbilirubinemia was therefore unlikely to be the result of an increased incidence of hepatic complications such as GVHD or veno-occlusive disease.

Two cell lines, one predominantly of the CTMC and the other of the MMC phenotype, were selected for further study. Among these, the phenotype was also confirmed by analysis for rat mast cell protease I and by mediator release triggered by compound 48/80 and ionophore A23187. The CTMC phenotype disappeared after culturing cells for 2 weeks. The change in phenotype did not significantly alter the mediator release due to calcium ionophore A23187. Repeated cloning of cells bearing the CTMC phenotype did not yield a cloned line of cells expressing the CTMC phenotype only, although it prolonged the persistence of this phenotype.

In addition, L1210 parental cells were compared to a subline, L1210A, expressing high levels of mFBP and defective reduced folate carrier. Antifolates for which KB-derived mFBP has high affinity (5, 10-dideazatetrahydrofolic acid [DDATHF] and homo-DDATHF [0.24 and 0.78 respectively relative to folic acid]) and low affinity (methotrexate [0.002]) were chosen for this study. Protection against DDATHF/homo-DDATHF induced cytotoxicity was achieved preferentially by folic acid compared to folinic acid in IGROV1 and L1210A cells. In IGROV1 cells, cytotoxicity IC50s were increased 18- and 5.5-fold for DDATHF and homo-DDATHF respectively by 20 nM folic acid. Moreover, greater protection was observed in L1210A cells, where IC50s were increased 354- and 80-fold for these same compounds by 20 nM folic acid. Similar protection was not observed in KB cells, suggesting that KB mFBP was not functional in DDATHF transport.

Only minor differences were noted in the CPT IC50s for the topoisomerase I activity in extracts from the two CPT-resistant cell lines, however, despite the marked differences in cellular sensitivity to CPT. There were notable differences in the level of CPT-induced cleavage of DNA oligonucleotides by topoisomerase I in nuclear extracts from CEM cells compared with the drug-resistant cell extracts, with very little oligonucleotide cleavage induced by enzyme in either drug-resistant cell type, despite the use of very high (100 microM) CPT concentrations. The alterations in topoisomerase I catalytic activity were associated with reduced cellular levels of both immunoreactive topoisomerase I protein (representing 59 +/- 19% [CEM/C1] and 49 +/- 12% [CEM/C2] of that in CEM, respectively) and mRNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

However, both sublines carry two identical point mutations in topo II alpha cDNA that have recently been found to confer resistance to etoposide and m-AMSA in transfected yeast cells. Although these data provide a strong molecular basis for this type of multidrug resistance, these findings alone cannot explain the increased level of resistance and cross-resistance, and the further decreased cellular topo II activities in the most resistant CEM/VM-1-5 cells compared to CEM/VM-1 cells. In this study we found that (1) topo II beta is not expressed in CEM/VM-1-5 cells; (2) a 160-kDa protein was consistently detected and coimmunoprecipatated only in nuclear extracts of CEM cells; (3) when nuclear extracts from all three cell lines were incubated at 37 degrees C, an immunoreactive band of 140-kDa appeared by 60-90 min only in samples of CEM cells, not in those of CEM/VM-1 and CEM/VM-1-5 cells; and (4) the in vivo phosphorylation level of topo II alpha protein was decreased > or = 2-fold in both resistant cell lines, compared to that of CEM cells.

Rashes and neutropenia have not previously been reported as thalidomide side effects when used for CGVHD treatment. We conclude thalidomide is immunosuppressive and active in the treatment of CGVHD.

Standard serologic HLA typing of potential donors and recipients was supplemented with one-dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF) for class I proteins, allogenotyping for DR and DQ alleles using DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and the measurement of antirecipient major histocompatibility complex (MHC) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor cells in the donors' blood (CTLp assay). Recipients were conditioned for transplantation with a combination of high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation (n = 103) or high-dose chemotherapy alone (n = 12). Twenty eight recipients received ex vivo T-cell-depleted marrow, and 84 underwent some form of in vivo T-cell depletion. The probability of severe (grades III or IV) acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 24%, and that of extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), 38%. Proportional hazards regression analysis showed an association between low frequency CTLp and a reduced incidence of severe aGVHD (relative risk [RR], 0.28; P = .0035). The probability of relapse at 3 years was 23%, with first chronic phase disease being independently associated with a lower risk of relapse (RR, 0.71; P = .01). The overall leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 3 years was 37%; the LFS for the first chronic phase and advanced phase recipients was 41% and 26%, respectively. First chronic phase disease (RR, 0.56; P = .063) and the combination of recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegativity and an IEF-matched donor (RR, 0.48; P = .011) were both associated with improved LFS. The probabilities of survival and LFS for patients under 40 years of age transplanted in first chronic phase from an IEF-matched donor were 73% and 50%, respectively. We conclude that VUD BMT is a reasonable option for patients with CML; when using ex vivo or in vivo T-cell depletion, optimal results are achieved in patients transplanted in chronic phase with marrow from donors without demonstrable class I HLA mismatch and a low CTLp frequency.",,,,,,,,,

Therapy-related MDS and AML (t-MDS and t-AML) may serve as an ideal model for a study of the genetic evolution of MDS and AML because chromosomal abnormalities are observed in most cases and because the disease is often diagnosed early due to a close patient follow-up. The cytogenetic characteristics at diagnosis were studied in 137 consecutive cases of t-MDS and t-AML, including 22 new cases, and correlated with the clinical characteristics and the course of the disease. Balanced translocations to chromosome bands 11q23 and 21q22 represent primary steps in pathways leading directly to overt t-AML. Specific chromosomal deletions or losses, on the other hand, represent primary or secondary events in alternative pathways leading to t-MDS with potential for subsequent transformation to overt t-AML. Loss of a whole chromosome 7 (-7) or deletion of its long arm (7q-) and deletion of the long arm of a chromosome 5 (5q-) were the most frequent primary abnormalities significantly related to t-MDS. Loss of a whole chromosome 5 (-5) was also a primary event, but surprisingly, was observed equally in t-MDS and in t-AML. Deletion of chromosome 13, including bands q13q14, was another less common primary aberration of t-MDS. Except for -7 and del(13q), these primary aberrations were most often observed together with secondary abnormalities. These included balanced aberrations involving band 3q26 and various deletions of chromosome 3, a gain of a whole chromosome 8, deletions of the short arm or loss of chromosomes 12 and 17, loss of a whole chromosome 18, and deletions of the short arm of chromosome 21. Deletions or loss or chromosomes 5 and 7 were significantly associated with previous therapy with alkylating agents (P = .002), and balanced translocations to chromosome bands 3q26, 11q23, and 21q22 were significantly associated with previous therapy with drugs targeting DNA-topoisomerase II (P < .00005). Other characteristic aberrations were not related to any specific type of therapy. The molecular changes believed to contribute to the development of t-MDS and t-AML have been identified for many of these chromosomal abnormalities.",,,,,,,,,

Cultured blasts (days 0, 3, 6, and 9) were washed, resuspended in phosphate buffer, lysed by freezing and thawing, and then assayed for procoagulant activity (PCA), elastase activity, tissue factor (TF) antigen, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) antigen. PCA was determined by a recalcification assay. Elastase was measured by an amidolytic assay (S-2484). TF, t-PA, and u-PA antigens were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Malignant promyelocytes isolated from the patients had increased levels of PCA and TF as compared with the control polymorphonucleates, and low levels of elastase, t-PA, and u-PA; the patient blast PCA level was significantly related to the degree of hypofibrinogenemia. In this system, blast PCA depended on the tissue factor and was significantly correlated to the TF antigen values. In the cultures without ATRA, PCA, TF, and u-PA progressively increased, whereas elastase and t-PA levels remained essentially unchanged. In the presence of ATRA, all parameters (except u-PA) decreased during the culture time. Thus, a major role of the promyelocytic blast cell PCA in the pathogenesis of M3-related coagulopathy is suggested; the ATRA effect on coagulopathy seems mainly mediated by a downregulation of the PCA.",,,,,,,,,

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether granzyme B and perforin could be expressed in human hematopoietic CD34+ cells and if present, discover what their physiologic relevance could be. The primitive CD34+ human cell line KG1a was investigated first and was found to express granzyme B and perforin. Highly purified hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were then selected using the CD34 surface antigen as marker. Steady-state bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells did not contain these proteins. Peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cells, which had been induced to circulate, were also analyzed. After chemotherapy (CT) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment, CD34+ cells strongly expressed mRNAs and proteins of granzyme B and perforin. In contrast, CD34+ cells mobilized by G-CSF alone were negative. Western blot analysis further showed that granzyme B and perforin proteins were identical in CD34+ cells and activated PBLs. Such proteins might be implicated in the highly efficient migration of CD34+ stem/progenitor cells from BM to PB after CT and G-CSF treatment. The cellular adhesion mechanisms involved in the BM homing of CD34+ cells are disrupted at least temporarily after CT. The Asp-ase proteolytic activity of granzyme B on extracellular matrix proteins could be used by progenitor cells for their rapid detachment from BM stromal cells and perforin might facilitate their migration across the endothelial cell barrier.",,,,,,,,,

This procedure involves incubating the cells of interest for 16 to 24 hours in a serum-free medium containing 100 ng/mL Steel factor (SF), 20 ng/mL interleukin-3 (IL-3), and 20 ng/mL granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), with or without 20 microCi/mL of high specific activity 3H-thymidine (3H-Tdr) before plating the recovered cells in standard LTC-IC assays. The details of this procedure are based in part on the finding that the number of LTC-IC (regardless of their cycling status) remains constant for at least 24 hours under these culture conditions, as long as 3H-Tdr is not present. In addition, we have determined that a 16-hour period of exposure to the 3H-Tdr is sufficient to maximize the discrimination of cycling LTC-IC but not long enough to allow a detectable redistribution of LTC-IC between noncycling and cycling compartments. Finally, any isotope reutilization that may occur is not sufficient to affect the LTC-IC 3H-Tdr suicide values measured. Application of this methodology to normally circulating LTC-IC showed these to be a primarily quiescent population. However, within 72 hours of incubation in a serum-free medium containing SF, IL-3, and G-CSF, most had entered S-phase, although there was no net change in their numbers. This suggests that, under certain conditions in vitro, self-renewal divisions of LTC-IC can occur and, at least initially, balance any losses of these cells due to their differentiation or death. In contrast, many of the LTC-IC in freshly aspirated samples of normal marrow were found to be proliferating, although those that were initially quiescent could also be recruited into S-phase within 72 hours in vitro when incubated under the same conditions used to stimulate circulating LTC-IC. This modified 3H-Tdr suicide procedure should facilitate further investigation of the mechanisms regulating the turnover of the most primitive compartments of human hematopoietic cells and how these may be altered in disease states or exploited for a variety of therapeutic applications.",,,,,,,,,

All patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation and received a combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Fourty-six patients received transplants from HLA-identical donors and 42 patients received transplants from donors who were minor-mismatched at one HLA-A or B or D/DRB1 locus. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of disease-free survival and relapse were 75% and 0% for patients with CML, 47% and 20% for ALL in first or second remission, 10% and 60% for ALL in relapse or third remission, 46% and 46% for AML in first remission (n = 1) or more advanced disease (n = 12), and 29% and 69% for other diseases. HLA disparity was not significantly associated with lower disease-free survival, but the results suggest more relapses in HLA-matched recipients and there was significantly more transplant-related mortality in mismatched recipients (51% v 24%, P = .04). Most deaths were due to infections associated with acute or chronic GVHD and occurred within the first 2 years after transplantation. Granulocyte engraftment occurred in all evaluable patients. Sixty-three percent of HLA-matched and 57% of HLA-mismatched recipients were discharged home disease-free at a median of 98 and 103 days, respectively, after transplantation (P = not significant [NS]). The incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD was 83% in HLA-matched and 98% in HLA-mismatched recipients (P = .009). The incidence of chronic GVHD was 60% in HLA-matched and 69% in HLA-mismatched recipients (P = NS). One or multiple late adverse events such as cataracts, osteonecrosis of the hip or knee, restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypothyroidism have occurred in 11 of 33 (33%) surviving patients. Immunosuppression was discontinued in 58% of surviving patients, including all 12 patients surviving more than 3.2 years, all of whom have a Lansky or Karnofsky score of 100%. These data show that marrow transplantation from fully or partially HLA-matched unrelated donors can be effective therapy for children with hematologic disorders and that pretransplantation disease status and posttransplantation GVHD remain important factors affecting patient outcome.",,,,,,,,,

We performed a retrospective survey in 14 BMT units in Italy in which all BMTs performed between 1984 and 1994 were reviewed and those involving HBsAg+ donors were identified. Donors and recipients were analyzed for HBV markers and liver disease. A total of 24 of 2,586 patients (0.9%) had received an HBsAg+ marrow. HBsAg became detectable in 22% of pre-BMT HBsAg- patients, but only 5.5% became chronic HBsAg carriers. Antigenemia developed more frequently in anti-HBs- compared with anti-HBs+ patients independently of passive prophylaxis with hyperimmune anti-HBs Ig, although the difference was not significant. Severe liver failure with death occurred in 21% of patients, which was a value greater than that generally observed after BMT in our units (3.7%). Patients with an anti-HBe+ donor had higher frequency of liver failure (28% v 0%) and alanine aminotransferase peaks as compared with those of patients with an HBeAg+ donor. Liver failure was not observed in anti-HBs+ recipients. The use of HBsAg+ donors, particularly if anti-HBe+, increases the risk of severe liver disease in BMT recipients. Anti-HBs positivity may prevent severe liver damage.",,,,,,,,,

The regulation of IRE-BP in situ could possibly occur either through its Fe-S cluster and/or via free cysteine sulphydryl groups such as cysteine 437 (Philpott et al, J Biol Chem 268:17655, 1993; and Hirling et al, EMBO J 13:453, 1994). Recently, nitrogen monoxide (NO) has been shown to have markedly different biologic effects depending on its redox state (Lipton et al, Nature 364:626, 1993). Considering this fact, it is conceivable that the NO group, as either the nitrosonium ion (NO+) or nitric oxide (NO+), may regulate IRE-BP activity by S-nitrosylation of key sulphydryl groups or via ligation of NO. to the Fe-S cluster, respectively. This hypothesis has been examined using the NO+ generator, sodium nitroprusside (SNP); the NO. generator, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP); and the NO./peroxynitrite (ONOO-) generator, 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1). Treatment of K562 cells for 18 hours with SNP (1 mmol/L) resulted in a pronounced decrease in both the RNA-binding activity of IRE-BP and the level of TfR mRNA. In addition, Scatchard analysis showed a marked decrease in the number of specific Tf-binding sites, from 590,000/cell (control) to 170,000/cell (test), and there was also a distinct decrease in Fe uptake. Furthermore, SNP did not decrease cellular viability or proliferation. In contrast, the NO. generator, SNAP (1 mmol/L), increased RNA-binding activity of IRE-BP, the level of TfR mRNA, and the number of TfRs in K562 cells. Moreover, both SNAP (1 mmol/L) and SIN-1 (0.5 mmol/L) reduced cellular proliferation. The results are discussed in context of the possible physiologic role of redox-related species of NO in regulating iron metabolism.",,,,,,,,,

Cell lines exhibiting megakaryocytic or erythrocytic phenotypes had GATA-1, GATA-2, and SCL gene transcripts, while monocytic cell lines had no detectable GATA-1, GATA-2, or SCL gene mRNA.

The RT-PCR was optimized by (1) increasing the amount of total RNA involved in the reverse transcription reaction to correspond to total RNA extracted from 10(8) cells, (2) using a specific abl primer in this reverse reaction, and (3) reamplifying 10% of the RT-PCR product in nested amplification.

Upon cellular activation, expression of the L-selectin gene is downregulated at both the protein and mRNA levels. To understand the mechanism of leukemic cell infiltration into organs, we studied the expression and regulation of L-selectin mRNA in fresh leukemic cells of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients and investigated the response of the L-selectin promoter to human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax, which is a viral transcriptional transactivator. Flow cytometry showed that L-selectin was expressed on fresh ATL cells along with other activation antigens. Northern blot analysis showed that ATL cells overexpressed that L-selectin mRNA and that the level was aberrantly upregulated after PMA stimulation. Studies using in situ hybridization showed expression of the L-selectin mRNA in the infiltrating leukemic cells in the liver of two ATL patients. Intravenous injection of a rat T-cell line that overexpresses L-selectin showed increased organ infiltration. The induction of Tax expression in JPX9 cells resulted in about a twofold increase in the mRNA expression levels compared with the basal level. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay after transient cotransfection showed about a fivefold transactivation of the L-selectin promoter by Tax. The serum level of the shed form of L-selectin was significantly increased in ATL patients (mean +/- SD, 4,215.4 +/- 4,111 ng/mL) compared with those of asymptomatic carriers and healthy blood donors (mean +/- SD, 1,148.0 +/- 269.0 ng/mL and 991.9 +/- 224 ng/mL, respectively). These results indicated that ATL cells constitutively overexpress the L-selectin gene that can be transactivated by HTLV-1 Tax. The overexpression of L-selectin, as well as of inflammatory cytokines, by ATL cells may provide a basis for ATL cells to attach the vascular endothelium, leading to transmigration and organ infitration.",,,,,,,,,

Treatment consisted of cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, etoposide induction and a 6-week seven-drug consolidation chemotherapy, followed by two blocks of high-dose cytosine arabinoside with or without cranial irradiation and maintenance therapy for 1 year. Five-year event-free survival for patients with immunophenotypic data was .43 +/- .03 SE. The diagnostic value of the pan-myeloid reagents CD13, CD33, and CDw65 for the recognition of childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was high with a sensitivity of 98% (positivity of at least one of these antigens), whereas, with the exception of CD41 for French American British (FAB) subtype M7, the expression of single cell-surface antigens showed no correlation with morphologic or cytogenetic subgroups. On the other hand, characteristic subgroups of AML defined by morphologic features and karyotypes could be described by low or high rates of surface antigen expression compared with those of other patients. These immunophenotypic features most probably associated with specific entities include expression of CD34 or CD13 and absence of CD14 or CD4 in M2 with Auer rods/t(8;21); absence of HLA-DR, CD34, and CD14, but expression of CD33 in M3/t(15;17); positivity of either CD34 or CD13 and either CD14 or CD2 for M4Eo/inv(16); and absence of either CD34 or CD13 and expression of either CD33 or CDw65 and either CD15 or CD4 for M5/t(9;11). In FAB M0, negativity of one or two of the three panmyeloid-associated markers (CD13/33/w65) was common; and cytogenetic results frequently showed random abnormalities. Expression of lymphoid-, progenitor- and most myeloid-associated antigens had no influence on the prognosis, whereas the outcome was significantly better for children with M2 with Auer rods, M3, or M4Eo or for those with the associated karyotypes t(8;21);t(15;17) and inv(16) than for other patients.",,,,,,,,,

We investigated the potential for overexpression of RBTN-2 to cause tumors in T cells and other tissues by constructing transgenic mice that expressed RBTN-2 under control of the metallothionein-1 promoter. Despite overexpression of RBTN-2 in all tissues, transgenic mice developed T-cell tumors only, thus indicating that tumorigenesis caused by RBTN-2 is T-cell-specific. Thymic tumors were found between 37 and 71 weeks and were invariably associated with metastasis to nonlymphoid organs. Thymuses from apparently healthy transgenic mice were also examined. In some mice there was an 10-fold increase in the CD4-CD8- thymocyte subset, yet the total number of thymocytes was the same as that in wild-type mice. Thymic homeostasis was maintained by a compensatory reduction in the CD4+CD8+ subset. The expansion of CD4-CD8- thymocytes was associated with increased expression of RBTN-2 and with increased cell proliferation. No differences were found in the proportion of thymocytes undergoing apoptosis in transgenic mice. Furthermore, RBTN-2-induced expansion of CD4-CD8- cells did not block differentiation of these cells. Thymuses with 30% CD4-CD8- cells were essentially monoclonal, indicating that all thymic immunophenotypes were derived from a single clone. Overall, our data are consistent with the following scenario: (1) RBTN-2 expression in T cells causes selective and polyclonal proliferation of CD4-CD8- thymocytes accompanied by a compensatory decrease in other thymocyte subsets; (2) a clone with growth advantage and differentiation potential is selected and populates the thymus; and (3) this clone eventually breaches homeostasis of the thymus, accompanied or followed by metastasis to other organs.",,,,,,,,,

TCF-1 mRNA was originally found to be expressed in a T cell-specific fashion within a set of human and mouse cell lines. In contrast, expression reportedly occurs in multiple nonlymphoid tissues during murine embryogenesis. We have now raised a monoclonal antibody to document expression and biochemistry of the human TCF-1 protein. As expected, the TCF-1 protein was detectable only in cell lines of T lineage. Its expression was always restricted to the nucleus. Immunohistochemistry on a panel of human tissues revealed that the TCF-1 protein was found exclusively in thymocytes and in CD3+ T cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues. Western blotting yielded a set of bands ranging from 25 kD to 55 kD, resulting from extensive alternative splicing. The TCF-1 protein was detectable in all samples of a set of 22 T-cell malignancies of various stages of maturation, but was absent from a large number of other hematologic neoplasms. These observations imply a T cell-specific function for TCF-1, a notion corroborated by recent observations on Tcf-1 knock-out mice. In addition, these results indicate that nuclear TCF-1 expression can serve as a pan-T-lineage marker in the diagnosis of lymphoid malignancies.",,,,,,,,,

The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin is expressed in a variety of cell types, but in cells of hematopoietic lineage, expression is restricted to megakaryocytes and platelets. Increased expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin during megakaryocytic differentiation is a consequence of transcriptional activation of the alpha 2 gene. We have begun to characterize the role of the 5' flanking region of the alpha 2 integrin gene in regulating expression during megakaryocyte differentiation. A 5-kb fragment of the 5' region directs both cell type and differentiation-dependent expression of a reporter gene in the pluripotent hematopoietic K562 cells upon megakaryocytic differentiation and in the megakaryocytic cell line, Dami. Analysis of a series of 5' deletion mutants indicates that expression of the alpha 2 integrin gene in cells with megakaryocytic features requires a core promoter region, a silencer region, and megakaryocytic enhancers in the distal 5' end. The organization of these three distinct regulatory regions of the alpha 2 promoter/enhancer suggests a common theme for megakaryocytic gene regulation shared with other megakaryocyte-specific proteins, including alpha IIb integrin subunit and platelet factor 4.",,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that promoters of myeloid-specific genes that are upregulated with myelomonocytic differentiation would also upregulate expression of an exogenous gene in a retroviral vector. Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV)-based retroviral vectors using promoters from hematopoietic genes (CD11b, CD18, and CD34) were compared with vectors with viral promoters (MoMuLV long terminal repeat [LTR], cytomegalovirus [CMV], and simian virus 40 [SV40]). Human glucocerebrosidase (GC) cDNA was the reporter gene. HL60 cells were transduced with these vectors and vector-derived GC activity was compared in undifferentiated HL-60 cells and the same cells differentiated into granulocytes using dimethyl sulfoxide or monocyte/macrophages using phorbol myristate acetate. In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, vector-derived GC activity was the highest when it was controlled by the MoMuLV LTR. In HL-60 cells differentiated into granulocytes, vector-derived GC activity transcribed from the CD11b, MoMuLV LTR, and CMV promoters was equivalent to 1.7, 1.5, and 1.5 times the normal endogenous GC activity, respectively, and 0.8, 2.0, and 3.6 times the normal GC activity, respectively, in those differentiated into macrophages. With granulocytic differentiation, the CD11b promoter showed maximal induction in GC activity (8-fold); with macrophage differentiation, the CD11b promoter showed a fourfold induction in GC expression. The CD11b promoter also generated significant levels of GC activity in the myelomonocytic progeny of transduced CD34+ cells. Expression from the CD11b promoter, unlike that from the CMV or the MoMuLV LTR promoters, was relatively myelomonocyte-specific, with minimal expression observed in Jurkat T cells or HeLa carcinoma cells. The induction of expression from the CD11b promoter with differentiation in HL-60 cells correlates with the developmental regulation of the CD11b gene. Retroviral vectors using the CD11b promoter have potential utility for gene therapy of disorders affecting the myelomonocytic lineage.",,,,,,,,,

In addition, expression of particular isoforms of CD44 has been associated with malignant transformation and/or the acquisition of metastatic potential. In this study, we used two recently developed monoclonal anti-CD44 antibodies, one reactive with an epitope shared by many CD44 isoforms and the other with an epitope unique to CD44 isoforms containing amino acids encoded by the alternatively spliced exon v10, to compare the expression of CD44 on primitive hematopoietic cells from the marrow of normal individuals and their neoplastic counterparts present in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Multiparameter fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis and cell sorting studies showed that CD44 is normally expressed at high to very high levels on both long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) and granulopoietic colony-forming cells (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units [CFU-GM]). In contrast, primitive erythropoietic progenitors (burst-forming units-erythroid [BFU-E]) in normal marrow were more homogeneous in their expression of CD44, and very few (less than 5%) showed the very high levels of CD44 seen on 20% to 25% of LTC-IC and CFU-GM. Antibody staining showed the expression of exon v10-containing CD44 isoforms to be restricted to a small subpopulation (4% to 8%) of morphologically recognizable mature (CD34-) myeloid cells within the light-density fraction of normal marrow cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed the presence of two exon v10-containing mRNA species. In CML, a significantly greater proportion of the circulating neoplastic CFU-GM expressed very high levels of CD44, and these CFU-GM were accompanied by an increased number of light density v10+ cells, including some that coexpressed CD34. Nonmalignant hematopoietic progenitors mobilized by prior chemotherapy and growth factor treatment of patients with Hodgkin's disease or acute myeloid leukemia in remission showed no changes in CD44 expression relative to normal marrow progenitors. These results provide evidence of early differentiation-associated changes in CD44 expression during normal hematopoiesis in vivo that may be deregulated in the neoplastic clone of patients with CML.",,,,,,,,,

The retained capacity of differentiation is the basis for the phenotypic classification of the bulk population of leukemic blasts and the identification of distinct subpopulations. Within the hierarchy of hematopoietic development and differentiation it is still unknown at which stage the malignant transformation occurs. It was our aim to analyze the potential involvement of cells with the immunophenotype of pluripotent stem cells in the leukemic process by the use of cytogenetic and cell sorting techniques. Cytogenetic analyses of bone marrow aspirates were performed in 13 patients with AML (11 de novo and 2 secondary) and showed karyotype abnormalities in 10 cases [2q+, +4, 6p, t(6:9), 7, +8 in 1 patient each and inv(16) in 4 patients each]. Aliquots of the samples were fractionated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of CD34+ cells. Two subpopulations, CD34+/CD38- (early hematopoietic stem cells) and CD34+/CD38+ (more mature progenitor cells), were screened for karyotype aberations as a marker for leukemic cells. Clonal abnormalities and evaluable metaphases were found in 8 highly purified CD34+/CD38- populations and in 9 of the CD34+/CD38- specimens, respectively. In the majority of cases (CD34+/CD38-, 6 of 8 informative samples; CD34+/CD38+, 5 of 9 informative samples), the highly purified CD34+ specimens also contained cytogenetically normal cells. Secondary, progression-associated chromosomal changes (+8, 12) were identified in the CD34+/CD38- cells of 2 patients. We conclude that clonal karyotypic abnormalities are frequently found in the stem cell-like (CD34+/CD38-) and more mature (CD34+/CD38+) populations of patients with AML, irrespective of the phenotype of the bulk population of leukemic blasts and of the primary or secondary character of the leukemia. Our data suggest that, in AML, malignant transformation as well as disease progression may occur at the level of CD34+/CD38- cells with multilineage potential.",,,,,,,,,

Specifically, we sought to determine whether TCD results in an attenuation of the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect on recipients of unrelated marrow grafts similar to that observed in HLA-identical sibling marrow transplantations. This question was addressed by comparative analysis of the relapse rates in marrow grafts who otherwise received identical preparative regimens and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis schedules (T-cell depletion with T10B9 monoclonal antibody and complement plus posttransplant cyclosporine) and by serial molecular analyses using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the bcr/abl RNA transcript in patients transplanted with unrelated donor grafts. Patients transplanted with advanced disease (accelerated phase or blast crisis) had equally high relapse rates, regardless of whether they received HLA-identical sibling (56%;95% confidence interval [CI], 29% to 82%) or unrelated marrow grafts (8%; 95% CI, 0% to 28%) had a significantly lower incidence of relapse than did patients transplanted with HLA-identical marrow grafts (47%; 95% CI, 23% to 71%; P = .002). Because all patients were similarly treated, these data indicate that the lower relapse rate in these unrelated patients was caused by an augmented GVL effect that was most likely attributable to increased HLA disparity between donor and recipient. The probability of developing both acute and chronic GVHD was significantly increased in chronic-phase recipients of unrelated marrow grafts, suggesting that the enhanced GVL effect was at least partly GVHD-associated. The lack of such a finding in advanced disease patient receiving unrelated marrow grafts raises the possibility that clinically significant GVL effect after TCD marrow transplantation was limited and confined to patients with more indolent disease. Serial PCR analyses for the presence of the bcr/abl RNA transcript showed that the vast majority of patients transplanted in chronic phase with unrelated marrow grafts were persistently PCR-negative, indicating that the GVL effect was durable in these patients. Most of these patients were observed to become PCR negative within 1 to 2 months after transplantation, showing that early eradication of leukemia was possible with TCD marrow grafts. This study shows that the use of unrelated marrow grafts compensates for reduced GVL reactivity associated with TCD in patients transplanted for CML. Furthermore, these data indicate that, in selected patient populations with CML, TCD can be used to reduce GVHD without a commensurate compromise in the GVL effect.",,,,,,,,,

In previous reports, no single common V beta and J beta sequence had been identified that allowed reliable amplification of the majority of rearranged T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-beta V-D-J junctions at the DNA level because of the relatively large number of possible TCR-beta variable (V beta) and joining (J beta) gene segments involved in the rearrangement processes. In the present study we designed highly degenerate PCR primers directed against conserved sequences of the J beta genes. IN combination with a previously published consensus V beta primer, these J beta primers specifically amplify TCR- beta V-N(D)N-J junctions from genomic DNA. Using this approach we studied DNA extracted from biopsy material of nine patients with T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, one c-ALL patient, and five patients with nonmalignant diseases. T-cell lines Molt 3, Jurkat, and HM 2 served as monoclonal controls. Individual PCR products were sequenced after cloning. The nucleotide sequences of 96 randomly chosen recombinant vectors were determined. In the polyclonal controls all analyzed clones differed in their TCR-beta V-N(D)N-J junctions. In the T-cell lines, in all of the T-cell malignancies, and in the c-ALL, monoclonal PCR products could be identified by demonstration of clonally restricted V-N(D)N-J junctions. The PCR results were confirmed by automated fluorescence quantification and size determination of PCR products after separation in a high-resolution polyacrylamide gel. The procedure allows rapid and specific characterization of clonal TCR-beta rearrangements from genomic DNA and will significantly simplify current experimental approaches to identify and to quantitate malignant T cells during initial staging and follow-up of T-lineage NHL and ALL patients.",,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that activated forms of the Abl tyrosine kinase, including P210BCR/ABL of human chronic myelogenous leukemia, require the SH2 domain for the transformation of fibroblasts. To determine whether SH2 is also required for Bcr/Abl to transform hematopoietic cells, we have studied two SH2 domain mutations in P210BCR/ABL: a point mutation in the conserved FLVRES motif (P210/R1033K), which interferes with phosphotyrosine-binding by SH2, and a complete deletion of SH2 (P210/delta SH2). Despite a negative effect on intrinsic Abl kinase activity, both P210 SH2 mutants were still able to transform the hematopoietic factor-dependent cell lines Ba/F3 and FDC-P1 to growth factor independence. Unexpectedly, both mutants showed greater transforming activity than wild-type P210 in a quantitative transformation assay, probably as a consequence of increased stability of the SH2 mutant proteins in vivo. Cells transformed by both P210 SH2 mutants were leukemogenic in synaptic mice and P210/r1053K mice exhibited a distinct disease phenotype, reminiscent of that induced by v-Abl. These results demonstrate that while the Abl SH2 domain is essential for BCR/ABL transformation of fibroblasts, it is dispensable for the transformation of hematopoietic factor-dependent cell lines.",,,,,,,,,

Various control ODNs were used to understand the mechanism of the observed antiproliferative effect. Not only the antisense ODNs but also several control ODNs inhibit the proliferation of the leukemic cell lines. All the ODNs that inhibit the cell proliferation share a TAT consensus sequence at their 3' end. A 1-base mismatch within this consensus sequence abolishes the antiproliferative effect. Mismatches of several bases at any other position within the sequence of the active ODNs do not suppress the observed effect. Similar experiments on normal or CML CD34+ cell fraction led to the same observations. We conclude that the antiproliferative effect of the phosphodiester BCR/ABL antisense ODNs cannot be attributed to an antisense mechanism but rather to a nonelucidated effect of a 3' terminal TAT sequence.

We have studied the VH sequence of 11 cases of CD5- B-CLL to address the question whether CD5- B-CLL are derived from naive pregerminal B cells (low mutation pattern) or from germinal center-derived memory B cells (high mutation pattern). Among the 12 detected rearrangements (2 distinct rearrangements in 1 case) VH1 family was found in 2, VH2 in 2, VH3 in 4, and VH4 in 4. Nine different VH genes were detected among the 12 rearrangements, including 2 cases expressing V1-69 (51p1) and 1 case expressing V4-39 (VH4.18), previously reported to be overexpressed in CD5+ B-CLL. A higher mutation pattern, following a random distribution, was observed when compared with classical CD5+ B-CLL. However, as reported in normal B cells, these results appeared to be related to membrane Ig phenotype (less mutations in membrane mu delta-expressing forms in leukemias expressing exclusively membrane mu). Overall, the differences found when comparing the mutational profile with classical CD5+ B-CLL were not clearcut and might be explained more by the membrane isotype (mu v mu delta) than by CD5 expression.",,,,,,,,,

Its recent assignment to the chromosomal region (12p12.3) prompted us to study the p27KIP1 gene in a series of 61 children with ALL. Microsatellite polymorphic markers flanking the p27KIP1 gene were analyzed to detect losses of heterozygosity (LOH). Eleven patients displayed LOH for at least one of the markers. The deleted are encompassed the p27KIP1 gene locus in 10 cases, but inactivation of the remaining allele by deletion, translocation, or mutation was never observed. In addition, in 1 patient, the p27KIP1 gene was situated outside of the region of LOH. Thus, p27KIP1 does not seem to be the target gene of 12p12-13 alterations. However, this study indicates that 12p12-13 alterations at the molecular level, which are present in about 27% of the children with B-lineage ALL, are much more common than had previously been reported by usual chromosome analysis.

Compared with 141 children with initial ALL, cells from 137 children with relapsed ALL were significantly more resistant to glucocorticoids, L-asparaginase, anthracyclines, and thiopurines, but not to vinca-alkaloids, cytarabine, ifosfamide, and epipodophyllotoxins. Relapsed ALL cells expressed the highest level of resistance to glucocorticoids, with a median level 357- and >24-fold more resistant to prednisolone and dexamethasone, respectively, than initial ALL cells, whereas the resistance ratios for the other drugs differed from 0.8- to 1.9-fold, intraindividual comparisons between initial and relapsed samples from 16 children with ALL showed that both de novo and acquired drug resistance were involved. Specific in vitro drug-resistance profiles were associated with high-risk relapsed ALL groups. In vitro drug resistance was also related to the clinical response to chemotherapy in relapsed/refractory childhood ALL. We conclude that drug resistance may explain the poor prognosis for children with relapsed/refractory ALL. These day may be helpful to design alternative treatment regimens for relapsed childhood ALL.",,,,,,,,,

FasR-mediated growth inhibition and DNA fragmentation could be induced in certain cases of AML. Interestingly, when DNA synthesis and G1 -> S transition in the cell cycle were enhanced by interleukin-3 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, Fas-insensitive blast cells acquired cellular susceptibility toward FasR-mediated growth inhibition. To further evaluate an association between the Fas-R-mediated action and a specific phase of the cell cycle, a FasR+ leukemic cell line, MML-1, was established from a patient with AML. The morphologic feature of dying cells and DNA fragmentation indicated that FasR cross-linking induced apoptotic cell death in MML-1 cells. Cell cycle arrest in G1A phase with the treatment of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or thymidine rendered MML-1 cells resistant to FasR-mediated apoptosis without downregulation of surface FasR expression. However, S-phase arrest with 5-fluorouracil could neither enhance nor inhibit FasR-mediated apoptosis. Simultaneous DNA/RNA quantification analysis revealed the selective loss of cells in G1B compartment, accompanied by the increase of apoptotic nuclei in sub-G1 fraction. These findings suggested that FasR-mediated apoptotic signals could be transduced into cells in G1B compartment and G1A -> G1B transition might augment the induction of FasR-mediated apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,

In this study we have examined the production and the regulation of the production of leukemia inhibitory factor/human interleukin for DA cells (LIF/HILDA) by EC. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were chosen as a working model as they are a well known source of cytokines. These cells secrete LIF/HILDA (90 pg/mL/10(6) cells/48 h) in basal conditions. This secretion is profoundly altered by interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha). Secretion of LIF/HILDA is increased threefold on stimulation with IL-1 alpha at a concentration of 100 IU/mL. The secreted protein is bioactive as demonstrated by its proliferative effects on DA1a cells. Modulation of the production of LIF/HILDA by glucocorticoids (GC) was also examined. In striking contrast to what was observed for IL-1 alpha, the synthetic GC dexamethasone (DXM) at a concentration of 10(-6) mol/L consistently inhibited the basal secretion of LIF/HILDA by an average of threefold and suppressed the IL-1 alpha-induced increase of the secretion of this cytokine by HUVEC. In an effort to extend results obtained with HUVEC to the bone marrow endothelium, we have also examined the production of LIF/HILDA by human bone marrow endothelial cells (HBMEC). Our study shows that HBMEC are quantitatively a very important source of this cytokine (above 7.25 ng/mL/10(6) cells/48 h) suggesting that they are a major source of LIF/HILDA in the bone marrow. Again, IL-1 alpha proved to be a very potent stimulus for the secretion of LIF/HILDA and synthetic GC such as DXM when used at a concentration of 10(-6) mol/L inhibited by an average of threefold the basal secretion of LIF/HILDA and had suppressive effect on the IL-1 alpha-induced increase of this secretion. The downregulation of LIF/HILDA production in the bone marrow by GC may be important to understand the effects of GC on hematopoiesis.",,,,,,,,,

A cloned subline of the AML14 cell line (AML14.3D10) that spontaneously differentiates to eosinophilic myelocytes in the absence of cytokine stimulation was obtained by limiting dilution. This subline exhibits augmented expression of interleukin-5 (IL-5) receptor alpha subunit mRNA and synthesizes all major eosinophil granule proteins. Exposure of this cell line to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) causes loss of eosinophilic granules and fast green staining within 48 hours, without cell death. In addition, mRNA for the IL-5 receptor alpha subunit becomes undetectable by 48 hours and the cells lose responsiveness to IL-5. Major basic protein, measured as a marker of eosinophilic granule content, decreases from more than 16 pg/cell to undetectable levels by 5 days after ATRA. Concomitant with the loss of major basic protein and fast green staining, surface expression of CD16 becomes detectable and is maximum by 10 days after ATRA. mRNA for the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor becomes detectable by day 5, and the cells become responsive to G-CSF. At this time, the cells appear morphologically as mature neutrophils and can reduce nitroblue tetrazolium. With continued culture, the neutrophilic cells die and the culture becomes repopulated with eosinophilic myelocytes. These findings show that it is possible to change the differentiation program of hematopoietic cells even after they show evidence of advanced lineage commitment. The AML14.3D10 subclone of AML14 will be a valuable model for study of the transcriptional regulation of the eosinophil and neutrophil differentiation programs and lineage-specific gene expression.",,,,,,,,,

The level of BM cell-mediated cytostasis of both P815 mastocytoma (H-2d) and L1210 lymphoma (H-2d) cells was dependent on BM-to-tumor cell ratio; 100% growth inhibition was obtained at a ratio of 480/1. In addition, BM cells were found to be able to synergize in suppressing P815 cell growth with lymphoid cells. The synergistic suppressive effects on tumor cell proliferation were observed in BM-spleen, BM-thymus and BM-lymphnode cell co-cultures. The analysis of cytostatic activity of the cell culture supernatants showed that the synergistic leukemia growth suppression could be mediated, at least in part, by cell-derived soluble cytostatic molecules. The data presented herein also indicated that culturing BM cells with either crude supernatant (25%) from allogeneic mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) or recombinant human interleukin(IL)-2 (20 U/ml) for 20 hours led to a 2-fold increase in their cytostatic activity against both P815 and L1210 cells. Taken together, the results suggest that although normal BM cells are ineffective in tumor cell killing, they may play an important role in cell-mediated effector mechanisms responsible for suppressing leukemia development; and that activated T lymphocytes, through producing cytokine(s), may rapidly upregulate leukemia growth inhibitory activity of BM cells.",,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly this antagonistic IL-6 variant had an agonistic effect on the human myeloma cell line XG-1, albeit at a 1000-fold higher concentration than wild type IL-6. This residual activity of the mutant arose from triggering gp130, because it could be inhibited by a gp130 specific mAb. Extensive mutagenesis of residues between Q153 and H165 of human IL-6, a region which is partly homologous in cytokines which also signal via gp130 (oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukaemia inhibitory factor, IL-11), did result in the isolation of a second antagonist for IL-6 activity on CESS and HepG2 cells. However on XG-1 cells this variant was active as well. These results suggest that (an) additional region(s) of the IL-6 molecule might be involved in gp130 triggering. Recently we indeed found that residues Lys42-Ala57 are also important for gp130 triggering. Inhibition experiments with neutralizing IL-6R alpha-chain specific mAb show that this region can be functionally separated from the Q153-H165 region. These findings have important implications for the development of receptor antagonists of IL-6 and IL-6 family members.",,,,,,,,,

At the end of induction therapy (after 2 months) 4/6 tested positive for CDR3, 2/6 for TCR gamma, and 5/6 for clone-specific rearrangements.

Two patients died in leukemic relapse; one patient relapsed but is still alive. All three of these patients remained PCR positive throughout the course of their disease. Clonal evolution in the IgH locus was found in one of these patients. We conclude that the molecular response to chemotherapy in adult B-lineage ALL is slow, even in patients without risk factors other than age. As in childhood ALL, most patients with long-term CR convert to PCR negativity approximately 18 months after the start of chemotherapy. The data also suggest the existence of early clone-specific PCR negativity in a small proportion of long-term survivors.

Factor IX production was measured in the transduced cells both in the uninduced state and after induction of granulocytic differentiation [with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)] or monocytoid differentiation [with phorbol myristic acetate (PMA)]. Transcription of factor IX from the MoMuLV LTR was seen in all cells, with a two-fold increase upon differentiation. Induction with PMA led to an 8- to 15-fold increase in factor IX transcripts from an internal CMV promoter. No factor IX transcripts from the internal SV40 promoter were detected. Immunoreactive factor IX protein was identified by Western blot from induced HL-60 cells transduced by either LIXSN or LNCIX. Factor IX production by HL-60 cells transduced by LNCIX ranged from 38-93 ng/10(6) cells/24 hr following induction of monocytic differentiation. The factor IX antigen titer was directly related to factor IX coagulant titer (r = 0.98; p < 0.001).

The effects of other body fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), on MLV vectors and packaging lines have not been studied. We have found that retroviral vectors packaged in ecotropic, amphotropic, and gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelope proteins were all inactivated by human sera, and human sera also lysed mouse NIH-3T3 cells and the retroviral vector packaging cells derived from them. Human fibroblasts producing amphotropic vector particles were resistant to lysis, but the particles produced by them were inactivated. In contrast, CSF did not inactivate MLV vectors, nor did it lyse murine retrovirus packaging cells. Our results suggest that exposure to human serum may prevent in vivo gene transfer by MLV vectors and xenogeneic packaging lines, but gene transfer within the central nervous system should be more successful.",,,,,,,,,

These promising results do not address a clinically relevant question: What is the contribution of already infected peripheral mononuclear and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to disease progression? In this report, we demonstrate inhibition of both HIV-1 replication and production of infectious particles in chronically infected human T leukemia cell lines.

This receptor (ET-IL-8RA) displayed functional properties similar to those of the native receptor in neutrophils in that exposure to IL-8 stimulated GTPase activity, phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, intracellular calcium mobilization, and degranulation in a pertussis toxin (PTx) susceptible fashion. IL-8 induced dose- and time-dependent phosphorylation of ET-IL-8RA. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment also resulted in phosphorylation of the receptor although to a lesser extent. Staurosporine totally blocked PMA-induced phosphorylation but only partially inhibited IL-8-mediated phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of ET-IL-8RA correlated with its desensitization as measured by GTPase activation and calcium mobilization. To determine the role of phosphorylation in IL-8RA signal transduction, three mutants lacking specific serine and threonine residues located at the C-terminal of this receptor were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (M1, M2, and M3). The mutated receptors expressed in RBL-2H3 cells displayed pharmacological properties (Kd approximately 2-2.8 nM and Bmax approximately 3-3.5 pmol/mg of protein) similar to those of the wild-type ET-IL-8RA. M2 and M3, but not M1, showed a marked decrease in IL-8-induced phosphorylation compared to the wild-type receptor. M2 and M3 but not M1 were resistant to PMA-mediated phosphorylation and desensitization and were also more resistant to homologous desensitization than M1 or ET-IL-8RA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

Here we elucidate the biophysical factors underlying the markedly improved bloodstream stability and cytotoxic activity of topotecan relative to camptothecin. Each agent contains an alpha-hydroxy-delta-lactone ring that hydrolyzes under physiological pH to yield a biologically-inactive carboxylate form. In human plasma, camptothecin lactone converts rapidly and completely to its carboxylate form due to a 200-fold binding preference by serum albumin (HSA) for the latter [Mi, Z., & Burke, T.G. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 10540-12545]. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements reveal that neither topotecan lactone nor carboxylate associates with HSA, thereby resulting in a significantly higher level of lactone stability in plasma for topotecan (t1/2 = 23.1 min, percent lactone at equilibrium of 17.6) relative to camptothecin (t1/2 = 10.6 min, percent lactone at equilibrium of < 0.2). Moreover, studies with HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells reveal that a physiologically-relevant level (40 mg/mL) of HSA dramatically attenuates the cytotoxic activity of camptothecin in excess of 2600-fold (for a 72 h exposure, the IC50 value of 1.5 nM in the absence of HSA increased to 4 microM in the presence of HSA). The activities of other clinically relevant anticancer analogues, 9-aminocamptothecin and SN-38, were also strongly modulated by the presence of 40 mg/mL HSA. In marked contrast, the presence of HSA effected no change on the cytotoxic activity of topotecan (IC50 = 12 nM both in the absence and in presence of HSA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

Here we report that, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), ADF/TRX mRNA was induced within 8 h after stimulation as detected by in situ hybridization study. To analyze the mechanism of ADF/TRX induction during T cell activation, the effects of immunosuppressants including FK506, rapamycin (Rap) and cyclosporin A (CsA) on ADF/TRX expression were investigated by immunoblot analysis. ADF/TRX induction in PBMC by PHA, Con A or OKT3 mAb was almost completely suppressed by FK506. Whereas CsA also inhibited ADF/TRX expression in OKT3 mAb-stimulated PBMC, Rap failed to affect it in spite of exhibiting growth inhibition. In addition, exogenous IL-2 could not increase ADF/TRX production in FK506-treated PBMC or in PHA blasts. These results indicate that ADF/TRX induction in T cell activation depends on calcineurin-dependent events in the early phase and that IL-2 production is not directly involved in ADF/TRX induction. Furthermore, when recombinant ADF (rADF) was added to a culture of PBMC 1 h before the addition of PHA and FK506, the action of FK506 was partially reversed as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation and viable cell counts. These results suggest that ADF/TRX produced and released from PBMC may be a crucial event in lymphocyte activation, and that FK506 and CsA may exert the immune suppression partly through inhibiting the induction of the endogenous reducing factor ADF/TRX.",,,,,,,,,

The following drugs were tested: prednisolone, daunorubicin, mitozantrone, etoposide, melphalan and 6-thioguanine. At initial presentation, lymphoblasts from adults demonstrated a significantly higher degree of in vitro resistance to prednisolone than those from children (P < 0.01). Glucocorticoid resistance may be a fundamental difference between adult and childhood ALL which may underlie different biological aspects and also explain the difference in prognosis. Lymphoblasts from adults who achieved CR were more sensitive in vitro to prednisolone (P = 0.07), daunorubicin (P < 0.05), mitozantrone (P < 0.01) and melphalan (P < 0.05) than cells from those who did not.

The in vivo administration of rhIL-3 (250 micrograms/m2d s.c. for 6-10d) recruited AML blasts into the cell cycle in two of the three patients, and this effect resulted in an increase in in vitro growth of clonogenic cells (CFU-L) and of their S-phase fraction. The percentage of leukaemic cells with monosomy 7 increased only in the two cases who showed a proliferative response. Normal cells were not recruited, even when rhIL-3 was administered for up to 10 d. In vitro studies showed an increased Ara-C cytotoxicity on clonogenic AML cells, in particular with IL-3 plus GM-CSF, thus confirming the priming effects of IL-3 in the two responding cases. The results of this study suggest that rhIL-3 can selectively recruit leukaemic cells into the cell cycle. Although leukaemic blasts can be sensitized to Ara-C, other mechanisms of primary blast resistance may limit the clinical benefit of kinetic-based approaches.",,,,,,,,,

We have identified a 95 kD soluble form of KIT (S-KIT) in culture supernatant of human megakaryoblastic cell line, CMK. To study the physiological significance of S-KIT, we have established a sensitive sandwich ELISA system. Serum samples from healthy individuals contained detectable amounts of S-KIT. Next, we determined a total of 220 samples from 134 patients with haemopoietic disorders. A considerable number of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), especially those with more immature phenotypes (M0, M1 or M2) had elevated levels of serum S-KIT. Those levels decreased to the normal range after effective chemotherapy. In chronic myeloid leukaemia, patients with myeloid blastic crisis showed markedly elevated levels of serum S-KIT. In contrast, S-KIT levels decreased in cases with either acute or chronic lymphoid leukaemia. There was a tendency for patients with severe aplastic anaemia to show decreased levels, but it was not significant. In myelodysplastic syndrome, S-KIT levels appeared to vary by subsets, with higher concentration in more advanced forms of the disease. Although the functional role of S-KIT is not yet elucidated, these results suggest that the serum S-KIT levels may reflect the pathological states of various haematological disorders.",,,,,,,,,

Using a qualitative RT-PCR method, AML1/ETO transcripts could be detected in all samples from 15 first PBSC harvests and 11 second PBSC harvests obtained from 15 patients with t(8;21) AML. With our competitive RT-PCR assay, the number of AML1/ETO transcripts was found to be lower in the second PBSC harvest than that in the first in every individual. Furthermore, MRD in PBSC harvests was less than that in the corresponding bone marrow obtained on the day of PBSC collection in the individual patients studied. In 10 patients who received autologous blood stem cell transplantation (ABSCT), we could not find a relationship between the number of AML1/ETO transcripts in the infused PBSC harvests and the clinical outcome after ABSCT. The present study clearly indicates that although PBSC harvests collected after consolidation chemotherapy are contaminated by leukaemic cells, the degree of leukaemic contamination may decrease as chemotherapy is repeated.

We studied 17 patients with a chromosome 16 abnormality (eight M4Eo, two M1, one M2, three M4 without abnormal eosinophils, three MDS) for the presence of CBFB/MYH11 transcripts using an RT-PCR technique. 10 AML patients with inv(16) tested RT-PCR positive (eight at presentation, one in remission, one in remission and relapse). Three of these patients were originally reported by cytogenetic analysis to have del(16q22) but the positive RT-PCR results prompted a cytogenetic re-examination, resulting in the correction of the reports to inv(16). We show that although inv(16) is closely associated with AML M4Eo, it can also be detected in cases of AML M4 without abnormal eosinophils. Three cases of MDS with inv(16) were also RT-PCR positive. Four patients with other chromosome 16 abnormalities were RT-PCR negative. Four AML patients with inv(16) were studied in remission. All were RT-PCR positive, including one patient in remission for 108 months and one 22 months post allogeneic bone marrow transplant. In the latter two remission patients, RT-PCR evaluation was positive in bone marrow (BM) but not in peripheral blood, suggesting that BM may be the more informative. We conclude that this technique is valuable in the accurate molecular classification of AML, particularly as treatment options may be influenced by such information. Though RT-PCR is highly sensitive in detecting CBFB/MYH11 fusion transcripts during remission, monitoring of minimal residual disease in patients with inv(16) remains to be established.",,,,,,,,,

There were also substantial raised risks in these migrants of each sex for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myeloma. For the mouth and pharynx, and liver in each sex, and gall bladder in females, there were also raised risks of lesser magnitude in British ethnic migrants. For colon and rectal cancer and cutaneous melanoma in each sex, ovarian cancer in women and bladder cancer in men, there were appreciable significantly reduced risks in the Indian ethnic migrants not shared by those of British ethnicity. Appreciable raised risks in British ethnic migrants not shared by those of Indian ethnicity occurred for nasopharyngeal cancer in males, soft tissue malignancy in both sexes and non-melanoma skin cancer in males. In migrants of both ethnicities there were appreciable significantly raised risks in each sex for leukaemia and decreased risks in each sex for gastric cancer, for lung cancer except in females of British ethnicity and in males for testicular cancer. The results suggest the need for public health measures to combat the high risks of oral and pharyngeal cancers and liver cancer in the Indian ethnic immigrant population of England and Wales, by prevention of betel quid chewing and hepatitis transmission respectively. The data also imply that early exposures or early acquired behaviours in India, or exposures during migration, may increase the risk of leukaemia and reduce the risks of gastric and testicular cancers in the migrants irrespective of their ethnicity. Aetiological studies would be worthwhile to investigate the reasons for the sizeable decreased risk of colon and rectal cancer and increased risk of gall bladder cancer in each sex and the increased risk of thyroid and laryngeal cancer in males and oesophageal cancer in females of Indian ethnicity but not of British ethnicity who have migrated from the Indian subcontinent.",PMC2033952,,,,,,,,

This compound induces flat cell morphology and causes a decrease in proliferative rate. The flat revertant cells not only exhibit a reduction in saturation density at confluence, but also lose the ability to proliferate in soft agar. Furthermore, their tumorigenicity is reduced when injected s.c. into athymic nude mice. The compound alters morphology in three out of seven cancer cell lines and has a potent growth inhibitory effect in six of these lines.

AML is the leading cause of cancer death in men aged 15-34 years and the second leading cause of cancer death in women in this age group. This clearly has an impact on loss of life in the productive years. But in terms of the population most affected and of the biology of the disease, the impact is even greater for the elderly patient. Age has been established in many AML treatment trials as a poor prognosis factor. Although ther is no consensus as to what age defines an elderly AML patient, those older than 45 years have a lower complete remission (CR) rate than those who are younger. In patients younger than 50 years, the average CR rate is 60%-75%; in contrast, in patients older than 70 years, the CR rate is 35%-40%. Long-term disease-free survival ranges from 25% to 50% in adult AML, depending on the post-remission therapy used and the age of the patient. In November 1991, the Southwest Oncology Group began a study to address the problems of treating AML in the elderly. Many previous treatment trials of AML have included elderly patients as a subgroup of the study analysis, with a larger proportion of young patients. This trial was designed to test the hypothesis that a myeloid growth factor used as supportive care could improve the outcomes in elderly patients with AML.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, the release of 45calcium (45Ca) from prelabeled bones is measured as an index of resorption. We studied 45Ca release from two types of long bone explants after different preparation methods: 17-day-old fetal mouse radii/ulnae with and without cartilage ends (intact radii/ulnae and shafts, respectively), and intact 18-day old metacarpals/metatarsals. In addition, we examined the effect of different culture conditions, such as cultures performed under the surface of the medium or at the interphase of medium and air, on 45Ca release and histology. When intact radii/ulnae were cultured under the surface of the medium, there was always a significant amount (10%) of net basal 45Ca release (corrected for physicochemical exchange) that was not due to osteoclastic resorption, as it could not be suppressed by inhibitors of resorption even at high concentrations. Moreover, histologically TRAcP-positive cells were almost absent after culture and the bone marrow/stromal cells in the center of the bone appeared necrotic, possibly due to a lack of oxygen. Under these culture conditions, osteoclasts could survive in shafts as well as in PTH-stimulated intact radii/ulnae, but a constant amount of 10% 45Ca, not due to resorption, was still released in the medium. When these explants were cultured at the interphase of medium and air, basal and stimulated 45Ca release originated from osteoclastic resorption. In contrast, in 18-day-old fetal mouse metacarpals/metatarsals, the experimental conditions applied did not affect 45Ca release, which was always due to resorption of the explants by osteoclasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

In contrast, amifostine exhibited no protective effects upon CFU-L. The results of this study will show that amifostine protects normal late and early progenitor cells for the toxic effects of cyclophosphamide derivatives while preserving their antileukaemic effects.

EdSm was additionally studied in vivo in human tumour xenografts and murine tumour models. EdSm showed a clear dose-response effect in vitro. At continuous exposure with 0.01 micrograms/ml, 2 out of 11 of the tumours responded (a gastric and a small cell lung carcinoma). At 0.1 mu/ml EdSm, the tumour response was 5/11 tumours and at 1 microgram/ml the compound was active in all tumours. The maximal tolerable doses of EdSm in vivo have been determined in non-tumour bearing CDF1 mice. In the intraperitoneally (i.p.) given multiple dose schedules the respective LD10 doses indicated that the tolerable cumulative dose increases when lower doses are given more frequently. This also enhances the antitumour activity in L1210 leukaemia to 172% T/C. On the other hand, continuous infusion strongly diminished the tolerable dose as well as the antitumour activity. EdSm was also active against i.p. inoculated P388 leukaemia (150% T/C), B16 melanoma (156% T/C), and RC carcinoma (197% T/C), and the subcutaneously (s.c.) inoculated L1210 (139% T/C) and RC (138% T/C). Absence of tumour responses was found in the following s.c. implanted murine tumours: M5076 sarcoma, osteosarcomas C22LR and CP369, and the LL carcinoma, as well as in the human tumour xenografts: LXFG 529, a non-small cell lung carcinoma; GXF 251, a gastric carcinoma; and FMa, an ovary carcinoma. Possible long-range retinotoxic effects of EdSm were investigated in tumour-bearing mice, cured after surviving treatment with LD50 doses of EdSm, by assaying the protein biosynthetic capacity of the retinal by assaying the ocular rhodopsin and opsin levels as parameters. In none of these cases could a significant reduction in either opsin or rhodopsin levels be measured and no changes were seen histologically.",,,,,,,,,

The present study involves 494 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) registered with the DCS between 1985 and 1989. This entire data set has been tested for localised spatial clustering using an established nearest neighbour method with 18% of all cases in young people classified as clustered (P < 0.05). No clustering was found in older cases. Subsamples were selected from the registered cases for a pilot study in which case clustering, herpes virus antibody titres and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) presence within the Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells (EBV-RS status) were investigated together. Firstly, a case-control study of HD in young people or nodular sclerosing (NS) subtype (39 HD cases and 26 healthy controls) found significant elevation of antibody titres to EBV-viral capsid antigen (VCA), EBV-early antigen (EA) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) in HD cases compared with controls. EBV viral genome was present in 5 cases and 4 of these were in clusters of HD in young people. Elevation of antibody titres to the EBV antigens was not associated with case clustering or EBV-RS status. Antibody titres to HHV-6 differed significantly between EBV-RS+ and EBV-RS- cases (P = 0.04). Geometric mean titres for HHV-6 for EBV-RS+ and EBV-RS- cases were 11.5 and 73.7, respectively, with the former lower than the control value of 20.5. Secondly, a cluster study included all other cases (n = 14) in clusters containing known EBV-RS+ cases. 3 further cases were EBV-RS+ positive but no cluster consisted entirely of positive cases. Overall, 5/16 clustered, 2/12 peripheral and 1/25 random cases in these studies were EBV-RS+ (P = 0.017). The interpretation of these results in terms of shared aetiological exposures of cases within clusters and the roles of EBV and HHV-6 is discussed, and hypotheses for testing in future studies proposed.",,,['Eur J Cancer. 1995;31A(9):1388-9.

Two cell lines (SK-N-SH and IMR32) were derived from human neuroblastomas, and one (L1210) was the original murine leukaemia cell line used to define schedule dependency of etoposide in vivo. Cytotoxicity was found to be determined by the product of concentration and duration of exposure over a 120-fold range of durations and a 100-fold range of concentrations. No difference in cytotoxicity was seen following equivalent exposure either continuously or in two separate intervals. In one cell line, exposure to etoposide when at confluence led to a highly resistant subpopulation comprising 10-15% of the entire cell number. This did not seem to be associated with any difference in the rate of etoposide efflux from cells preloaded with 3H-etoposide. We conclude that etoposide does not show schedule dependency in vitro, but cytotoxicity is related to total exposure to etoposide.

However, neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection is difficult to investigate because the brain parenchyma is not accessible to sampling during the course of AIDS. The second compartment of the CNS, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is accessible to sampling but how changes in the CSF relate to the changes in the parenchyma is poorly understood. Thus, knowledge of the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection predominantly stems from either postmortem or in vitro studies. This raises the need for animal models of HIV infection of the CNS. Such models have been developed and are briefly reviewed here. The models faithfully recapitulate some aspects of the HIV/CNS disease. Appropriate neuropathological changes and neurobehavioral dysfunction (e.g., cognitive and motor deficits) occur in SIV-infected macaques. Central sensory electrophysiological changes and sleep disturbances occur in FIV-infected cats. Infection of the brain and behavioral changes comparable to some of the changes seen in humans occur in mice infected with a mixture of murine leukemia viruses. Genetically immunodeficient mice (e.g., SCID) accept HIV-infected human organs and or cell grafts. Evidence summarized here indicates that these HuSCID animals undergo neuropathological changes similar to those observed in brains of individuals who died with AIDS. Thus, presently available animal models provide an opportunity to investigate HIV/CNS disease, and to develop and test therapeutic interventions to prevent or cure the disease.",,,,,,,,,

In attempts to further classify this family of viruses we have carried out nucleotide sequence and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the long terminal repeat (LTR), a region that has been shown in previous studies to have the greatest intra- and intersubtype genomic divergence. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences suggested the existence of distinct phylogenetic groups in each subtype and, on the basis of predicted differences in restriction endonuclease sites, RFLP analysis allowed the identification of four groups within the IIa subtype (a1-a4) and six within the IIb subtype (b1-b6). Nucleotide sequence analysis also suggested the possible existence of HTLV-II quasispecies. However, this appeared not to be significant, and preliminary studies suggest that these would not be expected to influence the results of RFLP analysis appreciably. The validity of the RFLP method was demonstrated in an analysis of 36 randomly chosen samples from HTLV-II seropositive blood donors from the New York City Blood Center, where it could be shown that all could be successfully classified. Moreover, the RFLP analysis correctly matched the viruses in donors and recipients of contaminated blood in four situations in which HTLV-II was inadvertently transmitted by transfusion. RFLP analysis of the LTR appears to be a rapid and reliable method by which to identify HTLV-II infection.

Among 5,325 patients with uterine cervix cancer, 619 developed SPM. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-1.39). Significantly increased risks were observed for cancer of the colon, rectum, lung, vulva, kidney and bladder. A total of 4,815 women with uterine corpus cancer were followed and 660 SPM were found. The overall SIR was 1.21 (95% CI 1.12-1.30) with significantly increased risk for cancer of the colon, ovary, vulva and bladder. The incidence of leukemia was also significantly elevated (SIR = 3.03; 95% CI 1.70-5.00). Among 5,060 patients with ovarian cancer, 379 SPM were found (SIR 1.49; 95% CI 1.34-1.64). Increased risks of cancer of the colon, rectum, breast, uterine corpus, bladder and leukemia were observed. All three primary sites showed elevated risks of cancer of the colon and bladder. For patients with a primary cancer of the corpus and ovary an elevated risk of leukemia was also noted. The conclusion from these findings is that SPM to some extent can be explained by previously known factors, i.e. treatment and common risk factors. However, further studies concerning the role of common etiology, for instance hereditary and hormonal factors, are needed to increase the knowledge on the etiology of second primary malignancies.",,,,,,,,,

One such cDNA cloned from murine embryonic germ(EG) cells encodes a nonreceptor type serine/threonine kinase and is predominantly expressed in the testis, ovary, and spleen of adult mouse. The nucleotide sequence of the entire coding regions shows that this clone, designated Plk1(polo like kinase 1), is identical with STPK13 previously cloned from murine erythro-leukemia cells. The protein encoded by Plk1 is closely related to the product of Drosophila polo that plays a role in mitosis and meiosis. To define the role of Plk1 in germ cell development, we have examined its expression in murine gonads by in situ hybridization. Here we show that the Plk1 gene is specifically expressed in spermatocytes of diplotene and diakinesis stage, in secondary spermatocytes, and in round spermatids in testes. It is also expressed in growing oocytes and ovulated eggs. The pattern of expression of the Plk1 gene suggests that the gene product is involved in completion of meiotic division, and like the Drosophila polo protein, is a maternal factor active in embryos at the early cleavage stage.",,,,,,,,,

Previous studies showed that camptothecin, a potent and specific inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I, is cytotoxic to African trypanosomes and related pathogenic hemoflagellates (Bodley AL and Shapiro TA, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92: 3726-3730, 1995). In this study, a series of camptothecin analogs was tested against axenically cultured, bloodstream form, T. brucei. Modifications to the pentacyclic nucleus of camptothecin ablated antiparasitic activity. In contrast, activity could be increased by substituents added to the parent ring system (e.g. 10,11-methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy groups; alkyl additions to carbon 7; or 9-amino or 9-chloro substituents). Cytotoxicity was correlated with the level of cleavable complexes in trypanosomes, implicating topoisomerase I as the intracellular target for these compounds. To obtain some indication of selective toxicity, ten compounds were also tested against L1210 mouse leukemia cells. The 9-substituted-10,11-methylenedioxy analogs caused a disproportionate increase in antiparasitic activity, compared with mammalian cell toxicity. These findings provide a basis for designing further structural modifications and for selecting camptothecin analogs to test in animal models of trypanosomiasis.",,,,,,,,,

Despite the high response rate, the majority of patients relapse with continued trans-retinoic acid therapy, and disease progression has been observed to be accompanied by an increase in the metabolism of trans-retinoic acid in the patients. In this study, the pharmacokinetic disposition of trans-retinoic acid was determined by HPLC in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia before and after concurrent therapy with the triazole antimycotic agent fluconazole. Treatment with trans-retinoic acid for 1 week reduced the area under the plasma trans-retinoic acid concentration vs time curve in one patient by 67%, from 277 to 91 ng/mL/hr. Trans-retinoic acid pharmacokinetics were repeated after the second dose of fluconazole, administered 1 hour prior to the retinoid, and the AUC was found to be 401 ng/mL/hr, a greater than 4-fold increase from the pre-fluconazole level. A similar, though more modest, effect of fluconazole was seen in a second acute promyelocytic leukemia patient. The effect of fluconazole on trans-retinoic acid metabolism was examined in vitro using isolated human hepatic microsomes. Fluconazole inhibited the NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450-mediated catabolism of trans-retinoic acid in a concentration-dependent manner. Although fluconazole was approximately one-half as potent an inhibitor when compared with ketoconazole, a related antifungal drug, 60-90% inhibition was observed at the concentrations of fluconazole measured in the acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. Neither fluconazole nor ketoconazole inhibited lipid hydroperoxide-mediated metabolism of trans-retinoic acid. Since fluconazole is a well-tolerated agent frequently administered to leukemia patients, its use in combination with trans-retinoic acid merits further consideration.",,,,,,,,,

Our laboratory has synthesized a variety of structural analogs in which we determined previously that the positioning of the nitrogen within the backbone, as well as sidearm modification, results in dramatic differences in the potency of cytotoxicity. We reported previously that although DNA reactivity appears to be a necessary component for mediating cell death, it is not sufficient for predicting cytotoxicity of the aza-anthracenediones. We have chosen three aza-anthracenediones (BBR 2828, BBR 2778 and BBR 2378) to investigate the importance of DNA strand breaks and/or protein-concealed DNA breaks induced by aza-anthracenediones. We determined in the present study that, while all three drugs cause DNA breaks as determined by alkaline and neutral elution, as well as KCl-SDS precipitation, these breaks do not correlate directly with their potency as cytotoxic compounds. Further, we found significant differences in the types of DNA breaks induced by these drugs. Finally, we report that the persistence of protein-DNA complexes induced by all three drugs was similar and, therefore, cannot account for differences in the potency of cytotoxicity of the aza-anthracenediones. Thus, we postulate that, while the total number of drug-induced protein-concealed DNA breaks is an important indicator of drug toxicity, it is possible that the actual nature of the breaks may differ among the aza-anthracenedione congeners, and it is these differences in the actual proteins present in the DNA breaks that differentiate between aza-anthracenediones.",,,,,,,,,

Recently, apoptosis has been associated with oxidative stress in a number of cell systems. Here we assessed the inhibitory capacity of different antioxidants on UV- and drug-induced apoptosis in the human leukemic cell line, HL-60. We found that the oxygen radical scavenger, BHA, the radioprotector cysteamine and the metal chelators, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC), diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC), and dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMDTC), were able to significantly inhibit nuclear fragmentation and reduce the formation of apoptotic bodies in UV-irradiated human leukemic cells. Both BHA and PDTC were found to reduce DNA fragmentation as assessed by in situ DNA nick-end labelling and quantification thereof using fluorescence flow cytometry. In addition to inhibiting UV-induced apoptosis, PDTC was also capable of reducing the amount of apoptosis induced by a range of cytotoxic drugs, such as actinomycin-D, camptothecin, etoposide, and melphalan, whereas BHA and cysteamine were not as effective in these cases after more than four hours in culture when compared to PDTC. To further elucidate the working mechanism of PDTC, we have looked at the effect of PDTC on DNA fragmentation in isolated nuclei, under conditions that promote activation of endogenous endonuclease involved in apoptosis. In contrast to ZnCl2, a potent inhibitor of endonuclease activity, PDTC was unable to inhibit DNA-ladder formation in this assay. Taken together, these results indicate that oxygen radicals may have a central role to play in the induction of apoptosis and that dithiocarbamates can serve as potent inhibitors of apoptosis induced by a wide variety of stimuli.",,,,,,,,,

The apparent molecular weight of this enzyme was approximately 50,000, as indicated by its sedimentation in glycerol gradients. The exonuclease did not copurify with DNA polymerase activity, required MgCl2 for its exonucleolytic activity, and was inhibited by KCl above 60 mM. The enzyme was active on single-stranded DNA, DNA duplexes and DNA/RNA duplexes, and it was efficient at removing 3'-terminal mispairs from DNA. The products of the exonucleolytic reaction were deoxynucleoside 5'-monophosphates. The behavior of the exonuclease was examined on DNA terminated at the 3' end with a variety of dideoxynucleosides that are potent against human immunodeficiency virus type 1. The exonuclease has a broad substrate specificity; however, the rate of the enzymatic reaction varied among the D dideoxynucleosides tested (ddAMP = ddCMP > d4TMP > AZTMP). Similarly, the enzyme was examined for its reactivity with DNA terminated by either the D or L enantiomers of ddC, SddC or FddC. The removal of analogs with the native D configuration was at least 6-fold more rapid than that of the L-compounds, and the type of structural modification had an impact on the rate at which the D enantiomers were removed (SddCMP > ddCMP > FddCMP). The monophosphate forms of AZT, D4T, L-FddC and L-ddC were potent inhibitors of the exonuclease at micromolar concentrations, while D-ddCMP partially inhibited the enzyme at millimolar concentrations. Based on its physical and enzymatic properties, this exonuclease represents a novel enzyme that may have an important role in determining the relative potencies of dideoxynucleosides against human immunodeficiency virus type 1.",,,,,,,,,

The modifications included the replacement of the 2-amino group by hydrogen or methyl as well as the inclusion of a methyl substituent at position 9. Based upon activity against L1210 leukemia cells in culture, three of the new analogues together with one compound described previously were evaluated for cytotoxicity in vitro using three human tumor cell lines (Colo 320 DM, Hep G2 and HL-60). The most effective compound was 2-desamino-N9-methyl-5,8-dideazaisoaminopterin (2c) with the HL-60 cells being the most sensitive to its cytotoxic effects. These analogues were evaluated in vitro as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS) from human as well as bacterial (Lactobacillus casei) sources. All four of the 4-amino analogues were most effective toward L. casei DHFR compared with human DHFR, with 2-desamino-2-methyl-5,8-dideazaisoaminopterin (2d) and its 9-methyl derivative (2e) having 818- and 430-fold greater selectivity (L. casei/human). Most of the compounds studied were found to be only modest inhibitors of human TS (I50 values = 1.5 to 20 microM) and were therefore at least 40-fold less inhibitory than 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid. Nevertheless, reversal of cytotoxicity studies with thymidine, hypoxanthine and folinic acid using the HL-60 cell line suggested that TS is the primary target for these analogues.",,,,,,,,,

Results showed that children irradiated before the age of 4 years were impaired in certain aspects of non-verbal ability, as well as in measures of short term memory and attention, calculated by factor scores derived from selected subtests of the IQ test. Subtests requiring verbal and non-verbal reasoning showed the greatest impairment after early diagnosis and treatment. In addition girls were selectively impaired in verbal IQ and other aspects of verbal ability, with the degree of impairment exacerbated by early treatment.

The sequence of the N-terminal 17 amino acids and five other internal tryptic peptides revealed that it is homologous to the liver/bone/kidney (L/B/K)-type alkaline phosphatase of other mammalian species. Corresponding oligonucleotides were synthesized and used for amplification of a 1.2-kb segment of the FeALP gene by polymerase chain reaction, using phage DNA from a FeT cell cDNA library as template. The 1.2-kb FeALP gene fragment generated was then used as a probe to isolate a 2127-bp L/B/K-type FeALP cDNA clone from the same library harboring a large, intact open reading frame. This cDNA possessed an open reading frame encoding a 524-amino-acid protein including a putative signal peptide of 17 amino acids followed by 14-amino-acid residues identical to the N-terminal sequence determined from the purified protein. Sequences closely related to five tryptic peptides from the purified protein were also contained within the cDNA-encoded protein. Homology with the human, bovine, rat and mouse L/B/K-type ALP was found to be 88-90% at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels. The cDNA was transferred into a eukaryotic expression vector and expressed following transfection into murine and mink lung fibroblast cell lines. High levels of enzymatically active ALP were detected, along with a 70-kDa protein reactive in immunoblot assay using a polyclonal antibody against the original crude FeALP preparation. FeALP was specifically released from intact cells by treatment with phosphoinositol-specific phospholipase-C. By Northern blot analysis, only one species of mRNA was detected using a 32P-labeled cDNA probe.

These can be revealed by cytolytic syndromes sometimes associated with cholestasis. It is therefore important to find an early and specific cholestasis enzymatic marker. A retrospective study of the changes in levels of biological parameters has been carried out in 13 children who underwent one or more bone marrow transplantations. During the 3 months following bone marrow transplantation, all patients developed liver injury characterized by an early and very elevated 5'-nucleotidase activity (sometimes more than 40 times the upper reference limit), a moderate increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, a variable increase in alanine aminotransferase activity and inconstant changes in total bilirubin levels. These results show that cytolytic syndrome and cholestasis are often associated with increases in 5'-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatase activities. These increases are not correlated, probably due to the influence of therapy on the synthesis and release of both enzymes in the liver. 5'-nucleotidase seems to be the best marker for the detection and follow-up of liver disease in this patient group.",,,,,,,,,

A series of 121 lymphoma/leukemia samples, including 35 cases of HD, 34 T-cell and 39 B-cells NHLs, 2 cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, and 11 cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, were evaluated for CD40L expression by immunostaining of frozen tissue sections and flow cytometry with the anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody M90. CD40L was constitutively expressed by neoplastic cells in 15 of 36 (42%) T-cell NHLs/adult T-cell leukemia/lymphomas, almost invariably those displaying the CD4+/CD8- phenotype, whereas no CD40L-expressing tumor cells could be found in B-cell NHL and HD. Among T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, CD40L was detected only on 2 cases displaying a stem-cell-like phenotype. In follicular B-cell lymphomas a large number of CD40L-expressing CD3+/CD4+ T lymphocytes were found admixed with tumor cells within the neoplastic follicles and in their surrounding areas. In the nonfollicular B-cell lymphomas, CD40L-positive CD3+/CD4+ T lymphocytes were few or absent. In all HD subtypes other than the nodular lymphocytic predominance, CD40L-expressing CD3+/CD4+ T lymphocytes were numerous in the HD-involved areas and were mainly located in close proximity to the Reed-Sternberg cells. Our data indicate that in human lymphomas CD40L is preferentially expressed by a restricted subset of T-cell lymphomas, mostly with CD4 immunophenotype. Finally, we have provided morphological evidence that CD40L may play an important role in the cell contact-dependent interaction of tumor B-cells (CD40+) within the neoplastic follicles or Reed-Sternberg cells (CD40+) in HD-involved areas and the microenvironmental CD3+/CD4+/CD40L+ T lymphocytes.",PMC1870995,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: Data on IFN-alpha therapy for CML collected from published articles identified in a MEDLINE computer search. RESULTS: Previously untreated patients with low-risk factors and early-stage disease consistently had the best results in clinical trials. A dose response was seen, with patients treated with dosages of 5 million units (MU)/m2 per day showing the greatest incidence of cytogenetic remissions. In addition, randomized trials showed a survival advantage for IFN-alpha-treated patients. In studies comparing IFN-alpha therapy to chemotherapy, IFN-alpha produced significantly more major and durable cytogenetic responses than chemotherapy did. In studies combining IFN-alpha and chemotherapy, patients had significantly more cytogenetic responses, although more patient accrual and follow-up data are needed to offer conclusive statements concerning durability of response. IFN-alpha also showed activity in maintaining remissions after both chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-alpha has significant activity in patients with CML, with best results at dosages of 5 MU/m2 per day. At these dosages, in patients with early-stage, Philadelphia+ CML, hematologic response rates of 70% to 80% and cytogenetic response rates of 50% (approximately 20% of which were complete) are seen. One randomized trial shows a survival advantage with cytogenetic response in IFN-alpha-treated patients, and this advantage appears to be unrelated to the degree of that response. These questions remain under study.",,,,,,,,,

Proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) for cancer and several other chronic diseases were significantly elevated among 61,682 white male construction workers who died between 1984 and 1986. Men younger than age 65, who were probably still employed immediately prior to death, had significantly elevated PMRs for cancer, asbestos-related diseases, mental disorders, alcohol-related disease, digestive diseases, falls, poisonings, traumatic fatalities that are usually work-related, and homicides. Elevated PMRs for many of the same causes were observed to a lesser degree for black men and white women whose usual industry was construction. In addition, women experienced excess cancer of the connective tissue and suicide mortality. Various skilled construction trades had elevated PMRs for specific sites, such as bone cancer and melanoma in brickmasons, stomach cancer in roofers and brickmasons, kidney and bone cancer in concrete/terrazzo finishers, nasal cancer in plumbers, pulmonary tuberculosis in laborers, scrotal cancer and aplastic anemia in electricians, acute myeloid leukemia in boilermakers, rectal cancer and multiple sclerosis in electrical power installers, and lung cancer in structural metal workers. Using a standard population of blue collar workers did not result in fewer elevated PMRs for construction workers. Despite lifestyle differences and other limitations of the study, the large numbers of excess deaths observed in this study indicate the need for preventive action for construction workers.",,,,,,,,,

This paper reports on a 5-year-old male patient who had an unusual presentation of an NK cell leukemia that was initially diagnosed as neuroblastoma. A bone marrow (BM) aspirate showed clumps of undifferentiated cells with the following phenotype: CD56bright+, CD33dim+, CD45-, CD2-, CD19-, CD16-, and CD57-. Cytochemistry was noncontributory. The patient, having failed to respond to conventional neuroblastoma chemotherapy, was subsequently diagnosed as having NK cell leukemia based on functional in vitro assays. The patient responded to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) chemotherapy but relapsed 4 weeks into treatment and eventually died 25 weeks after initial presentation. The cell surface phenotype observed is consistent with a rare NK cell subset, the biology of which has not been well defined. Freshly isolated BM cells killed K562 cells in a conventional 51Cr-release assay. Both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) induced LAK activity against the Daudi cell line. IL-2 induced proliferation of the leukemic cells. TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-1ra, and TGF-beta levels were assessed and found to be concentrated in BM, in contrast to plasma samples.

All patients achieved a complete cytogenetic and hematologic remission after bone marrow transplantation. Twelve patients are alive (median, 18 months; range, 5-54 months) and two patients died early. bcr-abl mRNA was persistently detectable for 6 to 54 months in four patients (patients 1, 3, 4, 6). From two of them, DNA fingerprint analysis showed only donor type DNA although bcr-abl mRNA was detectable. bcr-abl mRNA was never detectable posttransplant in three patients (patients 2, 5, 13). Six patients had detectable bcr-abl mRNA (patients 8-12, 14): by 6 months, all of these patients were bcr-abl mRNA negative. One patient (patient 7) had detectable full bcr-abl mRNA again at 12 months, but was then negative at 20 months. Ten patients (patients 2, 4-8, 10-13) had never detectable Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome t(9.22) translocation, whereas four patients had detectable Ph1 (patient 1, 3, 9, 14); by 6 months, three of four cases were negative. One patient (patient 1) had detectable Ph1 at 44 months, but was negative at 50 months. Three of six patients who initially had bcr-abl mRNA detectable posttransplant (patient 7-9) became negative for bcr-abl mRNA at the time of development of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). These results suggest that the detection of subclinical Ph1 positive cells by PCR is not associated with imminent clinical or cytogenetic relapse. Moreover, graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity may contribute to the treatment of minimal residual disease in CML after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.",,,,,,,,,

The authors studied 21 extramedullary tumors of lymphoid or myeloid blasts. They used a panel of 22 antibodies on frozen sections and 9 antibodies on paraffin sections to determine the spectrum of immunophenotypes and to develop a practical panel for diagnosis. All but two of the cases could be classified as lymphoid or myeloid using immunohistologic analysis. Thirteen cases were classified as lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia (LBL/ALL); 10 were classified as precursor T (CD7+, CD3+/-, CD45+) and 3 as precursor B-cell (CD19+/-CD10+CD45-) type. Five cases were classified as myeloid sarcoma (CD13+ myeloperoxidase+, lysozyme+). Two LBL/ALL coexpressed either CD33 (1 case) or CD15 (1 case), and one myeloid sarcoma coexpressed TdT and CD7. One case appeared to be truly mixed lineage, coexpressing CD3 with myeloperoxidase and lysozyme, and two cases expressed no lineage-specific antigens. There were clinical differences between the three major tumor types, and within the category of T-precursor LBL/ALL, classification according to stage of thymocyte differentiation was associated with distinctive clinical features. In conclusion, the spectrum of immunophenotypes detected on frozen section was similar to that reported by flow cytometry on peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens. The most useful antigens on frozen sections were CD7 and CD3 (T cell), CD10 and CD19 (B cell), and CD13 (myeloid). TdT was coexpressed by one myeloid sarcoma and was undetectable in 40% of LBL/ALL. On paraffin sections, myeloperoxidase and lysozyme were reliable markers of myeloid lineage, but none of the markers used on paraffin sections distinguished between LBL/ALL of T- and B-precursor types. Both B-LBL/ALL and myeloid sarcomas were often CD45- on paraffin sections, which may be a obstacle in determining the diagnosis. These distinctions appear to have clinical relevance.",,,,,,,,,

Since TK1 is virtually absent in non-dividing cells, TK2 is probably the only thymidine kinase present in these cells. In cellular metabolism, TK1 and TK2 presumably serve to maintain sufficient dTTP for DNA replication and repair. TK1 purified from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes is a dimer in the absence and a tetramer in the presence of ATP. In addition to the molecular weight transition, incubation with ATP at 4 degrees C or storage with ATP induces a reversible, enzyme concentration-dependent, kinetically slow transition from a low to a high affinity form of TK1, with Km values of 14 microM and 0.5 microM, respectively. This affinity difference implies that at cellular thymidine concentrations, the difference in catalytic activity between the two TK1 forms will be 3-5-fold. Calculations of cellular TK1 concentration suggested that the low affinity dimer form was dominant in G0/G1 cells and the high affinity tetramer form in S-phase cells. Hence, the transition may serve to fine-tune the cell-cycle regulation of thymidine kinase activity on the post-translational level. To study the ATP effect on the molecular level, an IPTG inducible T7 RNA polymerase-dependent expression system for the entire human TK1 polypeptide in E. coli was established. The recombinant TK1 has the same subunit mass and specific activity as the native enzyme. However, the recombinant TK1 solely displayed the kinetics of the high affinity form, with Km values of 0.3-0.4 microM regardless of pre-exposure to ATP, indicating that the ATP effect may be dependent on post-translational modifications absent in E. coli. Surprisingly, we did not observe any effect of ATP on TK1 purified from bone-marrow cells from a patient with acute monocytic leukemia (AMOL). Furthermore, the Km values of TK1 from these cells were 45 microM for the ATP-free enzyme and 65 microM for the ATP-incubated enzyme. With TK1 purified from HL-60 cells, we obtained the same pattern and kinetic values as for TK1 from lymphocytes. In the light of the results with the recombinant TK1, we presume that the lack of ATP effect and very high Km values observed for the AMOL TK1 may be due to changes in post-translational regulatory mechanisms in acute monocytic cells.",,,,,,,,,

The 3-amino-2-pyridine carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazones were also more active then the 5-amino-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazones in inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase activity and L1210 cell growth in culture and in vivo. N-Acetylation of the 3-amino derivative resulted in a compound that was much less active both in vitro and in vivo; N-acetylation of the 5-amino derivative did not alter the in vitro inhibitory properties, but did eliminate the antitumor properties in vivo. When the most active HCTs were studied in more detail, it was found that the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was inhibited completely without the inhibition of [3H]uridine incorporation into RNA. Further, the conversion of [14C]cytidine to deoxycytidine nucleotides and incorporation into DNA was inhibited by the HCTs without an effect on the incorporation of cytidine into RNA.

The enzyme appears to have a central role in both DNA organization and replication. The importance of nuclear matrix topoisomerase II alpha as a target for certain anticancer agents was evaluated in CEM human leukemia cells. Studies were done to determine the extent to which the alpha (170 kDa) and beta (180 kDa) isozymes of topoisomerase II form covalent enzyme-DNA complexes in whole cells and in the nuclear matrix and nonmatrix fractions of CEM cells that are either sensitive or resistant to topoisomerase II-active anticancer agents. Topoisomerase II alpha was detected in both the high salt-soluble (nonmatrix) and matrix fractions of nuclei from parental CEM cells. Most of the matrix topoisomerase II alpha was tightly bound to DNA in cells incubated with VM-26. In contrast, topoisomerase II beta was detected only in the high salt-soluble (nonmatrix) fraction of the nucleus. The subnuclear distribution of the alpha and beta topoisomerase II isozymes in CEM/VM-1 cells resistant to topoisomerase-active drugs was similar to that in drug-sensitive CEM cells. However, the amount and activity of topoisomerase II alpha in nuclear matrices of CEM/VM-1 cells were decreased 3- to 6-fold relative to that of CEM cells. The differences observed in the subnuclear distribution and DNA binding pattern of the topoisomerase II isozymes support the hypotheses that each isozyme has a distinct cellular function. Furthermore, these results provide evidence that topoisomerase II alpha is the nuclear matrix target for VM-26, and that depletion of the nuclear matrix isozyme contributes to cellular resistance to this anticancer agent.",,,,,,,,,

The behavior of the nuclear inositol lipid cycle has been investigated in nuclei of Friend erythroleukemia cells. These nuclei possess both lipid kinases and PLC. The cycle upon treatment with differentiating agents (i.e., DMSO and tiazofurin) is characterized by an accumulation of polyphosphoinositides and a decrease of DAG due to down-regulation of a specific PLC. Indeed, even if both beta 1 and gamma 1 isoforms are present in these nuclei, when Friend cells undergo terminal erythroid differentiation only the PLC beta 1 isoform is down-regulated as shown by immunochemical and immunocytochemical analysis, by direct determination of enzymatic activity and in the presence of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies as well as by Northern blot for PLC beta 1 message, whilst the amount of PLC gamma 1 and its activity are unaffected by erythroid differentiation. In conclusion, the presence of a specific nuclear PLC whose activity and expression are down-regulated during differentiation of erythroleukemia cells points out a role for nuclear phosphoinositide signalling in the processes of cell differentiation and hints at the nuclear PLC beta 1 as an important step of the cycle in relation to the erythroid differentiative commitment of murine erythroleukemia cells.",,,,,,,,,

The neuropoietic and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) cytokines, in particular, have emerged as candidates for regulating the phenotype of sympathetic neurons. Culture studies have shown that neuropoietic cytokines (such as leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, growth promoting activity) can induce the cholinergic enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and several neuropeptides, whereas certain members of the TGF-beta family (activin A, bone morphogenetic proteins-2 and -6) induce partially overlapping but distinct sets of transmitter and neuropeptide genes in sympathetic neurons. Since activins can induce ChAT in cultured neurons, we have investigated whether these cytokines are expressed by the appropriate cells and tissues to make them candidates for the cholinergic differentiation factor that is known to alter the phenotype of sympathetic neurons that innervate the sweat gland in the footpad in vivo. In-situ hybridization with the anti-sense probe for activin beta B specifically labels the sweat glands but not other tissues in the footpads of developing rats. Ribonuclease protection assays indicate that beta B as well as the other activin and inhibin subunit mRNAs are expressed by a number of tissues, including footpad, hairy skin and submaxillary gland. Homogenates of developing rat footpads, however, failed to induce the set of neuropeptide genes in cultured sympathetic neurons that is characteristic for activins, although neuropoietic cytokine activity was readily detectable in this assay. Thus, while activin beta B mRNA is expressed in the sweat gland, this tissue does not contain detectable activin protein as assayed by its ability to regulate neuronal gene expression. Moreover, activin subunit mRNAs are expressed by targets of noradrenergic sympathetic neurons in vivo, indicating that activin expression is not limited to targets of cholinergic neurons.",,,,,,,,,

We have used highly enriched human astrocyte cultures as an experimental tool to investigate the influence of cytokines on adhesion molecule expression and synthesis of mediators that are probably important in immune and inflammatory reactions involving the nervous system and in cerebral tissue repair. The response of astrocytes to interferon-gamma mainly resulted in increased expression of major histocompatibility complex antigens and co-stimulatory molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, LFA-1 alpha) which mediate astrocyte-T-cell interactions. Another co-stimulatory molecule, B7, was neither expressed nor inducible by IFN-gamma and other cytokines. TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta were more efficient in stimulating synthesis of immunoregulatory and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and colony-stimulating factors), cytokine antagonists (TNF-alpha soluble receptors), or cytokines with a possible neuroprotective role (leukemia inhibitory factor); they also increased expression of some co-stimulatory molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1). Transforming growth factor-beta 1 was a strong inducer of leukemia inhibitory factor, but did not affect either major histocompatibility complex/co-stimulatory molecule expression or cytokine synthesis. Thus, different cytokines activate distinct functional programs in astrocytes, which may play a specific role in different brain diseases or at different stages of the same disease. It was additionally observed that the response of human astrocytes to cytokines (in particular the inducible synthesis of certain cytokines) varied greatly depending on the presence or absence of neurons in the culture system. This finding suggests that neuronal-glial interactions may be implicated in determining the activation threshold of astrocytes to inflammatory cytokines.",,,,,,,,,

To examine these developmental issues, we have utilized several culture systems including conditionally immortalized cell lines, subventricular zone progenitor cells and primary neuronal cultures. A neural stem and progenitor cell line (MK31) was established from murine embryonic hippocampus by retroviral transduction of temperature-sensitive alleles of the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen. At the non-permissive temperature for antigen expression (39 degrees C) in serum-free media, the neural stem cells give rise to a series of increasingly mature neuronal progenitor and differentiated cellular forms under the influence of a subset of hematolymphopoietic cytokines (interleukins 5, 7, 9 and 11), when individually co-applied with transforming growth factor alpha, after pretreatment with basic fibroblast growth factor. These cellular forms elaborated a series of progressively more mature neurofilament proteins, a sequential pattern of ligand-gated channels, and inward currents and generation of action potentials with mature physiological properties. Because the factors regulating the development of central nervous system astrocytes have been so difficult to define, we have chosen to focus, in this manuscript, on the elaboration of this cell type. At 39 degrees C, application of a subfamily of bone morphogenetic proteins of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of growth factors sanctioned the selective expression of astrocytic progenitor cells and mature astrocytes, as defined by sequential elaboration of the Yb subunit of glutathione-S-transferase and glial fibrillary acidic protein. These lineage-specific cytokine inductive relationships were verified using subventricular zone neural progenitor cells generated by the application of epidermal growth factor, alone or in combination with basic fibroblast growth factor, to dissociated cellular cultures derived from early embryonic murine brain, a normal non-transformed developmental population. Finally, application of a different series of cytokines from five distinct factor classes (basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-AA, insulin-like growth factor 1, neurotrophin 3 and representative gp130 receptor subunit-related ligands) caused the elaboration of oligodendroglial progenitor species and post-mitotic oligodendrocytes, defined by progressive morphological maturation and the expression of increasingly advanced oligodendroglial and oligodendrocyte lineage markers. In addition, seven different gp130-associated neuropoietic (ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin-M) and hematopoietic (interleukins 6, 11, 12, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) cytokines exhibited differential trophic effects on oligodendroglial lineage maturation and factor class interactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

The improvement in survival rate was considerable for leukemia and malignant lymphoma, fairly good for neoplasms of the renal (mostly Wilms' tumor) and digestive (mostly hepatoblastoma) organs and moderate for neuroblastoma. Overall, survival rates of childhood neoplasms improved considerably. Much of this improvement was explained by a great improvement in survival rates of neoplasms of the blood which constituted the majority of patients.",,,,,,,,,

In addition, approximately 30% of inoculated animals developed central nervous system disease--hindlimb paralysis or semilateral paralysis. Rescue of virus from the spleen of an animal with combined erythroid/myeloid leukemia, followed by endpoint dilution gave two stocks: 19-6 (XC+, NB-tropic) and 19-7 (XC-, NB-tropic). Both stocks induced erythroid and myeloid leukemia, and 19-6 induced CNS symptoms as well. Southern blot analysis indicated that the predominant viruses from the 19-6 and the 19-7 cultures were related, but different in the env region. An infectious virus molecular clone of provirus from 19-6 cells was obtained. The resulting cloned virus [SRS 19-6 murine leukemia virus (MuLV)] induced four kinds of leukemia: erythroid, myeloid, B-lymphoma, and T-lymphoma; in many cases, more than one tumor type was identified in the same animal. Such a broad spectrum of leukemias induced by a cloned MuLV is unusual. Flaccid hindlimb paralysis induced by SRS 19-6 MuLV could be attributed to meningeal B-lymphoma. Immunofluorescent staining with a panel of env-specific monoclonal antibodies confirmed that the 19-6 and 19-7 viral stocks contained different viruses, which differed from previously characterized MuLVs.

A possible pathogenic interaction between polyomavirus and an endogenous mouse retrovirus locus (mtv-7) in polyomavirus-induced cancer has also been reported. To study potential interactive effects of polyomavirus (Py) and Moloney murine leukemia retrovirus (M-MuLV), newborn Balb/c and NIH Swiss mice were infected with high titer wild-type Py (A2 strain) and M-MuLV. Dramatically stunted growth (runting) occurred in 100% of the doubly inoculated mice, while much lower frequency of runting occurred in animals infected with Py alone and not at all with M-MuLV-infected mice. In situ hybridization for Py DNA showed ongoing Py replication and inflammation in kidneys (atypical of most mice singly infected by Py) of runted doubly inoculated mice. In addition, high Py viral replication continued well past the usual acute stage termination. M-MuLV replication was also initially inhibited in bone marrow by simultaneous Py infection. No M-MuLV replication was seen in singly or doubly infected mouse kidneys. Runting was very rapid, observable within 2 days after co-infection, arguing against an adaptive or antigen-specific immunological mechanism. One possibility was that a cytokine-driven acute response mechanism was involved. Supporting this view, RNAse protection assays for various cytokine RNAs showed that several were specifically elevated in kidneys of doubly infected mice. Three patterns were observed: (1) IL-6 was elevated in doubly infected mice early after infection (7 days), but it declined at later times (19 days); (2) IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, and IL-10 were elevated at both early and late times; and (3) TNF-alpha, IL-12p40, and possibly TNF-beta were elevated only at late times. While the cytokines in the third category might be indicative of infiltrating inflammatory cells, it seems possible that cytokines in the first or second categories might be involved in establishing runting and ongoing polyoma DNA replication in the doubly infected mice.",,,,,,,,,

Given its size, the RTI is the major (albeit geographically limited) Italian source of population-based survival rates of cancer in children. The present report describes time trends in survival of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: During 1970-87, 429 residents in Piedmont aged 0-14 were diagnosed as having ALL: they have been followed up until 1991. RESULTS: Five-year survival rates increased from 21% to 72% for children diagnosed ALL respectively in 1970-72 and 1985-87. Major improvements occurred up to the mid-seventies and again between cases diagnosed in the early and late eighties. Improvement in survival was statistically significant for children belonging to classes comprised between 2 and 10 years of age at diagnosis. Period of diagnosis was unrelated to probability of survival among the 13 cases diagnosed ALL at age 0. Survival was unrelated to sex, even in the early seventies and even after consideration of children dying more than 5 years after diagnosis. Between 1976-81 and 1982-87, an improvement in survival was found in all categories of WBC count at diagnosis: the ratio between the two estimates was somewhat higher for children with more than 50,000 WBC/mm3 at diagnosis than for other children. CONCLUSIONS: Present data are compared with those resulting from other population-based series: this exercise can be useful for an overall evaluation of delivery of cancer therapy at the population basis.",,,,,,,,,

All patients received a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine +/- corticosteroids.

This NA null phenotype was converted to the normal phenotype of NA1, NB2 by the transplantation of bone marrow from an HLA-identical sibling. To investigate the inherited or acquired nature of this rare phenotype, a combination of conventional neutrophil serology and recently developed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays was used. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Diagnosis, remission, and posttransplant patient peripheral blood samples were used for neutrophil phenotyping by granulocyte agglutination and immunofluorescence tests. The presence and dose of the gene for neutrophil Fc gamma RIIIb (Fc gamma RIIIB) were tested for with RFLP and Southern analysis and PCR-based RFLP tests. Plasma levels of circulating soluble Fc gamma RIII (sFc gamma RIII) were measured with radioimmunoassay. The sibling bone marrow donor and the patient's parents were also studied. RESULTS: RFLP analysis of DNA obtained from the patient at the time of diagnosis showed that she lacked the Fc gamma RIIIB gene for neutrophil Fc gamma RIII (i.e., Fc gamma RIIIb), but that, in DNA prepared from posttransplant samples, the Fc gamma RIIIB gene was present. Quantitation of plasma levels of soluble FcRIII (sFcRIII) demonstrated a complete absence of sFcRIII in the patient's pretransplant plasma. However, 20 units of sFcRIII were detected in the patient's plasma by 160 days after graft. Hair samples from the patient provided sufficient nonhematopoietic, genomic DNA to confirm that her genotype was NA0NA0. DNA prepared from lymphocytes of both parents and the sibling marrow donor was used to quantitate their Fc gamma RIIIB gene dose. The mother and brother had only one Fc gamma RIIIB gene each, while the father apparently had a normal complement of two Fc gamma RIIIB genes. CONCLUSION: In this case, an inherited absence of Fc gamma RIIIB gene in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia was unintentionally corrected by the transplantation of bone marrow from a sibling donor who himself carried only one Fc gamma RIIIB gene.",,,,,,,,,

Optimal conditions for collection of PBSC and successful PBSCT, however, are still controversial. We performed 57 leukaphereses after 19 courses of chemotherapy for mobilization of PBSC (semi-high-dose VP-16 alone; 500 mg/m2/day for 3 or 4 days, 13 courses, or conventional chemotherapy; six courses) combined with subsequent G-CSF administration in 13 patients with malignancies (six with lymphoma, five with leukemia, and two with germ cell tumors). Total numbers of the CD34+ cells and CFU-GM obtained by multiple leukaphereses after one course of mobilization therapy were 0.63-168.74 x 10(6)/kg (mean 33.94) and 0.15-56.0 x 10(5)/kg (mean 8.22), respectively. We demonstrated that many cellular components of peripheral blood (PB) on the day of PBSC harvest, especially CD34+ cell, total leukocyte, myelocyte and monocyte counts, were correlated with the numbers of CFU-GM obtained in each leukapheresis. A daily increase of leukocyte counts was another useful indicator for the day of PBSC harvest. We also found that the time when total leukocyte counts in PB recovered to more than 5000/microliters or when CD34+ cells within PB mononuclear cells exceeded 1% was optimal for PBSC harvest. Our results confirmed that the semi-high-dose regimen with VP-16 combined with G-CSF is a safe method which has both antitumor effects and mobilization ability of PBSC in patients with hematological malignancies. PBSCT following various high-dose chemotherapy regimens with or without total body irradiation was also performed in 11 of the 13 patients, and rapid hematologic recovery was observed in all of the patients.",,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with blood malignancies (AML, 19; ALL, 14; indifferentiated AL, 1; CML, 9; lymphoblastic lymphoma, 3; RAEB, 1; RAEBT, 1), subjected to BMT (16 autologous and 32 allo-BMT) were retrospectively revised. They all had been treated with BuCy as conditioning regimen. The GVHD prophylaxis was made in allo-BMT with cyclosporin and short-term methotrexate. Twelve patients received PTX-MP as mucositis prophylaxis. RESULTS: Some kind of toxicity was found in 47 of the 48 patients, mostly grade I-II (45 cases). The commonest sites involved were the mouth (87.5%) and the liver (30.23%). Neither veno-occlusive liver disease nor pulmonary toxicity were present in any case. Heart toxicity was seen only in 2 cases, while 3 had haemorrhagic cystitis due to Cy. The severity of the mucositis was lesser in those patients receiving PTX-MP, so the requirements of NPT were lower in them (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The toxicity of the BuCy conditioning regimen was lesser than that of Cy+total body irradiation, with the same eradicating capability. Prophylaxis with PTX-MP could prove effective in reducing mucositis.",,,,Toxicidad extramedular en el trasplante de medula osea bajo acondicionamiento con busulfan y ciclofosfamida.,,,,,

Bulk T1 and T2 in responder (n = 22) and nonresponder (n = 7) patients were compared. RESULTS: Relative to pretreatment bulk T1 values, bulk T1 had increased a mean of 11% at week 1 and had decreased a mean of 7% and 39% at weeks 2 and 6, respectively. Values in nonresponder patients were not statistically significantly different (+11%, -14%, -38%). CONCLUSION: MR imaging of lumbar bone marrow in patients with AML demonstrated statistically significant changes in bulk T1 during treatment that correlated with changes in cellularity.

The study was designed to estimate the lifetime incidence of myeloid leukemia in seven groups of about 750 mice each; radiation exposures were approximately 0, 1, 2 and 3 Gy both for tritiated water and for X rays. The lifetime incidence of leukemia in these mice increased from 0.13% in the control group to 6-8% in groups exposed to higher radiation doses. The results were fitted to various equations relating leukemia incidence to radiation dose, using both the raw data and data corrected for cumulative mouse-days at risk. The calculated RBE values for tritium beta rays compared to X rays ranged from 1.0 +/- 0.5 to 1.3 +/- 0.3. A best estimate of the RBE for this experiment was about 1.2 +/- 0.3.

Such an epilation effect has also been associated with leukemia mortality and the frequency of chromosome aberrations. Although this might be interpreted as indicating differential sensitivity to radiation between the epilation group and the no-epilation group, it could also be explained by imprecision in dose estimates. We have calculated that a 48% random error in DS86 dose estimates could be in accordance with the dose-response relationship for the prevalence of cataracts in the epilation group or the no-epilation group.

CD19-associated Lyn kinase can be selectively targeted and inhibited with B43-Gen, a CD19 receptor-specific immunoconjugate containing the naturally occurring protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (Gen).

The therapeutic potential of this membrane-directed apoptosis induction strategy was examined in a scid mouse xenograft model of radiation-resistant high-grade human B-lineage lymphoma. Remarkably, in vivo treatment of scid mice challenged with an invariably fatal number of Ramos-BT cells with B43-Gen at a dose level < 1/10 the maximum tolerated dose resulted in 70% long-term event-free survival.

Aggregation of Fc epsilon RI, the high-affinity IgE receptor, causes a significant increase in the amount of p53/56lyn associated with these low-density membrane domains. Under our standard conditions for lysis, IgE-Fc epsilon RI fractionates with the majority of the solubilized proteins, whereas aggregated receptor complexes are found at a higher density in the gradient. Stimulated translocation of p53/56lyn is accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in the low-density membrane domains as well as enhanced in vitro tyrosine kinase activity toward these proteins and an exogenous substrate. With a lower detergent-to-cell ratio during lysis, significant Fc epsilon RI remains associated with these membrane domains, consistent with the ability to coimmunoprecipitate tyrosine kinase activity with Fc epsilon RI under similar lysis conditions [Pribluda, V.

Hox proteins have recently been shown to bind cooperatively to DNA with another class of homeodomain proteins that include extradenticle, Pbx1, and Pbx2. Hox gene products contain a highly conserved hexapeptide connected by a linker of variable length to the homeodomain. We show that the hexapeptide and the linker region are required for cooperativity with Pbx1 and Pbx2 proteins. Many of the conserved residues present in the Hoxb-8 hexapeptide are required to modulate the DNA binding of the Pbx proteins. Position of the hexapeptide relative to the homeodomain is important. Although deletions of two and four residues of the linker peptide still show cooperative DNA binding, removal of all six linker residues strongly reduces cooperativity. In addition, an insertion of 10 residues within the linker peptide significantly lowers cooperative DNA binding.

To identify regions within alpha and beta II PKC that allow participation in these divergent pathways, we constructed chimeras in which the regulatory and catalytic domains of alpha and beta II PKC were exchanged. These PKC chimeras can be stably expressed, exhibit enzymatic properties similar to native alpha and beta II PKC in vitro, and participate in alpha and beta II PKC isotype-specific pathways in K-562 cells. Expression of the beta/alpha PKC chimera induces cytostasis in the same manner as overexpression of wild-type alpha PKC. In contrast, the alpha/beta II PKC chimera, like wild-type beta II PKC, selectively translocates to the nucleus and leads to increased phosphorylation of the nuclear envelope polypeptide lamin B in response to bryostatin-1. Therefore, the catalytic domains of alpha and beta II PKC contain determinants important for alpha and beta II PKC isotype function.

Ectopic expression experiments indicated that proteins containing the AML1 Runt domain function in Drosophila embryos and that sequences outside of this domain are important in vivo.",PMC40929,['GENBANK/U22358'],,,,,,,

In this report, conjugates that consist of folate covalently linked to anti-TCR antibodies are shown to be potent in mediating lysis of tumor cells that express either the alpha or beta isoform of the FR. Intact antibodies with an average of five folate per molecule exhibited high affinity for FR+ tumor cells but did not bind to FR- tumor cells. Lysis of FR+ cell lines could be detected at concentrations as low as 1 pM (approximately 0.1 ng/ml), which was 1/1000th the concentration required to detect binding to the FR+ cells. Various FR+ mouse tumor cell lines could be targeted with each of three different anti-TCR antibodies that were tested as conjugates. The antibodies included 1B2, a clonotypic antibody specific for the cytotoxic T cell clone 2C; KJ16, an anti-V beta 8 antibody; and 2C11, an anti-CD3 antibody. These antibodies differ in affinities by up to 100-fold, yet the cytolytic capabilities of the folate/antibody conjugates differed by no more than 10-fold.

The p53-dependent G1 arrest involves induction of p21 (also called WAF1/CIP1/SDI1), which prevents cyclin kinase-mediated phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (RB). Recent studies suggest a p53-independent G1 checkpoint as well; however, little is known about its molecular mechanisms. We report that induction of a protein-serine/threonine phosphatase activity by DNA damage signals is at least one of the mechanisms responsible for p53-independent, RB-mediated G1 arrest and consequent apoptosis. When two p53-null human leukemic cell lines (HL-60 and U-937) were treated with a variety of anticancer agents, RB became hypophosphorylated, accompanied with G1 arrest. This was followed immediately (in less than 30 min) by apoptosis, as determined by the accumulation of pre-G1 apoptotic cells and the internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA. Addition of calyculin A or okadaic acid (specific serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors) or zinc chloride (apoptosis inhibitor) prevented the G1 arrest- and apoptosis-specific RB dephosphorylation. The levels of cyclin E- and cyclin A-associated kinase activities remained high during RB dephosphorylation, supporting the involvement of a chemotherapy-induced serine/threonine phosphatase(s) rather than p21. Furthermore, the induced phosphatase activity coimmunoprecipitated with the hyperphosphorylated RB and was active in a cell-free system that reproduced the growth arrest- and apoptosis-specific RB dephosphorylation, which was inhibitable by calyculin A but not zinc. We propose that the RB phosphatase(s) might be one of the p53-independent G1 checkpoint regulators.",PMC40915,,,,,,,,

Engagement of CD28 induces interleukin 2 (IL-2) production and cell proliferation when combined with an additional signal such as treatment with phorbol ester, an activator of protein kinase C. Recent studies have established that after CD28 ligation, the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 can bind to the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase). There is a concomitant increase in PI3 lipid kinase activity that may be important in CD28 signaling. Despite the requirement of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for effector function, we have found, however, that treatment of Jurkat T cells with the phorbol ester PMA dramatically inhibits (i) the association of PI3 kinase with CD28, (ii) the ability of p85 PI3 kinase to be immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and (iii) the induction of PI3 kinase activity after stimulation of the cells with the anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody 9.3. These changes occur within minutes of PMA treatment and are persistent. In addition, we have found that wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI3 kinase, does not interfere with the induction of IL-2 after stimulation of Jurkat T cells with anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody and PMA. We conclude that PI3 kinase activity may not be required for CD28-dependent IL-2 production from Jurkat T cells in the presence of PMA.",PMC41056,,,,,,,,

The synovia of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) contains activated T lymphocytes, with a restricted expression of T cell receptor (TCR) variable (V) beta gene segments. To characterize the T-cell populations of RA among HTLV-I carriers and noncarriers, we performed the immunohistochemical staining of CD4 and CDB, as well as a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to estimate the proportion of TCR beta RNA containing any particular V elements on the synovial specimens. In all but one HTLV-I carrier, the proviral DNA and/or RNA expression of HTLV-I was detected in the synovium. The CD4-positive cells proliferated markedly in the HTLV-I carriers compared with the noncarriers. In contrast to mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood, synovial T cells expressed only a few V beta transcripts, and no definite difference was observed between the carriers and the noncarriers. These results suggest that a common major antigen associated with the pathogenesis of RA may thus selectively interact with the V beta component of the TCR. Using RT-PCR, we studied the expression of the recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG-1), which was used in the V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin and TCR genes. In all cases, RAG-1 was transcripted. The results supported the possibility that the extrathymic development of the selected TCR V beta T cells occurred in the synovia.",,,,,,,,,

Laryngeal tissue removed at autopsy from 14 patients with known disseminated hematologic malignancies and at operation from one patient with multicentric malignant lymphoma of low-grade malignancy (MALToma) of the head and neck region was investigated. A systematic survey of the main clinicopathologic features of the published cases of hemopoietic tumors with laryngeal involvement was also performed. Primary involvement of the larynx by hemopoietic neoplasms must be clearly distinguished from secondary involvement by disseminated or leukemic tumors. Most of the primary tumors are localized lesions that may involve the regional lymph nodes (stages IE or IIE). Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice, and the prognosis is generally favorable. However, secondary involvement by disseminated or leukemic disease carries a very poor prognosis in most cases. Extramedullary plasmacytoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), particularly B-cell lymphoma of high-grade malignancy, appear to be the most common hemopoietic tumors with primary laryngeal involvement, while primary tumors of myelogenous origin (granulocytic sarcoma and mast cell sarcoma) are extremely rare. Extramedullary plasmacytoma and NHL occur mainly in older persons and in men, are generally associated with a relatively short history of hoarseness and dysphagia, and exhibit preferential involvement of the supraglottic parts of the larynx, in particular the epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds. They are generally polypoid, non-ulcerated lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated whether this inhibition of catch-up growth during maintenance treatment is attributable to the influence of chemotherapy or to the influence of corticosteroids. PATIENTS: Forty-six children treated for ALL were included in the study. In 27 patients maintenance therapy comprised vincristine (VCR), prednisone (Pred), or dexamethasone (Dexa) alternated with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and methotrexate (MTX) and 19 patients received maintenance therapy with 6-MP and MTX only. Treatment did not include cranial irradiation. RESULTS: Statural growth during maintenance treatment was comparable in both groups over the study period of 1.5 years. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy with 6-MP and MTX, and not corticosteroids, is the main factor that prevents catch-up growth from occurring during maintenance therapy for ALL.",,,,,,,,,

From a morphological point of view, the infiltration by leukemic cells occurred in the hypoplasic areas of the bone marrow biopsy (BMB) without increase in reticulin fibers. From these observations the authors deduce that: 1) BMB in many cases is the only morphologic tool for diagnosis and prognosis of HCL; 2) probably the ""hypoplasic"" variant of HCL will become more frequent, because of the increasing indication to BMB in course of pancytopenia, even in absence of splenomegaly; 3) our case is probably related more to an early phase of the disease than to a distinct variant. In addition, we propose that the co-existence of an aggressive solid tumor and HCL could be related to the immunosuppressive action by hairy cells.",,,,,,,,,

CML cells have reduced adhesion to some extracellular matrix components but the mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. In this study we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins in cells expressing p210BCR/ABL. An interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line, 32Dc13, was transformed with a BCR/ABL cDNA, and the patterns of localization, expression, and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins were compared among untransformed 32Dc13 cells with and without IL-3 stimulation and BCR/ABL-transformed 32Dc13 cells. Of the focal adhesion proteins examined, only paxillin exhibited tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-3; while in cells transformed by p210BCR/ABL, paxillin, vinculin, p125FAK, talin and tensin were constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated. IL-3 induced a transient association between paxillin and vinculin, while in BCR/ABL-transformed cells, several proteins coimmunoprecipitated with paxillin, including vinculin, p125FAK, talin and tensin. Pseudopodia enriched in focal adhesion proteins were transiently detected in 32Dc13 cells in response to IL-3, but constitutively detected in cells expressing p210BCR/ABL. p210BCR/ABL protein was also found concentrated in punctate structures adjacent to the cell membrane in myeloid cell lines, which often contained vinculin and paxillin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

To assess the consequences of ectopic expression of an activated ras gene in normal hematopoietic cells in vivo, lethally irradiated mice were reconstituted with bone marrow cells infected with a mutant ras-containing retrovirus [murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-v-H-ras] based on the MSCV retroviral vector which efficiently transduces functional genes into hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Despite a marked myeloid leukocytosis detectable in the peripheral blood within 4 weeks of engraftment, none of 22 primary or secondary transplant recipients studied for longer periods of time presented with myeloid neoplasms. Instead, 18 of the MSCV-v-H-ras mice developed pre-T-cell thymic lymphomas and/or pre-B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas between 7 and 12 weeks post-transplantation. The pre-B and pre-T lymphoid tumors that arose in one animal were shown to harbor a common MSCV-v-H-ras provirus, indicating that the target cell for transformation was a bipotential lymphoid precursor. To more precisely examine the effects of activated ras expression on the behavior of hematopoietic progenitors, infected bone marrow cells were assayed in methylcellulose cultures under conditions favorable for growth of multilineage myeloid colonies or were passaged as bulk suspension cultures in the presence of various hematopoietic growth factors, including interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-7. MSCV-directed expression of v-H-ras selectively promoted the formation of large dense colonies comprised of monocyte-macrophages in methylcellulose cultures. When transferred to liquid cultures, the vast majority of the cells underwent terminal macrophage differentiation. By comparison, tumorigenic B-lymphoid and mixed lymphoid/myeloid cell lines were routinely established from the bulk suspension cultures, with cell lines of predominantly myeloid phenotype emerging only in IL-6-supplemented cultures. These results, considered together with previous findings, suggest that activating ras mutations could be an initiating genetic alteration in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia but are more likely to be a post-initiation change in human acute myeloid leukemia.",,,,,,,,,

To study the combined effects of v-erbA and v-myb, the two oncogenes were engineered into a retrovirus bicistronic vector with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) or into a vector with a splice acceptor (SPL). This allowed coexpression of the two proteins and a comparison with the same vector containing either v-erbA or v-myb only. Both the erbA IRES and the erbA/myb IRES virus constructs transformed erythroid cells after infection of bone marrow or blastoderm cultures. The erbA/myb IRES virus exhibited a 5-10-fold higher transformed colony forming efficiency than the erbA IRES virus in the blastoderm assay. Surprisingly, when injected into chicken embryos in the presence of helper virus, both viruses induced an erythroleukemia in about half of the animals. In contrast, no leukemia was observed with a myb IRES virus, with spliced vectors containing v-erbA alone or v-erbA in combination with v-myb, nor with erbA IRES and erbA/myb IRES viruses produced in the absence of helper virus. The average latency of leukemia induction was shorter for the erbA/myb IRES virus (3.5 weeks) than for the erbA IRES virus (5 weeks). Nevertheless, for both viruses the leukemic blasts retained full factor dependence for growth. These results show that v-erbA is capable of inducing an erythroleukemia when expressed by a high titer bicistronic retrovirus under conditions of virus spreading and that its in vitro and in vivo transforming potential can be enhanced by v-myb.",,,,,,,,,

An understanding of the natural history of PNH is essential to improve therapy. METHODS: We have followed a group of 80 consecutive patients with PNH who were referred to Hammersmith Hospital, London, between 1940 and 1970. They were treated with supportive measures, such as oral anticoagulant therapy after established thromboses, and transfusions. RESULTS: The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 42 years (range, 16 to 75), and the median survival after diagnosis was 10 years, with 22 patients (28 percent) surviving for 25 years. Sixty patients have died; 28 of the 48 patients for whom the cause of death is known died from either venous thrombosis or hemorrhage. Thirty-one patients (39 percent) had one or more episodes of venous thrombosis during their illness. Of the 35 patients who survived for 10 years or more, 12 had a spontaneous clinical recovery. No PNH-affected cells were found among the erythrocytes or neutrophils of the patients in prolonged remission, but a few PNH-affected lymphocytes were detectable in three of the four patients tested. Leukemia did not develop in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: PNH is a chronic disorder that curtails life. A spontaneous long-term remission can occur, which must be taken into account when considering potentially dangerous treatments, such as bone marrow transplantation. Platelet transfusions should be given, as appropriate, and long-term anticoagulation therapy should be considered for all patients.",,,,,,,,,

We show here, however, that the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, which is known to be deficient in p53 because of large deletions in the p53 gene, can be induced to undergo apoptosis following X-irradiation. We demonstrate that the decision to undergo apoptosis in this cell line appears to be made at a G2 checkpoint. In addition, we characterize an HL-60 variant, HCW-2, which is radioresistant. HCW-2 cells display DNA damage induction and repair capabilities identical to those of the parental HL-60 cell line. Thus, the difference between the two cell lines appears to be that X-irradiation induces apoptosis in HL-60, but not in HCW-2, cells. Paradoxically, HCW-2 cells display high levels of expression of bax, which enhances apoptosis, and no longer express bcl-2, which blocks apoptosis. HCW-2 cells' resistance to apoptosis may be due to the acquisition of expression of bcl-XL, a bcl-2-related inhibitor of apoptosis. In summary, apoptosis can be induced in X-irradiated HL-60 cells by a p53-independent mechanism at a G2 checkpoint, despite the presence of endogenous bcl-2. The resistance shown by HCW-2 cells suggests that bcl-XL can block this process.",PMC230836,,,,,,,,

Recently, we demonstrated that multiple Hox proteins bind DNA cooperatively with both Pbx1 and its oncogenic derivative, E2A-Pbx1. Here, we show that the highly conserved pentapeptide motif F/Y-P-W-M-R/K, which occurs in numerous Hox proteins and is positioned 8 to 50 amino acids N terminal to the homeodomain, is essential for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx1 and E2A-Pbx1. Point mutational analysis demonstrated that the tryptophan and methionine residues within the core of this motif were critical for cooperative DNA binding. A peptide containing the wild-type pentapeptide sequence, but not one in which phenylalanine was substituted for tryptophan, blocked the ability of Hox proteins to bind cooperatively with Pbx1 or E2A-Pbx1, suggesting that the pentapeptide itself provides at least one surface through which Hox proteins bind Pbx1. Furthermore, the same peptide, but not the mutant peptide, stimulated DNA binding by Pbx1, suggesting that interaction of Hox proteins with Pbx1 through the pentapeptide motif raises the DNA-binding ability of Pbx1.",PMC230833,,,,,,,,

Prolongation of hematopoietic cell survival by inhibition of apoptosis has been proposed to be an integral component of BCR-ABL-induced chronic myelogenous leukemia. BCR-ABL elicits transformation of both fibroblast and hematopoietic cells and blocks apoptosis following cytokine deprivation in various factor-dependent cells. To elucidate the mechanisms whereby BCR-ABL induces transformation and blocks apoptosis in hematopoietic cells, we examined the biological effects of expression of a series of BCR-ABL mutants. Single amino acid substitutions in the GRB2 binding site (Y177F), Src homology 2 domain (R552L), or an autophosphorylation site in the tyrosine kinase domain (Y793F) do not diminish the antiapoptotic and transforming properties of BCR-ABL in hematopoietic cells, although these mutations were previously shown to drastically reduce the transforming activity of BCR-ABL in fibroblasts. A BCR-ABL molecule containing all three mutations (Y177F/R552L/Y793F) exhibits a severe decrease in transforming and antiapoptotic activities compared with the wild-type BCR-ABL protein in 32D myeloid progenitor cells. Ras is activated, the SHC adapter protein is tyrosine phosphorylated and binds GRB2, and myc mRNA levels are increased following expression of all kinase active BCR-ABL proteins with the exception of the Y177F/R552L/Y793F BCR-ABL mutant in 32D cells. We propose that BCR-ABL uses multiple pathways to activate Ras in hematopoietic cells and that this activation is necessary for the transforming and antiapoptotic activities of BCR-ABL. However, Ras activation is not sufficient for BCR-ABL-mediated transformation. A BCR-ABL deletion mutant (delta 176-427) that activates Ras and blocks apoptosis but has severely impaired transforming ability in 32D cells has been identified. These data suggest that BCR-ABL requires additional signaling components to elicit tumorigenic growth which are distinct from those required to block apoptosis.",PMC230804,,,,,,,,

The use of inbred mouse strains that develop leukemia has greatly facilitated the identification of genes that contribute to the neoplastic transformation of hematopoietic cells. BXH-2 mice develop myeloid leukemia as a result of the expression of an ecotropic murine leukemia virus that acts as an insertional mutagen to alter the expression of cellular proto-oncogenes. We report the isolation of a new locus, Meis1, that serves as a site of viral integration in 15% of the tumors arising in BXH-2 mice. Meis1 was mapped to a distinct location on proximal mouse chromosome 11, suggesting that it represents a novel locus. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids segregating human chromosomes allowed localization of MEIS1 to human chromosome 2p23-p12, in a region known to contain translocations found in human leukemias. Northern (RNA) blot analysis demonstrated that a Meis1 probe detected a 3.8-kb mRNA present in all BXH-2 tumors, whereas tumors containing integrations at the Meis1 locus expressed an additional truncated transcript. A Meis1 cDNA clone that encoded a novel member of the homeobox gene family was identified. The homeodomain of Meis1 is most closely related to those of the PBX/exd family of homeobox protein-encoding genes, suggesting that Meis1 functions in a similar fashion by cooperative binding to a distinct subset of HOX proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that altered expression of the homeobox gene Meis1 may be one of the events that lead to tumor formation in BXH-2 mice.",PMC230793,"['GENBANK/U33629', 'GENBANK/U33630']",,,"['Meis1', 'PBX1']",,,,

This activity is dependent upon ATP and magnesium, and is enhanced by the addition of another compound containing an energetic phosphate group, either phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or phosphocreatine (PCr). This effect appears to be specific for PEP and PCr in that other compounds with energetic phosphate bonds including fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and additional ATP are not effective. On the contrary, GTP-gamma-S, an activator of G proteins, activates PLC in the presence of ATP alone and this is not further enhanced by the addition of PEP. In addition to Fc epsilon RI and GTP-gamma-S, two other stimuli lead to enhanced activity of PLC in permeabilized RBL cell ghosts: 1) an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases (Na3VO4) and 2) an analog of adenosine (NECA). Data presented here extend previous results to show that activation of PLC by GTP-gamma-S is not enhanced either by the addition of PCr or by the addition of a more MgATP. Further new findings include the observations that activation of PLC by Na3VO4 is augmented by PEP and PCr in a fashion similar to that observed for Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation of PLC and that activation of PLC by NECA shows even more marked dependency on PEP than does activation by Fc epsilon RI or Na3VO4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

The delta isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane (delta-HCH) is structurally similar to myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and is a potent releaser of stored Ca2+ from permeabilized cells. This release of Ca2+ is not mediated by a competitive interaction with the IP3 receptor on the Ca2+ release channel on the endoplasmic reticulum. In intact cells, delta-HCH and, to a lesser extent, lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) transiently increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The return to basal concentrations is mediated by the plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps and not by resequestration of Ca2+ into intracellular stores. Treatment of cells with delta-HCH (25-100 microM), but not lindane, leads to a progressive inhibition of the antigen- and thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ signal. Caffeine, a modulator of the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channel, attenuates the rise in intracellular Ca2+ induced by delta-HCH, suggesting that ryanodine receptor-like Ca2+ channels may be present in RBL cells. At 25 microM delta-HCH, a concentration that does not inhibit the antigen-stimulated Ca2+ signal, the release of [3H]serotonin from antigen-stimulated cells is enhanced as is secretion of [3H]serotonin from cells pretreated with 25-100 microM lindane. The depletion of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by delta-HCH should evoke Ca2+ entry into the cells by a capacitative mechanism; however; divalent cation permeability across the plasma membrane (Mn2+ influx) is not increased but rather is decreased by delta-HCH. An understanding of the mechanism of action of delta-HCH in releasing stored Ca2+ and blocking Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane may provide insights into the regulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry in nonexcitable cells.",,,,,,,,,

The intracellular targets of these drugs were dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GARTF), folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), and thymidylate synthase (TS). Parameters that were investigated included the affinity of both folate-transport systems for the antifolate drugs, their growth-inhibitory potential as a function of cellular RFC/mFBP expression, and the protective effect of either FA or leucovorin against growth inhibition. Methotrexate, aminopterin, N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB3717), ZD1694, 5,8-dideazaisofolic acid (IAHQ), 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolic acid (DDATHF), and 5-deazafolic acid (efficient substrate for FPGS) were used as the basic structures in the present study, from which modifications were introduced in the pteridine/quinazoline ring, the C9-N10 bridge, the benzoyl ring, and the glutamate side chain. It was observed that RFC exhibited an efficient substrate affinity for all analogues except CB3717, 2-NH2-ZD1694, and glutamate side-chain-modified FPGS inhibitors. Substitutions at the 2-position (e.g., 2-CH3) improved the RFC substrate affinity for methotrexate and aminopterin. Other good substrates included PT523 (N alpha-(4-amino-4-deoxypteroyl)-N delta-hemiphthaloyl-L-ornithine), 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin, and DDATHF. With respect to mFBP, modifications at the N-3 and 4-oxo positions resulted in a substantial loss of binding affinity. Modifications at other sites of the molecule were well tolerated. Growth-inhibition studies identified a series of drugs that were preferentially transported via RFC (2,4-diamino structures) or mFBP (CB3717, 2-NH-ZD1694, or 5,8-dideazaisofolic acid), whereas other drugs were efficiently transported via both transport pathways (e.g., DDATHF, ZD1694, BW1843U89, or LY231514). Given the fact that for an increasing number of normal and neoplastic cells and tissue, different expression levels of RFC and mFBP are being recognized, this folate antagonist structure-activity relationship can be of value for predicting drug sensitivity and resistance of tumor cells or drug-related toxicity to normal cells and for the rational design and development of novel antifolates.",,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, some of these compounds competitively antagonize the Y1-type NPY receptor-mediated increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in human erythroleukemic (HEL) cells. The inactive NPY carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide (Thr-Arg-Gln-Arg-Tyr-NH2; IC50 > 100 microM) was modified by replacing threonine with an aromatic amino acid and glutamine with leucine. This resulted in a series of pentapeptides with dramatically improved affinity (IC50 = 0.5-4 microM) for the rat brain receptor.

When the biological potencies of vitamin D3 analogs were assessed 24 h after the addition by the induction of 24-hydroxylation activity in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60,F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 was 6 times as potent as 1,25-(OH)2D3 in a medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. When the cells were cultured in a serum-free medium, F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 was only equipotent to 1,25-(OH)2D3. Considering a previous report demonstrating a weaker binding of F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 to serum vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) than 1,25-(OH)2D3, it seems that the resultant greater free fraction of F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 might account for its greater activity in a serum-containing medium. As assessed by the suppression of cell proliferation and the induction of cell differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage pathway which requires as long as 96 h for their assessment, the potency ratio of F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 to 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased as the levels of fetal bovine serum increased. It was of great interest that F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 was still significantly more potent than 1,25-(OH)2D3 even in a serum-free medium. Together with the data indicating the equipotency of F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the induction of 24-hydroxylation activity, it was suggested that decreased metabolic inactivation might contribute in part to the higher potency of F6-1,25-(OH)2D3 in the long-term effect.",,,,,,,,,

As for the latter, bone resorption-stimulating factors produced by tumor cells, such as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), show hormone-like effects and promote a bone resorption. Many cases have been reported regarding the production of TPTHrP in adult T cell leukemia (ATL), but few have been reported with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We report here a similar case with ALL. A 12-year-old male presented with fever, petechiae and thrombocytopenia, and was diagnosed as ALL. We started the induction therapy and confirmed complete remission. Later, he relapsed 3 times without symptoms apart from hypercalcemia at the beginning. Elevation of the serum calcium level followed by a rise of lymphoblastic cells was recognized. Bone metastasis was excluded since bone mineral density and serum mid region PTH were normal and no abnormal findings were noticed on X rays and 99mTc bone scintigraphy. However, his urinary PTHrP level was high, and his lymphoblastic cells staining immunocytochemically with the monoclonal antibodies against the C-terminal region of PTHrP showed a positively brownish color. Finally, he died of pulmonary aspergillosis. Hypercalcemia was not related to serum PTH or bone metastasis. ATL viral infection reported as a cause of PTHrP production was also excluded from several experimental data. Therefore, we concluded that lymphoblastic cells directly produced PTHrP, and that this PTHrP played an important role in the induction of hypercalcemia.",,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unknown. In an attempt to understand the cellular processes relevant to this phenomenon, we examined the effects of SLF and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on induced lipid metabolism in M07e cells. We find that both GM-CSF and SLF induced increased phosphatidylcholine (PC) turnover rates (biosynthesis and degradation) as measured by increased [3H]-choline labelling, with SLF being more potent than GM-CSF after 6 h of stimulation, but equipotent at 24 h of stimulation. The labelling of aqueous intermediates of PC metabolism was also increased by cytokine stimulation, most notably phosphocholine. Simultaneous stimulation with GM-CSF plus SLF resulted in a true synergistic induction of PC, lysoPC, and phosphocholine labelling. GM-CSF and SLF each induced asymmetric labelling of various phospholipid classes as measured by incorporation of different [3H]-fatty acids. [3H]-myristic acid labelling of phosphatidylserine was most prominently induced (approximately 12-fold). Cytosolic choline kinase activity was also upregulated more than twofold over control by SLF, which might contribute to the increased phosphocholine labelling. These effects may have relevance to the intracellular mechanisms of the synergistic proliferative stimulation of SLF plus GM-CSF on M07e cells.",,,,,,,,,

We compared treatment results for children who underwent autologous BMT with those who had chemotherapy. All patients were registered between 1983-94 in the multicentre trials. We selected groups of patients by matching variables associated with treatment outcome and duration of second remission. 52 matched-pairs were studied. The probability of event-free survival at 9 years was 0.32 (SD 0.07) for patients receiving chemotherapy versus 0.26 (SD 0.07) for patients who underwent autologous BMT. For two groups--children with prognostic factors indicating high risk of relapse and those with factors indicating lower risk--the outcome from transplantation did not differ significantly from that of chemotherapy: no advantage of autologous BMT over chemotherapy as post-induction treatment for children with ALL in a second remission could be detected with regard to event-free survival. Because autologous BMT has been used as the final step of treatment it is possible that its relative ineffectiveness has been due to the lack of continuation therapy after transplant.

The main aims of EGIL are to establish guidelines for the characterization of acute leukemias based on marker expression and provide a uniform basis for the diagnosis of the various types of these hemopoietic malignancies which should be helpful for future multinational clinical and laboratory investigations. Within the two major types (B and T cell lineage) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), several groups are delineated according to the degree of cell differentiation. Within the acute myeloid leukemias (AML), only three subtypes as defined by the FAB classification: M0-AML, M6-AML and M7-AML, can be unequivocally defined by immunological markers; prospective studies are undertaken to see whether characteristic immunological profiles are associated with particular AML subtypes defined by specific cytogenetic abnormalities. Criteria for the definition of biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL) are devised and a scoring system is outlined aimed to distinguish BAL from those acute leukemias with expression of a marker from another lineage. In addition, an uncommon subset of acute leukemias with no evidence of lymphoid or myeloid differentiation is recognized and the useful panel of markers to investigate and establish the cell nature of the acute leukemias is outlined. EGIL will focus in the future on testing the reproducibility of the proposed guidelines, particularly those for BAL, assessing their clinical value within a framework of multicentric trials and setting up uniform methodological criteria.",,,['Leukemia. 2001 Oct;15(10):1673-4.

However, a major obstacle to successful implementation of this technique involves the problem of clonal evolution, in which instability of the VHDJH region leads to the generation of further rearrangements of the IgH gene over time. Such clonal evolution results in a high likelihood of false negative results when detecting MRD using clone-specific primers based on the rearrangement present at diagnosis. Since in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), clonal evolution commonly involves alterations of the VHD joining but not the DJH joining, we have devised a novel PCR strategy to circumvent the problem of false negativity in these evolved leukemias. The strategy, which involves construction of overlapping clone-specific DJH primers for use with a consensus VH segment primer, can be used to amplify both evolved and nonevolved ALL populations with high sensitivity and specificity. The method does not require radioactivity and should prove valuable for improving the effectiveness of PCR-based detection of residual leukemia.",,,,,,,,,

This in vitro 'purging' must destroy the malignant cells while preserving sufficient normal precursors to allow re-establishment of normal in vivo function. We have confirmed that cortivazol (CVZ), a glucocorticoid with an unusual structure, can kill dexamethasone (DEX)-resistant leukemic cells and have examined its ability to purge DEX-sensitive (CEM-C7) and -resistant (ICR-27) human leukemic blasts artificially mixed with normal marrow mononuclear cells in vitro. By carefully defining time and dose, we established a 'therapeutic window' that allowed 'cure' of the artificial remission marrow.

Combinations of both agents had no additional effects over those of RA alone on HL-60 cells, THP-1, and U937 cells during the first 48 h.

By many criteria, including their sensitivity to various inducers of oxidative burst, lipopolysaccharide-induced production of monokines and in the present work, lysozyme secretion and TGase expression, U937 cells exposed to combinations of RA and VD exhibit a behavior different from those of HL-60 and THP-1 cells.

Nine patients demonstrated a non-random or skewed X-chromosome inactivation pattern in PMN cells. Three of these nine patients had an apparently random pattern in MN cells (group A), whereas the remaining six patients demonstrated no difference between the inactivation patterns of PMN and MN cells (group B). The PMN cells of the other 25 patients showed a random X-chromosome inactivation pattern, and the patterns of the PMN cells did not differ from those of the MN cells (group C). The scores for myelodysplasia were high (> or = 4) in all three patients in group A, intermediate (2-3) in two patients and low (score < 2) in four patients in group B, and intermediate in five patients and low in 20 patients in group C. The duration of remission in patients with a myelodysplasia score of > or = 2 was significantly shorter than that of patients with a score of < 2 (P < 0.01). We conclude that clonal remission actually occurs with myelodysplastic features in some patients with AML (around 10%, group A). It is possible that this clonal analysis may not be sensitive enough to detect the preleukemic clone with myelodysplastic features when this clone constitutes only a minor population of remission hematopoiesis. To further elucidate the biology of such preleukemic clones it is essential to develop more sensitive molecular methods for the detection of genetic abnormalities specific to preleukemic hematopoiesis.",,,,,,,,,

Changes of the immunophenotype, especially of the expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) have been documented less frequently. Multiple tumor samples of two patients with follicular lymphoma who developed tumor progression, were studied by Southern blot analysis for rearrangements of the Ig genes and the oncogenes BCL2 and MYC. In both patients, the general pattern of Ig gene rearrangements, especially of the Ig light-chain genes, and the structure of the t(14;18) breakpoint as assessed by the polymerase chain reaction (PRC) and fine restriction mapping, remained unaltered with time. However, both within the functional Ig heavy-chain allele and around the t(14;18) breakpoint, extensive secondary alterations took place. This indicates clonal evolution rather than the appearance of an independent lymphoma. In the first case with progression from follicular lymphoma to Burkitt's lymphoma 3 years after diagnosis, alterations were especially present 3' of the t(14;18) breakpoint. In the second patient with a change from follicular to diffuse centroblastic lymphoma 4 years after diagnosis, subsequent class switches from IgM to IgG and to defective IgH expression were accompanied by deletion of C mu sequences and a rearrangement of the MYC gene, respectively. Additionally, in both patients alterations in individual restriction sites occurred, which most likely were due to somatic mutations within both the functional IgH and translocated allele. Our data indicate that complex alterations of both the functional and non-functional IgH allele may accompany tumor progression and may erroneously suggest the appearance of independent clones by Southern blot analysis. It remains to be established whether these alterations are causative events or the consequence of genetic instability and clonal evolution.",,,,,,,,,

Normal B and T lymphocytes from 11 blood donors were separated by magnetic beads and tested with this assay. The GST pi was the most abundant transferase, and was detected in all B and T cell samples. GST mu was undetectable ('null' phenotype) in 6/11 normal donors, either in B or T cells. GST alpha was very stable from donor to donor, and was highly correlated between B and T cells of the same individual (P < 0.0001). There is no correlation between the three isoenzymes, and between each isoenzyme and mdr1 gene expression. Twenty-three B lymphoproliferative disorders (20 B-CLL, 3 CD5- chronic lymphoproliferative syndromes) were tested with the same technique. An average decrease of 57% of the GST pi expression was noted in the mononuclear cells of these patients (P < 0.02), with no differences between the untreated and treated cases. The GST alpha and mdr1 mRNA levels did not differ from normal B lymphocytes, but the proportion of patients with no detectable expression of GST mu is lower than in the control (13%). Interestingly, the low content of GST pi in B-CLL could explain the frequent sensitivity of this disease to alkylating agents.",,,,,,,,,

Differences in the method of determining CD7 positivity, the antibody used, the therapy administered, and the CD7 level used as a cutoff point to reduce it to a binary variable have all been postulated to account for the discordant findings. We determined the level of CD7 expression by flow cytometric analysis using the Leu9 monoclonal antibody in 331 patients with newly diagnosed AML and attempted to determine the impact of CD7 on AML prognosis. This study used the same methodology and antibody as three of the four studies that reported a positive association between CD7 expression and prognosis in AML. Optimal cutpoint analysis was used to divide the population into CD7-positive (CD7+) (>10.5% expression) and CD7-negative (CD7-) (< 10.5% expression) groups with the largest survival difference. At the optimal cutpoint, the difference in survival was not statistically significantly different (P = 0.068 uncorrected, P = 0.244 corrected for optimal cutpoint search). There was a marked imbalance in the distribution of favorable cytogenetic abnormalities [t(8;21), inversion 16, t(15;17)], with 95% segregating to the CD7- group. Analysis excluding patients with favorable cytogenetic abnormalities revealed no prognostic importance for CD7 expression (P = 0.24 uncorrected). The response rate (CR) and survival experiences of CD7+ and CD7- patients were similar with six different regimens. CD7 expression was not a significant independent prognostic factor in a Cox regression model that included cytogenetics as a predictive variable, but it was marginally significant when cytogenetics was excluded. We conclude that regardless of the antibody used, the therapy received, or the cutoff point selected to determine CD7 expression, CD7 is not associated with response rate, prognosis, or survival in AML. The 'optimal cutoff point analysis' utilized in this study has applicability to other biologic parameters as well.",,,,,,,,,

Twenty-two patients remained in continuous complete remission (median follow-up 61 months), and 28 experienced relapse (median follow-up 75 months). Initial regression of MRD on therapy correlated with outcome. At the end of induction therapy 2/18 (11.1%) patients from the CCR group were PCR positive vs 10/16 (62.5%) from the 'relapse' group (P = 0.005). The presence of PCR detectable MRD predicted event-free survival independent of standard clinical and cytogenetical parameters. Also subsequent to first BM relapse, a correlation between MRD regression and outcome was observed. Six of eight patients who became PCR negative in the time period between relapse and bone marrow transplantation are in CCR, whereas 7/7 patients who remained PCR positive in this time period died (P = 0.006). In approximately 70% of evaluable patients, clinical relapse was preceded by recurrence of detectable MRD at time intervals of 3-18 months earlier and the recurrence of PCR positivity after a period of negativity was always followed by overt relapse. At relapse, the combined use of IgH and TCR delta probes reduced false negativity caused by clonal evolution to approximately 10%.

P-gp expression was measured by flow cytometry using MRK16 monoclonal antibody. P-gp function was measured by rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) efflux kinetics. When TF-1 cells were cultured with 5637-CM (50% v/v), both P-gp expression and P-gp efflux capacity were increased in a time-dependent manner with a 4-fold increase in P-gp expression level at day 6 whereas TF-1 cell differentiation status remained unchanged as assessed by morphological studies, phenotypical and cytochemistry analysis. Recombinant cytokines including GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-1 beta, IL-6, stem cell factor, LIF, erythropoietin, and IL-3 had no effect on P-gp expression whereas TNF alpha induced dose- and time-dependent P-gp and mdr-1 gene overexpression. However, TNF alpha-induced P-gp overexpression had no influence on P-gp efflux capacity. Furthermore, when TF-1 cells were exposed to IL-3 for periods longer than 1 month, we found that P-gp efflux capacity was increased as compared to cells cultured with GM-CSF whereas P-gp expression was unchanged. Both TNF alpha and IL-3 did not induce TF-1 differentiation. Collectively, these results suggest that cytokines may influence both expression and function of P-gp in TF-1 cells without interfering with their differentiation status. In contrast to cytokines, phorbol esters enhanced expression and efflux capacity of P-gp in parallel with TF-1 cell monocytic differentiation. Finally, our study suggests that paracrine and/or autocrine secretion of cytokines may interfere with P-gp activity in some acute myeloid leukemia cells.",,,,,,,,,

Previous analysis of the TCR genes strongly suggested the clonal origin of human T-ALL. We present a sensitive clonal analysis of bone marrow TCR V beta transcripts in a case of T-ALL. This study allows the analysis not only of TCR V beta transcripts in tumor cells but also the temporal modification of the global TCR repertoire in the follow-up of clinical specimens from bone marrow aspirates. Moreover, we used clone-specific junctional region oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the clonal leukemic population for the molecular monitoring of the malignant clone throughout the clinical course of the disease. This molecular fingerprint appears to be a sensitive method to detect minimal residual disease. It shows that junctional regions of rearranged TCR beta genes corresponding to the tumor cells can also be detected at the time of the complete remission.",,,,,,,,,

A 4977-bp deletion (mtDNA-4977, also known as the common deletion) is the most frequent abnormality in patients with mitochondrial myopathies. A low percentage of mtDNA-4977 is also found in various tissues of normal ageing individuals. Accumulation of this deletion as well as other mtDNA deletions and point mutations is thought to contribute to normal cell ageing. We examined blood and bone marrow samples of 63 hematologically normal patients undergoing sternotomy for cardiac surgery. Using short-cycle PCR, which favors the amplification of molecules carrying large deletions, we detected the common deletion in 22 (35%) of the patients. In one of the probands, a hitherto unknown 4867-bp deletion was identified (nt 8561-13429). In each sample the percentage of mtDNA-4977 was very low, since detection always required primer-shift reamplification of a primary PCR product. Because mtDNA molecules with large deletions are known to be progressively enriched through their tendency to replicate more rapidly than full-size mtDNA, the small amount of mtDNA-4977 detected is likely to be concentrated in a small fraction of cells. The common deletion was not detectable in 20 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 20 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 10 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The seeming paradox of detectability of mtDNA-4977 in hematologically normal individuals and its absence in clonal myeloid disorders is explained by varying selection against self-renewing stem cells harboring the common deletion. Selection appears to be effective under circumstances of proliferative stress (eg among continuously proliferating stem cells in clonal hematopoiesis), whereas in normal steady-state hematopoiesis, affected stem cells persist because they are rarely recruited into cell cycle and can thus tolerate mitochondrial dysfunction.",,,,,,,,,

We postulated that the additional abnormalities of chromosome 8, where the c-myc oncogene is mapped to 8q24, may play a role in the development of overt leukemia. DNA analysis using the CD1A c-myc probe did not reveal rearrangements of the c-myc gene by Southern blotting. We have used a monoclonal antibody for the c-myc protein to investigate the level of expression in 11 patients with T-PLL and two with Sezary cell leukemia and compared it with levels seen in normal lymphocytes. Significantly higher levels were observed in patients compared with controls (P < 0.0001). The highest levels of c-myc were seen in eight cases with trisomy for 8q resulting from an i(8q). One patient was investigated before and after treatment. In the active state, c-myc showed a level of 64.36 units (range 20-200). After treatment a residual population of malignant cells showed a c-myc level of 155 (range 90-280). This study suggests that the increased expression of c-myc as a result of trisomy for 8q may have a role in the pathogenesis of de novo T-PLL and T cell leukemia supervening AT and that there may be a correlation between c-myc levels and resistance to therapy.",,,,,,,,,

At the beginning of relapse, which occurred after 7 months of complete remission, a normal karyotype was observed. At the terminal stage, leukemic cells with Ph1 and BCR-ABL mRNA for the P190 variety were observed. The second patient was a 12-year-old boy with immature T cell type ALL-L1. The metaphase cells showed a 9p- chromosome at diagnosis and Ph1 appeared in addition to 9p- at relapse. Hybrid mRNA for the P210 variety was detected only when Ph1 had developed. The blast cells with Ph1 were derived from the original leukemic clone through clonal evolution, since the same clonal rearrangements of IGH or TCRB were detected in leukemic cells obtained both at diagnosis and relapse in both patients. Thus, in both cases, Ph1 was detected only in the course of ALL along with expression of BCR-ABL mRNA.

Concomitant use of other genotoxic drugs, such as alkylating agents and cisplatin, can increase the hazard further. We have treated 154 consecutive higher-risk cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in our recent Total Therapy Study XIII with an intensive post-remission regimen of chemotherapy that included etoposide given every other week or less often-a schedule associated with a relatively low cumulative incidence of secondary AML in our Study XI. Unexpectedly, four patients have developed secondary AML at 12 to 23 months from the start of treatment (median, 16 months). The 2-year cumulative risk estimate significantly exceeds that for 185 historical controls in Study XI whose continuation regimen included epipodophyllotoxins every other week: 5.4% (95% confidence interval, 0-11%) compared with 1.1% (0-2.6%), P = 0.046. Compared to patients treated in Study XI, those enrolled in Study XIII receive fewer scheduled doses of epipodophyllotoxin (48 (all etoposide) vs 63 (30 etoposide, 33 teniposide)) but 16 to 19 additional doses of L-asparaginase and eight additional doses of high-dose methotrexate, all within the week preceding etoposide treatment. We attribute the apparently increased rate of secondary AML in Study XIII to the use of L-asparaginase immediately before etoposide administration. On this schedule, the enzyme could increase systemic exposure to etoposide or its catechol metabolites and reduce the ability of cells to repair DNA damage.",,,,,,,,,

In the present study, time-courses of 2-CdA loss from CLL cells were biexponential: the mean half-life of the initial phase was 0.30 +/- 0.18 h; the presence of 0.5 microM nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR, a classical inhibitor of nucleoside transport) in the suspending medium, significantly decreased the initial rate of 2-CdA efflux (mean half-life, 0.43 +/- 0.22 h). As a consequence, AUCs (areas under time-course plots) were significantly higher in the NBMPR-treated cells (4.56 +/- 2.01 pmol.h/10(6) cells, n = 19) than in untreated control cells (3.83 +/- 1.74 pmol.h/10(6) cells; n = 19). 2-CdA was the principal efflux product released into the medium from 2-CdA-loaded CLL cells.

To test this hypothesis cDNA encoding bcl-2 was transfected into cells of the continuous lines OCI/AML-2 and OCI/AML-5. Four transfectant lines were isolated; three contained transfected bcl-2 in the sense orientation (AML5-BCL2sa, AML5-BCL2sb and 2-bcl2) and one with anti-sense bcl-2(AML5-bcl2as). The presence of the transfected gene was demonstrated by Northern blot; translation of the sense transfected genes into protein was demonstrated by Western blotting. Lines with sense-oriented transfected bcl-2 were significantly less sensitive to Ara-C or H2O2 than the parental lines; the cells with anti-sense transfected genes were more sensitive than their parent but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The effect of ATRA on bcl-2 expression was compared in sense-transfected cells and their parents; by Northern blotting it was shown that the endogenous but not the transfected genes were down-regulated after ATRA exposure. The capacity of cells with transfected genes to respond to ATRA was tested by obtaining Ara-C survival curves for ATRA-treated cells. Compared to controls not exposed to ATRA, the transfected cells showed little or statistically insignificant changes in Ara-C sensitivity after ATRA treatment. We conclude that data from the transfectants provides evidence that expression of bcl-2 is a determinant of sensitivity to Ara-C and H2O2; and that the effect of ATRA on sensitivity requires the presence of bcl-2 genes in association with regulatory elements.",,,,,,,,,

The in vitro cytotoxicity of the Topo II inhibitors DNA and teniposide (VM26) was measured using the MTT assay, and the cell cycle distribution of leukemic samples was analyzed by DNA flow cytometry. Results showed that (1) relapsed ALL samples were more resistant to DNR, but not to VM26 compared to untreated samples; (2) large interpatient variations existed in both Topo II alpha gene expression and in vitro cytotoxicity results; (3) Topo II alpha gene expression was detectable in 29/33 childhood ALL samples with a median expression of 5% the level of a relatively chemosensitive human small cell lung cancer cell line; (4) Topo II alpha gene expression did not differ between untreated and relapsed ALL; (5) Topo II alpha gene expression was positively correlated with the percentage of ALL cells in S- and G2M-phase, but not with the in vitro cytotoxicity of the drugs tested.

However, these differences were not significant, and we conclude that the identification of the transcript type by current methodology does not predict for response to alpha-IFN and for prognosis. Further studies may be required to confirm that conclusion, or to detect a true smaller difference.",,,,,,,,,

The biological characteristics considered, median WBC count, FAB classification, immunophenotype at onset of disease, were no different from those of our adult ALL series. Overall complete remission (CR) rate of these patients was 59%, 18% had resistant disease and 23% died during induction. Overall median survival was 9 months and overall median duration of CR was 7 months. All patients were divided according to treatment into two groups: group A (13 patients) received an intensive treatment including vincristine (VCR), prednisone (PDN), daunorubicin (DNR) and L-asparaginase (L-Asp), while in group B (36 patients) were included patients who received mild conventional induction with VCR and PDN. In group A, 77% of patients achieved CR and 23% died during induction. All patients were hospitalized during induction treatment. During follow-up, among 10 CRs, five (50%) died in CR because of hemorrhage (two), infections (two) and myocardial infarction (one); five (50%) relapsed. Median survival was 4 months and median duration of CR was 3.5 months. In group B, 53% of patients obtained CR, 25% had resistant disease and 22% died during induction. During induction, 44% of patients were hospitalized. During follow-up, among 19 CRs, 14 (74%) relapsed and three (15%) died in CR because of infection (two) and cardiorespiratory failure (one). Three patients (15%) are still alive: two in first CR and one in second CR. No statistical differences between the two groups in terms of CR rate or survival were noted. Standardized therapeutic trials are needed better to evaluate results in these patients, considering also the introduction of new therapeutic agents or supportive treatments, such as growth factors.",,,,,,,,,

We designed a phase I dose escalation study of Tmx (200-700 mg/day p.o. for 7 days) in combination with a fixed dose of DNR (50 mg/m2 intravenously on days 5, 6 and 7) in patients with advanced leukemia to determine whether this combination could be given safely and whether plasma levels of 10 microM, the effective in vitro MDR modulator concentration, could be achieved. Pharmacologic studies of Tmx, NDMTmx and DNR, and its main metabolite daunorubicin-ol (DNR-ol) were performed as was determination of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an external epitope of the molecule. A total of 14 patients (median age 50, range 22-67) were treated at the following dose levels: 200 mg/day: three patients; 400 mg/day: four patients; 550 mg/day: three patients; and 700 mg/day: four patients. Two patients with relapsed AML achieved remission. Toxicity of the combination was similar to that seen with DNR alone and no severe hepatic, cardiac or retinal toxicity was noted. Plasma Tmx levels approached 7 microM at the two highest dose levels studied; plasma levels of NDMTmx were slightly less. The area under the curve for DNR and its main metabolite daunorubicin-ol (DNR-ol) did not show significant changes with escalation of Tmx dose. This phase I study suggests that concentrations of Tmx high enough to reverse the MDR phenotype can be approached and that the combination of high-dose Tmx with a standard dose of DNR has an acceptable toxicity profile. More evaluation in phase II studies is necessary to define further its role as an MDR modulator.",,,,,,,,,

This syndrome is distinct from the previously described translocation t(8;16)(p11;p13) associated with acute monoblastic leukaemia. We have summarized the clinical and cytogenetic features of 13 case reports which describe a myeloproliferative syndrome with eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy and a high incidence of T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with progression to acute myeloid leukaemia. The translocations involving 8p11 were: either t(8;13)(p11-12;q11-12), t(8;9) (p11;q32-34) or t(6;8)(q27;p12). In two cases of t(8;13) molecular studies have mapped the chromosome 13 breakpoint to a 1.5 Mbp region, but a full molecular characterization of these translocations is required. In view of the striking clinicopathological and karyotypic similarities between these cases we propose that they be considered a single nosological entity and termed '8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome'.",,,['Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10(7):1252-3.

The primary difference appears not to be the absolute level of overall activity, but rather the relative proportions of the different forms of activity detected. Thus, despite similar levels of total aminopeptidase-N-like activity detected in cells from different leukemic groups, true aminopeptidase-N/CD13 activity was only detected in cells derived from AML patients. Even in these patients, however, most of the detected aminopeptidase-N-like activity ( > 80%) could not be attributed to aminopeptidase-N/CD13. In marked contrast, plasma from leukemic patients also contained substantial total aminopeptidase-N-like activity, of which (irrespective of leukemic group) most could be attributed to aminopeptidase-N/CD13. Whilst slightly higher levels of total activity were obtained in plasma from AML patients compared to ALL patients, there was no difference in the relative proportion attributable to aminopeptidase-N/CD13 (approximately 80% of total aminopeptidase-N-like activity). Evaluation of total aminopeptidase-N-like activity present in whole blood gave differential patterns, and whilst only a proportion (20-40% of total aminopeptidase-N-like activity) could be attributed to true aminopeptidase-N/CD13, blood from patients with CD13+ AML showed the greatest activity so attributable. In total, our results outline the complexities of peptidase activities present within blood of leukemic individuals, and may, in part, explain the variability of previous studies attempting to associate prognostic features with phenotypic expression of CD13.",,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment of cells with aphidicolin (2 microM) augments ara-C-induced apoptosis, since it was first observed at 0.4 microM ara-C and became more intense at 2 and 10 microM. Although aphidicolin itself had a marginal effect on c-jun expression, it significantly augmented ara-C induced c-jun upregulation by shortening the lag time and lowering ara-C concentrations necessary for the induction of detectable c-jun transcripts. Aphidicolin and ara-C acted synergistically to increase NF-kappa B DNA binding activity as determined by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Expression of c-myc was slightly increased through the DNA degradative phase, and was then downregulated. Thus, the activation of NF-kappa B and c-jun expression seems to be well correlated with the potentiation by aphidicolin of ara-C-induced apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,

The SP+ expresses a full complimentation of HTLV-I-specific viral proteins, and contains replication competent viral particles. Restriction enzyme digestion followed by Southern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of a single integrated proviral copy and limiting dilution analysis confirmed the clonality of the cell line. Interestingly, phenotypically, the SP+ cell line is CD2+, CD3+ and coexpresses CD4 and CD8, yet lacks TCR alpha beta and TCR tau delta expression. Further ontogenetic characterization of the SP+ cell line demonstrated the lack of thymic T-cell precursor markers, including absence of cell surface expression of CD1, intracellular thymic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) enzyme, as well as message expression for V(D)J recombinase activating gene-1 (RAG-1). Furthermore, the SP+ cell did express the message for the CD3 delta chain. Taken together, these data suggest that the SP+ cell line resulted from HTLV-I infection of a mature CD4+/CDB+ lymphocyte.

Distributions of clinical progression and overall survival were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Associations of these endpoints with treatment and other patient characteristics were analyzed using the proportional hazards regression method of Cox. Both regimes were well tolerated. Patients in the busulfan plus vitamin A arm had somewhat longer durations of clinical progression-free survival (median 46 months) and overall survival (51 months) compared to those in the busulfan arm (medians 38 and 44 months). However, the differences were not statistically significant (one-tailed P = 0.11 for clinical progression-free survival, 0.081 for survival). After adjustment for significant factors identified in an additional exploratory multivariate analysis, risk of clinical progression or death was 53% (P = 0.022) greater and risk of death 60% (P = 0.014) greater among busulfan patients.

In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 results in the formation of the unique BCR/ABL fusion gene which is believed to play a crucial role in the establishment of CML. In order to decrease the BCR/ABL gene product we designed short synthetic ribozymes and analyzed their effects on the proliferation rate of K562 cells.

The discovery that chemotherapy induced the mobilization of CD34+ cells into the peripheral blood (PB) (14) gave rise to the successful autologous transplantation of PBSC (1, 13). Also cord blood (CB) was found to contain considerable numbers of ""stem cells"", and to date at least 42 allogeneic transplantations have been performed with this cell source (22, J. Wagner, personal communication). Further investigations led to the successful autologous transplantation of positively selected CD34+ cells from BM and PB (18), and the latest results indicate that it is promising to transplant purified CD34+ cells obtained from cytokine-stimulated donors (4, 10, 15-16). Despite such achievements it remains unclear how many ""stem cells"" are required per kg of the recipient and how they are phenotypically characterized. In this communication we give examples of typical differences observed by flow cytometry and clonogenic assay between the CD34+ cells contained in the different cell sources. They may explain why it is not sufficient only to analyze the CD34+ cell populations which may represent progenitors of different lineages as well as of various states of differentiation. CB CD34+ cells are early myeloid progenitor cells with the highest incidence of CFU-mix among the three cell sources. They have a high proliferative potential in vitro. They hardly coexpress B cell antigens and they are partially negative for CD38.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,Phanotypische Unterschiede zwischen CD34 positiven Zellen in verschiedenen Transplantations-Materialien.,,,,,

An additional retrospective inquiry to all treating clinicians and principal investigators of clinical trials as well as a link to a previously existing pool of secondary malignancies (1) lead to a completion of the data. At the registry now 329 patients with second malignant neoplasms have been observed. 41.3% of them had been developed the first malignancy before the registry started its work in 1980. The most common primary malignancies are acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, 28.6%), brain tumours (12.2%), and retinoblastomas (8.8%). Compared to the population of the registry retinoblastomas as a secondary malignancy occur in excess (2.5% vs 8.8%). Most common secondary malignancies are brain tumours (20.1%), acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (13.1%), osteosarcomas (10.9%), and thyroid carcinomas (6.1%). Hereby especially for thyroid cancer a remarkable deviation from the frequency in the total population of the registry (0.2%) is observed. In 3% of the patients a secondary malignancy appears within a span of 10 years after the primary malignancy. This is a twentyfold increase compared with the cumulative rate of developing a malignancy in the first 10 years of life. Brain tumours after ALL (8.5%) and after other brain tumours (5.8%) and osteosarcomas after retinoblastomas (4.9%) are the most often reported combinations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,Zweitmalignome nach malignen Erkrankungen im Kindesalter.,,,,,

However, she had a third relapse in September, 1994. She was treated with a trial of G-CSF (300 micrograms/body, day 1-7), to stimulate dormant leukemic cells to enter the cell cycle, and cyclosporin-A (78 mg/kg, day 2-5), in order to overcome daunomycin resistance in refractory leukemia, combined with daunomycin (45 mg/m2, day 3-5) and ara-C (1.4 g/m2, day 3-7), after obtaining informed consent. The fourth remission needed 46 days after combination chemotherapy because of severe myelosuppression. It was suggested that intermittent-dose ara-C/daunomycin therapy combined with G-CSF and cyclosporin-A may be useful for relapsed and refractory leukemia.",,,,,,,,,

Data from animal models are frequently used in the risk assessment for benzene. In rodent studies, mice have been shown to be more sensitive to benzene-induced hematotoxicity than rats. In this regard, we have observed that bone marrow stromal cells from mice were significantly more susceptible to the cytotoxicity induced by the benzene metabolites hydroquinone (HQ) and benzoquinone (BQ) than cells from rats. Since cellular glutathione (GSH) and quinone reductase (QR) are known to play critical roles in modulating HQ-induced cytotoxicity, we have measured the GSH content and the QR and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in stromal cells from both species. In rat cells, the GSH content and the QR specific activity were 2 and 28 times as much as those from mice, respectively. GSH and QR in both mouse and rat stromal cells were inducible by 1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T). D3T pretreatment of both mouse and rat stromal cells resulted in a marked protection against HQ-induced toxicity. Pretreatment of both mouse and rat stromal cells with GSH ethyl ester also provided a dramatic protection against HQ-induced toxicity. Conversely, dicoumarol, an inhibitor of QR, enhanced the HQ-induced toxicity in stromal cells from both mice and rats, indicating an important role for QR in modulating HQ-induced stromal toxicity in both species. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which depleted GSH significantly in both species, potentiated the HQ-induced toxicity in mouse but not in rat stromal cells. Surprisingly, incubation of stromal cells with BSO resulted in a significant induction of QR, especially in rats. The failure of BSO to potentiate HQ-induced toxicity in rat stromal cells may be due to the concomitant induction of QR by BSO. Overall, this study demonstrates that the differences in stromal cellular GSH content and QR activity between mice and rats contribute to their respective susceptibility to HQ-induced cytotoxicity in vitro, and may be involved in the greater in vivo sensitivity of mice to benzene-induced hematotoxicity.",,,,,,,,,

Also, some, but not all, studies have indicated that the incidence of certain solid tumors increases following treatment for Hodgkin's disease. PURPOSE: We studied the association between treatment for Hodgkin's disease and the incidence of second cancers. METHODS: We conducted a study within a cohort that included 10,472 patients from 14 cancer centers in the United States and Canada who were first diagnosed as having Hodgkin's disease at some point from 1940 through 1987. Discounting the 1st year after diagnosis, the average length of follow-up was 7.1 years per subject. RESULTS: We observed 122 leukemias and 438 solid tumors. The relative risk (RR) of leukemia following chemotherapy, compared with no chemotherapy, was 14 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.6-35). Increased risks of leukemia were observed after treatment with chlorambucil (RR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.1-3.6), procarbazine (RR = 4.9; 95% CI = 2.6-9.1), vinblastine (RR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.1-2.8), and a group of rarely used drugs that included methotrexate, vindesine, etoposide, and 22 others (RR = 3.8; 95% CI = 1.9-7.4). RRs were also estimated for various combinations of drugs, including MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) (RR = 5.9; 95% CI = 2.9-12) and ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) (RR = 1.5; 95% CI = 0.7-3.4). The RR of leukemia associated with splenectomy was 1.6 (95% CI = 1.0-2.5). The RR of solid tumors following chemotherapy was 1.4 (95% CI = 1.1-1.8). For the group of rarely used drugs, the RR of solid tumors was 3.1 (95% CI = 1.7-5.8). Chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of cancers of the bones, joints, articular cartilage, and soft tissues (RR = 6.0; 95% CI = 1.7-20), and cancers of the female genital system (RR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.1-3.2). In patients followed for 10 or more years after radiotherapy, increased risks were found for cancers of the respiratory system and intrathoracic organs (RR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.1-6.8) and for cancers of the female genital system (RR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.1-5.4). CONCLUSIONS: Procarbazine, chlorambucil, and vinblastine are associated with increased leukemia risk. Combination drug regimens have leukemogenic effects estimated as the product of RRs for individual drugs. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy increase the risk of selected solid tumors, and the effect of chemotherapy on solid tumor risk is weaker than the leukemogenic effect. IMPLICATIONS: Without doubt, the benefits of treatment of Hodgkin's disease outweigh the risk of a subsequent malignancy, but data on the carcinogenic effects of radiation and drugs beyond 10 years after treatment continue to be sparse, and future analyses should be directed at long-term survivors.",,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 May 17;87(10):705-6.

The anomeric configuration and the site of glycosylation were established by 1H-NMR and proton-proton nuclear Overhauser effect difference spectroscopy. The structure of compound 23 beta was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Thiophenfurin was found to be cytotoxic in vitro toward murine lymphocytic leukemia P388 and L1210, human myelogenous leukemia K562, human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60, human colon adenocarcinoma LoVo, and B16 melanoma at concentrations similar to that of tiazofurin. In the same test furanfurin proved to be inactive. Thiophenfurin was found active in vivo in BD2F1 mice inoculated with L1210 cells with a % T/C of 168 at 25 mg/kg. K562 cells incubation with thiophenfurin resulted in inhibition of inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (63%) and an increase in IMP pools (6-fold) with a concurrent decrease in GTP levels (42%). Incubation of adenosine-labeled K562 cells with tiazofurin, thiophenfurin, and furanfurin resulted in a 2-fold higher NAD analogue formulation by thiophenfurin than by tiazofurin. Furanfurin was converted to the NAD analogue with only 10% efficiency.

Both analogues were evaluated in vitro as inhibitors of DHFRs from (recombinant) human, human CCRF-CEM cells, and Lactobacillus casei. Compound 3 showed moderate activity (IC50 10(-6)-10(-7) M). Compound 4 was essentially inactive (IC50 10(-5) M, CCRF-CEM). The compounds were also evaluated against TS from (recombinant) human and L. casei and were of low activity (IC50 10(-5) M).

Compound 3 inhibited the growth of tumor cells in culture (IC50 10(-7) M) while 4 showed a low level of growth inhibitory activity.

Analogue 3 was a good substrate for human folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) derived from CCRF-CEM cells (Km 8.5 microM). Further evaluation of the growth inhibitory activity of 3 against the MTX-resistant subline of CCRF-CEM cells (R30dm) with decreased FPGS indicated that poly-gamma-glutamylation was important for its action.

More lipophilic silaplatin analogues were prepared--Pt(II) complex 2c and Pt(IV) complex 2d have one additional methylene carbon compared to 2a,b, whereas Pt(II) complex 2e and Pt(IV) complex 2f have two additional methylene carbons.

All five species of crude saponins studied here, i.e. tea-leaf saponins, tea-seed saponins, ginsenosides, soyasaponins and saikosaponins, stimulated the generation of O2- from RA-differentiated HL-60 cells. Tea-leaf saponins showed the highest stimulating activity, followed by soyasaponins and ginsenosides. The cytotoxic activity of saponins was determined by the dye exclusion method after the incubation of RA-differentiated HL-60 cells with various concentrations of saponins. Saikosaponins and tea-seed saponins exhibited considerable cytotoxic activity and hemolytic activity. To examine the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in the neutrophil activation by saponins, the effect of H-7, an antagonist of PKC, on the generation of O2- induced by saponins was investigated. H-7 was found to inhibit the generation of O2- in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting the participation of PKC in the neutrophil stimulating process by saponins.

A pilot clinical study indicates that dacarbazine can induce a marked decrease of leukemic blasts in patients affected by acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with low pretreatment levels of OGAT activity. In this study we show a synergistic antitumor effect between cisplatin (CDDP) and temozolomide (an in vitro active analog of dacarbazine), following combined in vitro treatment of leukemic blasts. Synergistic effect appears to be CDDP-dose dependent. In vivo treatment of leukemic patients with CDDP was followed by a reduction of OGAT activity in 2 out 3 cases.

The conditioned medium from dengue virus infected monocytes suppressed significantly growth of CEM, HL60, K562, and U937 cells. In the presence of 10% conditioned medium (v/v) from dengue virus infected monocytes, DNA synthesis of U937 cells, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, decreased by 99% in contrast to their synthesis in conditioned medium from noninfected control monocytes, which did not have any suppressive effect. Partial characterization of CF showed that it is a proteinase-K-sensitive and heat-labile protein with a molecular mass over 100 kDa. Employing a flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle, it was found that U937 cells, treated either with conditioned medium from dengue virus infected monocytes or with CF, but not treated with conditioned medium from noninfected monocytes, showed cell-cycle arrest in G1 phase by 48 hr. This suppressive effect of CF on U937 growth was dose- and time-dependent.

Five CD44 mAbs (5F12, BRIC235, 3F12, BU-75, and HP2/9) of 21 studied were identified that at least partially blocked FITC-labeled HA (HA-FITC) binding to the standard form of CD44 (CD44S) in CD44-transfected Jurkat cells. Analysis of reactivity of HA-blocking CD44 mAbs defined three distinct epitopes. Lack of reactivity of mAb 5F12 with a CD44 fusion protein (CD44-Rg) containing an N-terminal truncation of 20 amino acids (aa), as well as reactivity of mAb 5F12 with an N-terminal CD44 synthetic peptide (CD44-9A), demonstrated that the N-terminal proximal region of CD44 (aa 1 to 20) was involved in mAb 5F12 binding. A mutant cell line, CEM-NKR, derived from the T-ALL cell line, CEM, did not bind mAb 5F12 nor bind HA, whereas wild-type CEM did bind mAb 5F12 and HA. Sequence analysis of wild-type CEM and CEM-NKR CD44 cDNA demonstrated a G to A point mutation at position 575 in the CD44 cDNA of CEM-NKR, resulting in an arginine to histidine mutation at aa position 154. Taken together, our studies demonstrated that there are three epitopes to which HA-blocking mAbs bind in the extracellular domain of CD44, and that the CD44 N-terminal proximal and central regions are two regions in the extracellular domain of CD44 that may interact and either mediate or regulate HA binding to cell surface CD44.",,,,,,,,,

Analysis of RNA expression revealed that the loss of surface expression of CD2 was due to a lack of expression of CD2 mRNA and was associated with a lack of expression of VDJ TCR-beta transcripts in 12 of these mutants, sparing the expression of DJ TCR-beta, TCR-alpha, CD3 gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta RNA. The expression of other differentiation molecules was unaffected, except for CD1, CD4, and CD5, which were either decreased or absent in most of these mutants. A gain in the expression of TCR-gamma transcripts was observed in each of these mutants, while, as expected, no TCR-gamma transcripts were detected in wild-type J32 cells. Several mutants were able to use the human CD2 enhancer and the murine TCR-beta enhancer and promoter to activate transcription from reporter genes in the context of heterologous promoters, indicating that the mutation(s) does not affect transcription pathways. Consistent with this finding is the adequate expression in these mutants of several lineage-specific transcription factors. The expression of CD2 in several of these mutants was rescued by gene transfer using a genomic 28.5-kb CD2 fragment, suggesting that the enhancer function of this gene may be dependent on the enhancer site. These observations suggest that the coordinate expressions of CD2 and TCR-beta genes share common regulatory mechanisms involving factors regulating chromatin structure and accessibility.",,,,,,,,,

Monocytes and synoviocytes are major producers of cytokines, growth factors, and enzymes that contribute to the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) process. Since they are in close contact in vivo, we engaged in an in vitro study of the functional consequences of their interactions. Coculture of unstimulated elutriated normal blood monocytes over RA synoviocytes resulted in a synergistic increase of the production of IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and IL-8, when compared with their respective production in culture alone. In contrast, cytokines such as IL-10, IL-1 beta, IL-1 alpha, and TNF-alpha could not be detected. The IL-6 production in coculture was further increased by the addition of IL-1 beta, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, or TNF-alpha, but was inhibited by the addition of IL-10, IL-4, IL-13, or IL-1Ra, an effect reverted by the addition of IL-1 beta. Moreover, an inhibition was also observed with anti-CD14 mAb and newly raised mAbs directed against RA synoviocytes. Under reducing conditions, the mAb SY12 precipitated a 150-kDa surface membrane protein, identified as amino-peptidase N (CD13/AP-N). Collectively, these results indicate that 1) monocytes and synoviocytes interact with each other to produce proinflammatory cytokines, 2) pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines have opposite effects on IL-6 production, and 3) molecules such as IL-1, CD14, and CD13 are involved.",,,,,,,,,

One of these is a symmetric bivalent ligand, N,N'-bis[[epsilon-[(2,4-dinitrophenyl)amino]caproyl]-L-tyrosyl]-L- cystine ((DCT)2-cys), which binds specifically to the combining sites of a mAb anti-DNP IgE and efficiently cross-links cell surface IgE, but does not trigger significant degranulation or increases in intracellular Ca2+. Several lines of evidence, including lateral mobility measurements, indicate that this ligand preferentially forms stable cyclic complexes containing two (DCT)2-cys and two IgE. The second ligand is a mAb anti-IgE, B1E3, which causes lateral mobility changes consistent with dimerized IgE-Fc epsilon RI and also does not trigger increases in intracellular Ca2+ or degranulation. The two ligands together trigger robust responses. In the presence of B1E3, (DCT)2-cys causes immobilization of IgE-Fc epsilon RI in a broad concentration range; in a more narrow concentration range, it is a potent stimulant of changes in both degranulation and Ca2+. We have compared the dose-response curves for cellular activation to simulated IgE aggregation curves, i.e., curves that predict the equilibrium IgE aggregate size distribution as a function of the (DCT)2-cys concentration. Our results indicate that maximal cellular activation occurs at a much higher (DCT)2-cys concentration than maximal IgE aggregation. When IgE aggregation is maximal, almost all aggregated IgE is in cyclic dimers. Thus, cyclic dimers appear to be functionally ineffective, even after they have been cross-linked by B1E3. Aggregated IgE-Fc epsilon RI that is effective in stimulating a cellular response may have particular structural or dynamic properties that allow critical interactions for initiating the signaling cascade.",,,,,,,,,

These paediatric oncology community nurse specialists (POCNS) are mostly based at regional children's cancer treatment centres, although some are based within paediatric units of district general hospitals. In addition to the National Health Service (NHS), a major source of funding has been provided from a range of charities. This paper examines the impact that the employment location (regional or district) and funding sources have on the process, practice and structure of nursing within the speciality. All 43 POCNSs were interviewed from 28 different hospitals across the United Kingdom and Eire. Thirty-one were based at regional treatment centres, whilst 12 were from district general hospitals. Funding was provided by: the NHS (9); Cancer and Leukaemia in Childhood (CLIC) (10); Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund (5); and other charities (19). Major differences were found according to the location of POCNSs, i.e. the regional model and the district model, and according to funders, i.e. the Macmillan model, the CLIC model and the 'other funders' model. This research suggests that both funding source and location of POCNSs have implications for nursing practice.",,,,,,,,,

While the physiologic significance of P-gp expression in leukocytes is unknown, the relatively high levels of P-gp in CD56+ and CD8+ cells suggest that P-gp may function in cell-mediated cytolysis. To explore this possibility we examined the effect of four inhibitors of P-gp efflux [(R)-verapamil (R-ver), (S)-verapamil (S-ver), cyclosporine A (CsA), and PSC833 (PSC)] on both the inhibition of natural killer cell (NK) function and on P-gp efflux. NK function was assayed by measuring the lysis of 51Cr-labeled K562 target cells in the presence and absence of inhibitors. All four P-gp efflux inhibitors inhibited NK-mediated cytolysis in a dose-dependent manner. The stereoisomers of verapamil were more potent inhibitors of cell-mediated cytolysis than the cyclosporines CsA and PSC. In contrast, CsA and PSC were more potent as inhibitors of P-gp-mediated rhodamine 123 dye efflux than the verapamil isomers. Both CsA and PSC maximally inhibited P-gp efflux at 3 microM, but only minimally inhibited cell-mediated cytolysis. The verapamil compounds demonstrated closer correlation between efflux inhibition of NK-mediated cytolysis. The data support a role for P-gp in NK-mediated cytolysis; however, these studies also suggest that the NK cytolytic process is multifaceted and that inhibition of the P-gp-mediated efflux mechanism only partially abrogates this process.",,,,,,,,,

There appeared to be two classes of proteoglycans. One, serglycin, was recognized to have a core protein of 31 kDa, an overall molecular mass of 200-300 kDa, and glycosaminoglycan chains of mean size < 25 kDa. The size of this proteoglycan was increased by both PMA and DMSO. Synthesis was increased by PMA and reduced by DMSO. mRNA for serglycin was increased at 24 to 72 hr following PMA treatment. In addition, the cells contained a core protein triplet at 96, 110, and 120 kDa, and the medium only the bands at 96 and 110 kDa, suggesting the presence of betaglycan. Synthesis of this proteoglycan was enhanced by PMA. This proteoglycan had an overall size of 130-150 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in control cells, but in the presence of PMA, a component > 250 kDa was present. Probes for Northern blot analysis were prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the sequences of human serglycin and betaglycan. The serglycin probe recognized a 1.4 kb band, and the betaglycan probe recognized a 4.1 kb band, on blots prepared from RNA from CHRF cells and cultured normal human megakaryocytes. Both proteoglycans in their intact form adhered to peptides derived from fibronectin and collagen, but the free GAGs released by alkaline borohydride digestion did not adhere.

It has been previously demonstrated that PML, which is tightly bound to the nuclear matrix, concentrates in discrete subnuclear compartments that are disorganized in APL cells due to the expression of the PML-RAR alpha hybrid. Here we report that adenovirus infection causes a drastic redistribution of PML from spherical nuclear bodies into fibrous structures. The product encoded by adenovirus E4-ORF3 is shown to be responsible for this reorganization and to colocalize with PML into these fibers. In addition, we demonstrate that E1A oncoproteins concentrate in the PML domains, both in infected and transiently transfected cells, and that this association requires the conserved amino acid motif (D)LXCXE, common to all viral oncoproteins that bind pRB or the related p107 and p130 proteins. The SV-40 large T antigen, another member of this oncoprotein family is also found in close association with the PML nuclear bodies. Taken together, the present data indicate that the subnuclear domains containing PML represent a preferential target for DNA tumor viruses, and therefore suggest a more general involvement of the PML nuclear bodies in oncogenic processes.",PMC2120608,,,,,,,,

Transfection of the parental reduced folate carrier into MTXrA cells resulted in a cell line which exhibited a complete restoration of methotrexate uptake and an enhanced sensitivity to methotrexate. Northern analysis and specific [3H]MTX cell surface binding indicated that expression of the reduced folate carrier was elevated approximately 5-fold in the transfectant compared to parental and MTXrA cells. The MTX influx properties of the transfectant cell line were identical to those of the well characterized reduced folate carrier from parental L1210 cells in terms of: 1) patterns of sensitivity to competing folates, 2) sensitivity to the organic anion sulfobromophthalein, 3) lack of energy dependence, and 4) capacity for trans-stimulation. We also provide new data which suggests that the nucleotide sequence 5' of the predicted ATG initiation codon may encode additional protein information in the form of a leader sequence.

(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 14355-14358) and predicted that AZT treatment of whole cells should cause similar inhibition. In this report, we verify this prediction by showing that treatment of K562 cells with AZT inhibits lipid and protein glycosylation. AZT treatment dramatically alters the pattern of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, nearly abolishing ganglioside synthesis at clinically relevant concentrations (1-5 microM), and suppresses the incorporation of both sialic acid and galactose into proteins. Control experiments demonstrate that these changes do not result from nonspecific effects on either the secretory apparatus or protein synthesis. On the other hand, studies using isolated nuclei as a model system for chromosomal DNA replication show that AZTTP is a very weak inhibitor of DNA synthesis. These observations strongly suggest that the myelosuppressive effects of AZT in vivo are due to inhibition of protein and/or lipid glycosylation and not to effects on chromosomal DNA replication.",,,,,,,,,

Of 95 patients of AML diagnosed between July 1987 and December 1991, 53 uniformly treated patients (induction therapy with cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin) had sequential bone marrow examinations performed in the 2- to 5-week period following initiation of induction therapy. Four morphologic patterns were recognized in these 53 patients: Group I (22 patients)--hypocellularity or normal regeneration (> or = 15% cellularity and < 5% blasts) on the initial 2-week marrow followed by marrows showing normal regeneration; Group II (10 patients)--hypocellularity followed by ""reactive myeloblastosis"" (> or = 15% cellularity, 5% to 34% blasts, with promyelocytes = or > blasts); Group III (12 patients)--residual blasts (> or = 5% blasts with blasts >> promyelocytes) in the initial posttherapy marrow; Group IV (9 patients)--atypical patterns not fitting any of the other categories.

Seven of 21 patients in Groups III and IV had unfavorable initial morphology (MO, hypoplastic AML and AML preceded by myelodysplasia) compared to only 3 of 32 patients in Groups I and II (p = 0.039). It was thus observed that ""reactive myeloblastosis"" with up to 34% blasts on the third or fourth week bone marrow following an initial hypocellular marrow does not require additional induction therapy to achieve durable remissions or favorable survival. Also, residual blasts that outnumber promyelocytes, and atypical patterns of regeneration correlate with lower remission induction rates, shortened survival, and unfavorable morphology on the initial diagnostic bone marrow.",,,,,,,,,

Two hundred and fifty-one ALs were characterized morphologically, cytochemically, and immunologically. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) positivity in > 3% of blasts was regarded as evidence of the myeloid origin of leukemic cells, cytoplasmic CD22 (cCD22) expression was taken as an indication for B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and CD3+ (membrane or cytoplasmic) cases were classified as T-ALL. Diagnosis of minimally differentiated acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M0) was made when blast cells had undifferentiated features by light microscopy, reacted with at least one of the antibodies to myeloid-specific antigens (CD13, CD33, MPO), and lacked CD19, cCD22, and c/mCD3. Megakaryoblastic differentiation was demonstrated by the expression of CD41 and/or CD61. Following these criteria, 209 cases were classified as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 39 as ALL. Expression of lymphoid antigens was detected in 45% of AML cases and 30% of ALLs showed myeloid antigens. One case was regarded as a true biphenotypic leukemia because of the combined expression of MPO and CD33 for the myeloid lineage, and cCD3, CD2, and CD5 for the T-cell lineage. Two cases lacked signs of myeloid or lymphoid differentiation and were studied by electron microscopy methods. One displayed platelet peroxidase (PPO) activity and was classified as a megakaryoblastic variant, one other reacted with anti-CD33 and was considered AML-M0. We conclude that light microscopy and standard immunologic methods can accurately demonstrate the lineage orientation in greater than 99% of ALs. Integration with ultrastructural analysis can define the cell nature of virtually all cases of AL.",,,,,,,,,

To investigate the mechanisms involved, we examined the activities of endogenous endonucleases in nuclei and cytoplasm. Both fractions of control cells contained Ca(2+)-dependent endonuclease which was capable of mediating internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The assay system using two kinds of target substrates, i.e., nuclear chromatin of CCRF-CEM cells and naked DNA purified from the same cells, revealed that the activity of Ca(2+)-dependent endonuclease was enhanced in the crude nuclear extracts of cells treated with 1.0 microgram/ml of ara-C for 24 h or 48 h. The activity was extracted more easily from ara-C-treated cells than control cells without sonication of the nuclear fraction. On the other hand, in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cells, the activity towards naked DNA was unchanged, whereas that towards nuclear chromatin was clearly enhanced. These results suggest that internucleosomal DNA fragmentation induced by ara-C treatment is associated with enhancement and activation of constitutively expressed Ca(2+)-dependent endonuclease in L1210 cells.",PMC5920892,,,,,,,,

As compared to controls, CGP 48664A, DFMO and the CGP 48664A-DFMO combination reduced L1210 cell numbers by 33, 43 and 85%, respectively. CGP 48664A did not affect cell-cycle phase distribution. DFMO and the CGP 48664A-DFMO combination caused a moderate and a heavy accumulation in G0/G1- and G2/M-phases, respectively.

Compared with CGP 48664A, the CGP 48664A-DFMO combination caused lower putrescine and total polyamines, higher spermine, but no change in spermidine. Compared with DFMO, the CGP 48664A-DFMO combination caused higher putrescine and spermidine, lower spermine, but no change in total polyamine levels. We conclude that CGP 48664A potentiates the cystostatic effect of DFMO in vivo. The resulting growth inhibition is accompanied by an accumulation in G0/G1- and G2/M-phases and a reduction of putrescine and spermidine. The data suggest that perturbed polyamine composition rather than reduced spermidine or total polyamine pool size causes a profound growth inhibition.",,,,,,,,,

Two BsAb's constructed with monoclonal anti-saporin Fab arms each recognizing a different epitope on the saporin molecule also performed poorly. In contrast the BsAb OKT10 x RabSap constructed with Fab derived from a rabbit polyclonal anti-saporin antiserum performed in a dose dependent manner achieving its IC50 at a concentration of 1.3 nM.

DBA/2 mice (10-16 months old) were injected with 5 x 10(6) erythroleukemia cells and remained either: (i) untreated (control); (ii) treated with indomethacin (5 micrograms/ml drinking water) for 9 days from tumor onset; (iii) treated with rIL-2 (24 x 10(3) U/injection) twice a day for the last 4 days of the 9-day tumor-bearing period, or (iv) treated with both indomethacin and rIL-2 concomitantly. Some mice from each group (above) were killed after 9 days of tumor growth, while the others were allowed to survive. Spleen and bone marrow cells were collected from the mice of each group and NK (ASGM-1+) cells were quantitated using an immunoperoxidase technique combined with light microscopy. NK cell-mediated activity was assessed using a standard chromium release assay. The results show that although NK cell numbers increase in the presence of the growing tumor, neither indomethacin alone, rIL-2 alone, nor the combination could further increase the numbers of these cells. Furthermore, indomethacin and/or rIL-2 could not induce NK cell-mediated activity in such mice. Moreover, tumor-bearing aged mice treated as above did not have a significantly longer life span than untreated (control) tumor-bearing mice.

Furthermore, the results of this and our previous studies suggest that immunotherapy, which may be highly effective in one age group, should not be presumed effective throughout life.",,,,,,,,,

Very little is known of the molecular mechanisms by which radiation induces apoptosis. Morphology changes and chromatin cleavage at internucleosomal sites accompany apoptosis in these cells. We found that trolox, a water-soluble derivative of vitamin E that penetrates biomembranes and protects mammalian cells from oxidative damage, blocks DNA fragmentation in irradiated MOLT-4 cells. Levels of DNA fragmentation in cells not treated with trolox were directly related to both radiation dose and time postirradiation. Preincubation of cells with trolox or incubation with trolox only during irradiation did not protect cells. A 4 h postirradiation incubation with trolox was sufficient to completely block fragmentation measured at 24 h, indicating the processes triggered by radiation to induce DNA fragmentation occur early after irradiation. Removal of cells from trolox earlier than 4 h resulted in progressively less inhibition. Trolox preserves the integrity of irradiated cells as judged by increased viability and thymidine incorporation. Radiation induces an uptake of extracellular Ca2+ into MOLT-4 cells that was blocked by a postirradiation incubation with trolox. These results suggest that membrane-associated oxidations triggered by radiation are responsible for radiation-induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells.",,,,,,,,,

The establishment of long-term bone marrow cultures, which are thought to mimic hematopoiesis in vitro, and various stromal cell lines has greatly facilitated the analysis of the functions of this microenvironment. Extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules of all three categories (collagens, proteoglycans and glycoproteins) have been identified as part of this microenvironment and have been shown to be involved in different biological functions such as cell adhesion and anti-adhesion, binding and presentation of various cytokines and regulation of cell growth. It is suggested that these matrix molecules in combination with cytokines are crucial for compartmentalization of the bone marrow. Although many cell adhesion molecules have been characterized on the surface of hematopoietic progenitor cells, the nature of cellular receptors for the ECM components is less well defined. During leukemia, many immature blood cells are released from bone marrow, but it is not yet known whether these abnormalities in hematopoiesis are also caused by an altered microenvironment or altered composition of its extracellular matrix. The elucidation of the involvement of specific ECM-isoforms and as yet not characterized ECM components and their receptors in the bone marrow will certainly help towards a better understanding of these phenomena.",,,,,,,,,

It catalyzes the exchange of eukaryotic chain initiation factor (eIF)-2-bound GDP for GTP and facilitates the recycling of eIF-2 during polypeptide chain initiation. We used the Friend virus-transformed murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell system to elucidate the translational regulatory processes that occur during growth and hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA)-induced cell differentiation. GEF activity is increased during growth and decreased during MEL cell differentiation, and this parallels the overall changes in protein synthesis during this period. Inhibition of GEF activity in induced cells may occur indirectly by phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eIF-2. However, the decrease in GEF activity in induced cells cannot be reversed by increasing the concentration of eIF-2-GDP added as a substrate in the GEF assay. This is diagnostic for the presence of eIF-2 alpha(P)-GDP in cell lysates and suggests that regulation of GEF activity may occur by one or more mechanisms other than eIF-2(alpha) phosphorylation. We have previously shown that the activity of GEF may be influenced directly by phosphorylation with casein kinase II (CK-II) of the 82-kD subunit of the factor. CK-II activity parallels the changes in GEF activity and the rate of protein synthesis during growth and differentiation of MEL cells. Addition of 1mM spermidine, a stimulator of CK-II but not of purified GEF, in induced MEL cell extracts enhances both CK-II and GEF activities approximately 48 and 32%, respectively. The results presented suggest that the inhibition of protein synthesis during MEL cell differentiation may be linked to the decreased CK-II and GEF activities.",,,,,,,,,

CD13 antigen was induced in all 10 cases of precursor-B ALL after culture with BCGF, with weaker expression seen in cells incubated with TPA or in medium alone. Aminopeptidase-N-like enzymatic activity was also demonstrated in cultured cells, particularly after BCGF exposure. Using the mAb WM-15, which specifically inhibits aminopeptidase-N function, we demonstrated that induction of true aminopeptidase-N activity was largely restricted to BCGF-treated cells, in which approximately 20% of total aminopeptidase activity was due to aminopeptidase-N. Phenotypic expression of the peptidase CD10 (neutral endopeptidase) was not altered on cultured cells.

This effect was partly mediated by the T cell line supernatant: four of five supernatants tested inhibited the growth of CFU-GM. Antibody neutralization studies demonstrated the presence of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in these supernatants. There was a greater suppression of CML CFU-GM when compared with CFU-GM from normal individuals.

To gain insights into the patterns of activation of this gene during hematopoietic differentiation, we have examined HOXA10 expression in CD34+ and CD34- subfractions of normal marrow and normal peripheral blood, as well as samples from patients with a variety of acute and chronic leukemias. HOXA10 is strongly expressed in CD34+ normal marrow cells, markedly downregulated in CD34- marrow cells, and inactive in mature neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. HOXA10 is expressed in all types of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with the notable exception of acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML-M3). HOXA10 message is observed in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) but appears to be reduced in accelerated phase and blast crisis, particularly lymphoid blast crisis. With rare exception, HOXA10 expression is not observed in samples of acute or chronic lymphoid leukemias. Normal marrow and patient samples appear to contain a single transcript which encodes a full-length homeobox-containing protein, while immortalized cell lines contain an additional alternatively spliced transcript.

To elucidate a possible functional relationship between FAK and BCR-ABL oncoprotein detected in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias, we investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation state of FAK in a murine growth factor-dependent cell line and in its stable human bcr-abl cDNA transfectant. In interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent NFS/N1.H7 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was not detected after stimulation with either IL-3 or Steel factor (SLF), both of which involve Ras-mediated signaling pathways. However, stable gene transfection with p210bcr-abl cDNA into H7 cells made these cells growth factor-independent for proliferation and resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activation of FAK. Constitutive phosphorylation and activation of FAK was also observed in all Ph+ leukemia cell lines examined--that is, K562, TS9;22, and YS9;22, which express p210BCR-ABL, and NALM-21 and OM9;22, which express p185BCR-ABL. Ph-negative (Ph-) cell lines, such as MO7e and JM, did not show any detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. FAK phosphorylation in BCR-ABL-expressing cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by cytochalasin D, a reagent that disrupts the intracellular network of actin filaments. However, no suppression of kinase activity or protein expression of BCR-ABL was observed after treatment with cytochalasin D. A physical association between BCR-ABL and FAK was not apparent. These data suggest that BCR-ABL may be involved in the activation of FAK. Moreover, FAK may be distinct from components in Ras-mediated signaling cascades that are activated by stimulation of myeloid cells with various cytokines.",,,,,,,,,

However, evidence is accumulating to show that the actual situation is more complex: the living state implicitly involves the production of oxyradicals. (1) Blast type cells produce much less oxyradicals than the differentiated ones, and an increased production of OH radicals induce differentiation of various lines of leukemia cells; meanwhile, their superoxide dismutase expression increases to a very high extent. (2) The supramolecular organization of the cells is developed by means of ""useful"" crosslinking effects OH radicals. (3) Repiratory inhibition of oxyradical production (KCN-intoxication, suffocation, etc.) would kill living organisms prior to the exhaustion of energy reserves. It is assumed that the continuous flux of OH radicals is a prerequisite for a electron delocalization on the proteins, which is a semiconduction of p-type, proposes already in 1941 by Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, and refuted on a ""theoretical"" basis. It has become clear by now that the carbon-based semiconduction is possible because diamond transistors are known to exist. The recently developed atomic force microscopy offers some real possibilities for experimental testing of this assumption. This concept may lead us to new horizons in interpretation of living functions, such as the basic memory mechanisms in brain cells and their impairment during aging.",,,,,,,,['Szent-Gyorgyi A'],"['Szent-Gyorgyi, A']"

Unlike intact granulocytes or monocytes, human B-lymphocytes require calcium ionophore, exogenous arachidonic acid and an oxidative environment in order to produce 5-lipoxygenase products. Several thiol-reactive compounds such as N-ethylmaleimide, methyl methanethiosulfonate, azodicarboxylic acid bis[dimethylamide] (diamide) as well as hydrogen peroxide were all found to stimulate cellular leukotriene biosynthesis. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis demonstrated the expression of 5-lipoxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) and LTA4 hydrolase mRNA in B-CLL cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated a band corresponding to the molecular size of FLAP in the B-CLL cell membrane. Furthermore, MK886, the FLAP-binding cellular leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor, reduced both LTB4 and 5-HETE formation. Immunocytochemistry showed that 5-lipoxygenase was mainly localized in the nuclei of non-activated B-CLL cells, tonsillar B-lymphocytes and monoclonal B-cells. In contrast, neither human peripheral T-lymphocytes nor Jurkat cells were stained. These results suggest that 5-lipoxygenase and its products function in the nucleus of B-lymphocytes.",,,,,,,,,

The longevity of human alpha-globin mRNA is associated with a ribonucleoprotein complex (alpha-complex) formed on the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). One or more of the proteins within this alpha-complex contain strong polycytosine [poly(C)] binding (alpha PCB) activity. In the present report we purify alpha PCB activity from human erythroid K562 cells. Although not able to bind the alpha-globin 3'UTR directly, alpha PCB activity is sufficient to complement alpha-complex formation in a cytosolic extract depleted of poly(C) binding activity. Peptide microsequencing demonstrates that alpha PCB activity contains two structurally related poly(C) binding proteins. These two proteins, alpha-complex protein (alpha CP)-1 and -2, have an overall structural identity of 80% and contain three repeats of the K homology (KH) domain which is found in a subset of RNA binding proteins. Epitope-tagged recombinant alpha CP-1 and alpha CP-2 expressed in cells are each incorporated into the alpha-complex. We conclude that alpha CP-1 and alpha CP-2, members of the KH domain RNA binding protein family, are involved in formation of a sequence-specific alpha-globin mRNP complex associated with alpha-globin mRNA stability. As such this represents the first example of a specific function for this class of proteins and suggests potential roles for other members of this protein family.",PMC394520,['GENBANK/U24223'],,,,,,,

The rat HLF gene is transcribed from two alternative promoters, alpha and beta, with different circadian amplitudes and tissue specificities. The alpha RNA isoforms produce a 43 kDa protein, HLF43, abundant in brain, liver and kidney, like the previously described human HLF RNA. The beta RNA HLF isoforms use a CUG codon to initiate translation of a novel 36 kDa protein, HLF36, which is shorter at its N-terminus relative to the 43 kDa form. HLF36 is expressed uniquely in the liver, where it is the most abundant HLF protein. Surprisingly, the two proteins accumulate in the liver with different circadian amplitudes and have distinct liver-specific promoter preferences in transfection experiments. Thus, HLF43 stimulates transcription from the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase promoter much more efficiently than from the albumin promoter, while the converse is true for HLF36.",PMC394515,"['GENBANK/S79817', 'GENBANK/S79818', 'GENBANK/S79820']",,,,,,,

To determine the function of this gene in mice, null mutations were made using homologous recombination in ES cells to incorporate lacZ into the hox11 transcription unit. Production of beta-galactosidase from the recombinant hox11 allele in +/- mutants allowed identification of sites of hox11 expression which included the developing spleen. Newborn hox11 -/- mice exhibit asplenia. Spleen formation commences normally at E11.5 in hox11 -/- mutant embryos but the spleen anlage undergoes rapid and complete resorption between E12.5 and E13.5. Dying spleen cells exhibit molecular features of apoptosis, suggesting that programmed cell death is initiated at this stage of organ development in the absence of hox11 protein. Thus hox11 is not required to initiate spleen development but is essential for the survival of splenic precursors during organogenesis. This function for hox11 suggests that enhanced cell survival may result from the t(10;14) which activates HOX11 in T cell leukaemias, further strengthening the association between oncogene-induced cell survival and tumorigenesis.",,,,,,,,,

Recently, in vitro effects of the association on neutrophil function have been reported. In particular, the association was able to increase random migration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis-associated- and f-MLP-induced chemiluminescence. In this paper the authors evaluate the effects of L-lysine-L-arginine combination (lisargin) on several humoral and cell-mediated immunologic parameters in patients with recurrent infection. An increase of neutrophil random migration and chemotaxis (evaluated by a new technique, based on a computer assisted image processing system) was found.

K562/Dox displayed typical MDR features with respect to its cross-resistance to a variety of functionally and structurally unrelated compounds: vincristine (Vin), Dox, mitomycin C, reduced steady-state intracellular anthracycline accumulation, and elevated P-glycoprotein expression/mdr1 mRNA transcription/mdr1 gene amplification. Nevertheless, by incubation of cells with Dox/epirubicin (Epi)/daunorubicin (Dau) (5-80 micrograms/ml), the initial drug uptake was similar (p > 0.05) in K562/Dox and K562 cells, suggesting P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux would not occur unless a relatively high cellular drug concentration was reached. After 8 h incubation of cells with 50 ng/ml Dox (5 times higher than its IC50 to K562 cells), there were only slight differences (p > 0.05) in intracellular drug levels between K562/Dox and K562 cells, clearly indicating that K562/Dox, circumventing drug toxicity in this case, was irrelevant to reduced drug accumulation caused by P-glycoprotein. Similar results were obtained when Epi or Dau was applied. Despite complete restoration of anthracycline accumulation in K562/Dox cells in the presence of 6 mumol/l verapamil, the reversal of their drug resistance was incomplete. These results suggest that P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux possibly did not play a primary role in the drug resistance of K562/Dox cells.",,,,,,,,,

In the first child the pattern of both spontaneous and mitomycin-C-induced chromosome breakage was characteristic of Fanconi's anaemia although the degree of breakage was extreme. She also exhibited a striking increase in X-ray-induced chromosomal damage in G0 lymphocytes as measured by dicentric formation and increase in chromatid-type aberrations. She had a number of typical clinical features, including cafe-au-lait patches and abnormalities involving the kidney; however, she demonstrated neither the hypoplasia of radius and thumb nor the typical aplastic phase of this disorder. At age 22 months the child became anaemic with trilineage myelodysplasia, which was rapidly followed by the development of acute myeloblastic leukaemia. The early onset (at age 4 months) of retinoblastoma may have been associated with the underlying genomic instability. The second child exhibited a pattern of chromosome breakage characteristic of Bloom's syndrome, in addition to a moderate increase in damage induced by mytomycin-C. She had the typical stunted growth and malar hypoplasia of Bloom's syndrome although she did not demonstrate the frequently described erythematous 'butterfly rash' Although patients with Fanconi's anaemia and Bloom's syndrome are recognised to be at an increased risk of cancer, retinoblastoma has not previously been described in patients with either condition.

Furthermore, the induction of erythroid differentiation by NHAC was tested in K-562 cells. The cytotoxicity of NHAC in both cell lines was not influenced by the deoxycytidine (dCyd) concentration or the presence of the nucleoside-transport-blocking agent dipyridamole as demonstrated in coincubations with dCyd and/or dipyridamole, whereas in contrast, the cytotoxicity of ara-C was decreased additively by both drugs. As compared with ara-C, the uptake of NHAC displayed up to 16- and 5-fold increases in K-562 and U-937 cells, respectively, depending on the drug concentration. Studies of the drug distribution and pharmacokinetics of NHAC revealed a depot effect for NHAC in the cell membranes, resulting in half-lives 2.6 and 1.4 times longer than those of ara-C in the two cell lines. The ara-CTP concentrations derived from NHAC were 150- and 75-fold lower at a drug concentration of 1 microM in K-562 and U-937 cells, respectively. The DNA incorporation of the drugs observed after incubation with 2 microM NHAC was 60- and 30-fold lower as compared with that seen at 2 microM ara-C in the two cell lines. Furthermore, NHAC was capable of inducing irreversible erythroid differentiation to a maximum of only 22% of K-562 cells, whereas ara-C induced differentiation at a drug concentration 100-fold lower in 50% of the cells. These results indicate a mechanism of cytotoxicity for NHAC that is independent of the nucleoside transport mechanism and the phosphorylation pathway and suggest that the mechanisms of action of NHAC are significantly different from those of ara-C. Therefore, NHAC might be used for the treatment of ara-C-resistant malignancies.",,,,,,,,,

In anticipation of clinical trials of UVB-modified bone marrow grafts, we studied the in vitro effects of UVB irradiation (50-300 J/m2) on human natural killer and lymphokine activated killer cells since both types of cells influence the development of GVHD and graft-versus-tumor effect. Interleukin-2-activated and untreated human lymphocytes were used as effectors in a 51Cr release cytotoxic assay against various tumor cell lines as targets. NK-mediated lysis of K562 targets was decreased by UVB irradiation of the effector cells in a dose-dependent manner. FACS analysis of CD16+ and CD56+ cells 24 hr after UVB exposure showed a UVB-dose-dependent decrease in the number of cells expressing these surface markers. UVB irradiation of lymphocytes prior to activation with high-dose IL-2 resulted in a range of 20- to 89-fold decrease in LAK precursors as measured by limiting dilution analysis using the LAK-sensitive cell line HL60. In contrast, the LAK activity of lymphocytes that had been stimulated in vitro with high-dose IL-2 prior to UVB irradiation was preserved when assayed immediately after UVB modulation; however, there was a significant decrease in lytic activity (with most samples tested) when the assay was performed 24 hr after UVB exposure. It appears that the lymphocyte response to UVB modification is dose dependent, with some cell types displaying higher sensitivity to UVB irradiation than others. These findings suggest that prevention of GVHD by UVB is due, in part, to inhibition of NK activity, and may offer a new strategy to augment the graft versus leukemia effect of UVB-modified bone marrow grafts in clinical transplantation.",,,,,,,,,

The nuclease activity, corresponding to a triplet of proteins observed at approximately 42, 45, and 50 kDa in size, was extractable, heat-stable, and detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing deoxyribonucleic acids (SDS-PAGE-DNA) assay. The NP42-50 activity requires the presence of Mg2+/Ca2+ and is insensitive to inactivation by heating at 80 degrees C for 5 min. Zinc effectively inhibited the enzymatic activity of NP42-50 on SDS-PAGE-DNA and also protected Jurkat cells from the CD95-mediated apoptosis in cell cultures. The nuclease activation, however, was not a unique pathway for the CD95-mediated cell death. The apoptosis induced by arabinofuranosyl cytosine, a chemotherapeutic agent, also activated the NP42-50 nuclease activity in Jurkat cells, suggesting that a similar cascade of subsequent events in apoptosis may occur in most instances although many different signals can initiate apoptotic cell death in various cell types. The nuclease identified by this study appears to be distinguishable from DNase I or DNase II by its molecular characteristics and its enzymatic requirements. The NP42-50, with respect to the nuclease activity closely associated with apoptotic cell death, may serve as a candidate for the endonuclease(s) involved in the cleavage of DNA into fragments during apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,

Despite a loss of fibroblast transformation activity, all three mutants retain the ability to render hematopoietic cell lines growth factor independent and transform primary bone marrow cells in vitro. In vivo tests of malignant potential reveal a most critical role for signals dependent on the BCR-ABL SH2 domain. The efficiency of both fibroblast and hematopoietic transformation by BCR-ABL is strongly affected by increased dosage of the SHC adapter protein, which can connect tyrosine kinase signals to RAS.

Cells were stimulated by Fc epsilon RI clustering either with IgE and antigen or by an IgE specific monoclonal antibody. Both stimuli induced a biphasic increase in the free intracellular Ca(2+)-concentration ([Ca2+]i). Fc epsilon RI clustering in Ca(2+)-free solution induces a transient increase in [Ca2+]i reflecting Ca2+ release from the Ins(1,4,5)P3 sensitive stores. Mn2+ applied to a nominally Ca(2+)-free solution, causes quenching of the Fura-2 emission during Fc epsilon RI clustering, indicating activation of a transmembrane pathway for the entry of extracellular calcium ions. Whole-cell current-voltage relationship of resting cells showed strong inward rectification. The inward current component at a potential of -100 mV is increased by 23 +/- 11% (n = 14) upon Fc epsilon RI clustering, whereas the outward component at +50 mV was enhanced by 45 +/- 6%. The Fc epsilon RI activated current was identified as due to K+ ions, because it reversed close to the K(+)-equilibrium potential, was blocked by Ba2+ or Cs+ containing or K(+)-free bath solutions. It was also inhibited by TEA and quinidine, while DIDS had no effect. Moreover, an inwardly rectifying K(+)-channel with a conductance of 28 pS was recorded in single channel measurements. The open probability of this channel increased by 39 +/- 16% (n = 8) upon Fc epsilon RI clustering. Superfusion of the cells with nominally K(+)-free solution also significantly inhibited both the Fc epsilon RI mediated 45Ca2+ uptake and the secretory response of the cells. We conclude that activation of K(+)-channels upon Fc epsilon RI clustering is functionally involved in the control and the maintenance of the secretory response of RBL-2H3 mast cells.",,,,,,,,,

The DN reductase associated with CBR reduces the C13 methyl ketone group and does not metabolize the quinone ring of DN. Reports comparing DN and DNOL toxicity have resulted in various conclusions depending on the cells tested. Differences in toxicity could be due to variations in several enzymes involved in DN metabolism. In this report, the effects of CBR expression on DN metabolism and cell toxicity were determined by cloning and expressing a human CBR cDNA in DN reductase-deficient myeloid erythroleukemia K562 cells. CBR activity increased 83-fold in the K562-transfected cells and was associated with a 2-3-fold reduction in DN toxicity. Maximum protection occurred at 30 nM DN where 94% of the intracellular DN was converted to DNOL within 2 h. The reduced toxicity was specific for DN. Other CBR substrates such as menadione, phenanthrenequinone, and doxorubicin were equally toxic to both the CBR expresser cells and the control cells under the conditions tested. Our results suggest that high levels of CBR in tumor cells could contribute to drug resistance. The results also suggest that reduction of DN to DNOL protects against DN toxicity by altering interaction of the drug at one or more of the many target sites.",,,,,,,,,

Alternatively, leukemic cell lines with megakaryocytic differentiation potential may provide good models to counter these problems. METHODS: Leukemic cells from a patient with acute megakaryocytic leukemia were put into long-term culture and established into a cell line which was designated as VGH-MK1. The VGH-MK1 cells were challenged with differentiation agents and/or cytokines, and the differentiation of these cells was examined using morphological, immunocytochemical and surface-marker studies. RESULTS: Morphologically, VGH-MK1 cells had prominent nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm with some protrusions, but large cells were occasionally seen. Under regular culture condition, the cells had a doubling time of 36-48 hours. The cloned cell line exhibited markers characteristic of megakaryoblasts after differentiation induction. Specifically, when stimulated with 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cells became larger and had large or multinuclei. They were induced to express platelet glycoproteins GPIb (CD42b), GPIIb/IIIa (CD41), and GPIIIa (CD61) antigens, but not erythroid nor lymphoid markers. Platelet peroxidase (PPO) activity was also induced. Retinoic acid did not exhibit similar differentiation-inducing effects. In contrast, it counteracted the effects induced by TPA. CONCLUSIONS: An unique human leukemic cell line, VGH-MK1, has been established here. It could be induced to exhibit some characteristics of megakaryocytic lineage, and may be an useful model for the biological studies of megakaryopoiesis.",,,,,,,,,

Following treatment of THP-1 cells with combinations of IFN-gamma and IL-1, IDO activity and IDO mRNA were quantified by HPLC and radioanalytic imaging of RT-PCR products, respectively. IL-1 increased the amount of IDO activity and the expression of IDO mRNA in IFN-treated cells; IL-1 alone had no effect on untreated THP-1 cells. Because IDO gene regulation might differ between immature THP-1 cells and mature macrophages, experiments were repeated using primary macrophage cultures. IFN-gamma induced IDO activity, and IDO mRNA was expressed in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of IL-1, 10 times less IFN was required to obtain the same amount of IDO mRNA and IDO activity. Furthermore, IL-1 alone increased IDO mRNA expression. It appears that unlike what was observed in THP-1 cells, IL-1 transcriptionally activates the IDO gene in primary macrophages. However, increases in IDO activity were not observed following treatment with IL-1 alone. Although the THP-1 cell may be used to model cytokine potentiation of IFN-induced IDO activity, some differences in regulation between THP-1 cells and primary macrophage cultures may exist.",,,,,,,,,

The left RCJs were injected with an equivalent volume of vehicle alone (n = 6) or vehicle containing 1 micrograms human albumin (n = 2). Goat joints were examined for clinical features of inflammation, and synovial fluid (SF) was aspirated on days 0, 2, and 6 postinjection. Leukocyte counts and concentrations of keratan sulfate, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha were determined in the SF. Proteoglycan synthesis was determined ex vivo in cartilage explants obtained on day 6 postinjection. A statistically significant increase in joint swelling and effusion volume was observed in LIF-injected joints but not in control joints. In the LIF-injected RCJs, the leukocyte count increased from 82 +/- 9 cells/microliters before injection to 10,300 +/- 3357 cells/microliters at day 2 postinjection (p < 0.005) and declined to 678 +/- 113 cells/microliters at day 6 postinjection. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocyte/macrophages predominated in the infiltrate. No appreciable change in leukocyte counts was observed in control joints.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

Recently, two genes, MTG8 on chromosome 8 and AML1 on chromosome 21, were found. The t(8;21) translocation resulted in rearrangements of the two genes and formation of AML1/MTG8 fusion gene. To clarify the molecular characteristics of AML-M2b, we studied 41 patients with AML-M2b. By Southern blot and hybridization, the rearrangements of AML1 and MTG8 genes were detected in 24 of 30 and 22 of 28 patients, respectively. By means of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the AML1/MTG8 chimeric transcript was found in all 37 patients. In 4 patients with AML-M2b of normal karyotype, AML1/MTG8 fusion mRNA and/or rearrangements of AML1 and MTG8 genes were detected. However, among 31 patients with other types of AML, these abnormalities were found in only one patient with AML-M6. These results suggest that rearrangements of AML1, MTG8 genes and/or AML1/MTG8 fusion gene could be regarded as gene marker of AML-M2b that can be applied in the diagnosis and monitoring of therapy and minimal residual disease.",,,,,,,,,

The changes include replacement of a portion of the U3 region of the MoMLV LTR with a hybrid regulatory element consisting of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/promoter (CMV-IE) together with the human immunodeficiency virus transactivation response element (HIV-TAR). Transfection of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter constructs into a variety of human cell lines showed that the hybrid LTR with the CMV-IE/HIV-TAR enhancer/promoter exhibited basal expression levels which were 10- to 50-fold higher than those obtained from the wild-type MoMLV-LTR enhancer/promoter. Expression from the recombinant LTR was further increased in the presence of the HIV-Tat protein, and surprisingly, Tat up-regulated transcription from both the HIV and the MoMLV TATA boxes. In contrast, a MoMLV enhancer/promoter containing only the HIV-TAR element in the LTR did not respond to Tat. When stably transfected into an amphotropic packaging cell line, the modified retroviral vector containing the hybrid LTR plus an extended packaging signal consistently gave higher titres of retrovirus than did the parental MoMLV based vector. Higher basal expression levels which can be further upregulated by Tat, together with more efficient virion production, suggests that the modified vector should be superior for anti-HIV gene therapy applications as well as for other more general applications in human gene therapy.",,,,,,,,,

One of the goals of the ICC is to expedite the development of combination antiretroviral therapy through data and compound sharing. Recently, the ICC formed a consensus master protocol to evaluate rapidly the safety and efficacy of triple-drug combinations of antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV-infected patients. This concept builds upon historical work with combination chemotherapy that resulted in treatments to successfully control chronic immunosuppressive, infectious or malignant diseases, such as tuberculosis, leprosy, childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Because of limitations on potency and the continuing emergence of drug resistance seen with use of currently available antiretroviral agents in monotherapy and two-drug combination regimens, triple-combination regimens should represent a more promising approach to maximize antiviral activity, maintain long-term efficacy, and reduce the incidence of drug resistance. The ICC master protocol is a randomized, controlled, double-blind study with a treatment duration of 52 weeks. Patients eligible to enroll in this study must have documented HIV infection, with CD4 counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3, and no history of antiretroviral therapy. The first four triple-drug combinations will be evaluated in two trials. These regimens have been selected based on encouraging data from laboratory and clinical studies. Each ICC trial will consist of three arms, with 75 patients per arm. Protocol ICC 001 will include AZT + zalcitabine (ddC) + saquinavir, AZT + ddC + nevirapine, and AZT + ddC as the control arm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

Apheresis products were examined for viable mononuclear cell (VMC), CD34+ cell, and clonogenic cell contents. The number of progenitors in aphereses differs in subgroups of patients with different diagnoses. However, the number of CD34+ or clonogenic cells is dependent on age and amount of chemotherapy delivered to patients before collection rather than on the nature of the disease itself. In addition, the actual dose of rhG-CSF used to mobilize PBSC and the number of VMC in aphereses influenced the clonogenicity of CD34+ cells, although the daily dose of rhG-CSF seems to play little role on the number of clonogenic cells in each individual apheresis product. CD34+ cell and CFU-C (or CFU-GM) numbers are related parameters, and the relation can be described as linear. However, the linear relation varies in different patient groups, and most of the linearity is induced by the highest sets of values. We conclude that mobilization with low doses of rhG-CSF alone is feasible and that the probability of collecting a high number of peripheral blood progenitors is increased in young patients undergoing apheresis early in the course of the disease. Although the relationship between CD34+ cells and CFUs can be described as linear in well-defined situations, its relevance may be limited because it is not a universal finding.",,,,,,,,,

These cells have been previously demonstrated to present a signal transduction system based on the polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis localized at the nuclear level, which can be specifically modulated by agonists. The results demonstrate that in Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts mitogenically stimulated by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a rapid and transient decrease of the PIP2 detectable by immunogold labeling occurs at the nuclear interior. This effect appears due to the activation of the PLC beta 1 isozyme already present in the nucleus, since no significant variations of the enzyme amount and distribution can be detected by immunolabeling. However, after 30 min of exposure to IGF-I, when the PLC beta 1 activity is returned to basal level, a slight but significant increase of the enzyme amount is detected both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm.

On the basis of the currently available data we can argue that p53 acts as a negative regulator of proliferation of myeloid mature cells and CD34+ progenitors, and its action is mediated through changes in cell cycle kinetics, mainly before the S phase. The p53-dependent pathway is also regulated by several proteins, including p16, p21, p27 (cyclin-dependent kinase [CDK] inhibitors), and a few oncogenes (bcl-2, bax, MDM-2). Although there is some information about the changes in the p53 gene seen in various types of leukemia, the functions and biological importance of these changes in the pathogenesis of leukemia are still largely elusive. During the past several years, accumulated evidence suggests that changes in the p53 gene are commonly associated with blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but rarely with chronic phase, and they are represented by rearrangements, deletions and point mutations. As for most of the tumors, the majority of point mutations occur between exons 4 and 8 (hot regions). In patients with CML in blastic crisis the most frequent mechanism of p53 inactivation is complete deletion of one allele in association with a point mutation in the remaining allele.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

Inhibitors of the mammalian enzymes are widely used antitumor drugs. They stabilize topoisomerase-DNA cleavable complexes by hindering the DNA relegating step of the catalytic reaction, thus resulting in DNA cleavage stimulation. Investigations on the sequence selectivity of DNA cleavage stimulated by chemically unrelated compounds established that specific nucleotides flanking strand cuts are required for drug action. Moreover, structure-activity relationship studies have identified structural determinants of drug sequence specificities, thus eventually allowing the design of new agents targeted at selected genomic regions. The initial cellular lesion, i.e., the drug-stabilized cleavable complex, is a reversible molecular event; however, how it may lead to cell death remains to be fully clarified. Several laboratories focused in past years on molecular and genetic aspects of drug-activated apoptosis. Irreversible double-stranded DNA breaks, generated from collisions between cleavable complexes and advancing replication forks, were suggested to increase p53 protein levels, thus triggering the cell death program. Other genes were also shown to cooperate in modulating the cell response to drug treatments. Recently, several groups have evaluated the possible prognostic value of topoisomerase II levels in solid tumors and hematopoietic neoplasms. Topoisomerase II inhibitors may also have genotoxic effects. Secondary leukemias, characterized by a translocation between chromosomes 11 and 9, have been reported in disease-free patients after treatments with drug regimens that included anti-topoisomerase II agents. It has been proposed that an impairment of topoisomerase activity may be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of secondary leukemias.",,,,,,,,,

The hematopoietic graft product contains both stem/progenitor cells and populations of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic (accessory) cells. The frequency of accessory cell types varies with the source of the graft product; marrow or blood. Reinfusion of these accessory cells causes effects other than the hematopoietic restoration provided by the stem/progenitor cells such as graft versus host disease and graft versus leukemia effect after allogeneic transplants. Effects of infused accessory cells in the autologous setting are less well studied and could provide ancillary advantages and/or disadvantages to the patient. Do these additional effects actually occur, and, if they do, are they more likely to appear following peripheral blood cell transplants (PBCT) or after autologous bone marrow transplants (AMBT)? Preliminary data are beginning to accumulate which suggest that reinfusion of occult tumor cells is less likely with PBCT, that immune reconstitution is different depending on the source of the autograft and that, for certain diseases, patient event-free survival following PBCT rather than ABMT may be better. However, infusion of occult tumor cells may result in re-establishment of the malignancy. If the accessory cells (including potential occult tumor cells) are eliminated from the product before transplant, will the patient have a better clinical outcome, or would benefits provided by infused accessory cells outweigh the risks of infused occult tumor cells? These controversial issues are in the very early stages of investigation.",,,,,,,,,

We used an in vitro colorimetric assay based on the bioreduction of the tetrazolium salt XTT by viable cells. Fludarabine concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 30 microM were tested on cells collected from 22 B-CLL patients. For each fludarabine concentration, 800 I.U. of either alpha or beta IFN were added. Interferon alone did not exert any cytotoxic effect, while Fludarabine showed a strong cytotoxicity against B-CLL cells. The concentration of Fludarabine required to induce a 50% cytotoxicity (IC50) was below 3 microM (the achievable serum level after standard dose in vivo administration) for 19 out of 22 patients. After IFNs supplementation to Fludarabine, it was possible to identify three groups of samples. The first in which IFNs addition did not produce almost any significant change in Fludarabine cytotoxicity (13/22), the second in which there was an improvement in FAMP IC50 (6/22), and finally the third group in which IFNs worsened it (3/22). Stage of disease was the only identified factor accounting for these different results. The second group included samples from 5 patients at stage A and one at stage B, while in the third group all three samples were from patients at stage C. Interferon-alpha and -beta induced the same degree of FAMP IC50 variation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

CD34 was expressed (> or = 20%) by leukemic cells from 45% of childhood and 43% of adult AML patients. CD34+ AML was often associated with M1/M2 morphology as well as the coexpression of CD7 and TdT.

MDS is a clonal malignant disorder which often involves a variety of immunologic abnormalities. Examination of the effects of IL-2 on MDS in vitro yielded the following results: (1) IL-2 did not induce the proliferation of blasts in most MDS cases. (2) The cytotoxicity of IL-2-induced lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells for cell lines and MDS blasts was reduced in the high-risk MDS group (refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation and MDS transformed to acute leukemia), but it was still preserved in the low-risk MDS group (refractory anemia (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts). However, considerable variation in LAK cell cytotoxicity was noted in each group. (3) The reduced LAK cell cytotoxicity observed in MDS was explained, at least in part, by the presence of a reduced of number of natural killer (NK) cells amongst the LAK cells. (4) MDS patients who have a high blood soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level often had defects in NK and CD8+ T cells. These in vitro findings suggest that the response to IL-2 is heterogeneous in MDS patients, and those who have a low-risk MDS subtype and/or a low blood sIL-2R level, may be prone to respond to IL-2 therapy.

In some cases, osteolytic lesions can be observed. Many of these clinical features, especially haematopoietic insufficiency and osteolytic lesions are likely to be caused by soluble factors, such as cytokines. There is evidence that these factors are produced by the malignant hairy cells themselves, suggesting a paracrine pathway. The importance of autocrine as well as paracrine growth loops in growth regulation of HCL-cells is supported by a series of excellent studies, performed within the last few years. It could be clearly shown that cytokines are involved in this autocrine and paracrine regulatory process. The most important cytokines which should be mentioned in this respect are tumor necrosis factor alpha, (TNF alpha). Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Interleukin-4 (IL-4), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and B-cell-growth factor (BCGF). The role of other factors such as viruses and oncogenes remains rather unclear. Nevertheless, recent data suggest that the c-fms, which encodes for the macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) may be involved in the pathophysiological control of HCL growth. In this review, we summarise the important data and studies performed recently which shed light on the complex network of autocrine and paracrine growth regulation of HCL.",,,,,,,,,

The gene is also rearranged in cases of secondary AML developing after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, especially topoisomerase II inhibitors. In at least one report, genomic analysis of this recombination site showed the breakpoint to be a topoisomerase II binding site and that exposure to the inhibitor could induce the rearrangement. If exposure induces the rearrangement of the gene, secondary ALL as well as secondary AML could occur after exposure to these agents, because the type of leukemias with rearranged HRX gene is not limited to AML.

A population-based nested case-control study of prenatal and neonatal risk factors for childhood myeloid leukemia was performed with the use of the Swedish National Cancer Register and the Swedish Birth Register. A total of 98 cases of myeloid leukemia were identified in successive birth cohorts from 1973 through 1989. From the Birth Register, five controls were matched to each case. Fourteen of the 98 cases with myeloid leukemia and none of the controls had Down syndrome [odds ratio (OR) = infinity; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 21.0-infinity]. The risk for myeloid leukemia also increased among children who had physiological jaundice (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.2-5.0; children who had been treated with phototherapy (OR = 7.5; 95% CI = 1.8-31.9); or who had been treated in an incubator (OR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.2-10.2). Excluding cases with Down syndrome, however, decreased these risks, so that their 95% lower confidence interval included the no-effect value. Maternal age < 20 years old (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.1-6.0), hypertension (OR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.2-5.0), Cesarean section (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.3-4.9), maternal smoking (OR = 2.4; 95% CI = 0.9-6.5), and being one of a multiple birth (OR = 3.6; 95% CI = 1.1-11.3) increased the risk for myeloid leukemia among those without Down syndrome. When the analyses were repeated, by restricting the cases to those with acute myeloid leukemia, the risk associated with young maternal age declined and became nonsignificant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

Treatment with peptide slightly slows down the rate of cellular proliferation and this effect becomes more evident in cells grown for several weeks in the presence of the effector. An enhanced effect (40-50% inhibition respect to the control) is found in reversibly permeabilized cells and after 1% DMSO is added to the medium. Moreover the presence of peptide markedly increases the percentage of cells differentiated by DMSO and RA. The effect in DMSO-induced cells is more evident than that observed in RA-induced cells. This in agreement with our hypothesis that DMSO facilitates the peptide entry and its effect is due to an intracellular action.,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Record linkage study. SETTING: Finland. SUBJECTS-1577 female and 187 male cabin attendants who had worked for the Finnish airline companies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Standardised incidence ratio; expected number of cases based on national cancer incidences. RESULTS: A significant excess of breast cancer (standardised incidence ratio 1.87 (95% confidence interval 1.15 to 2.23)) and bone cancer (15.10 (1.82 to 54.40)) was found among female workers. The risk of breast cancer was most prominent 15 years after recruitment. Risks of leukaemia (3.57 (0.43 to 12.9)) and skin melanoma (2.11 (0.43 to 6.15) were not significantly raised. Among men, one lymphoma and one Kaposi's sarcoma were found (expected number of cases 1.6). CONCLUSIONS: Although the lifestyle of cabin attendants is different from that of the reference population--for example, in terms of social status and parity--concentration of the excess risks to primary sites sensitive to radiation suggests that ionising radiation during flights may add to the cancer risk of all flight personnel. Otherwise the lifestyle of cabin attendants did not seem to affect their risks of cancer. Estimates of the effect of reproductive risk factors only partly explained the increased risk of breast cancer. If present estimates of health hazards due to radiation are also valid for cosmic radiation, then the radiation doses of cabin attendants seem too small to account entirely for the observed excess risk.",PMC2551425,,"['BMJ. 1996 Jan 6;312(7022):53; author reply 53-4.

Nevertheless, until the present investigation it has not been known if these contemporary methods are more sensitive at detecting reverse transcriptase activity. In our study, a non-isotopic ELISA method was shown to be considerably more sensitive than the radio-label technique at detecting reverse transcriptase in growth medium used to culture the murine breast cancer cell line GR/A. Using the ELISA, less reverse transcriptase activity was demonstrated in growth medium from human mammary adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells than the murine source. This ELISA did not detect reverse transcriptase activity from a pure source of Moloney murine leukaemia virus. In light of this, the broad applicability of this ELISA for reverse transcriptase from different viral sources must be investigated before it can be used to monitor biological supernatants for the presence of retroviruses.",,,,,,,,,

There were no deaths from VZV infection. Two risk factors noted to be associated with VZV infection were the presence of graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic transplants and leukemia as the underlying disease in autologous transplants.

Immunocompromised patients are at particularly high risk for candidemia. In patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, treatment with vancomycin and/or imipenem appears to be an independent risk factor for candidemia; colonization of stool by Candida species may be another important predisposing factor in these patients. Rapid detection of invasive candidemia in these high-risk patients is particularly important to the improvement of rates of survival. Methods for rapid detection, such as the measurement of mannan (the major cell-wall polysaccharide of Candida), may be useful for diagnosing invasive candidiasis and for monitoring the response of this infection to antifungal therapy. Further studies of risk factors and the development of new methods for rapid diagnosis and monitoring should help decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with nosocomial fungal infections.",,,,,,,,,

Morphologically, all 225 cells are large blast cells with basophilic cytoplasm containing no granules, large round nucleus containing 2-3 prominent nucleoli, and fine chromatin structure and a large nuclear/cytoplasm ratio.

The karyotype analysis of MHH225 cells revealed a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 7: del(7)(p13)-, a whole-arm translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 21: t(9;21)(q10;q10), and a chromosome 11 with an elongated long arm due to duplication of chromosome 11 material as well as to translocation of part of chromosome 9 onto 11q+. Also, chromosome 21 was deleted in some metaphases or showed a ring formation in other metaphases. Utrastructurally, MHH25 cells display a strong platelet peroxidase activity in the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum. The MHH25 cells have been grown exponentially without growth factors or conditioned media or serum only in RPMI1640 culture medium. None of the myelopoietic growth factors, i.e., interleukin-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, erythropoietin, or interleukin-6, has any effect on the proliferation and differentiation of MHH25 cells. The two, hematopoietic inhibitory cytokines, interferon-alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, have only minimal growth inhibitory effect. Stem cell factor showed only weak growth-stimulatory effect on MHH225 cells but significantly inhibited chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in these cells. The new cell line MHH225 should constitute a useful model for studying stem cell antigen (CD34)-positive human multilineage myeloid leukemia cells carrying a deletion in the short arm of chromosome 7 and an aberration in chromosome 11 and provide a unique tool for investigating human hematopoietic stem cell biology and its cytokine regulation in serum-free cultures.

Although the delay in the administration of T lymphocytes is expected to reduce the risk of severe GvHD, this risk is still present at higher doses of donor T-cells. The transfer of a suicide gene into donor lymphocytes could allow the in vivo selective elimination of cells responsible for severe GvHD. Additionally, under appropriate conditions, it may allow in vivo modulation of donor anti-tumor responses, and to separate GvL from GvHD. Finally, crucial questions concerning survival and function of donor lymphocytes could be answered by their gene marking. Previous studies documented that T lymphocytes are suitable targets for gene transfer through retroviral vectors (10, 11). This protocol has been designed to evaluate in the contest of allogeneic BMT: 1--the safety of increasing doses of donor lymphocytes transduced with a suicide retroviral vector; 2--the efficacy in terms of survival and immunologic potential of donor lymphocytes after in vitro activation, gene transduction, and immunoselection; 3--the possibility of in vivo down regulation of GvHD by the administration of ganciclovir to patients treated by tk-transduced donor lymphocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

Retroviral vectors proved to be a safe and efficient tool to transfer and express genes into satellite cells and their differentiated progeny, although muscle-specific regulation of the transferred gene is very difficult to achieve in a conventional vector framework. We modified a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-derived retroviral vector containing a bacterial beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) reporter gene by inserting a muscle creatinine kinase (MCK) enhancer element into the U3 region of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). The resulting vector (mLBSN) was transferred into cells of different histological origin, including undifferentiated murine and human myogenic cells, which were unable to express the transgene at detectable levels. Instead, gene expression from the modified LTR was obtained in a mouse myogenic cell line and in human primary satellite cells upon induction of differentiation into myotubes in culture, and correlated with the activation of the muscle differentiation program. beta-Gal-negative, mLBSN-transduced human satellite cells were also transplanted into the quadricep muscle of immunodeficient mice, where activation of the transgene expression was observed in vivo after differentiation and fusion into muscle fibers. These results show that retroviral vectors carrying LTRs modified in the enhancer sequences may be used to target tissue- and differentiation-specific gene expression into the muscle. For practical purposes, satellite cells engineered by muscle-specific retroviral vectors might represent an effective tool to deliver expression of a given gene product specifically into the muscle tissue, avoiding undesired protein accumulation in mononucleated cells. More generally, this type of vector might be useful whenever regulated expression of a transferred gene is necessary in a target cell or tissue.",,,,,,,,,

In [3H]oleic acid-labeled cells, both antigen (100 ng/ml) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (100 nM) produced a specific product of PLD activation, [3H]phosphatidylbutanol (PBut) in the presence of butanol. Pretreatment of cells with a selective PKC inhibitor, Ro31-8425 (1-5 microM) inhibited PMA-stimulated PLD activity by 85%. In contrast, the antigen-stimulated PLD activity was much less sensitive to the inhibitor. RBL-2H3 cells express PKC alpha, beta, delta, epsilon and zeta isozymes and down-regulation of PKC by exposure to PMA (20 nM) for 1-2 h caused rapid decrease in PKC alpha and beta isozymes, leaving PKC delta, epsilon and zeta isozymes intact. Apparent decreases in the levels of PKC alpha and beta to about 50% were observed after adding 20 nM PMA for 1 h, when PMA-stimulated PLD activity was inhibited by up to 70%. Decrease in antigen-stimulated PLD activity was evident after 2 h PMA-treatment, when PKC alpha and beta decreased by nearly 70%. These results suggest that in the antigen-mediated PLD pathway PKC may be implicated but not play such a great role as PMA-stimulated pathway which is mediated through PKC alpha or beta. Then, we have examined the involvement of calcium/calmodulin (CaM) in PLD activation by antigen, since the antigen-stimulated PLD activation showed the absolute requirement for extracellular calcium. Preincubation of RBL-2H3 cells with a CaM antagonist W-7 (20 microM) inhibited the antigen-stimulated PLD activity by 90%, but W-5, a chlorine-deficient analogue of W-7 that only weakly interact with CaM, caused little inhibitory effect. Another non-specific CaM antagonist, trifluoperazine (TFP) also inhibited PLD activation. These results suggest that calcium/CaM may be involved in the antigen-stimulated PLD activation.",,,,,,,,,

The sodium-independent, leucine-insensitive uptake of L-arginine measured in this study has been assigned by us previously to system y+ in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of cells with serum-free media containing epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha), or the protein kinase C (PKC) activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), stimulated system y+ arginine transport activity in Caco-2 cells. Transport upregulation by these growth factors or by TPA was blocked by cycloheximide or the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine. Arginine uptake was diminished during the course of differentiation, attributable to a reduction in the transport system y+ capacity (Vmax) with no change in apparent affinity (Km). TPA stimulated arginine uptake required at least 3 h of continual exposure, and increased the membrane's transport capacity (Vmax) in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells. TPA elevated the diminished transport Vmax of differentiated cells TPA to the elevated Vmax value associated with undifferentiated cells. We conclude that upregulation of arginine transport is part of a pleiotropic response to EGF/TGF alpha, and that this involves PKC and de novo synthesis of polypeptides associated with system y+ transport activity.",,,,,,,,,

In addition the incorporation of labeled AA in PL from THP-1 cells was compared to that in human monocytes. Measurements were done through HPLC separation of PL, detected by UV absorption and radioactivity, FA analysis by GC and characterization of PC subclasses by FAB-MS. Marked differences were observed in the incorporation of the two FA in cell PL, particularly two PC subclasses, and in the accumulation in individual PL after supplementation of THP-1 cells. Accumulation of AA and EPA in THP-1 cells appeared to be mutually independent. The incorporation of AA was also quite different in THP-1 from that in monocytes.

NMP-2 was shown to recognize two binding sites, site A (nt-605 to -599) and site B (nt -441 to -435), in the rat bone-specific osteocalcin gene promoter. This study shows that the NMP-2 binding sites A and B as well as a third NMP-2 binding site (nt -135 to -130) constitute a consensus sequence, ATGCTGGT, and represent an AML-1 recognition motif. AML-1 is a member of the AML transcription factor family which is associated with acute myelogenous leukemia and binds to the sequence TGCTGGT via its DNA-binding runt domain. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal that a component of NMP-2 is a member of the AML/PEBP2/runt domain transcription factor family based on cross-competition with AML-1 consensus oligonucleotide. Limited immunoreactivity of NMP-2 with a polyclonal N-terminal AML-1 antibody and inability of the AML-1 partner protein CBF-beta to form complexes with NMP-2 indicate that NMP-2 is not identical to AML-1 but represents a variant AML/PEBP2/runt domain protein. Western and Northern blots reveal the presence of multiple AML-related proteins and AML-1 transcripts in several osseous cell lines. Furthermore, our results indicate that AML family members may selectively partition between nuclear matrix and nonmatrix compartments. Because proteins that contain a runt domain are implicated in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation, our results support the concept that the nuclear matrix mediates osteoblast-specific expression of the osteocalcin gene.",,,,,,,,,

The sources of these Ca2+ signals are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent Ca2+ stores. Here we use a rapid perfusion apparatus to measure the release of 45Ca2+ from permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells to investigate the regulation of IP3-mediated Ca2+ release by cytosolic and luminal Ca2+. At 200 nM IP3, Ca2+ release was potentiated by an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. This potentiation by Ca2+ was nearly absent at 500 nM IP3. Previous studies in smooth muscle cells and neurons showed an inhibition of Ca2+ release above 300 nM Ca2+. In contrast, no such inhibition was observed in RBL cells. When assayed at low cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, IP3-mediated release was steeply dependent upon luminal Ca2+ concentration. At high luminal Ca2+ concentration, 1 microM IP3 released most of the stored Ca2+ even in the complete absence of cytosolic Ca2+. However, at high cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations (890 nM), IP3-mediated release was no longer steeply dependent upon the luminal Ca2+ concentration. Furthermore, high concentrations of BAPTA inhibited IP3-mediated release in the absence of cytosolic Ca2+. This suggests that a rapid and local luminal Ca2+ feedback is generated by luminal Ca2+ ions binding to cytosolic sites of the same channel or closely associated channels.

Moreover, investigations of antitumor activity in a standard tumor screen have revealed the highest efficiency for mer-[Ru(terpy)Cl3]. In a cell-free medium, the ruthenium complexes coordinate to DNA preferentially at guanine residues. The resulting adducts can terminate DNA synthesis by thermostable VentR DNA polymerase. The reactivity of the complexes to DNA, their efficiency to unwind closed, negatively supercoiled DNA, and a sequence preference of their DNA adducts (studied by means of replication mapping) do not show a correlation with biological activity. On the other hand, the cytotoxic mer-[Ru(terpy)Cl3] exhibits a significant DNA interstrand cross-linking, in contrast to the inactive complexes which exhibit no such efficacy.

Previous studies indicate that this may be related to locus-specific structural differences in certain enhancer elements. We have recently examined the 5' proximal regulatory regions of the A and B homologs in the higher non-human primates and found pronounced differences between the loci. Sequence analysis shows the B-promoters are more homogeneous, whereas the A-locus promoters are divergent among the various species examined. The differences in A- and B-promoters is exemplified by the regulatory element referred to as the IFN-responsive element (IRE). While the B-locus IRE is conserved among all primates examined, the A-locus IRE are divergent and reveal different sequences in the human/chimpanzee, gorilla and orang-utan. In reporter gene bioassays, the B-locus IRE exhibited an enhancer activity in response to induction with IFN-beta and IFN-gamma. In contrast, all the variants of the A-locus IRE found in hominoid primates were unresponsive to IFN. One base substitution shared by all the primate IREs proved to be inactivating. These results provide a molecular basis of how duplicated gene loci encoding structurally and functionally similar antigen-presenting molecules may become differentially responsive to physiological stimulus.",,,,,,,,,

Fractions were analyzed for stimulatory activity using [3H]thymidine incorporation in normal and leukemic (B-CLL) B cells as target cells. Activity was present in a 12 kDa protein peak. Upon storage this lost activity indicating that the factor was sensitive to air oxidation, a well-known property of mammalian thioredoxins (Trxs). Treatment of the inactive fraction with dithiothreitol restored full activity. When culture medium was analyzed with a radioimmunoassay for human placenta Trx, the MP6 clone was shown to release 30-50 ng/ml per million cells during 24 h. The B cell stimulatory activity of the MP6 medium was removed by Sepharose-bound anti-human placenta Trx IgG and activity was recovered by elution from the antibodies. Furthermore, MP6 medium showed Trx activity with NADPH and Trx reductase using an insulin disulfide reduction assay. Starting from 5 l of serum-free MP6 conditioned medium, the Trx was purified approximately 100,000-fold. After gel electrophoresis banding, the material was analyzed by peptide sequencing and a full length sequence of an 104 amino acid long protein was obtained.

Analysis of the first 462 transplants showed disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years to be approximately 40% in good-risk patients and 20% in poor-risk patients. Chronic myelogenous leukemia transplanted within the first year after diagnosis had 45% DFS.

Allogeneic sibling-donor marrow transplant may be the therapy of choice for younger patients early in the course of disease. Early transplant is an important influence on disease-free survival and relapse after related-donor transplant therapy, although additional patient characteristics influencing outcome can be identified and may have cumulative adverse effects. The 5-year disease-free survival of patients transplanted within one year of diagnosis and without signs of advanced disease is greater than 65%. Significant problems remain, however, including early mortality (primarily from infection, pneumonia, and pneumonitis) and relapse of CML following transplant, including late relapse occurring more than 5 years posttransplant. For patients without a matched, related donor, unrelated-donor marrow transplant may be a treatment option and can result in successful outcome for patients with CML. Relapse following unrelated-donor marrow transplant is rare. However, the use of an unrelated donor is associated with significant toxicity, including early mortality, engraftment failure, and ongoing morbidity and mortality associated with acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. For patients who lack an available matched-related or -unrelated donor, autologous marrow transplant has been developed as an alternative approach to therapy. Long-term survival following autologous marrow transplant is possible and may even approach the survival for allogeneic related-donor recipients, although cure of disease is not achieved.",,,,,,,,,

The improved retention properties of SM/cholesterol liposomes resulted in plasma vincristine levels 7-fold higher than in DSPC/cholesterol liposomes. The improved circulation lifetime of vincristine in SM/cholesterol liposomes correlated with increased vincristine accumulation in peritoneal ascitic murine P388 tumours and in subcutaneous solid A431 human xenograft tumours. Increased vincristine delivery to tumours was also accompanied by increased anti-tumour efficacy. Treatment with SM/cholesterol liposomal formulations of vincristine resulted in greater than 50% cures in mice bearing ascitic P388 tumours, an activity that could not be achieved with the DSPC/cholesterol formulation. Similarly, treatment of mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) bearing solid human A431 xenograft tumours with SM/cholesterol vincristine formulations delayed the time required for 100% increase in tumour mass to > 40 days, compared with 5 days, 7 days and 14 days for mice receiving no treatment or treatment with free vincristine or DSPC/cholesterol formulations of vincristine respectively.",PMC2034038,,,,,,,,

The metabolites we measured, thioguanine nucleotides and methylmercaptopurines, are products of two competing metabolic pathways and would be expected to show an inverse correlation. A total of 327 children from 17 centres in the UK were studied. All were on the same therapeutic schedule of mercaptopurine. All had been on an unattenuated full protocol-directed dose (at least 75 mg m-2) for a minimum of 7 days before assay. There was a very wide variation in the concentration of the two metabolites measured; the thioguanine nucleotides ranged from 0 to 1255 pmol per 8 x 10(8) red cells (median 289, lower quartile 210, upper quartile 377) and the methylmercaptopurine metabolites ranged from 0 to 46.3 nmol per 8 x 10(8) red cells (median 5.18, lower quartile 2.31, upper quartile 11.59). The anticipated negative correlation was not apparent, but the ratio between the two was not randomly distributed. No child had both metabolite concentrations in the upper quartiles, but in 32 (10%) children the concentration of both metabolites was in the lower quartile. Of the 32, only one metabolite was detected in four and none at all in six. The most likely explanation for these findings is that a minority of children with lymphoblastic leukaemia fail to take oral mercaptopurine either totally or intermittently. The extent of the problem is unknown, but we suspect it may be clinically important in at least 10% of patients.",PMC2034028,,,,,,,,

Detection of specific chromosomal abnormalities at diagnosis identifies patients who are at risk of failing to achieve remission, as well as those who are likely to have short, intermediate, or prolonged disease-free intervals after successful remission induction.

Molecular studies were performed on parental persistently infected cells (Dami-P), as well as on derived clones (Dami-Cl). We report that in these nonlytic and non-HFV producer cells, viral DNA was found to be integrated into the cellular genome and that the few free proviral forms detected in Dami-P cells were deleted in their 5' LTR. Our molecular analysis indicates the presence of undeleted 5' LTR forms in the integrated provirus within a proviral population mainly composed of deleted forms. In addition, the deletion in the bel1 trans-activator gene, previously described by Saib et al., was found to be highly predominant. However, in 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine treated Dami-Cl cultures, virus production occurred, providing evidence for the presence of complete viral genome. Analysis of HFV expression in Dami-Cl cells, by Northern blot and immunoprecipitation, shows that the most striking difference between cytolytic and persistent HFV infection was the lack of expression of structural viral proteins, in contrast with Bet protein expression, which is maintained. Our data suggest that the Bet protein could be involved in the maintenance of viral persistency and that the persistently infected Dami system provides a suitable model for clarifying its function.",,,,,,,,,

When a potential was applied in the range 0-1.0 V relative to a saturated calomel electrode, an anodic peak current appeared at around 0.33 V. This peak current, attributed to serotonin, increased with time, and the maximum current (0.5 microA) was obtained 20-25 min of incubation. The response of the RBL-1 cells was specific to the protein fraction of wheat. The peak current increased linearly with increasing protein concentration in the range of 0.01-0.5 micrograms ml-1.

DESIGN: Retrospective medical chart review. SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS: Eighty pediatric patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation for a variety of refractory malignant neoplasms or lymphohematopoietic disorders at the Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC, from April 1, 1988, to September 30, 1993. INTERVENTION: Diagnostic surgical biopsies, surgical debridement, and treatment with amphotericin B. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Resolution of AS and discharge from the hospital. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients had screening sinus radiographs, 27 of which showed abnormalities. Aspergillus sinusitis developed in three of the patients with abnormal screening radiographs. Fifty-eight patients had screening nasal cultures. One culture was positive for Aspergillus, and histopathologically proved AS developed in this patient. Twelve diagnostic biopsies were done in nine patients. Three biopsy specimens showed histopathologic evidence of AS. The three patients with AS were successfully treated with aggressive surgical and medical therapy and were discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSION: The incidence of AS was 4% (3/80) in the patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation. Screening radiographs, while not a good predictor of AS, have a role in evaluation of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation to define preexisting sinus disease. Screening nasal cultures do not reliably predict AS. When AS is suspected and diagnostic biopsy is considered, the seven clinical criteria outlined in this article should be used. Survival of immunocompromised patients with AS requires early diagnosis and aggressive surgical and medical therapy.",,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to determine the presumptive value of nuclear pattern to correctly allocate each isolated cell to each of the five patients. The cells were examples of five histogenetically different tumors, all undifferentiated and with a close microscopic resemblance to one another. High gradient structures (heterochromatin-euchromatin and nuclear membrane edges) were estimated by a difference-of-boxes filter, and pattern spectrum decomposition was obtained by successive openings and closings performed on the input gray tone image. One important feature of these procedures was that no prior selection by thresholding of the structures to be studied was required, thus obviating subjective bias. Percentages of correctly allocated cells by canonical analysis ranged from 70.0% (rhabdomyosarcoma) to 92.9% (Ewing's sarcoma). Although the five cases could be distinguished using seven texture variables, this does not imply generalization of the results for the differential diagnosis of these tumors. Nonetheless, the possibility that undifferentiated small round cells present distinctive nuclear patterns when studied by sensitive image analysis techniques is suggested by our results.",,,,,,,,,

The function of these structures remains elusive. We and others have shown recently that they represent specific targets for adenovirus and herpes simplex virus. This prompted us to investigate whether PML, like SP100, might be induced by IFN and to explore the role of PML in viral infection. Here we report that PML mRNA levels increase rapidly in response to interferon treatment. This accumulation of PML transcripts is a primary IFN response since it does not require de novo protein synthesis. The IFN-induced activation of the PML gene is accompanied by enhanced protein expression as revealed by immunolabelling. Both the intensity of the staining and the number of labelled structures increased upon interferon exposure. To probe the role of PML in IFN action, we compared the antiviral state established by alpha-interferon in embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) derived from null mutant mice for PML and from wild-type control mice. The resistance to viral infection conferred by IFN-alpha was identical in both PML+/+ and PMLm/m fibroblasts indicating that PML is not an essential mediator of the antiviral effect of interferon. We also noted that DNA-binding factors are normally activated by IFN in PMLm/m cells.",,,,,,,,,

During the asymptomatic period, perturbation of T cell differentiation occurs in the thymus. The major anomalies present during this phase are an increase in the percentage of large thymocytes lacking CD4 and CD8 markers and also of small thymocytes express both the T cell marker CD3 and the B cell-specific form of CD45. These abnormal T cell populations can be clonal and thus a primary result of aberrant expression of the LIM-protein Rbtn2 is alteration of T cell differentiation preceding overt malignancy.

In light of a growing body of evidence for the Abl kinase as a negative regulator of cell death, we sought to determine whether Abl expression could protect against Fas-mediated cell death. To address this question, we utilized two separate strategies. In the first, we expressed human Fas in K562, a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, which constitutively expresses bcr-abl and examined the effects of Fas ligation in these cells. Fas-positive K562 transformants (K562.Fas) were found to be protected against Fas-mediated cell death. However, down-regulation of Bcr-Abl protein levels in K562.Fas cells using antisense oligonucleotides targeted to bcr-abl mRNA rendered these cells highly susceptible to Fas-induced death. In the second approach we utilized a Fas-positive HL-60 cell line, which we transfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Abl. HL-60.v-Ablts transfectants were found to be protected from Fas-induced apoptosis at the permissive but not the restrictive temperature for the Abl kinase. Taken together, these observations identify the Abl kinase as a negative regulator of Fas-mediated cell death. Since Abl was also found to block apoptosis mediated by ceramide, a recently proposed downstream effector of the apoptotic pathway initiated by Fas, we propose that Abl exerts its protective effects downstream of the early Fas-initiated signaling events.",,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We administered rhG-CSF (filgrastim) 16 micrograms/kg subcutaneously for 4 days in five normal subjects (age 18-31, M = 3, F = 2), previously selected as HLA-identical donors of siblings with leukemia. All the donors gave written informed consent. On days 4 and 5 (in one donor on day 6 too), 10:l leukapheretic collection was performed with a CS-3000 (Baxter) or an AS-104 (Fresenius) cell separator through the antecubital vein. RESULTS: The WBC count reached a median peak of 57.0 x 10(9)/L on day 5. The peripheral blood CFU-GM peaked to a median level of 8908/mL on day 5 with a median increase over baseline values of 39.1 times. The CD34+ cells peaked to (median) 147.0 x 10(6)/L on day 4 with a median increase of 65.3 times. A lesser enrichment was recorded for BFU-E (median increase 12.7 times) and CFU-GEMM (median increase 15.2 times). Even CD3+ and CD56+CD3- cells increased (median 1.7 and 1.5 times, respectively). A median of 771 x 10(8) MNC (range 672-1378), 116.4 x 10(6) CFU-GM (range 47.7-145.1) and 754 x 10(6) CD34+ cells (range 477-2599) were apheretically collected. Concerning side effects, mild to moderate back pain and general minor discomfort were reported by all donors. The platelet level regularly but transiently decreased after completion of the apheretic procedures with a median nadir of 69 x 10(9)/L (range 43-126) on (median) day 7, but in no case did thrombocytopenia cause bleeding.

CONCLUSIONS: rhG-CSF 16 micrograms/kg x 4 days is an efficient schedule for PBSC mobilization in healthy donors, but lower doses and even a single apheresis procedure might prove similarly adequate.",,,,,,,,,

After calcitriol-mediated differentiation (72 h, measured by CD 14 expression) mRNA expression was further enhanced by PMA (45-fold), dexamethasone (15-fold), oestradiol (3.7-fold), testosterone (2.5-fold) and androstenedione (3.5-fold). Forskolin, cAMP and follicle stimulating hormone had no stimulatory effect. Oestradiol formation from testosterone (oestradiol radioimmunoassay in culture supernatants) increased to > 2000 pg/ml/10(6) cells/24 h after PMA-stimulation, mirrored mRNA expression and was suppressed below 10% of original values in the presence of 4-OH-androstenedione.

In addition, the conditioned media of Meg-01, but not Dami, contained a potent fibroblast-stimulating activity which could be neutralized by bFGF antibodies.

The thymocytes expressing ICT-1 antigen appear after the 18th week of gestation during fetal development. Since the distribution pattern of the ICT-1 antigen within thymus partly overlaps with that of the CD1 antigens, we investigated whether ICT-1 was one of the CD1 antigen family. However, the failure of anti-ICT-1 antibody to react with mouse L cells transfected with cDNA of CD1a, -b, and -c and the different histologic distribution patterns from that of CD1d strongly suggest that the anti-ICT-1 antibody recognizes an antigen distinct from CD1. Furthermore, ICT-1 is also expressed in human neuroglial cells such as oligodendroglioma, glioblastoma multiforme, Ewing's sarcoma, and cerebellar astrocyte.

Therefore, we examined whether the posttransplant BM microenvironment is deficient in supporting the proliferation and/or differentiation of B-cell precursors. BM stromal cell cultures were established from patients who received allogeneic or autologous BMT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These cultures were then compared with normal donor BM stromal cell cultures for expression of adhesion molecules and the capacity to support the adhesion and interleukin-7 (IL-7)-dependent growth of normal B-cell precursors. Analysis of BM stromal cell cultures established from 28 BMT recipients showed a significantly reduced expression of cell surface vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1/CD106), compared with normal donor BM stromal cells. Transplant BM stromal cell CD106 expression was responsive to regulatory cytokines in a manner qualitatively comparable with normal donor BM stromal cells. The level of B-cell precursor adhesion to transplant BM stromal cells correlated with the level of CD106 expression. Of 19 evaluable transplant BM stromal cell cultures, eight exhibited a reduced capacity to support the growth of CD19+/light chain- normal B-cell precursors. The capacity of transplant BM stromal cells to support B-cell precursor growth correlated with the level of CD106 expression, and the level of B-cell precursor adhesion. Our collective results may provide new mechanistic insight into why B-cell recovery is delayed post-BMT and underscore the importance of VCAM-1/CD106 in regulating B lymphopoiesis.",,,,,,,,,

The receptors for GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 each possess a cytokine specific alpha subunit, but all three share a common beta chain. Using an immunoblotting system designed to detect phosphotyrosine containing proteins and a permeabilized cell system to detect rapid changes in phosphate turnover on proteins, we show that while GM-CSF and IL-3 use tyrosine phosphorylation to mediate mitogenic signal transduction, IL-5 uses tyrosine dephosphorylation in its signaling pathway. The use of different signaling pathways by these cytokines can be confirmed in a biologic system whereby the proliferation induced in culture by GM-CSF and IL-3 is inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but that induced by IL-5 is enhanced. Conversely, GM-CSF- and IL-3-induced proliferation is stimulated by a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, yet IL-5-induced proliferation is inhibited. Inhibitors of protein kinase C inhibit IL-3- and GM-CSF-, but not IL-5-induced proliferation. We suggest that, because all these cytokines share the identical beta chain of their receptors, the cytokine specific alpha chain mediates the linkage of each receptor to the individual biochemical signal transduction pathways responsible for the different biologic activities of these cytokines.",,,,,,,,,

Group II patients were given immunoselected blood and bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells. One to 6 weeks before bone marrow transplantation (BMT), PBPCs from HLA-identical and MLC- sibling donors were mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (5 micrograms/kg twice daily subcutaneously) for 5 days. Aphereses were performed at days 4 and 5 of G-CSF application. CD34+ cells were separated from the pooled PBPC concentrates by immunoadsorption onto avidin with the biotinylated anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody 12.8 and then stored in liquid nitrogen. BM was procured on the day of transplantation. Patients were conditioned with either busulfan (16 mg/kg) or total body irradiation (12 Gy) followed by cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg). Cyclosporin A and short methotrexate were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. After transplantation, all patients received 5 micrograms G-CSF/kg/d from day 1 until greater than 500 neutrophils/microL were reached and 150 U erythropoietin/kg/d from day 7 until erythrocyte transfusion independence for 7 days.

A matched historical control group (n = 12) transplanted with a mean of 5.2 x 10(6) CD34+ and 156 x 10(5) CD3+ cells/kg from BM alone was assembled for comparison. In group I, the median time to neutrophil recovery to > 100, > 500, and > 1,000/microL was 12, 15, and 17 days, respectively. Patients from group II reached these neutrophil levels at days 13, 15 and 17 post BMT. Neutrophil recovery in the control patient group occurred at days 17, 18, and 20 respectively. Group I patients were given platelet transfusions within 18 days and red blood cells within 10 days, whereas for group II patients, these time points were 26 and 17 days, respectively. These same transfusions could be ceased within 38 and 24 days, respectively, in control patients. The addition of about 2% more peripheral blood CD3+ cells (group I patients) did not result in higher grades of acute GVHD (median grade II) as compared with the controls (median grade II).

To determine the therapeutic efficacy of an abbreviated treatment regimen, 26 patients with newly-diagnosed highly aggressive lymphomas, 17 of them belonging to the International Working Formulation (IWF) group I and 9 with Burkitt's lymphoma (IWF J), were entered in a study using short-term weekly chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Besides histology, requirements for entry into to the study were age between 16 and 60 years, stage 1 bulky disease and elevated LDH or stage II to IV disease with or without bulk or elevated LDH, and an absence of HIV infection or CNS involvement at diagnosis. The treatment plan was 12 weeks of MACOP-B or VACOP-B chemotherapy followed by high dose therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation in first complete remission. RESULTS: Twenty patients (76%), 16 (62%) of those on MACOP-B or VACOP-B, 1 who had received 2 cycles of ProMACE-CytaBOM prior to MACOP-B and 3 after a first salvage regimen, achieved complete remissions. Seventeen patients (65%) were transplanted in first remission, and 15 (58%) after induction treatment with only MACOP-B or VACOP-B. Reasons for not being given high dose therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) were failure to achieve complete remission in 6 patients, early relapse in 2 and severe pulmonary toxicity associated with chemotherapy in 1. The median time of follow-up was 45 months. At 3 years, the estimated event-free survival was 31% (CI 14%-50%) and the overall survival 48% (CI 25%-67%). There were no deaths from toxic effects of treatment. Pretreatment factors associated with relapse were stage III or IV disease, age over 30 years and bone marrow involvement. Logrank analysis showed that age was the only factor significantly associated with poor event-free survival. CONCLUSION: Short-term weekly chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy with the CBV regimen in first remission is not a higly effective treatment for advanced lymphoblastic and Burkitt's lymphomas. The 30% rate of failure to achieve partial remission after 6 weeks and/or complete response after 12 weeks of MACOP-B or VACOP-B treatment, as well as the 42% failure rate to undergo ABMT in first remission, suggest that more aggressive chemotherapy should be used in the beginning.",,,,,,,,,

Prior to and following cytokine priming, the sensitivity of cells to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) at concentrations ranging from 10(-12) to 10(-4) M was assessed in clonogenic culture. In addition, the initial percentage of AML cells in S phase was assessed and their subsequent kinetic response to cytokine treatment evaluated by FACScan analysis. Light-density marrow cells (LDMCs) from 19 AML patients were initially T-cell and monocyte depleted in order to remove potential sources of endogenous cytokine production prior to in vitro investigation. LDMCs were incubated in liquid phase for 7 d in a chemically defined complete medium with or without cytokines. Clonogenic data from fresh AML LDMCs not pretreated with growth factors demonstrated a heterogenous response to Ara-C. In only 4/15 marrows tested clonogenically was there any improvement in sensitivity to Ara-C following cytokine priming. S-phase data on all 19 marrows were similarly variable either before or after cytokine preincubation. There was no discernible correlation between clonogenic and kinetic data, nor could any relationship be established between in vitro findings and the FAB subtypes of patients or clinical outcomes. In summary, it would appear that the cell-cycle status of AML cells is likely to be only one of many contributory factors governing the sensitivity of AML progenitors to Ara-C. The clinical response of AML patients to cytokine therapy in association with cell-cycle-specific cytotoxic agents may therefore be variable and unpredictable.",,,,,,,,,

In addition, we have identified pp90rsk as one of the H7 sensitive protein kinases critical for primary response gene expression induced by IL-11. Furthermore, activation of 3CH134 (a MAP kinase phosphatase) gene by IL-11 suggested that a MAP kinase phosphatase may be involved in IL-11-mediated signal transduction. Our data also suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat91 and related transcriptional factors is involved in IL-11 signaling but is not sufficient for the activation of primary response genes such as JunB, tis11, tis8 and MAP kinase phosphatase in mouse preadipocytes.

For identification of megakaryocytes we used the PAS stain and CD61 to calculate the subfraction of precursors (pro- and megakaryoblasts). Demonstration of macrophages and their different subsets was carried out by PG-M1 (CD68) and the GSA-1 lectin. The erythroid precursors were stained by Ret40f (anti-glycophorin C). Density of argyrophilic (reticulin plus collagen) fibers was determined by applying Gomori's silver impregnation method. Clinical variables like state of hematological response to IFN administration, age, spleen and liver size, myeloblasts plus promyelocytes, basophils as well as basophils and eosinophils exerted a predictive capacity by univariate statistical analysis. However, when entering these factors into previously published risk models, i.e., the so-called Sokal score and its modifications, to assess subgroups with different survival patterns or relative risk groups, a clear-cut discrimination was not feasible. Bone marrow features of prognostic value consisted of megakaryocytes and their precursors, fibers, and pro- and erythroblasts. Only when including histological variables into a formerly reported Cox model, could a significant separation of patients into the different categories or relative risk groups be computated. In conclusion, the present data emphasize the prognostic impact of histological parameters to be considered in all clinical trials on CML.",,,,,,,,,

Screening of a human genomic library and Southern blot analysis revealed that these sequences are of endogenous origin. ERV-MLN represents a multicopy family of human endogenous retroviral elements (HERVs) with two closely related copies and up to 20 more distantly related members. In contrast, ERV-FRD and ERV-FTD comprise only one copy and five to seven related elements per haploid human genome. DNA sequence analysis of the proviral pol region of ERV-MLN revealed an uninterrupted stretch of 241 amino acids that shows 65% identity with the RT of the type B-related HERV designated HERV-K10. ERV-FRD and ERV-FTD are defective type C-related HERVs. The pol gene of ERV-FRD displays a nucleotide homology of 54% to the gibbon ape leukemia virus, and the pol gene of ERV-FTD is about 67% homologous to members of the RTVL-I family of HERVs. Our results thus indicate that the retroviral particles released by the breast cancer cell line T47-D are probably generated by complementation of several endogenous proviruses and can package retroviral transcripts of different origins.",PMC189540,"['GENBANK/U27240', 'GENBANK/U27241', 'GENBANK/U27242']",,,,,,,

Randomized clinical trials have been used to evaluate both clinical results and total medical costs associated with new agents. With new expensive pharmaceutical agents, early assessments of economic benefit have taken on greater importance to physicians and patients. Who should provide financial support to these integrated economic and clinical analyses in clinical trials? Here we describe issues that hinder funding of economic analyses and propose potential support mechanisms. RESULTS: The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), a large, national cooperative group of academic and community hospitals in the United States, designed a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment trial to compare two widely used supportive care regimens that varied 20-fold in cost. One important objective of this trial was to compare the cost-effectiveness of the two regimens. While funding for the clinical trial was supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute and the pharmaceutical companies involved in the trial, no specific funding agency was willing and/or able to provide financial support for the economic analyses. After 2 years of planning, the clinical trial was retracted when the funding for the economic analyses could not be secured. The prisoner's dilemma, individual reluctance to support a common social good, explains the lack of funding. CONCLUSION: Economic theory predicts difficulties in evaluating cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals and reluctance to support economic analyses of clinical trials. Economic analyses will require new sources of funds that will not take scarce resources from clinical trials groups. Options for funding include a new federal agency, coordinated work by existing agencies, or academic centers for economic analysis.",,,['J Clin Oncol. 1996 Mar;14(3):1042-3. PMID: 8622010'],,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors and a maximum of one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease were eligible if they had a performance status of 0 to 1 and normal renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function. Prior treatment with taxanes or comptothecin analogs, and prior pelvic irradiation were not allowed. Patients with a history of cardiac disease or on medications known to affect cardiac conduction were excluded. The dose of topotecan was fixed at 1.0 mg/m2/d for 5 days. The dose of paclitaxel was escalated until the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), without and with filgrastim 5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously (SC) on days 6 to 14, was reached. Paclitaxel was administered over 3 hours on day 1 before topotecan. Treatment cycles were repeated every 21 days. RESULTS: Of 46 patients entered, 45 were assessable for toxicity and 34 for response. The principal toxicity was neutropenia. Without filgrastim, the MTD of paclitaxel was 80 mg/m2 on day 1 in combination with topotecan 1.0 mg/m2/d for 5 days. With filgrastim, the dose of paclitaxel was escalated to 230 mg/m2 in combination with the same dose of topotecan. At this dose level, one patient had hematologic DLT and a second patient developed neuromuscular DLT. Three patients had a partial response (PR): one with head and neck cancer, a second with non-small-cell lung cancer, and the third with colon cancer. CONCLUSION: We conclude that paclitaxel can be given at clinically relevant doses in combination with topotecan and filgrastim. The recommended dose for phase II studies is paclitaxel 230 mg/m2 on day 1 and topotecan 1.0 mg/m2/day for 5 days with filgrastim 5 micrograms/kg on days 6 to 14.",,,,,,,,,

By two-dimensional electrophoresis, the protein expressed in the mast cells was of a size (40 kDa) and pI (6.9) predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence. Thus, although previously shown to be preferentially expressed in T cells and B cells, the phosphatase is also found in mast cells. By immunofluorescence microscopy, rat hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase localized to discrete, globular compartments within the cytoplasm and was not found either in the nucleus or associated with the cell surface membrane. Aggregation of high affinity IgE receptors in the mast cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the phosphatase. The tyrosine phosphorylation was mimicked by stimulation with calcium ionophore A23187 but not by direct activation of protein kinase C. Since phosphorylation of the phosphatase was dramatically reduced when the cells were activated in Ca(2+)-free media, it is dependent on a rise in intracellular Ca2+. These data strongly suggest that hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase may be involved in the IgE receptor-mediated signaling cascade.",,['GENBANK/U28356'],,,,,,,

K562 and MV3 cells lacked alpha v beta 3 expression and adhered to fibronectin through alpha 5 beta 1. Mel57 cells adhered through alpha v beta 3 and alpha 5 beta 1. A recombinant fibronectin polypeptide, containing five type III repeats from the central cell binding domain 3Fn6-10, and a mutated polypeptide lacking the synergy site were equally effective in promoting Mel57 adhesion. For K562 and MV3, the mutated polypeptide was not or poorly active compared to the control polypeptide. Expression of alpha v beta 3 in MV3 induced strong adhesion to the mutated polypeptide. TS2/16 stimulatory beta 1-integrin antibodies or Mn2+ induced alpha 5 beta 1-mediated adhesion of K562 and MV3 to GRGDSP. In the presence of TS2/16 or Mn2+, alpha 5 beta 1-mediated MV3 adhesion to the mutated polypeptide was equally strong as adhesion to the control polypeptide.

Abnormally tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates of the Bcr/Abl kinase in Ph-positive cells are likely to contribute to leukemogenesis by interfering with normal signal transduction pathways. We have previously shown that the adaptor molecule Crkl is a major in vivo substrate for the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase, and it is thought to connect Bcr/Abl with downstream effectors. In the current study, a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa was identified which binds only to the Crkl Src homology 2 (SH2) domain in cells, including Ph-positive patient material, containing an active Bcr/Abl protein. We demonstrate here that this protein is Cbl, originally discovered as an oncogene which induces B-cell and myeloid leukemias in mice. The Crkl SH2 domain binds specifically to Cbl. The Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of Crkl do not bind to Cbl, but do bind Bcr/Abl. These findings suggest the existence of a trimolecular complex involving Bcr/Abl, Crkl, and Cbl and are consistent with a model in which Crkl mediates the oncogenic signal of Bcr/Abl to Cbl.",,,,,,,,,

The method is based on paraformaldehyde fixation followed by staining of F-actin and DNA with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-phalloidin and propidium iodide (PI), respectively. Bivariate green fluorescence (F-actin) vs. side scatterplots of HL-60 cells treated with 10 microM etoposide for 4 h showed two cell populations, one with high green fluorescence and low side scatter and one with low green fluorescence and high side scatter. Sorting revealed cells with intact nuclei in the high green fluorescence/low side scatter population and cells with fragmented nuclei in the low green fluorescence/high side scatter population, demonstrating that the cells in the latter population were apoptotic. Exposure of HL-60 cells to 10 microM etoposide for 4 h resulted in S-phase selective apoptosis, whereas 5 micrograms/ml cycloheximide initiated apoptosis mainly in G0/G1-phase and S-phase cells. The apoptotic response of HL-60 cells to 20 GY gamma-irradiation was selective for S-phase and G2 + M-phase cells. The present method offers the opportunity to estimate the cell cycle distributions of both the apoptotic and the nonapoptotic cell populations, which is especially valuable when apoptosis occurs in association with cell cycle perturbations. A similar shift from one to two cell populations in green fluorescence vs. side scatter-plots, similar to that observed for HL-60 cells, was observed in the THP-1 and U-937 cell lines secondary to etoposide treatment.",,,,,,,,,

Expression of MDR1 is common in AML and has been linked to lower remission induction rates and decreased remission durations. Because MDR1 efflux function may be modified by drugs such as cyclosporin A, accurate identification of MDR1+/efflux+ AML cases will be critical to identify patients who may benefit from therapies that contain such MDR1 modulators. We have optimized single and multiparameter flow cytometric assays to detect efflux of drugs or fluorescent dyes by previously cryopreserved AML blasts. These assays allowed precise identification of efflux by leukemic blasts, and correlation with CD34 and MDR1 expression. We subsequently studied a series of 60 previously untreated AML cases. Functional efflux was identified in 39 cases and was significantly correlated with MDR1 expression (P = .0002). However, discrepant cases were identified; 10 cases were efflux+ without significant MDR1 expression, whereas 6 MDR1+ cases were efflux-. There was also a highly significant correlation of efflux with CD34; 31 (79%) of the 39 efflux+ cases were CD34+ in comparison with only 5 (24%) of the 21 efflux- cases (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis showed that efflux was significantly associated with independent effects of both CD34 (P = .0011) and MDR1 expression (P = .034); the majority of efflux+ cases were CD34+, whereas 5 of the 6 MDR1+ efflux- cases lacked CD34 expression. Cyclosporin A blocked efflux in all but 2 cases regardless of MDR1 expression. Functional efflux in AML is frequently detected without the classic MDR1+ phenotype indicating that alternate non-MDR1-mediated efflux mechanisms may be important. Efflux assays may better identify patients who would benefit from therapies that include efflux modulators.",,,,,,,,,

Using a monoclonal antibody directed against the laminin-like domain of perlecan, we have recently shown that perlecan is widely expressed in all lymphoreticular systems. To investigate further this observation we have studied the expression of perlecan in two human leukemic cell lines. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR, ribonuclease protection assay, and metabolic labeling we detected significant perlecan expression in the multipotential cell line K562, originally derived from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia. In contrast, the promyelocytic cell line HL-60 expressed perlecan at barely detectable levels. These results were intriguing because the K562 cells do not assemble or produce a classical basement membrane. Following induction with either sodium butyrate or the phorbol diester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), K562 and HL-60 differentiate into early progenitor cells with erythroid or megakaryocytic properties, respectively. Following treatment of K562 and HL-60 cells with either of these agents, perlecan expression was markedly increased in K562 cells. In contrast, we could detect perlecan protein synthesis in HL-60 cells only at very low levels, even after induction with TPA or sodium butyrate. Collectively, these results indicate that perlecan is actively synthesized by bone marrow derived cells and suggest that this proteoglycan may play a role in hematopoietic cell differentiation.",,,,,,,,,

Our earlier studies showed that such SEA-directed T cells efficiently killed chronic B lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. With the ultimate goal to replace the natural specificity of SEA for MHC class II molecules with the specificity of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), we initially made a mutated protein A-SEA (PA-SEAm) fusion protein with > 100-fold reduced binding affinity for MHC class II compared to native SEA. The fusion protein was successfully used to direct T cells to B-CLL cells coated with different B lineage specific (CD19, CD20) or associated (CD37, CD40) mAbs. The PA-SEAm protein was 10-100-fold more potent against mAb coated compared to uncoated HLA class II+ B-CLL cells. No correlation was seen between the amount of mAb bound to the cell surface and sensitivity to lysis. Preactivation of B-CLL cells by phorbol ester increased their sensitivity, and lysis was dependent on ICAM-1 molecules. However, no preactivation of the target cells was needed when a cocktail of two or four mAbs was used. Circulating leukemia and spleen cells were equally well killed. We conclude that the natural target specificity of SEA, MHC class II, can be reduced by mutagenesis and novel binding specificity can be introduced by linkage to tumor reactive mAbs. Our findings encourage the construction of recombinant SEA mutant fusion proteins for specific T cell therapy of hematopoietic tumors such as B-CLL.",,,,,,,,,

Those under 36 achieving a complete remission and with an histocompatible donor were assigned to a transplant arm. The rest were randomized to receive one of three consolidation arms: A, cytosine arabinoside, 200 mg/m2 daily for 7 days and daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 daily for 3 days for three courses; B, one course as in Arm A followed by amsacrine, 120 mg/m2 daily for 5 days followed by a 5-day continuous infusion of azacytidine, 150 mg/m2/day; C, thioguanine and cytosine arabinoside, 100 mg/m2 every 12 h and daunorubicin 10 mg/m2 daily for 5 days for three courses followed by four maintenance courses of cytosine arabinoside, 100 mg/m2 daily for 5 days and daunorubicin, 45 mg/m2 for 2 days every 13 weeks. From 1981 to 1986, 398 eligible patients were enrolled and 219 achieved a complete remission. The initial induction dose of cytosine arabinoside was reduced after five of 29 patients exhibited fatal gastrointestinal toxicity. Only 11 patients were assigned to the transplant arm. There were no significant differences in the consolidation arms. The 5 year disease-free survivals were 38, 31 and 27% in arms A, B, and C respectively. Intensive consolidation therapy with the same or different drugs used in induction was as effective as lower dose consolidation followed by maintenance therapy.",,,,,,,,,

Functional properties of peripheral blood neutrophils from a patient with APL during treatment with ATRA have been studied. Wright stain of patient neutrophils showed hypogranulation and loose nuclear chromatin when compared with normal neutrophils. These cells were of lower density than normal neutrophils and separated on density gradient centrifugation with mononuclear cells. Surface antigen expression by FACS distinguished these cells from lymphocytes. The histograms showed a population of larger cells expressing CD18 and CD11b, distinct from the smaller cells which did not express CD11b. fMLP caused an increase in intracellular calcium (measured spectrophotometrically) that was inhibited by the calcium chelator BAPTA. Actin polymerization following cell activation was measured using NBD-phallacidin staining and FACS. Both IL-8 and fMLP caused rapid increases using F-actin content (2.5-3.0 fold), which were of greater magnitude than generally seen with normal neutrophils. Treatment with BAPTA before activation with fMLP did not blunt the actin responses, despite complete inhibition of an intracellular calcium increase. In summary, neutrophils derives from differentiated APL cells express CD18/CD11b, and exhibit a similar degree of actin polymerization in response to fMLP and IL-8, independent of an increase in intracellular calcium. Although the actin responses are greater than normal neutrophils, most properties are similar, supporting the contention that these cells can protect the host. The exaggerated actin response to inflammatory mediators, however, may play a role in the 'retinoic acid syndrome'.",,,,,,,,,

In the present work, we explore quantitatively the relationship between aggregation of the receptors and one of the earliest biochemical changes this initiates. We compare the time course of aggregate formation, inferred from studies of the binding of dimers of IgE, and the time course of phosphorylation of tyrosines on receptor subunits when the receptors are aggregated.

In this study, sinusoids in 12 hepatoblastomas, of various subtypes, and in normal liver were investigated with UEA-1 and antibodies against von Willebrand's factor, CD31 and CD34 to detect differences of possible diagnostic significance. In the normal liver, staining of sinusoids was seen with all these markers, but it was focal and confined to a few sinusoids near the portal tracts. In hepatoblastoma, the endothelial markers reacted with the sinusoids to varying extents. UEA-1 and anti-CD34 usually stained the majority of these vessels, anti-CD34 staining greater numbers of sinusoids and with greater intensity. Immunostaining revealed that both number and spatial organization of sinusoids in hepatoblastoma are dependent on the subtype. In addition to staining of endothelium, one of the two small cell hepatoblastomas exhibited strong immunoreactivity of the tumour cells for CD34. These findings show that the marked difference in sinusoidal immunoreactivity for CD34 between normal liver and hepatoblastoma could be useful for discriminating between non-neoplastic liver tissue and highly differentiated fetal hepatoblastoma. Our findings also show that small cell hepatoblastoma, in addition to acute leukaemia, should be considered when immunoreactivity for CD34 is found in small round and blue cell tumours in childhood.",,,,,,,,,

Because suramin, a polysulfonated naphthylurea originally described as an antitrypanosomal agent, was found to inhibit the binding of several growth factors to their receptor, we tested its effect on AML progenitor proliferation. We first examined the effect of suramin on murine EL-4.6.1 cells that express type I IL-1 receptors and found that suramin inhibited the binding of IL-1 to its receptor. We then tested the effect of suramin on AML progenitors using bone marrow samples from 17 patients with AML. In all experiments, suramin inhibited AML blast proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations ranging from 30 to 240 microM. IL-1 beta (100 U/mL) partially reversed this inhibitory effect. Suramin also inhibited normal early and mature hematopoietic progenitors, as assessed by both the delta assay and the mixed colony culture assay; however, at the same concentration, suramin suppressed the colony growth of colony-forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) by only 45% compared with an 89% suppression of AML progenitors. IL-1 beta did not negate this inhibitory effect, which suggests that another growth inhibitory mechanism might be operative. Our data suggest that suramin may inhibit AML progenitor proliferation by blocking the interaction of IL-1 and its receptor; therefore, further studies are warranted to evaluate suramin's therapeutic potential in patients with AML.",,,,,,,,,

No animal model yet exists for FA. Consequently, we have studied the effects of constitutive expression of human FACC in two murine transplantation models. In the first model, we demonstrated transduction of FACC to reconstituting stem cells of mutant W/WV mice. In the second model, we demonstrated transduction of FACC to hematopoietic cells transplanted to the bone marrows and spleens of non-myeloablated BALB/c mice.

Apoptosis was confirmed by morphologic analysis alone or in combination with DNA electrophoresis analysis. Four of the five cell lines showed Fas expression, three of which showed induction of apoptosis by anti-Fas antibody. One cell line, RPMI 8226, showed the highest sensitivity for Fas-mediated apoptosis. High bcl-2 expression was found in KMS12PE, which showed resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis despite its Fas expression. Plasma cells from seven fresh cases, including all five cases with high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), showed expression of Fas antigen. Fas-induced apoptosis was found in five cases at various levels, although significant induction of apoptosis was found in only one case. Interestingly, Fas-independent apoptosis was induced during culture without anti-Fas antibody in cases with high serum LDH.

These deletions frequently include the entire interferon (IFN) gene cluster as well as the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) gene. Recently, the CDKN2 gene (p16INK4A, MTS I, CDK41) was proposed as a candidate tumor-suppressor gene on 9p21 because it is frequently deleted in cell lines derived from multiple tumor types. To determine if CDKN2 or another closely related gene on 9p is the target of 9p deletions in ALL and other hematologic malignancies, we analyzed 20 primary patient samples (13 ALL, 2 acute myeloid leukemias [AML], and 5 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas [NHL]) with 9p rearrangements using Southern blot analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) for alterations of CDKN2. Homozygous deletions of the CDKN2/CDKN2B (p15) region were detected in 10 cases (50%; 6 ALL, 2 AML, and 2 NHL). In 1 additional case, the intensity of the Southern blot band was significantly reduced, suggesting a CDKN2 deletion in a subpopulation of the malignant cells. No CDKN2 or CDKN2B rearrangements were seen. The IFN gene cluster was homozygously deleted in 2 of 15 (13%) analyzed cases, whereas the MTAP gene was deleted in 6 of 15 cases (40%). In addition, hemizygous deletions of the CDKN2 region were identified in 6 ALL cases using interphase FISH. No point mutation of the coding region of CDKN2 was detected by SSCP in these cases. We conclude that CDKN2 is the most frequently homozygously deleted marker on 9p. The absence of point mutations in the coding region of CDKN2 in cases with hemizygous 9p deletions and the frequent codeletion of MTAP, CDKN2B, and other yet unidentified neighboring genes suggest that the simultaneous deletion of these genes may be necessary for the selective growth advantage of malignant cells.",,,,,"['CDK4I', 'CDKN2', 'IFN', 'MTAP', 'MTS1']",,,,

In contrast, LTC-IC expansion has been attained in cultures of bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) using frequent medium exchange. The use of frequent medium exchange was, therefore, examined in cultures of CD34-enriched cells. In stromal-free, CD34-enriched cell cultures, medium exchange intervals ranging from 2 days to no feeding for 14 days gave similar results. Six different growth factor combinations, reported by other groups to give optimal expansion of CD34-enriched cells, were tested in comparison with the control combination of IL-3/GM-CSF/Epo/SCF. None of the combinations resulted in improved colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) expansion or LTC-IC maintenance, although two were equivalent. All stromal-free cultures resulted in loss of LTC-IC to half of input. Because of the limited effect of medium exchange and growth factor variations on CD34-enriched cell cultures, the effect of preformed stroma was next examined. Preformed stroma increased cell (3-fold), CFU-GM (5-fold), and LTC-IC (3-fold) output, but only when the medium was exchanged every other day. Under these conditions, the number of LTC-IC was maintained near input level. The lack of LTC-IC expansion in CD34-enriched cell cultures prompted experiments to examine the effect of cell purification. Parallel cultures were performed at CD34+lin- cell purities of 20%, 40%, 70%, and 95%, with each well containing exactly 4,000 CD34+lin- cells in addition to the CD34- accessory cells required to give the desired percentage. Also, MNC from the same source (approximately 2% CD34+lin-) were cultured at a concentration to give 4,000 CD34+lin- cells per well. As CD34+lin- cell purity was decreased from 95% to 2%, the output of cells, CFU-GM, and LTC-IC increased by threefold to fivefold. The loss of culture performance with purification was likely due to the removal of important accessory cells, because the levels of endogenously produced leukemia inhibitory factor and IL-6 were found to decline significantly with increasing CD34+lin- cell purity. In summary, preformed stroma abrogated the decrease in cell and CFU-GM output from cultured CD34-enriched cells and led to LTC-IC maintenance. In contrast, MNC inocula resulting in a growing stromal layer during the culture led to LTC-IC expansion (3.2-fold).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

In addition, normal hematopoietic progenitors and progenitor cell lines show an absolute dependence on growth factors for their survival in vitro, yet the effect of growth factors on progenitor cell survival has not been separated from effects on both proliferation and differentiation. Using an in vitro assay system, we examined whether growth factors could promote the survival of stem cells in culture in the absence of cell division. These studies show that steel factor (SLF) and, to a lesser extent, interleukin-3 (IL-3) directly promoted the survival of elutriated bone marrow progenitor cells (countercurrent centrifugal elutriation [CCE]-27) that are enriched for primitive hematopoietic progenitors that respond to the combination of SLF plus IL-3. Furthermore, SLF promoted the survival of short-term reconstituting cells (STRC), and long-term reconstituting cells (LTRC) with trilineage reconstitution potential in vivo. In comparison, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-11, IL-1, granulocyte macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and macrophage CSF (M-CSF) had no effect on the survival of these cells. In the presence of mitotic inhibitors (nocodazole or aphidicolin), SLF promoted the survival of CCE-27 progenitor cells that respond to the combination of SLF plus IL-3 in vitro and STRCs and LTRCs that are detected in vivo. Taken together, these data show that SLF can directly promote the survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the absence of cell division.",,,,,,,,,

This paper describes the ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of gamma RF-1 in a cell-free system. gamma RF-1 activity was induced by IFN-gamma in a time-dependent manner from 5 to 60 min in lysates prepared from the human monocytic leukaemia line THP-1 and the human epidermoid carcinoma line A431. The activation of gamma RF-1 in vitro required both ATP and an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases (sodium orthovanadate or pervanadate). In the presence of limiting concentrations (micromolar) of ATP, activation was also dependent upon stimulation with IFN-gamma, whereas at millimolar concentrations of ATP, gamma RF-1 was activated by either sodium orthovanadate or pervanadate in the absence of ligand. Based on cell fractionation studies, both membrane and cytosol components were essential for activation of gamma RF-1 in vitro. Consistent with a role for one or more tyrosine kinases in the activation of gamma RF-1, its DNA binding activity was blocked by monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein, lavendustin A and herbimycin A. A comparison with recently described pathways of IFN-mediated transcription factor regulation indicates that the in vitro activation of gamma RF-1 is unique, requiring both membrane and cytosol fractions and inhibition of endogenous tyrosine phosphatase activity.",PMC1135918,,,,,,,,

More recently, the large scale production of the recombinant forms of these molecules has enabled to treat the patients with pharmacologic doses of cytokines. The therapeutic activity of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) has been demonstrated in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia and other chronic myeloproliferative syndromes. IFN-gamma is useful in the prevention of infections in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. Erythropoietin (EPO) was the first hematopoietic growth factor available for clinical use, initially to treat anaemia in renal failure patients. The next cytokines introduced into the clinic were granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). They are used successfully in haematological malignant disorders to stimulate granulopoiesis after chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation and to help mobilise marrow stem cells for peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

We have now further assessed the modulatory role of TDRF on TNF-alpha, TNF receptors (TNF-R) and NOS mRNA synthesis. Macrophages activated by INF-gamma priming and triggering by rTNF-alpha bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of IL-2 evoked greater NO generation in the presence than in the absence of L1210 targets. TDRF-containing culture fluid from L1210 targets was subsequently confirmed to synergize with IFN-gamma and rTNF-alpha, LPS or IL-2 triggering agents to promote increased TNF-alpha mRNA for autocrine induction of NOS mRNA synthesis with resultant augmentation of NO generation. IFN-gamma selectively upregulated TNF-R1 mRNA expression, whereas either IL-2 or LPS upregulated only TNF-R2 mRNA expression. TDRF combined with IFN-gamma to further upregulate TNF-R1 mRNA and with either IL-2 or LPS to further upregulate TNF-R2, mRNA expression. These findings indicate that TDRF activity synergizes with either IL-2 or LPS triggering agents for enhanced activation of IFN-gamma-primed macrophages by promotion of TNF-alpha and TNF-R mRNA synthesis for autocrine induction of NOS with resultant increased NO-mediated tumor cytotoxicity.",,,,,,,,,

Although RBTN-2 is crucial for normal erythropoiesis, the ectopic expression of RBTN-2 in T lymphocytes results in T-cell proliferation and leukemogenesis. Thus, while a proliferative function for RBTN-2 has been established in T-cells, neither its role in erythropoiesis nor its function(s) in other tissues are known. We have examined the expression and location of RBTN-2 in normal and malignant cells. Similar to fetal development, RBTN-2 RNA was detected in all normal adult tissues tested with the exception of colon and thymocytes. RBTN-2 RNA was not detected in all primary tumors and tumor cell lines, indicating RBTN-2 expression is not ubiquitous in proliferating cells. Using polyclonal antisera, RBTN-2 was detected predominantly in the nucleus of human hematopoietic cells. Significantly, human leukemic T cells with disruption of the RBTN-2 locus and thymocytes from transgenic mice with enforced expression of RBTN-2 showed similar nuclear location of RBTN-2 protein, consistent with the notion that RBTN-2 acts as a transcriptional regulator in T-cell proliferation. Surprisingly, in normal tissues, RBTN-2 showed a strikingly similar distribution to that of metallothionein-1, having both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization that suggested that RBTN-2 may be involved in the acute phase response. Indeed, similar to metallothionein-1, RBTN-2 mRNA was induced in thymocytes of mice exposed to zinc and in human thymocytes treated with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Since the LIM domain permits binding of multiple protein partners, the specific function of RBTN-2 may depend upon subcellular sequestration through interaction with different cofactors. Thus, in addition to its roles in erythropoiesis and T-cell leukemia, RBTN-2 may also be involved in the acute phase response.",,,,,['RBTN-2'],,,,

Dose escalation was possible because of the use of filgrastim, a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Twenty-five patients at three institutions were treated. The dose-limiting toxicity of the combination was granulocytopenia, with other toxicities being generally mild to moderate. The maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel was 300 mg/m2, and the recommended phase II dose is 250 mg/m2.

This fusion protein, termed as G-CSF-PE40, can displace [125I] G-CSF binding to its receptor. After 48 hrs incubation in the presence of G-CSF, G-CSF-PE40 inhibited protein synthesis and revealed cytotoxicity in NFS60 cells in a concentration dependent manner. The half maximal dose of G-CSF-PE40 for protein synthesis inhibition (ID50) in NFS60 cells was estimated at around 100pM. Additionally, relatively low concentration of G-CSF-PE40 stimulated DNA synthesis in NFS60 cells after 16 hrs' incubation in the absence of G-CSF, suggesting that G-CSF-PE40 also can transduce a transient mitogenic signal.

Ligation of the Fas receptor with a monoclonal antibody (IgM) resulted in the rapid (within 3 h) induction of apoptosis and was characterized by a sequence of distinct morphological and biochemical events. Thus, plasma membrane blebbing, condensation of the chromatin, and formation of high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA fragments were the earliest events observed (by 45 min). They were followed by cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal-length fragments (laddering pattern) and the formation of apoptotic bodies, and finally, rounding of the apoptotic cells and complete cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal-length fragments occurred. The mitochondria remained structurally intact up to the stage of oligonucleosomal-length DNA cleavage, and the ability of the cells to exclude trypan blue was not compromised throughout the time course of the experiments. In contrast to many other model systems, apoptosis in JURKAT cells after anti-Fas treatment did not require the presence of extracellular Ca2+ or Mg2+ and was only partially inhibited by Zn2+. In addition, Fas-mediated apoptosis was unaffected by the presence of free radical scavengers or inhibitors of protein phosphatases, protein kinases, and nitric oxide synthesis. However, the serine protease inhibitors, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) prevented anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in JURKAT cells. Low concentrations of these inhibitors blocked oligonucleosomal-length, but not HMW, DNA fragmentation. The latter required a higher concentration of TPCK or DCI to block. In addition, low concentrations of DCI also prevented Fas-mediated plasma membrane blebbing. In summary, our results suggest that proteolysis plays a central role in Fas-mediated apoptosis and that distinct proteolytic enzymes are involved in HMW DNA fragmentation, and oligonucleosomal-length DNA fragmentation, as well as in plasma membrane blebbing.",,,,,,,,,

However, they still maintain the capacity to differentiate since they respond to vitamin D3 by the formation of mature cells. Transfection of the G-CSFR gene into WEHI-3B D- cells resulted in three major changes. G-CSFR-expressing clones (a) acquired the capacity to respond to the differentiation-inducing properties of G-CSF and retinoic acid, (b) formed colonies which exhibited a dispersed phenotype, and (c) exhibited near diploid DNA ploidy.

Two-color flow cytometric analysis has emerged as a valuable addition to morphology and cytochemistry for the distinction of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). By careful selection of monoclonal antibody (mAb) combinations, diagnostic accuracy, and cost effectiveness may be enhanced compared to flow cytometry using one-color analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of a mAb panel were assessed in the determination of nonlymphocytic lineage in acute leukemia. One hundred twenty-five consecutive cases of acute leukemia were analyzed in which Wright's-stained smears, cytochemical stains, and immunophenotyping studies had been performed. The antibody panel included the nonlymphoid markers CD13, CD33, CD14, and CD4 in combination with CD2, as well as a broad panel of lymphoid and nonlineage specific markers. Of the 125 cases of acute leukemia studied, 85 cases (68%) were nonlymphocytic and 32 cases (26%) were lymphocytic (28 cases B cell, 4 cases T cell). CD13 and CD33 were very sensitive in the detection of ANLL, being expressed on 94% and 93% of ANLL cases, respectively. Sixty-five percent of cases of ANLL were CD4+ (CD2-). However, CD4+ (CD2-) had a much higher specificity (91%) for ANLL than CD13 (75%) or CD33 (84%), which were expressed in a significant number of ALL. When leukemic cells were positive for CD4 (CD2-) and either CD13 or CD33, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) for ANLL rose to 96% and 98%, respectively. The combination of CD4 positivity with either CD13 or CD33 has higher specificity and PPV than the traditional positivity for both CD13 and CD33 (specificity 89%, PPV 96%).

Cells from previously treated patients were, on average, significantly more sensitive to methylprednisolone than those from untreated patients (mean LC90 = 5.7 micrograms/ml, n = 61 vs 31.0 micrograms/ml, n = 17, respectively; p < 0.05). Twelve patients with advanced disease were given high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g/m2/day i.v. x 5 days). In 7 cases, > or = 3 courses were given; 3 patients did not respond (2 achieved palliation) and 4 (57%) achieved a good partial response. These latter 4 patients were all clinically resistant to chlorambucil and anthracyclines and 2 were resistant to fludarabine. In 5 cases, 1 or 2 courses were given but no patients responded. The 8 nonresponders survived a median of 3.5 months whilst the responders have survived a median of 28.5+ months (3 of 4 still alive). This work suggests a rationale for why CLL patients resistant to standard chemotherapy may benefit from high-dose methylprednisolone therapy. Due to cost and toxicity associated with therapy, the decision to treat would be best made on the basis of a DiSC assay result. This pilot study requires confirmation with a well-designed controlled clinical trial.",,,,,,,,,

The cell line proved susceptible to killing by exposure to a mitogenic concentration of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) within several hours, with biochemical analyses demonstrating extensive degradation of DNA to oligonucleosomal bands characteristic of apoptosis. Chromatin condensation and cell shrinkage features of apoptotic cells could also be clearly identified under the electron microscope. The apoptosis-related Fas antigen was expressed on L-KAW cells and DNA fragmentation was induced by incubation with anti-Fas monoclonal antibody. The c-myc mRNA levels declined within 15 min to 3 h after the addition of PHA.

Most of the patients (aged 1-17 years) suffering severe pain for about one month were in the advanced stage of the malignant diseases (e.g. leukemia). The pain etiology was mostly tumor-associated while therapy-related pain accounted for 23.5%. These pains were treated with NSAIDs or pentazocine before the consultation with inadequate relief. Oral morphine sulfate or continuous intravenous morphine chloride was administered to 16 patients with successful pain relief and side effects such as nausea (52.9%) and drowsiness (41.2%). It took 5.5 days on average until adequate pain control methods were determined. It is known that most NSAIDs frequently used for pediatric pain possibly cause adverse effects such as platelet dysfunction or mucous membrane injury with a suppository, which could lead to a fatal disorder in clinically ill pediatric cancer patients. Moreover sufficient doses for the pain relief are not necessarily given to the pediatric patients because of a limit to the dosage of NSAIDs. The period of pediatric cancer pain in which the patient require a methodical treatment and receive benefit from pain relief is relatively short in the advanced stage, not to mention the early stage in which chemotherapy is efficacious against cancer disease itself. Therefore, to obtain effective pain control within a short time, the authors propose the pain management for advanced pediatric cancer patients by the two-step analgesic ladder prescribing weak or strong opioid analgesics first, adapted from the three-step ladder of the WHO Cancer Pain Relief, 1986.",,,,,,,,,

We have mutated the conserved sequence at the active site of ASLV PR by converting the Ser and Gly residues to Thr and Ala, respectively. Replacement of Gly with Ala yielded an ASLV PR devoid of proteolytic activity. The Ser to Thr conversion did not alter the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Both wild-type and mutated PRs correctly cleaved viral precursors expressed in bacterial cells, as well as synthetic peptides homologous to ASLV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 cleavage sites. Bacterially produced ASLV PR with Thr instead of Ser had increased enzymatic activity, as shown by hydrolysis of synthetic peptides.

To characterize the biochemical and biological properties of proMBP, and compare these to the known properties of MBP, we expressed recombinant proMBP in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified the secreted form from supernatants. We developed a mAb specific for proMBP, J163-15E10, and by using a proMBP-specific RIA we found that recombinant proMBP was expressed quite efficiently at levels between 10 and 100 mg/l. By SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses of bulk Chinese hamster ovary supernatants, recombinant proMBP was electrophoretically heterogeneous with an apparent molecular mass ranging from 3 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) daltons. Despite difficulties encountered because of the extreme molecular heterogeneity of the proform, two methods for purification of a predominant 33-kDa form of recombinant proMBP are presented. Glycosylation analysis of purified 33-kDa proMBP indicated that approximately 5 kDa is likely accounted for by the addition of one glycosaminoglycan group, three O-linked, and one N-linked complex type carbohydrate groups. Functional studies of purified recombinant proMBP were also conducted. Using amounts of proMBP determined to be optimal for MBP activity, it was shown that proMBP not only lacked the ability to inhibit protein synthesis in K562 cells, but it also lacked the ability to stimulate basophil histamine release or generate neutrophil superoxide anion release. Furthermore, proMBP inhibited in a dose-responsive manner the basophil histamine release and superoxide anion generation stimulated by MBP. The development of a mAb and RIA specific for proMBP will now make it possible to analyze biologic fluids for the presence of this protein, especially in pregnancy, when proMBP is increased.",,,,,,,,,

Maximal increase in IL-2 transcription was recorded with CHO-DR/B7/LFA-3, suggesting a cooperative effect of B7 and LFA-3 at the transcriptional level. Gel-shift analysis demonstrated that stimulation of CD4+ T cells with CHO-DR and staphylococcal enterotoxin A was sufficient to induce significant amounts of NF-kappa B binding proteins, whereas induction of AP-1 binding proteins required costimulation. LFA-3 induced moderate levels of AP-1, but did not influence the levels of NF-kappa B, while B7 costimulation strongly induced both AP-1 and substantially enhanced NF-kappa B binding proteins. The CHO-DR/B7/LFA-3 triple transfectant induced a further increase in AP-1 and NF-kappa B binding proteins compared with the double transfectants. The level of Oct-1 binding proteins remained similar in all samples. Super-shift analysis revealed that the NF-kappa B complex of costimulated CD4+ T cells contained large amounts of p50, substantial amounts of p65, and marginal levels of c-Rel proteins. The AP-1 binding proteins contained c-Jun, Jun-D, and Fra-1, but marginal amounts of Jun-B and c-Fos. Our results indicate distinct effects of B7 and LFA-3 costimulation on the activity of AP-1 and NF-kappa B. These may partly account for the differential effects of B7 and LFA-3 costimulation on IL-2 expression.",,,,,,,,,

We have recently demonstrated that IFN-alpha acts directly on CML hematopoietic progenitors to restore their adhesion to marrow stroma by modulating beta 1 integrin receptor function. In the present study we examined the effect of IFN-alpha treatment of marrow stroma on subsequent adhesion of CML progenitors. Stromal layers were preincubated with IFN-alpha (10,000 microns/ml) for 48 h. Subsequent coincubation with CML progenitors for 2 h resulted in significantly increased adhesion of CML progenitors. We demonstrated that alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 integrin receptors were involved in the enhanced adhesion of CML progenitors, suggesting that IFN-alpha-treated stroma can upregulate CML integrin function. This effect is due, at least in part, to IFN-alpha-induced increased stromal production of the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), which upregulates beta 1 integrin-dependent adhesion of CML progenitors to stroma. Thus, IFN-alpha treatment of marrow stroma restores beta 1 integrin-dependent adhesion of CML progenitors, at least in part through induction of MIP-1 alpha production. These observations provide further insights into mechanisms by which IFN-alpha may restore normal hematopoiesis in CML.",PMC185281,,,,,,,,

Its regulation is therefore an important factor in determining the fate of cells at sites of complement activation. We have chosen the K562 erythroleukaemia cell line as a model for studies of the regulation of CD59 expression, because it has previously been reported that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused a 15-fold up-regulation of CD59 mRNA in these cells, implying a substantial capacity for CD59 synthesis. However, no assessment of CD59 protein expression was made in these studies. We show here that surface expression of CD59, as assessed by flow cytometry, was increased four-fold over a 16-hr incubation with PMA, whereas surface expression of decay-accelerating factor (DAF) (CD55) and membrane cofactor protein (MCP) (CD46) was not altered. The newly expressed CD59 was functionally active and anchored through glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI). Increased expression was dependent upon de novo protein synthesis. CD59 released into cell supernatant was also increased seven-fold by PMA, this 'secreted' CD59 retained its GPI anchor. Non-lethal complement attack did not alter CD59 expression but antibody cross-linking of CD59 caused a rapid loss of the CD59-antibody complexes. However, CD59 was quickly restored to pre-attack levels. This rapid restoration was not dependent upon protein synthesis, suggesting release from preformed stores.",PMC1384038,,,,,,,,

As a consequence, K562 cells possibly modify their interaction with immune cells. Here we describe the binding and killing activity of peripheral blood NK cells against differentiating K562 cells and the correlation between their altered binding capacity and ICAM-1 expression levels in differentiating K562 cells. We found that decreased percentages of NK (and T) cells were bound to differentiating K562 cells generating a decreased cytotoxic activity. This corresponded to decreased expression of ICAM-1, as detected by FACS analysis and Western blot. Erythroid differentiation, binding and killing reduction, and ICAM-1 down-modulation were completely abrogated by guanosine treatment. Tiazofurin causes a decrease in lymphocyte recognition and binding to K562 target cells. This can be ascribed to the down-modulation of ICAM-1 expression on target cells, which, therefore, can escape killing, acquiring a selective survival advantage.",,,,,,,,,

At the chromosomal level, karyotype analysis of metaphase spreads revealed the presence of an aberrant 2q + chromosome in the AraC-resistant cell line and a (Xq:11q) translocation in its subclone RA/7. The DAC-resistant lines were identical to the parental RCL/O. Fluorescence in situ hybridization on normal rat fibroblast metaphase spreads localized the rat dck gene to chromosome 14q21-q22, a region that was not involved in any of the observed karyotypic aberrations. Analysis at the molecular level revealed an identical rearrangement of the dck gene in the AraC-resistant cell line RCL/A and its subclone RA/7 that resulted in the absence of dck expression, as assessed by RT-PCR. No genomic rearrangements were observed in a DAC-resistant cell line RCL/D or in its subclone RD/1. However, detection of a single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) allowed the identification of a single C to G substitution (His to Gln) in the dck cDNA of the DAC-resistant RD/1 clone. The data demonstrate that exposure to AraC and DAC induces a resistant phenotype marked by functional dck deficiency that may be the consequence of mutations occurring in the dck gene.",,,,,['dck'],,,,

We report a case of cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis that occurred in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. OBSERVATIONS: A 55-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic B-cell leukemia, Rai stage IV, presented with multiple angiomatous papules that clinically resembled pyogenic granulomas. Histopathologic examination revealed circumscribed lobules of small vessels with plump endothelial cells, numerous neutrophils, and abundant nuclear dust; these features were diagnostic for bacillary angiomatosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the Grocott-Gomori methenamine-silver nitrate stain that revealed argyrophilic bacteria and by ultrastructural demonstration of bacillary structures with trilaminar walls. Treatment with clarithromycin led to complete resolution of the lesions within 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes that (1) bacillary angiomatosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of vascular lesions in immunocompromised patients without human immunodeficiency virus infection, (2) Grocott-Gomori methenamine-silver nitrate stain is a simple and satisfactory alternative to the Warthin-Starry stain for the demonstration of bacilli in this condition, and (3) clarithromycin is an effective oral antibiotic for the treatment of this disease.",,,,,,,,,

We observed that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) arrested HIMeg-1 growth and induced expression of monocytic surface antigens CD11c and CD14, but not the megakaryocytic surface antigen CD14a. In addition, PMA treatment of HIMeg-1 led to rapid activation of mRNA expression of egr-1, a transcription factor involved in regulating differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. On the other hand, treatment of HIMeg-1 with the activated peripheral blood lymphocyte-conditioned medium (PBL-CM) resulted in greatly enhanced incorporation of 3H-thymidine into newly synthesized DNA. This enhanced 3H-thymidine incorporation appears to be specific to HIMeg-1 since the same concentrations of PBL-CM had little effect on the growth of the megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line SAM-1. The PBL-CM-induced DNA synthesis in HIMeg-1 was associated with activation of CD41a and CD41b surface antigen expression and down-regulation of expression of the erythroid marker glycophorin A and the early myeloid surface antigen CD33. HIMeg-1 capable of responding differentially to PMA and PBL-CM by changing its growth rate as well as its differentiation patterns will provide an ideal model to study the underlying mechanism regulating lineage restriction of hematopoietic progenitor cells.",,,,,,,,,

The FAS antigen was expressed in a minority (5-41%, mean 15.6%) of the CLL cells in 10 of 21 CLL patients and this expression was not modified during spontaneous or hydrocortisone-induced apoptosis of CLL cells. In contrast, culture with gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) upregulated the expression of FAS in all CLL patients, with 65-100% (mean 84.8%) of the cells being positive after 2 days in vitro culture. Culture with alpha-IFN induced FAS expression in 15 of 19 CLL patients tested, with 15-74% (mean 34%) of the cells being FAS+ after 2 days culture. IL-4 and IL-10, lymphokines that inhibit and promote CLL apoptosis respectively, did not modify the expression of FAS. These results from FACS analysis were consistent with FAS mRNA analysis of fresh and cultured CLL cells, using a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR technique. Although IL-4 and IFNs prevent apoptotic cell death of CLL cells in vitro, the present results show that IFNs induce the expression of the apoptosis-inducing protein FAS. However, FAS+ CLL cells were not killed in the presence of anti-FAS monoclonal antibody (while the FAS+ Jurkat and four lymphoblastoid cell lines were killed). This resistance is not due to a mutated FAS protein, since only wild-type FAS cDNA was demonstrated in the leukemic cells of three CLL patients. In four HCL patients 34-53% (mean 44.5%) of the leukemic cells were FAS+ and they were also resistant to the anti-FAS mediated cytotoxicity. The combination of high bcl-2 protein levels and resistance to anti-FAS mediated cytotoxicity may contribute to the extended in vivo survival of CLL and HCL cells.",,,,,,,,,

In the FBM the highest bcl-2 levels (mean antibody binding capacity 51 x 10(3) molecules/cell) were found in CD34+ intermediate sized blasts and myeloblasts, while a CD34+ subset of CD10+ lymphoblasts had low bcl-2 content (8-10 x 10(3) molecules/cell) and the CD34-, CD10+ lymphoblasts were, as expected from previous studies, bcl-2- (< 5 x 10(3) molecules/cell). Variable levels of bcl-2 (5.1-222 x 10(3)) were found in 43 tested cases of AML. The bcl-2 levels decrease with granulocytic and monocytic differentiation and, accordingly, cases of AML with M1 and M2 features showed significantly higher mean bcl-2 levels than the leukemias with promyelocytic (M3) or myelo-monocytic (M4/M5) features. Nevertheless, in seven cases of AML the bcl-2 levels were higher than seen in the normal FBM cells and none of these patients remain in remission after 2 years. Furthermore, in several AML cases intraclonal heterogeneity was observed. The undifferentiated smaller blasts with Class-IIdim display had higher bcl-2 content than the more differentiated larger blasts with more granular side scatter and Class-bright expression. In the same subsets of AML blasts the proliferative S-G2-M fractions showed a reciprocal correlation to bcl-2 content. Thus the higher bcl-2 levels may give a survival advantage and confer some degree of drug resistance to the least differentiated blast populations. The multi-parameter analysis described in this paper, including a combined bcl-2 and cytokinetic analysis of phenotypically defined subgroups of AML blasts, may detect early population shifts during relapse and also guide combination drug therapy.",,,,,,,,,

When both ITs were used in combination at equivalent dose levels, the therapeutic outcome was significantly improved over that obtained for single IT therapy, with 20% of animals surviving disease-free to 300 days. When anti-CD38 IT was given in combination with anti-CD19 antibody there was no therapeutic improvement over anti-CD38 IT used alone. However, when anti-CD19 IT was given in combination with CD38 antibody, a significant prolongation of survival ensued over that obtained with anti-CD19 IT alone, though this was not as significantly pronounced as that obtained when both ITs were used in combination and was only as good as the survival obtained with OKT10 antibody used alone.

However, this phenotype does not seem to be responsible for the resistance to alkylating agents usually employed in the management of CLL. METHODS: Lymphocytes from 42 patients were evaluated by flow cytometry for P-170 expression and by spectrophotometry for glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity. RESULTS: Our findings show that GST is not related to any clinical parameter but is increased in treated patients. Conversely, 85% of patients were positive for P-170 and this was related to the percentage of CD5/CD19-positive lymphocytes. CD5/CD19-negative patients were also negative for P-170. MDR was not related to any clinical parameter evaluated nor to GST activity in lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: MDR is constitutively expressed in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and seems to be related to a CD5/CD19 B-CLL phenotype. The increase of GST activity in treated patients is statistically significant (p < 0.005).",,,,,,,,,

(1992) Cancer Immunol Immunother 35:145; Baxevanis et al. (1994) Cancer Immunol Immunothera 38:281]. In this report we demonstrated that ProT alpha, when administered simultaneously with L1210 tumor cells, is capable of generating in DBA/2 animals tumor-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The ProT alpha-induced CD8+ CTL lysed their syngeneic L1210 targets in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted fashion since monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against the H-2Kd allelic product could inhibit the cytotoxic response. Mice receiving only ProT alpha developed non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic activity (NK, and LAK activities) whereas those receiving ProT alpha and L1210 tumor cells developed both MHC-restricted (CTL) and non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic activities and survived longer. The ProT alpha-induced CD8+ CTL activity was regulated by ProT alpha-induced L1210-specific syngeneic CD4+ cells. This was shown in two different ways: first, CD8(+)-cell-mediated cytotoxic responses against L1210 targets were associated with L1210-specific and MHC-restricted proliferative responses of syngeneic CD4+ cells and, second, CD4+ cells from mice that had received both ProT alpha and L1210 tumor cells could enhance in vitro the otherwise weak, MHC-restricted and L1210-specific cytotoxicity of syngeneic CD8+ cells from mice that had received only L1210 cells. Our data suggest that ProT alpha is capable of inducing nonspecific, as well as tumor-specific CTL responses in vivo. This is of importance since ProT alpha may prove to be useful in clinical protocols aimed at cancer immunotherapy.",,,,,,,,,

E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and protein kinase C activation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) potentiated monocyte binding during either coincubation or 24-h pretreatment (0.1 microM PMA, +200 +/- 21%).

The myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia develop in some patients with severe congenital neutropenia. Abnormalities in the signal-transduction pathways for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may play a part in the progression to acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: We isolated genomic DNA and RNA from hematopoietic cells obtained from two patients with acute myeloid leukemia and histories of severe congenital neutropenia. The nucleotide sequences encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSF receptor were amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Murine myeloid 32D.C10 cells were transfected with complementary DNA encoding the wild-type or mutant G-CSF receptors and tested for their responses to G-CSF. RESULTS: Point mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor were identified in both patients. The mutations, a substitution of thymine for cytosine at the codon for glutamine at position 718 (Gln718) in one patient and at the codon for glutamine at position 731(Gln731) in the other, caused a truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the receptor. Both mutant and wild-type genes for the G-CSF receptor were present in leukemic cells from the two patients. In one patient, the mutation was also found in the neutropenic stage, before the progression to acute myeloid leukemia. The 32D.C10 cells expressing mutant receptors had abnormally high proliferative responses but failed to mature when cultured in G-CSF. The mutant G-CSF receptors also interfered with terminal maturation mediated by the wild-type G-CSF receptor in the 32D.C10 cells that coexpressed the wild-type and mutant receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor that interrupt signals required for the maturation of myeloid cells are involved in the pathogenesis of severe congenital neutropenia and associated with the progression to acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['GENBANK/S78382', 'GENBANK/S78385']",['N Engl J Med. 1995 Aug 24;333(8):516-8.

Most of the orally administered drug undergoes opening of the dithiolethione ring, reduction, recyclization, and methylation to form 7-methyl-6,8-bis(methylthio)pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine (""metabolite III""). We report here that metabolite III inhibits viral replication in vitro (ED50 approximately 25 microM) in acutely infected H9 and CEM T cell lymphoma cell lines. Although both metabolite III and oltipraz were able to inhibit phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-stimulated viral replication in the chronically infected U1 promonocytic leukemia cell line, only metabolite III was able to inhibit phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-stimulated viral replication in chronically infected ACH-2 T cell lymphoma cells. The results with ACH-2 cells suggest that oltipraz inhibits an early stage of the viral life cycle, whereas metabolite III affects human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication at a step distal to viral integration. This is consistent with the finding that oltipraz inhibits reverse transcriptase, whereas metabolite III does not. Although the mean ED50 for metabolite III in acutely infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells was 18 microM, the ED50 was below 5 microM in three of eight independent experiments. Studies of metabolite III in combination with oltipraz in acutely infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated significant antiviral synergy. These results raise the possibility that the in vitro potency of oltipraz may underestimate its antiretroviral activity in vivo. Based on these results, the pharmacokinetics of oltipraz and metabolite III will be compared with the pharmacodynamic effects of orally administered oltipraz in a forthcoming phase I/II trial of oltipraz in patients with p24 antigenemia.",,,,,,,,,

The alpha v beta 3-dependent inhibition apparently required a signal transduction cascade as it was reversed by inhibitors of serine/threonine kinases. Now, we have studied the mechanisms of signal transduction in this system and have found that the beta 3 cytoplasmic tail is both necessary and sufficient for initiation of the signal leading to inhibition of alpha 5 beta 1 phagocytosis. Ligation of integrin-associated protein (IAP), which has been implicated in alpha v beta 3 signal transduction, mimics the effects of alpha v beta 3 ligation only when the beta 3 integrin with an intact cytoplasmic tail is present. Although fibronectin-mediated phagocytosis requires the high affinity conformation of alpha 5 beta 1, ligation of alpha v beta 3/IAP does not prevent acquisition of this high affinity state. We conclude that alpha v beta 3/IAP ligation initates a signal transduction cascade, dependent upon the beta 3 cytoplasmic tail, which inhibits the phagocytic function of alpha 5 beta 1 at a step subsequent to modulation of integrin affinity.",PMC2120530,,,,,,,,

Immunoconjugates were synthesized using anti-CD3, or distinct anti-V beta antibodies cross-linked to CRM9, a binding site-mutant of diphtheria toxin. All TcR-expressing cells display the CD3 complex on the plasma membrane. HPB-ALL cells express the V beta 5 gene product in the beta subunit of the TcR, while Jurkat cells express V beta 8. V beta expression in primary T cells isolated from buffy coats is heterogeneous. Primary T cell populations expressing specific V beta epitopes in the TcR were generated by plating CD3+ T cells on V beta-specific antibody-coated flasks or by positive immunomagnetic selection. Immunotoxins directed against the invariant CD3 epsilon epitope target and kill all T cells. Immunoconjugates targeted at distinct anti-V beta epitopes are specific for cells that express the corresponding gene product in the TcR. The results demonstrate the ability of anti-TcR-based immunotoxins selectively to kill T cells with defined V beta epitopes. These reagents may be clinically useful in disorders mediated by autoreactive T cell populations exhibiting V beta restriction and in the treatment of clonal TcR-expressing lymphomas.",,,,,,,,,

However, formal proof of viral infection is lacking. Measurement of MxA-protein in leucocyte lysates is a sensitive test for evaluating the activation of the host's interferon system. Both viral infections and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) strongly induce MxA-protein in peripheral leucocytes. We therefore examined 15 patients with longlasting hypogammaglobulinaemia for MxA-protein induction in vivo: 13 patients suffered from CVID, one from hyper-IgM syndrome, and one patient had chronic B lymphocytic leukaemia associated with immunoglobulin deficiency and chronic papilloma virus infection (condylomata accuminata). Only the latter patient exhibited a strong MxA-protein expression; two CVID patients were borderline positive, and the remaining 12 patients including the hyper-IgM syndrome were MxA-protein-negative. There was no relationship between MxA expression and low CD4/CD8 ratios or increased CD8/CD57+ T cell counts, although both conditions are often observed in CVID as well as in chronic viral infections. When exposed in vitro to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), peripheral blood leucocytes of four MxA-negative patients were capable of producing normal amounts of MxA-protein. Taken together, these results argue against a viral or autoimmune pathogenesis of CVID.",PMC1553315,,,,,,,,

We investigated stem cell involvement in leukemia using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunofluorescence labeling of hematopoietic subpopulations, and flow cytometric analysis/sorting to discriminate and quantify cytogenetically aberrant stem cells in 12 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and three myelodysplastic (MDS) specimens. Flow cytometric analysis and sorting were used to discriminate and collect a primitive subpopulation enriched in stem cells expressing CD34+ and lacking CD33 and CD38 (CD34+lin-). A subpopulation containing progenitors and differentiating myeloid cells expressed CD34, CD33, and CD38 (CD34+lin+). Nine specimens contained less than 10% CD34+ cells and, thus, were considered to be CD34- leukemias. Mature lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid subpopulations were sorted on the basis of antigen-linked immunofluorescence. Cytogenetically aberrant cells in sorted subpopulations were identified using FISH with enumerator probes selected on the basis of diagnosis karyotype. Cytogenetically aberrant CD34+lin- cells were present at frequencies between 9% and 99% in all specimens. CD34+lin- cytogenetically aberrant cells comprised between 0.05% and 11.9% of the marrow/blood specimens. Cytogenetically aberrant CD34+lin+ cells constituted 0.01% tp 56% of the marrow/blood population. These data demonstrate that aberrant cells are present in primitive CD34+ stem cell compartments, even in CD34- leukemias. Stem cell involvement was confirmed further by sorting lymphoid and erythroid subpopulations from eight specimens in which the predominant leukemic population lacked lymphoid/erythroid differentiation markers. In these specimens, as well as in multiple lineages, suggests involvement of a cell(s) with multilineage capabilities. The ability of aberrant CD34+lin- stem cells to contribute to clonal and compartment expansion within immunofluorescently defined subpopulations was evaluated to explore the functional phenotype of aberrant CD34+lin- cells. Analysis of compartment size and aberrant cell frequency suggests that frequency of cytogenetically aberrant stem cells is uncoupled from compartment size. These data suggest that cytogenetically aberrant cells in the primitive compartment show varying abilities to expand primitive compartments. Cytogenetically aberrant CD34+lin- cells precede the blast subpopulation in hierarchical maturation and may in some cases by considered preleukemic, requiring maturation or additional mutations before transformation (eg, compartmental expansion) occurs.",,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 581 formalin fixed, paraffin embedded trephine biopsy specimens of the iliac crest were immunostained with QBEND10 (avidin-biotin complex/ABC method). The number of CD34+ haemopoietic stem cells/blast cells (referred to hereafter as CD34+ cells) was determined in each case. The Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The following diagnostic categories were defined: (1) normal or reactive bone marrow (n = 356), (2) lymphoproliferative disorders, usually non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of low grade malignancy or multiple myeloma (n = 118), (3) myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 22), (4) acute leukaemia (n = 44), and (5) myeloproliferative diseases (n = 41). The average number of CD34+ cells was very low (0.2/HPF) in normal and reactive bone marrow, in lymphoproliferative disorders and in the myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes RA and RARS. Myeloproliferative diseases showed an average of three CD34+ cells/HPF. However, the average number of CD34+ cells was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes RAEB and RAEB-T (8.7/HPF) and in acute leukaemia (including both myeloid and lymphoblastic leukaemia; 111.7/HPF). CONCLUSIONS: QBEND10 is of value for the identification of RAEB and RAEB-T in routinely processed bone marrow biopsy specimens because it enables the detection of even small increases in the number of CD34+ cells.",PMC502542,,['J Clin Pathol. 1995 Sep;48(9):884.

Previously, we evaluated the same compounds to determine their ability to induce trifluorothymidine (TFT) resistance in L5178Y mouse cells and found that their mutagenic potency also correlated with their reported ability to induce morphological changes in C3H10T1/2 cells. Here, we examine four of the same analogs, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine, 5-azacytidine, 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine and 6-azacytidine, to find out if micronuclei induced by these compounds correlated with these effects. The most cytotoxic analog was 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine, followed by 5-azacytidine. 5,6-Dihydro-5-azacytidine and 6-azacytidine were substantially less cytotoxic. All four compounds induced micronuclei. The lowest dose ranges at which responses were observed for micronucleus induction were -0.04 microM for 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine, 0.2 microM for 5-azacytidine and 10-20 microM for 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine and 6-azacytidine. Lack of kinetochore staining in most of the micronuclei indicated that all four compounds were clastogenic. We note a general trend in the biological activity of these analogs: compounds that are specifically blocked at the 5 position such as 5-azacytidine and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine effect changes in cell morphology, cytotoxicity, TFT resistance and the induction of micronuclei at very low doses. 5-Azacytidine analogs that possess more chemically accessible 5 positions such as 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine and 6-azacytidine either require doses that are orders of magnitude greater to induce these effects or are unable to induce changes in cell morphology and TFT resistance at doses below which the compound is lethal to the cells.",,,,,,,,,

Since the c-kit receptor has also been detected on malignant cells, experiments were performed to study the effect of SCF on the proliferation and radiation survival of a variety of both c-kit-positive and -negative human tumor cell lines using [3H]thymidine incorporation and colony formation assays. The addition of SCF to both c-kit-positive and -negative cell line cultures had no significant effect on the stimulation index (in [3H]thymidine assay). In contrast, colony formation by H69 (small cell lung cancer cell line), H128 (small cell lung cancer cell line), and HEL (erythroid leukemia cell line) cells was enhanced by SCF in a dose-dependent manner, but SCF did not promote the in vivo growth of H128 xenograft tumors in terms of graft rate, time from implantation to tumor detection, or tumor size. Furthermore, SCF did not significantly increase the surviving fraction of either c-kit-positive or -negative cell lines following radiation, and there were no statistically significant differences between D0 [defined by the slope of the terminal exponential region of the two-component (single-hit multitarget model) survival curve where slope = 1/D0], Dq (quasithreshold dose), n (extrapolation number), alpha, and beta values for any of the cell lines studied that were irradiated with and without SCF. Finally, nude mice with transplanted human LG425 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (c-kit positive) were treated with 10 Gy with or without SCF (100 micrograms/kg i.p. 20 h before, 2 h before, and 4 h after irradiation). There were no significant differences in the median tumor quadrupling time between groups that received either no treatment or SCF alone, or between groups treated with 10 Gy and SCF or 10 Gy alone (P > 0.05). These results are encouraging and suggest that SCF does not stimulate tumor cell proliferation in vivo or enhance the survival of tumor cells following irradiation.",,,,,,,,,

It was found that the enzyme derived from Erwinia chrysanthemi loses its activity when exposed to freeze-thaw cycling. When it was frozen at -40 degrees C and thawed, the enzyme lost 67.3% of its activity; whereas, when frozen in liquid nitrogen (-190 degrees C), it lost almost all of its activity. Rheological studies of hetastarch showed that its viscosity dramatically increases with decreasing temperature, suggesting that at sub-zero temperatures it will create a highly viscous environment around the enzyme. It is proposed that this highly viscous environment retards the rate of conformational changes leading to losses in activity. Hetastarch solutions of various concentrations and degrees of hydroxyethylation were evaluated for their protective ability against the freeze-thaw denaturation of L-asparaginase. It was found that the cryoprotective effect of hetastarch with 0.8 degree of substitution at a concentration of 0.2% was sustained over many freeze-thaw cycles while that of the lesser substituted starch was not. The cryoprotective effect of hetastarch was compared to that of other commonly used additives such as glucose and lactose, which failed to protect the enzyme from freeze-thaw denaturation. In addition, the protective effect of a monomer of hetastarch was evaluated in order to distinguish whether the protective effect of hetastarch was due to physicochemical interactions with the individual monomer units or to its polymeric nature. The monomer showed significant cryoprotection through the first freeze-thaw cycle which was not sustained over additional freeze-thaw cycles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

These studies determined whether BZ, or its reactive metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ), affect differentiation of myeloblasts. BZ or HQ administered to C57BL/6J mice specifically induced terminal granulocytic differentiation of myeloblasts. The ability of the compounds to induce differentiation of the myeloblast was tested directly using the murine interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent myeloblastic cell line, 32D.3 (G) and the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cell line. Treatment of HL-60 myeloblasts with BZ activated protein kinase C and upregulated the 5-lipoxygenase (LPO) pathway for the production of leukotriene D4 (LTD4), an essential effector of granulocytic differentiation. Differentiation was prevented by sphinganine, a kinase C inhibitor, as well as by LPO inhibitors and LTD4 receptor antagonists. BZ and HQ also induced differentiation in 32D.3 (G) myeloblasts. Both compounds interact with cellular signaling pathways activated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and thus replace the requirement for G-CSF. IL-3 induces a growth response, whereas G-CSF provides both growth and differentiation signals. BZ does not induce growth in the absence of IL-3, but provides a differentiation signal. Both HQ and LTD4 induce differentiation and synergize with IL-3 for growth, however, neither support growth in the absence of IL-3. BZ-induced 32D cells showed a gradual progression of progenitor differentiation to granulocytes similar to that seen with G-CSF or LTD4. HQ blocks differentiation at the myelocyte stage; only a small percentage of progenitors proceed to granulocytes. BZ, like G-CSF, upregulates LTD4 production, whereas HQ obviates the requirement for LTD4 by activating the LTD4 receptor.",,,,,,,,,

The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection.",PMC189326,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of this phenotype was investigated. Viruses containing disrupted nef genes were 4 to 40 times less infectious than wild-type HIV-1 in a single-round infection. The Nef-mediated stimulation HIV-1 infectivity was dependent on the association of Nef with the plasma membrane and could be observed when Nef was provided in trans in the virus producer but not target cells. The impaired infectiousness of nef-defective (delta Nef) virions was observed whether or not CD4 was present in either of these cells. Furthermore, it was independent of the mode of viral entry, since it was not rescued by pseudotyping Env- HIV-1 virions with the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope glycoproteins. As predicted from this result, wild-type and delta Nef virions entered cells with equal efficiencies. However, despite their normal content in viral genomic RNA and reverse transcriptase activity, delta Nef viruses were limited in their ability to perform reverse transcription once internalized in several cell types, including peripheral blood lymphocytes. Since Nef does not appear to be abundant in virions, these results suggest that Nef acts in producer cells to allow the generation of particles fully competent for completing steps that follow entry, leading to efficient reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome. Using a trans complementation assay, we found that Nef proteins from a number of primary HIV-1 isolates as well as, to a milder degree, those from HIV-2ST and SIVMAC239 could enhance the infectivity of delta Nef HIV-1. This indicates that the Nef-mediated stimulation of proviral DNA synthesis is highly conserved and likely plays an important role in vivo.",PMC189322,,,,['nef'],,,,

In the human monocytic cell line THP-1, either integrin-dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin or ligation of beta 1 integrins with antibodies causes a rapid and intense tyrosine phosphorylation of two sets of proteins of about 65-75 and 120-125 kDa. In addition, integrin ligation leads to nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-kappa B transcription factor, to activation of a reporter gene driven by a promoter containing NF-kappa B sites, and to increased levels of mRNAs for immediate-early genes, including the cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 beta. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A block both integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and increases in IL-1 beta message levels, indicating a causal relationship between the two events. The components tyrosine phosphorylated subsequent to cell adhesion include paxillin, pp125FAK, and the SH2 domain containing tyrosine kinase Syk. In contrast, integrin ligation with antibodies induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk but not of FAK or paxillin. In adhering cells, pre-treatment with cytochalasin D suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin but not of Syk, while IL-1 beta message induction is unaffected. These observations indicate that the Syk tyrosine kinase may be an important component of an integrin signaling pathway in monocytic cells, leading to activation of NF-kappa B and to increased levels of cytokine messages.",,,,,,,,,

Although determining the numbers and affinities of IFN-alpha receptors on CML cells has been developed as a method for predicting treatment response to IFN-alpha, it fails to predict response in CML. Previously, we and others observed that mitogens, toxins and lectins that bind to cell-surface receptors are endocytosed, escaping endosomes in order to act directly on cellular targets. Therefore, we tested the ability of low concentrations of IFN-alpha (5-10 units) to act directly on DNA polymerase (Pol) in purified chromatin nucleoprotein complexes (NPC). NPC were prepared by a methodology that uses direct treatment of leukocyte nuclei with MspI to generate six NPC-containing fractions (S1, M1, S2, M2, 0.1K and R). We found three general categories of in vitro DNA synthesis response for the six different NPC fractions isolated from the white blood cells of patients with CML (n = 19) before their treatment with IFN-alpha. IFN-alpha induced either stimulation, inhibition or had no apparent effect on Pol activity in the six different NPC fractions in a blind assay. In most of the NPC fractions isolated from the leukocytes of patients with progressive CML and in those from CML patients who failed to show a clinical response to IFN-alpha, this cytokine stimulated or had no effect on Pol activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

Because apoptosis appears to be the predominant mode of tumor cell death after treatment with most antitumor drugs, and in the case of some drugs, the proclivity of the cell to undergo apoptosis varies depending on the cell cycle position, this study was aimed toward elucidating whether induction of apoptosis by AZC is cell cycle phase specific. Human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cells were treated with varying concentrations of AZC, and flow cytometric methods that identify apoptotic cels and provide information about the cell cycle distribution of the apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell populations were used. At 2-6 microM concentrations of AZC, the cells in the G1 phase preferentially underwent apoptosis, whereas the cells in G2-M were particularly resistant. Although incorporation of bromouridine into RNA was suppressed at that low AZC concentration, the rate of 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA was not significantly affected. At an AZC concentration of 8-40 microM, no cell cycle phase specificity in induction of apoptosis was apparent, but both the rate of 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA and bromouridine into RNA were reduced in proportion to drug concentration. The data suggest that the mechanism of cell killing by AZC may be different, depending on its concentration. Namely, whereas incorporation of AZC into RNA may play a predominant role in the induction of cytotoxicity of G1 cells at low drug concentrations, the perturbation of both RNA and DNA metabolism may be responsible for triggering cell death in the G1 and S phases, as is seen at higher concentrations of this antimetabolite.",,,,,,,,,

FISH has the advantage of allowing for a cell by cell analysis of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene rearrangement immediately after flow sorting in nondividing G0/G1 cells that are potentially transcriptionally inactive. We initially selected CD34+ cells with very low expression of the activation antigen CD38 as a candidate phenotype for an immature and hypothetically more benign cell population, but found no enrichment for Ph negativity in that subtype. In five CML samples, 55% +/- 3.3% (mean +/- SE) of CD34+/CD38hi cells had the BCR gene rearrangement, similar to 57% +/- 3.7% seen in the CD34+/CD38lo population. In contrast, subsequent experiments (n = 4) determined that the CD34+/HLA-DRlo population in CML marrow does contain an increased proportion of benign cells: 15% +/- 1% of the CD34+/DRlo cells were BCR rearranged, compared with 52% +/- 5.8% of the CD34+/DRhi cells (P = .001). Our results indicate that benign progenitors in CML are enriched within the CD34+ cells with low DR antigen expression, but not low CD38 expression. One possible interpretation of these observations is that low CD38 antigen expression is not as useful as low HLA-DR expression for isolating immature cells.",,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that SP effects on hematopoiesis are mediated by an NK-1-type receptor, the BM stroma, and growth factors. Here, we have studied the induction of stem cell factor (SCF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) by SP in stroma. At 10(-9) mol/L SP, cytokine levels in supernatants were IL-1 alpha, 20 +/- 5 ng/mL; IL-1 beta, 40 +/- 10 ng/mL; and SCF, nondetectable; and the cell-associated levels were SCF, 21 +/- 2 ng/mL; IL-1 alpha, 90 +/- 6 ng/mL; and IL-1 beta, 45 +/- 3 ng/mL. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and ligand-binding studies with stroma stimulated by these two cytokines resulted in (1) NK-1-like receptor mRNA accumulation and (2) downregulation of SP binding sites (day 1) followed by an upregulation (day 3). Low numbers of high-affinity receptors were expressed by day 1 but not by day 3.

The results presented here strongly suggest that hematopoietic cells are derived from a nonhematopoietic cell population that has been previously thought to give rise to the germ cells. These cells are called primordial germ cells (PGCs) and can be recognized as large cells showing blebbing and pseudopodial extrusions on their surface. They are alkaline phosphatase (AP) positive and possess a stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA-1) on their surface. They represent a small pool of cells in the extraembryonic mesoderm at the base of the allantois in late day-6 embryos. Primordial germ cells from 7.5- and 8.5-day visceral yolk sac and embryo proper form AP+ and SSEA-1+ colonies within 5 days when grown on an embryonic fibroblast feeder cell layer in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), stem cell factor (SCF), and interleukin-3 (IL-3). Individual colonies taken from day-5 cultures can be shown to differentiate into erythroid lineage cells in secondary methyl cellulose culture and produce secondary and tertiary PGCs in the presence of LIF, SCF, and IL-3. Cells taken from the region of the allantois and primitive streak can form colonies on hydrophilic Teflon (DuPont, Wilmington, DE) foils precoated with collagen and fibronectin. The cells from these colonies were then shown to form cobblestone areas on irradiated adult bone marrow stromal layers, indicating that the most primitive in vitro hematopoietic stem cell, the cobblestone-area forming cell (CAFC), was present. PGC colonies were grown in methyl cellulose in the presence of LIF, SCF, and IL-3 for 5 days, and the colonies were removed and passaged 3 times on pretreated extracellular matrix hydrophilic Teflon foils. After each passage, the cells were assayed for their differentiation capacity and PGC content. After the last passage, the number of CAFCs was also determined.

Since 1985, we have entered 30 IF patients into protocols using conditioning with high-dose cyclophosphamide, carmustine (BCNU), and etoposide (VP16-213) with or without cisplatin (CBV +/- P) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with bone marrow (19 patients), peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs; 8 patients), or both (3 patients). All except 2 patients had previously received chemotherapy regimens for HD that contained at least 7 drugs, and 9 had received prior radiotherapy (RT). After documentation of IF, the majority of patients received some cytoreductive therapy as specified by protocol (local RT in 9, two cycles of conventional chemotherapy in 2, both modalities in 2, or high-dose cyclophosphamide to enhance PBSC collection in 11) before CBV +/- P. Five treatment-related deaths occurred, all before day 150 posttransplant. Eleven patients have had progressive HD at a median of 6 months (range, 0.1 to 45 months) after ASCT. The actuarial progression-free survival (PFS) at a median follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 0.2 to 8.2 years) is 42% (95% confidence intervals, 21% to 61%). The statistical analysis identified only prior clinical bleomycin lung toxicity as an adverse risk factor for PFS, mainly because of the increased nonrelapse mortality seen in these patients. CBV +/- P and ASCT can produce durable remission in a substantial proportion of IF HD patients who otherwise have a poor survival, and we believed ASCT approaches represent the best therapy currently available for these patients. Additional measures are needed to reduce the primary problem of disease progression despite high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation.",,,,,,,,,

Seventy-six patients were randomly assigned to receive either G-CSF (n = 37) or no growth factor (n = 39) in conjunction with a uniform chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, intrathecal methotrexate, and cranial irradiation. The median duration of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1 x 10(9)/L) during chemotherapy was 8 days in patients receiving C-CSF, compared with 12.5 days in the control group (P < .002). A similar reduction from 11.5 to 7 days was observed in patients with T-ALL receiving additional mediastinal irradiation (P = .13). Infections occurred in 43% and 56% of patients in the G-CSF and control arm, respectively (P = .25); the incidence of nonviral infections was reduced by 50%, from 32 episodes in the control arm to 16 episodes in the G-CSF arm. Prolonged interruptions of chemotherapy administration were less frequent, with delays of 2 weeks or more occurring in only 24% of patients receiving G-CSF as opposed to 46% in the control arm (P = .01). Accordingly, chemotherapy was completed significantly earlier with the use of G-CSF (39 v 44 days, P = .008). With a median follow-up of 20 months, the probability of disease-free survival was 0.45 in the G-CSF group and 0.43 in the control group (P = .34). In conclusion, adult ALL patients appear to benefit by the simultaneous administration of G-CSF with induction chemotherapy because of a significant reduction in the duration of neutropenia, a trend to fewer infections, and a more rapid completion of chemotherapy.",,,,,,,,,

The G-banding pattern suggested an identical deletion of 9p, but, also, an unbalanced translocation with chromosome 20 was taken into consideration. Dual-color chromosome painting with probes for chromosomes 9 and 20 revealed the presence of material from chromosome 20 at the short arm of the abnormal chromosome 9 in all three cases. Centromeric alpha-satellite DNA of both chromosome 9 and chromosome 20 was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and indicated the presence of a dicentric chromosome. The hybridization of a YAC clone of the short arm of chromosome 20 proved that the dicentric chromosome contained the short arm of chromosome 20, which had been suspected from the G-banding pattern. Thus, the rearrangement was interpreted as dic(9;20)(p11;q11.?1). Because this was the sole chromosome abnormality in two patients, dic(9;20) may be a primary chromosome aberration in ALL. In one case, a 9q+ chromosome derived from a Philadelphia (Ph) translocation was involved in the formation of the dicentric chromosome. Immunophenotyping revealed CD10+ B-cell precursor ALL in all three cases. Whereas the two patients in whom dic(9;20) was the sole cytogenetically detectable change are in continuous complete remission for 10 and 45 months, respectively, the Ph+ patient relapsed with leukemia and died 8 months after diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,

Recently, two genes--AML1, which has a unique runt domain, and ETO (MTG8)--have been isolated from the chromosomal breakpoint. In this study, we isolated and identified two fused transcripts from a leukemic cell line carrying t(8;21). AML1 and ETO were fused at the same position in these transcripts. One of the transcripts codes a unique domain, including two zinc finger domains and three proline- and one leucine-rich region. The other transcript codes only for one proline- and leucine-rich region but lacks zinc finger domains. We demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis that 1) these two transcripts are consistently expressed in leukemic cells with t(8;21) obtained from patients and 2) expression of AML1 was not restricted to the particular stage of hematopoietic differentiation but was present in all hematopoietic cells investigated. We also provide evidence that two wild types of ETO transcripts containing the region of the ETO gene in fused transcripts are expressed in hematopoietic cells from different lineages. The widespread expression of AML1 and ETO in hematopoietic cells suggests a fundamental role of these proteins in hematopoiesis. Furthermore, the differences in the carboxy termini of ETO may modulate the activity of fused proteins resulting from the chromosomal translocation t(8;21).",,"['GENBANK/S78158', 'GENBANK/S78159']",,,"['AML1', 'ETO']",,,,

A small percentage of DLBLs express the CD5 antigen. The majority of these cases have evolved from a pre-existing low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Richter's syndrome). However, we identified and characterized nine CD5-positive DLBLs in which the patients did not have a previous history or concomitant evidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, suggesting that they arose de novo. All nine cases expressed CD20 and monotypic immunoglobulin, all eight cases examined expressed CD19, CD22 and CD43, eight of the nine cases expressed HLA-DR, and two of eight cases expressed CD11c. None of the cases expressed CD3, CD10, CD11b, CD21, CD23 or CD30. CD5 expression by these cells was found to be identical to that of CD5-positive B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of CD5 mRNA. These nine de novo CD5-positive DLBLs exhibited clonal immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene rearrangements but lacked integration of the Epstein-Barr virus genome and structural alterations of the bcl-1, bcl-2, c-myc, H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras proto-oncogenes and the p53 tumor suppressor gene. However, bcl-6 proto-oncogene rearrangement, which is involved in chromosome band 3q27 aberrations, was found in four cases (44.4%). This is comparable with the frequency of bcl-6 gene rearrangement in CD5-negative DLBL. In contrast, bcl-6 gene rearrangement was absent in six cases of DLBL associated with Richter's syndrome. These findings suggest that de novo CD5-positive DLBLs are genotypically similar to CD5-negative DLBLs and may be pathogenetically distinct from the DLBLs associated with Richter's syndrome.",PMC1869880,,,,['bcl-6'],,,,

Similar to non-malignant NK-cells, these tumors can be divided into those which express the CD3-T-cell receptor complex and those which do not. The CD3-positive type of LGL-leukemia is immunophenotypologically characterized by the expression of CD16, and variably CD 56 and CD 57, and generally follows a more indolent course. In contrast, malignant proliferations of CD3-negative LGL express either CD16 or CD 56, and only occasionally CD 57 on their cell surface. Clinically, CD3-negative NK-lymphomas tend to progress rapidly. We report here the case of a high grade malignant lymphoma which was characterized by an immunophenotype typical for CD3-negative NK-cells (CD2+, CD3-, CD16+, CD56(+), CD57-). The disease proved to be rapidly fatal despite aggressive chemotherapy. Interestingly, the patient suffered from a high turn over pancytopenia, which also characterizes NK-cell leukemias/lymphomas of the LGL-type. However, our patient's lymphatic cells appeared highly immature, and cytoplasmic granules, characteristic for LGL-cells, could not be discerned either microscopically or electronmicroscopically.

To investigate the relevance of HSP27 to the pathological change of astrocytes, phosphorylation of HSP27 was examined in astrocyte cultures isolated from fetal human brains. In unstimulated human astrocytes, HSP27 was identified in the cytoplasm and was comprised of a major unphosphorylated ""a"" isoform and a minor monophosphorylated ""b"" isoform. The level of HSP27 phosphorylation was elevated greatly after a 30 minute exposure to heat shock, sodium arsenite, interleukin-1 (IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) with an increased expression of a diphosphorylated ""c"" isoform. Treatment with interferon-beta (IFN-beta), platelet-derived growth factor-AA, leukemia inhibitory factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP stimulated phosphorylation of HSP27 moderately, while IFN-gamma, TNF-beta, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or fetal bovine serum did not significantly alter the level of HSP27 phosphorylation. Total amount of the HSP27 protein and its cytoplasmic localization were unaffected by any of these reagents. These results indicate that HSP27 is a constitutive protein in human astrocytes. The induction of HSP27 phosphorylation by a specific set of cytokines and growth factors suggests that HSP27 is a key cellular substrate by which signaling events are mediated in human astrocytes under normal and pathological conditions.",,,,,,,,,

Here we investigate Ca2+ signals in individual blastomeres of zebrafish embryos with the goal to better understand the role of PI and Ca2+ signaling for early vertebrate embryogenesis. Initial studies showed that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) concentration increases after the 32-cell stage of development, suggesting that IP3-mediated Ca2+ signals may be present during the blastula stage. Ca2+ signals were measured by identifying individual cells using confocal imaging of a nuclear localized Ca2+ indicator. Using this in situ indicator, changes in Ca2+ concentration were measured over several hours in each cell of a series of sections through the developing embryo. Transient increases in Ca2+ concentration that lasted 20-50 sec (Ca2+ spikes) were first triggered during the 32- to 128-cell stage in cells of the outer embryonic cell layer. These cells develop epithelial characteristics and specialize into the enveloping layer (EVL). No Ca2+ activity was observed during the earlier cleavage cycles or in deep blastomeres. Ca2+ spikes remained restricted to the EVL until the end of the blastula stage. Ca2+ spikes in neighboring EVL cells often occurred in the same short time interval, indicating that small groups of EVL cells can synchronize their activity. When averaged over several cell cycles, Ca2+ activity showed an even distribution in the EVL and did not indicate future polarities.",,,,,,,,,

However, it is unknown which class of DRG neurons express c-kit receptor and which factor regulates differentiation and survival of c-kit-positive neurons. In the present study, we attempted to characterize c-kit positive neurons in the mouse DRG. The c-kit-positive neurons were small or medium in size, and 44% of these neurons contained substance P. Central fibers of the c-kit-positive neurons terminated in laminae I and II of the gray matter of the spinal cord. These results suggest that c-kit-positive neurons in the DRG belong to a functional subpopulation. The c-kit receptor protein was presented on the membrane of processes and growth cones in neurons. When DRG cells of embryonic day 15.5 or 17.5 were cultured, the survival of c-kit-positive neurons was supported by SCF, nerve growth factor (NGF) or leukemia inhibitory factor. SCF and NGF synergistically supported the survival of c-kit-positive neurons at submaximal concentrations. c-kit-positive DRG neurons from neonatal mice survived without addition of any factor in culture, suggesting that the requirement for trophic support in c-kit-positive neurons changes during development.",,,,,,,,,

Also, it is not known whether mutations of the dck gene are the result of selection of mutants or de novo induction. To address these issues, three subclones of a rat leukemic cell line (RCL/O), sensitive to cytotoxicity mediated by AraC and DAC, were exposed to gradually increasing concentrations (from 0.1 to 10 microM) of either AraC or DAC over a 140 days vs a 180 days period.

We found that all clones acquired irreversible cross-resistance, at marginally cytotoxic AraC or DAC concentrations of 0.1 to 0.4 times the IC50 for the parental clones. Furthermore, all resistant cell lines were DCK deficient and harbored different mutations in the dck gene. AraC induced both rearrangements and point mutations in the dck gene when administered over 140 days and 180 days, respectively. 140 days DAC induction yielded point mutations only. All point mutations detected were nonrandomly distributed within the dck coding region. SSCP analysis showed that in the majority of resistant clones more than one bandshift was present. The data suggest the presence of multiple resistant clones, originating from one sensitive clone and thus arguing against selection of mutants as a mechanism for the development of AraC and DAC resistance.",,,,,,,,,

Thirty-five out of 38 patients were treated with 1-2 regimens of daunorubicin (DNR)/cytarabine (Ara-C), and 57% attained a complete remission (CR). Failure to achieve a CR correlated with autonomous growth (P = 0.0064), CD34 and P-gp expression alone (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.048 respectively), and with simultaneous expression of P-gp and CD34 (P = 0.0001), but not with expression of the non-P-gp drug resistance associated-protein (p110), the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), Ara-CTP formation or Ara-C incorporation, respectively. AML cells with CD34/P-gp double expression were more frequently observed in samples with high autonomous growth (P = 0.003). The median survival was 6 months in CD34+/P-gp+ patients as compared with 15 months in other AML patients (P = 0.003). In patients with de novo AML who fail on chemotherapy, a population of autonomously proliferating, immature AML cells with a multidrug resistant phenotype can be recognized. These cells thus show primary resistance to chemotherapy and have the potential for rapid regrowth, leading to resistant disease.",,,,,,,,,

When used to infect embryonic chicken haematopoietic cells two types of self-renewing progenitors are obtained, namely myeloblasts and 'MEPs' (Myb-Ets progenitors). In earlier work we have shown that myeloblasts transformed by the ts21 mutant of E26, which has a lesion in v-Myb, can be induced to differentiate into macrophages following shift to the non-permissive temperature. Here we show that the ts21 v-Myb is temperature sensitive for DNA binding in band shift experiments and that its inactivation in transformed MEPs induces their maturation into thrombocytes. The MEP transforming capacity of v-Myb is not confined to its fusion with v-Ets, as it is also seen with a virus that co-expresses tsMyb with v-ErbB. As with wild-type E26-transformed MEPs, ts21-transformed MEPs are multipotent, differentiating into eosinophils and myeloblasts following treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In addition, ts21-transformed myeloblasts differentiate into macrophages when shifted to the non-permissive temperature. This shows that v-Myb blocks haematopoietic differentiation at two distinct stages. In contrast, v-Ets inactivation in MEPs transformed by a ts E26 mutant with a lesion in the corresponding oncoprotein leads to their differentiation into erythrocytes, myeloblasts and probably eosinophils. These data show that the two domains of Myb-Ets selectively affect decision making processes in different types and stages of haematopoietic cells.",PMC398405,,,,,,,,

Studies with a variety of cell lines demonstrated that Cl-F-ara-A is a potent cytotoxic agent; in cell-free systems, its triphosphate (Cl-F-ara-ATP) inhibited DNA polymerase alpha and ribonucleotide reductase. To further characterize its mechanism of cytotoxicity, the present study investigated the cellular metabolism of Cl-F-ara-A and the actions of its nucleotide metabolites in human T-lymphoblast leukemia CCRF-CEM cells. The mono-, di-, and triphosphates of Cl-F-ara-A accumulated in cells, with the monophosphate as its major metabolite. After washing cells into drug-free medium, the elimination of each Cl-F-ara-A nucleotide was nonlinear with a prolonged terminal phase. Incubation of CCRF-CEM cells with Cl-F-ara-A resulted in the incorporation of Cl-F-ara-AMP into DNA; a much lesser amount was associated with RNA, suggesting that Cl-F-ara-A is a more DNA-directed compound. The site of Cl-F-ara-AMP in DNA was related to the ratio of the cellular concentrations of the analogue triphosphate and the natural substrate dATP. At low Cl-F-ara-ATP:dATP values, incorporation was mainly in phosphodiester linkages at internal sites, whereas at higher Cl-F-ara-ATP:dATP values, Cl-F-ara-AMP was principally detected at terminal sites. Clonogenicity assays showed a strong inverse correlation between cell survival and Cl-F-ara-AMP incorporation into DNA. These results suggest that the incorporation of Cl-F-ara-A monophosphate into DNA is critical for the cytotoxicity of Cl-F-ara-A.",,,,,,,,,

While dye-efflux was measurable in 3/4 of the cases, the capacity of the P-glycoprotein inhibitors varied substantially among patients. In 23 patients, P-glycoprotein function was completely inhibited by the resistance modulators, whereas in 17 patients neither verapamil nor cyclosporine had any reverting effect on dye-efflux at concentrations even 10-times higher than achievable in vivo.

However, flow cytometric evaluation of the staining of gated blast cells with the anti-P-glycoprotein antibody, 4E3.16, revealed no difference in P-glycoprotein expression between modulator-sensitive and -insensitive cases (p = 0.86), indicating disproportionate translation of MDR1 mRNA.

To date, the characterization of Thy-1 expression has been confined largely to normal tissues and cell lines. In this study, we evaluated the frequency and intensity of Thy-1 expression as defined by reactivity with the anti-Thy-1 antibody 5E10 in 38 cases of CD34+ acute leukemia (21 acute myelogenous leukemia [AML], 8 chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML] in blast crisis, and 9 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]). In 34 of 38 cases (89%) the CD34+ cells lacked expression of the Thy-1 antigen. High-density Thy-1 expression was found in 1 case of CML in lymphoid blast crisis, and low-density Thy-1 expression was identified on a portion of the leukemic cells in 2 cases of AML with myelodysplastic features, and 1 case of CML in myeloid blast crisis, suggesting a possible correlation between Thy-1 expression and certain instances of stem cell disorders such as CML and AML with dysplastic features. In contrast, the dissociation of Thy-1 and CD34 expression in the majority of acute leukemias studied suggests that the development of these leukemias occurs at a later stage than the hematopoietic stem cell. Characterization of Thy-1 expression in acute leukemia may eventually provide insights into the origin of the disease. In addition, separation of leukemic blasts from normal stem cells based on Thy-1 expression may prove useful in assessing residual disease, as well as in excluding leukemic blasts from stem cell preparations destined for autologous bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation.",,,,,,,,,

A potential role for Id and TAL1/E2A bHLH genes in hematopoiesis has been suggested by studies on immortalized cell lines. However, it is uncertain whether these observations reflect normal hematopoiesis. We have investigated the expression pattern of Id2 and TAL1/E2A genes in liquid suspension culture of purified hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPCs) undergoing erythroid or granulopoietic differentiation in the first culture week and maturation to terminal cells in the second week. In quiescent, freshly purified HPCs, Id2 mRNA is detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), whereas TAL1 and E2A mRNAs are not. At the onset of erythroid differentiation, Id2 mRNA is downregulated, while E2A and TAL1 mRNAs are concomitantly upregulated: their expression is further increased at erythroblast level. Conversely, Id2 is not downmodulated in granulopoietic culture, except for a late decline at day 10 to 12, while TAL1 and E2A are only transiently induced in the first week of granulopoietic differentiation. The expression pattern of the TAL1/E2A heterodimer, as evaluated by mobility shift assay, is consistent with RT-PCR results (except for lower levels of the heterodimer in late erythroid maturation). TAL1 protein level, analyzed by Western blot, shows a pattern consistent with gelshift results. Functional experiments were performed on purified HPCs treated with phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to Id2 or TAL1 mRNA. The results are strictly consistent with the expression studies: anti-Id2 oligomer (alpha-Id2) causes a significant dose-dependent increase of erythroid colony formation, whereas alpha-TAL1 induces a selective dose-related inhibitory effect on erythroid colonies, as compared with untreated or scrambled oligomer-treated control HPCs. Finally, murine and human glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-Id2 polypeptides compete the TAL1/E2A-specific DNA binding activity when added to the nuclear extracts derived from erythroid culture cells, thus indicating biochemical and suggesting functional interaction of Id2 with the TAL1/E2A complex. These novel observations indicate a coordinate expression and function of an inhibitory Id protein (Id2) and a stimulatory bHLH/bHLH heterodimer (TAL1/E2A) in normal erythroid differentiation.",,,,,"['E2A', 'GATA-1', 'Id2', 'SCL', 'TAL1', 'TCL5']",,,,

Five patients with haematological malignancy associated with DIC were studied. r-Hirudin was administered by continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.005 mg/kg/h for 4-9 days to each patient. Fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), D-dimer, TAT and plasmin-alpha 2 antiplasmin complex (PAP) concentrations decreased after treatment with r-hirudin in four patients studied. However, in one patient, serum creatinine increased to 1.7 mg/dl and aPTT was prolonged to 74.4s. Statistical analysis disclosed significant positive correlations between plasma concentrations of hirudin and THC, and between concentrations of THC and TAT. The concentrations of THC were much higher than those of TAT. In conclusion, these findings indicate that r-hirudin more strongly inhibited thrombin than did ATIII without heparin, and that administration of r-hirudin to renal insufficiency required individual adjustment of dosage. The present findings also suggest that r-hirudin can be considered a new agent for the treatment of DIC.",,,,,,,,,

Different compounds known to stimulate cAMP accumulation in cells were used: dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP), isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX) or pentoxifylline (PTX) and forskolin. Treatments with db-cAMP or IBMX (10-1,000 microM) induced a dose-dependent increase in vWf synthesis. Associations of IBMX with forskolin produced a synergistic enhancement in vWf synthesis. PTX alone did not enhance vWf synthesis but a latent effect was revealed in the presence of forskolin or db-cAMP. The increase in vWf mRNA shown by Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the protein synthesis correlates with the transcript expression after db-cAMP or IBMX treatments. vWf synthesis paralleled the accumulation of cAMP in the cells. Moreover vWf expression induced by combination of IBMX with forskolin was associated with a moderate increase in the percentage of GPIIb/IIIa positive cells and in the ploidy level related to an important inhibition of cell growth. These data provide evidence that agents acting on cAMP metabolism induce vWf synthesis in the Dami megakaryoblastic cells.",,,,,,,,,

We investigated the repopulation of lymphocyte subpopulations and their relation with clinical parameters such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), graft-versus-leukaemia and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The number of repopulated T cells varied strongly between the blood samples of the recipients. In 45% of the recipients the number of T cells recovered to or above normal levels within 3 months after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), whereas the other recipients remained below normal up to 1 year after BMT. In recipients with a high repopulation, the CD8+ T-cell subset contributed more to this high repopulation than the CD4+ T-cell subset. We showed that the majority of T cells of these recipients expressed the alpha beta T-cell receptor, CD8, CD57 and CD11b. HLA-DR was also highly expressed reflecting the activation stage of T cells in these recipients. BMT recipients with a high repopulation of CD8+ T cells showed a lower incidence of leukaemic relapse than recipients with a low repopulation. The 3-year probability of relapse was 19% versus 64% (P = 0.03), respectively. The relative high number of CD8+ T cells at 3 months after BMT was not associated with the incidence of GVHD. In contrast, occurrence of CMV infection after BMT was significantly higher in these recipients. Our results indicate that CD8+ T cells, predominantly CD57+, of BMT recipients with an expansion of these cells represent an in vivo activated cell population. This CD8+ T-cell population may consist partially of cytotoxic cells with anti-leukaemic activity as suggested by a low relapse rate. The signal for the strong expansion of these CD8+CD57+ T cells after BMT is still unclear, but association with CMV infection suggests that viral antigens are involved.",,,,,,,,,

Growth factor re-addition induced, within 2 h, the appearance of GM-CSF mRNA. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrated that the increase of GM-CSF mRNA levels depends on GM-CSF gene transcription. The simultaneous addition, to deprived cells, of the growth factor, and of cycloheximide (CHX) for 2 h inhibited GM-CSF mRNA expression, suggesting the requirement for newly made proteins for GM-CSF gene transcription. By means of the M-07e bioassay, which allows the detection of GM-CSF, IL-3 and MGF activities, and neutralizing antibodies to each of these factors, GM-CSF activity was detected in the cell-free extract of both IL-3- and MGF-sustained cells and of cells deprived for 24 h. This finding demonstrates that M-07e cells produce and store biologically active GM-CSF in response to both IL-3 and MGF. In contrast, analysis of the growth stimulatory activity present in the culture supernatants revealed that MGF, unlike IL-3, is able to induce the secretion of consistent amounts of GM-CSF. Taken together, our results suggest that, in M-07e cells, GM-CSF gene transcription and GM-CSF production are mediated, unlike its secretion, by mechanisms shared by IL-3 and MGF.",,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the effects of SP and beta-amyloid peptide on cell viability in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, by means of the WST-1 tetrazolium and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays.

Disialoganglioside GD2 is a glycolipid expressed at high levels in human tumors and a small group of murine lymphomas (EL4, RBL5, RMA, RMA-S, A13, and BALBRVE). Immunization of C57B1/6 mice with irradiated EL4 cells stimulated a specific CTL response and protected these animals from engraftment of EL4 lymphoma. The CTL activity resided in the CD4-CD8+ population, was dependent on T cell receptor alpha/beta, and was not removed by anti-natural killer cell immunoabsorption, but was restricted to GD2 and H-2b bearing targets. CTL activity could be completely inhibited by GD2-oligosaccharide-specific monoclonal antibodies and their F(ab')2 fragments, but not by immunoglobulin G3 myelomas or antibodies against GD3 or GM2. Soluble GD2 did not inhibit specific tumor lysis. RMA-S lymphoma cells (GD2+H-2b-TAP2 deficient) were resistant to GD2-specific CTL. Sialic acid-containing peptides eluted from EL4 lymphoma cells could (a) stabilize H-2 molecules on RMA-S cells and (b) sensitize them for GD2-specific CTL. Control peptides (derived from vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein peptide and GD2-negative lymphomas) could also stabilize H-2 on RMA-S, but were resistant to GD2-specific CTL. These H-2-binding peptides could be purified by anti-GD2 affinity chromatography. We postulate a new class of naturally occurring epitopes for T cells where branched-chain oligosaccharides are linked to peptides with anchoring motifs for the major histocompatibility complex class I pocket. While analogous to the haptens trinitrophenyl and O-beta-linked acetyl-glucosamine, the potential implications of natural carbohydrates as antigenic epitopes for CTL in biology are considerable.",PMC2192096,,,,,,,,

It is not yet known what physiologic factors modulate G-CSF receptor mRNA expression in these cells. We studied the effect of G-CSF on freshly isolated neutrophils and bone marrow cells from normal human subjects and on myeloid leukemic cell lines. We found that G-CSF receptor mRNA levels were maintained by G-CSF in neutrophils but not in bone marrow cells. Of the leukemic cell lines tested, K562 and BV173, both of which contain the bcr-abl translocation, neither expressed G-CSF receptor mRNA. Whereas G-CSF did not affect mRNA levels for its receptor in myeloid leukemic cell lines, exposure of the acute promyelocytic cell line, NB4, to all-trans retinoic acid induced a striking increase in G-CSF receptor mRNA expression and resulted in increased G-CSF receptor surface expression. The effect of retinoic acid on G-CSF receptor mRNA on NB4 cells occurred early, before morphologic evidence of differentiation, and required protein synthesis. All-trans retinoic acid also upregulated G-CSF receptor mRNA in the myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. Thus, maintenance of G-CSF receptor on neutrophils by G-CSF may extend the duration of ligand responsiveness. Furthermore, the ability of retinoic acid to up-regulate G-CSF receptor may account for the synergistic effect of G-CSF and retinoic acid in differentiation induction of acute promyelocytic leukemia.",,,,,,,,,

We raised a new mAb C8A2, that specifically recognizes NDP52. Immunofluorescence analysis using this mAb showed a typical nuclear dot staining as it was described for ND10. Isolation and sequencing of the corresponding cDNA revealed that NDP52 has a predicted molecular mass of 52 kD. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibits an extended central coiled coil domain containing a leucine zipper motif. The COOH terminus of NDP52 shows homology with LIM domains, that have recently been described to mediate protein interactions, which let NDP52 appear as a suitable candidate for mediating interactions between ND10 proteins. In vivo, NDP52 is transcribed in all human tissues analyzed.

However, we observed that A-MuLV-transformed cell lines are often B220- while maintaining high levels of ""pan"" CD45 expression. In vitro transformation of murine bone marrow revealed that the stromal microenvironment over which A-MuLV-transformed lymphoblasts are grown affected the B220 phenotype of the pre-B cells. Over a period of a few weeks, B220+ populations grown over a clonal stromal cell line gradually became B220-. However, the transition from a B220+ to B220- phenotype was dependent on the lot of fetal calf serum used. In contrast, cells grown over a heterogeneous bone marrow stroma maintained B220+ expression for long periods of time. The appearance of B220- cells in clonal B220+ populations indicated that the change in phenotype resulted in part from modulation of B220 expression. B220- B-cell lines did not express the high molecular weight CD45 RNA species indicating that the B220- phenotype was due to alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Finally, the shift from B220+ to B220- was not accompanied by changes in the stage of development of the cultures.

We describe a unique case of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with circulating PM. The patient, a 48-year-old man, presented initially with refractory anemia. Four years later his general condition deteriorated, accompanied by an increase in leukocytes to 200,000/microliters blood. The bone marrow histology was interpreted as compatible with a diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Two months before he died, the patient developed generalized lymphadenopathy clinically simulating malignant lymphoma. Histologic examination of an axillary lymph node revealed diffuse infiltration by PM. The PM in the lymph node and some circulating cells closely resembling PM expressed L-selectin, a finding that could be interpreted as a morphologic correlate of their marked lymphotropism. The detection of large numbers of CD56/CD33 double-positive circulating blast cells by FACS analysis strongly supported the diagnosis of a leukemia of myelogenous origin. The patient died of tumor cachexia. Autopsy revealed widespread leukemic infiltrates (always containing clusters of PM) in bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of the oropharynx. The final diagnosis was one of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with marked lymphotropism and partial differentiation towards PM. We consider that the rare instances of a hematologic tumor with differentiation towards PM should be classified amongst the myelogenous leukemias.",,,,,,,,,

However, the first cells that grow and transiently dominate the cultures, while similar to melanocytes, are unpigmented. These have been shown to be precursors of melanocytes and may be termed melanoblasts. Under our previous standard culture conditions, involving the use of keratinocyte feeder cells, foetal calf serum, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) and cholera toxin, all the melanoblasts spontaneously differentiated to pigmented melanocytes within about 3 weeks. We now describe some factors affecting the proliferation and differentiation of diploid murine melanoblasts in the presence of serum. Murine stem cell factor/steel factor (SCF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and murine leukaemia inhibitory factor/differentiation-inhibiting activity (LIF/DIA) all increased melanoblast numbers. SCF and LIF also slightly inhibited melanoblast differentiation, while cholera toxin and TPA promoted differentiation. Using some of these findings, and by regular replacement of keratinocyte or fibroblastoid feeder cells, we have established a clonal line of immortal murine melanoblasts, 'melb-a'. These cells express tyrosinase-related protein-2 but not, in general, tyrosinase. They can be induced to differentiate irreversibly to functional melanocytes (also proliferative and immortal) by plating in the absence of feeder cells. Thus a new immortal melanocyte line, 'melan-a2', has also been produced.",,,,,,,,,

CD44 is an adhesion molecule expressed by B and T lymphocytes that mediates cell attachment to extracellular matrix components and specific cell surface ligands. In normal process of T-cell development, CD44 can be implicated in homing of bone marrow-derived T-cell precursors into the thymus. In hematopoietic malignancies, CD44 and other adhesion molecules can mediate the behavior of neoplastic cells such as metastatic migration. In the leukemic process, CD44 expression is correlated with increased numbers of circulating blasts and it is present at other sites such as the central nervous system. 2. In the present study, CD44 was investigated in lymphoblasts from 30 patients with T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and in peripheral lymphocytes from 10 healthy individuals. CD44 expression was detected in 23 (77%) of T-ALL cases studied and was correlated with clinical features such as mediastinal mass, adenomegaly, and infiltration of the central nervous system and other organs. Interestingly, CD44 expression in patients with tumor infiltration was higher than in patients with no tumor infiltration. 3. These data suggest that CD44 may be regarded as an additional marker for tumor expansion in T-cell leukemias.",,,,,,,,,

Two years later, a secondary acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) was diagnosed.

Among the CD5- CLL, there were significantly more cases with advanced stage (Rai and Binet) and splenomegaly. The cytological study found more mixed CLL according to FAB classification (more prolymphocytes). There were significantly more CD23-, FMC7+, SIg strong positive cases. A score from 0 to 6 was established based on clinical, cytological and immunophenotypic criteria. Typical CD5+ CLL was scored 0, score 6 corresponded to typical PLL. There were significantly more higher scores amongst CD5- CLL. It therefore appears that CD5- CLLs share certain features with B PLL. The use of this scoring system will allow determination of prognosis within these different categories, thus identifying groups which require specific therapy.",,,,,,,,,

In hematopoiesis, recent data indicate that not only leukemic cells, but also some populations of normal hematopoietic cells, particularly CD34+ progenitor cells as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes, express a functional multidrug-resistant phenotype. Among CD34+ cells, we found evidence that myeloid committed precursor cells (CD34+/CD33+) have lower levels of MDR1 expression than earlier CD34+ cell populations, but there was no difference in MDR1 expression between CD34+/HLA-DR- and CD34+/HLA-DR+ subpopulations. During normal myeloid differentiation, MDR1 expression is down-regulated, which is similar to our observations in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML): MDR1 expression was only rarely detected in acute promyelocytic leukemia, which was in contrast to other subtypes of AML; also, within leukemic subpopulations of the same patient, higher MDR1 levels were correlated with a more immature immunophenotype. Regarding regulation of MDR1 expression, we did not observe changes of MDR1 expression in normal CD34+ cells in response to various cytokines. However, in 2 patients with AML treated with interleukin-3 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, respectively, a significant down-regulation of MDR1 expression was found after 24 hours. In conclusion, there is evidence that the pattern of MDR1 expression observed in leukemias reflects the distribution of MDR1 in normal hematopoiesis. In contrast to normal CD34+ cells, leukemic cells from some AML patients can respond to cytokines with a down-regulation of MDR1, which may contribute to response to cytokine/chemotherapy combinations.",,,,,['MDR1'],,,,

In this study, 107 additional B- and T-cell neoplasms were studied, including 47 cases of high grade lymphoma (33 diffuse large B-cell type, 9 Burkitt and Burkitt-like, 4 precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, and 1 adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia), 38 additional cases of low grade B-cell lymphoma (18 CLL, 15 hairy cell leukemia and 5 mantle cell lymphoma), and 22 plasmacytomas for expression of cyclin D1 using the same immunohistochemical staining technique.

Cyclin D1 does not appear to play an important role in high grade lymphomas. In addition, most CD5 positive high grade B-cell lymphomas do not express cyclin D1, and are not likely to be derived from mantle cell lymphoma or other lymphomas with t(11;14).",,,,,,,,,

We find that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells from most patients coexpress both membrane-bound and soluble CD27, along with its newly identified ligand, CD70. The expression of soluble CD27 may preclude leukemic B cells from stimulating T cells via CD70, thereby potentially impairing their ability to function as effective antigen-presenting cells. We find that leukemic B-cell expression of soluble and membrane-bound CD27 can be downmodulated through a CD40-dependent signal. This signal also induces enhanced expression of CD70 on both normal and leukemic B cells. We find that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, or the Th1 cytokine interferon (IFN)-gamma, also can induce downmodulation of CD27, whereas Th2-associated cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) or IL-10 can enhance leukemic B-cell expression of this accessory molecule. The modulation of CD27 induced by these conditions is accompanied by reciprocal changes in the expression levels of CD70, suggesting that these accessory molecules may be engaged in reciprocal receptor-ligand downmodulation. Consistent with this, we observe that co-culture of CLL B cells with transfected murine plasmacytoma cells that express human CD70 affects downmodulation of CD27 and enhanced expression of CD70 on leukemic B cells, but does not affect expression of CD27 mRNA. However, we find that CD40-crosslinking, in addition to reducing the level of CD27 protein, also reduces leukemic B-cell expression of CD27 mRNA. This argues that the changes in the expression levels of CD27 following CD40-signaling are not simply due to induced increases in the expression levels of CD70. Finally, we demonstrate that reciprocal changes in expression of CD27 and CD70 may contribute to the enhanced antigen-presenting capacity of CLL B cells after CD40-dependent leukemic B-cell activation. These findings expand the understanding of the regulation of costimulatory molecules important in antigen presentation and also have implications for the immunobiology of and therapy for CLL.",,,,,,,,,

We examined the effects of IFN gamma and SLF treatment, alone or in combination, on the expression of a 33-kD cytoplasmic protein serine/threonine kinase designated pim-1 whose expression has been closely associated with proliferation induced by related myeloid cytokines. IFN gamma alone, but not SLF, stimulated expression of pim-1 RNA and protein in MO7e cells; compared with IFN gamma alone, costimulation with IFN gamma and SLF resulted in a twofold to threefold increase in pim-1 message and protein expression, correlating with synergistic effects on cell proliferation. Both IFN gamma and IFN gamma/SLF induced pim-1 mRNA in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. Nuclear run-on assays showed that, although IFN gamma alone increased the rate of pim-1 gene transcription, costimulation with IFN gamma and SLF did not further potentiate this effect; however, the stability of pim-1 message was significantly enhanced in the presence of both cytokines. An IFN gamma-responsive element within the 5' flanking region of the pim-1 gene that could confer IFN gamma responsiveness on a heterologous promoter was identified. This sequence, designated PMGAS, formed a specific complex with Stat (signal transducers and activators of transcription) 1 alpha (the p91 subunit of the transcription factor ISGF3 [interferon-stimulated gene factor 3]) in IFN gamma-treated cell extracts, suggesting that the transcriptional effects of IFN gamma on pim-1 expression may be mediated by Stat 1 alpha.",,,,,['pim-1'],,,,

In addition, P-selectin bound all precursors (pre-CFU) of committed myeloid progenitors assayed by their ability to sustain hematopoiesis in both conventional stroma-containing and stroma-free, cytokine-dependent systems. Binding of CD34+ cells to P-selectin was temperature-independent and shear-resistant, occurred only in the presence of divalent cations, was protease sensitive, and was completely blocked by anti-P-selectin antibody. Neuraminidase treatment of CD34+ cells completely abrogated their binding to P-selectin, implying a prominent role for sialic acid in the structure and function of the P-selectin ligand on hematopoietic progenitors. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) CSLEX-1 and HECA-452, which identify carbohydrate epitopes involving sialic acid, bound to 33% and 35% of CD34+ cells, respectively, and included the majority of CFU-GM and pre-CFU. Three-color flow cytometric analysis showed a precise codistribution of CSLEX-1 and HECA-452 antigens on CD34+ cells, implying recognition of the same glycoprotein antigen by the two MoAbs. Treatment of CD34+ cells with neuraminidase completely abolished binding of both MoAbs. In addition, HECA-452 partially blocked the adhesion of CD34+ cells to P-selectin. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL-1), recently molecularly cloned from the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60, was expressed by CD34+ cells as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

To investigate the signal transduction pathway of these three phenomena, we studied the effect of herbimycin A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase (TK) and the effects of calphostin C, a specific inhibitor protein kinase C (PKC) on TPA treated MEG-01 cells. Both herbimycin A and calphostin C inhibited all three TPA-induced phenomena, suggesting that both pathways are required for these phenomena. Herbimycin A but not calphostin C blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Immunohistochemical staining of PKC using an anti-PKC monoclonal antibody showed that herbimycin A did not interfere with the translocation and subsequent down regulation of PKC induced by TPA, suggesting that the TPA-induced effect on PKC (translocation and probably its activation) is not dependent on TK. Induction of c-fos and c-jun expression by TPA was inhibited by both herbimycin A and calphostin C, suggesting that both PKC and TK pathways are necessary for the induction of the TPA-induced transcription factor AP1, which is a known TPA-inducible early immediate gene product. Taken together, our results show that the tyrosine kinase signal transduction system as well as the PKC pathway is indispensable for the TPA-induced phenomena of morphologic change, cell attachment, early immediate gene expression, and lineage-specific phenotypic expression in the MEG-01 cell line.",,,,,,,,,

By the same analysis, a partial epitope for gp130 was also identified on the surface of helix A that faces away from the alpha-epitope. Superposition of the CNTF and growth hormone structures showed that the location of these epitopes on CNTF is analogous to the location of the first and second receptor epitopes on the surface of growth hormone. Further comparison with proposed binding sites for alpha- and beta-receptors on interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor indicated that this epitope topology is conserved among helical cytokines. In each case, epitope I is utilized by the specificity-conferring component, whereas epitopes II and III are used by accessory components.

Furthermore, incubation with 7C11 causes death of hematopoietic cell lines that express APO-1/Fas but not APO-1/Fas-negative cell lines. 7C11 therefore recognizes the human APO-1/Fas (CD95) antigen, a 40 to 50 kDa cell surface glycoprotein that can trigger apoptosis or programmed cell death. Expression of APO-1/Fas antigen by normal and neoplastic hematopoietic cells was determined by flow cytometry using 7C11. APO-1/Fas is expressed by approximately 30 to 40% of resting peripheral blood T cells, B cells, and monocytes and by approximately 5% of resting NK cells and thymocytes. It was not detected on granulocytes, erythrocytes, or platelets. Approximately 80 to 90% of activated T cells, B cells, and thymocytes express APO-1/Fas, as do the majority of activated NK cells. Perturbation of APO-1/Fas by 7C11 does not affect the viability of resting lymphocytes or monocytes. In contrast, activated T cells and NK cells undergo apoptosis within 3 hours of exposure to 7C11. Other mAb that stimulate T cells or NK cells do not cause rapid induction of programmed cell death. APO-1/Fas antigen is expressed by many cell lines of lymphoid and myeloid lineage. However, this antigen was detected on neoplastic cells from only one of 69 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or multiple myeloma. Only 3 out of 25 tumor samples from patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were found to express APO-1/Fas. All three of these lymphomas harbored the bcl-2-Ig fusion gene associated with the chromosomal translocation t (14;18). Conversely, only 27% of lymphomas that possessed the bcl-2-Ig gene were found to express the APO-1/Fas antigen. Like normal activated lymphocytes, leukemia and lymphoma cells that expressed APO-1/Fas antigen were found to undergo apoptosis in vitro after incubation with 7C11. The APO-1/Fas antigen appears to regulate the growth of normal hematopoietic cells, and the marked upregulation of this antigen on activated normal lymphocytes contrasts sharply with the absence of APO-1/Fas on neoplastic cells of hematopoietic lineage. Defects in the apoptotic signal delivered through this antigen might contribute to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic neoplasms.

For this purpose, fifty-three CD7+ patients (23 females and 30 males; mean age 52 years) were analyzed and classified into the following subtypes according to French-American-British (FAB) classification: 7 M0, 13 M1, 9 M2, 1 M3, 9 M4, 14 M5. Immunophenotypic studies were carried out by flow cytometry and blast cells were selected on the basis of forward light scatter gating and pan-myeloid marker, either CD13 or CD33. All the CD7+ patients were negative for surface CD3 and T-cell-receptor (TCR) molecules. We found no correlation between CD7 expression and sex, age, hepatosplenomegaly and/or central nervous system involvement. The immaturity of CD7+ leukemic cells was supported by the high expression of CD34 (P = 0.001). CD7 positivity was significantly associated with a white blood cell count (WBC) greater than 100 x 10(9)/L (P = 0.003). P-Glycoprotein (P-170) expression was also evaluated in 135 patients by a flow-cytometric assay: there was a close relationship between CD7 and P-170 positivity (P < 0.001). For remission induction, all patients received therapeutic regimens routinely used for AML. The complete remission (CR) rate was significantly lower in CD7+ cases (32% vs 74%, P = 0.001). The overall survival and disease free survival rate of CD7+ AML was lower than those of CD7- patients (P < 0.001 and = 0.002, respectively). CD7+ AML with coexpression of CD14 had a particularly unfavourable response and prognosis in comparison with CD7+ patients without CD14.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

We determined APO-1 expression and sensitivity to anti-APO-1 mediated apoptosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells of T lymphocyte precursor phenotype (T-ALL). APO-1 was constitutively expressed by 21 of 30 T-ALL and by all T-ALL cell lines investigated. However, most APO-1 positive T-ALL were resistant to anti-APO-1 mediated apoptosis. Sensitivity to anti-APO-1 mediated apoptosis was independent of the density of APO-1 expression on the cell surface and independent of the amount of Bcl-2. Incubation of resistant T-ALL with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide reversed resistance and induced sensitivity to anti-APO-1 mediated apoptosis in most T-ALL. These data suggest that resistance to anti-APO-1 mediated apoptosis in T-ALL is maintained by an active cellular program.

Furthermore, EBV-CLL rapidly die by apoptosis in culture. In the present study we have used the B cell growth factors interleukin 4 and antibodies to CD40 to induce activation and proliferation of EBV-infected CLL cells. Although cell numbers did not significantly increase, apoptosis was partially inhibited in CLL cells which expressed increased levels of CD23 and were activated to immunoglobulin-secreting lymphoblasts. Expression of LMP was induced by interleukin (IL)-4 and anti-CD40 in all five EBV-infected CLL samples examined. However, this did not enhance cell proliferation or induce immortalization. Further analysis showed that LMP could be detected 4-5 days after EBV infection, and that both IL-4 and anti-CD40 could independently induce LMP but that their effect was additive. These results indicate that LMP expression is dependent on B cell activation processes and that in some circumstances full latent viral gene expression is not sufficient to cause B cell immortalization.",,,,,,,,,

Several of the mutant viruses replicated normally, some showed significant delays in infectivity, and others were noninfectious. Virions were collected, and the products of the endogenous reverse transcription reaction were examined to determine which steps might be affected by these mutations. Some mutants left their minus-strand strong-stop DNA in RNA-DNA hybrid form, in a manner similar to that of RNase H null mutants. Some mutants showed increased polymerase pausing. Others were impaired in first-strand translocation, independently of their wild-type ability to degrade genomic RNA, suggesting a new role for RNase H in strand transfer. DNA products synthesized in vivo by the wild-type and mutant viruses were also examined.

The necropsy findings included generalized lymphoid depletion, severe bone marrow hypoplasia, plasmacytic infiltrates in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs, and severe secondary infections. Supernates of peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures from the affected dog contained an agent with manganese-dependent reverse transcriptase (RT) activity that sedimented at a density of 1.122 g/ml. RT activity was also found post-mortem in extracts prepared from the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and small intestine. The lymph nodes and small intestine expressed a 3.8 kb mRNA that was recognized by a bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) pol DNA probe by Northern blotting. DNA isolated from the lymph nodes and small intestine from the affected dog showed distinct band patterns by Southern analysis, suggesting an exogenous retrovirus. The retrovirus could be propagated in normal canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells or short-term canine lymphocyte cell lines in-vitro, and was cytopathogenic for cells of canine, but not human, origin.

After injection of 32D or 32D-Kit cells into syngeneic hosts, animals bearing 32D-Kit cells, but not 32D cells, became moribund and were killed. These animals had circulating leukemic blast cells, infiltration of bone marrow, spleen, brain, liver, lung, and kidney. Cells recovered from some of the animals continued to be dependent upon IL-3 or KL for growth while in other cases the cells were factor independent. This model illustrates that the constitutive expression of c-Kit enhances the leukemic potential of 32D cells.

These cells also expressed receptors for interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and stem cell factor (SCF), as measured by flow cytometry and/or RNA expression. MEG-01s cell proliferation or survival was only marginally influenced by these factors and their combinations. c-kit, the receptor for SCF, was downmodulated by its ligand. This modulation was time-dependent, appeared to involve receptor conformational changes, and became concentration-dependent by day 3. Northern blot analysis indicated that amounts of c-kit RNA increased as downmodulation proceeded. IL-3 induced IL-6 secretion in these cells, which was augmented by a protein kinase-C (PKC) inhibitor, H7, and reduced by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Evidence for autocrine regulation of this cell line by IL-6 was demonstrated by the inhibitory effects of an antisense oligonucleotide on 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation.

Such changes have been observed in human leukaemic cells treated with a variety of cytotoxic agents. These structures are unlike those seen in untreated non-mitotic or mitotic cells. As taxol is known to act by enhancing the polymerization of tubulin in the initiation and extension of microtubules (MTs), and has been shown to induce and stabilize the formation of tubulin structures in a variety of cells, we examined the involvement of tubulin in apoptosis induced by taxol. Apoptosis was induced in a human T-cell leukaemic line, CCRF-CEM, following treatment with 10 nM taxol. The morphological features typical of apoptosis were apparent in taxol-treated cells after drug addition. Immunocytochemical analysis using a monoclonal antibody to beta-tubulin indicated that taxol induced visible tubulin polymerization. DNA fragmentation was detected at 10 hr post-treatment. Flow cytometric analysis of taxol-treated cells showed a time-dependent accumulation of cells in G2/M phase with the appearance of a hypodiploid peak coincident with the detection of DNA fragmentation. Microtubule structures observed following taxol treatment were of three types. At the time of DNA fragmentation, 50% of the cells displayed tubulin structures associated with apoptotic morphology similar to those seen in apoptosis induced by treatment with methotrexate (10(-8) M) or etoposide (17 microM). Twenty percent of the cells were arrested in mitosis at this time. These cells contained either multiple asters or disordered mitotic spindles, and did not display apoptotic morphology. The remaining cells, while normal in morphology, had extensive tubulin polymerization in the cytoplasm and around the nucleus. We examined the time-course of tubulin mRNA expression in apoptosis induced by taxol, methotrexate and etoposide. The level of tubulin mRNA displayed a transient increase after treatment, and prior to the onset of DNA fragmentation with each of the three drugs. These results suggest that during apoptosis taxol induces tubulin changes that display characteristics similar to those observed during apoptosis following treatment with drugs that do not interact directly with tubulin.",,,,,,,,,

Here we show that Tat also promotes AIDS-KS and normal vascular cells to migrate and to degrade the basement membrane and stimulates endothelial cell morphogenesis on a matrix substrate. These effects are obtained at picomolar concentrations of exogenous Tat and are promoted by the treatment of the cells with the same inflammatory cytokines stimulating expression of the receptors for Tat, the integrins alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha v beta 3. Thus, under specific circumstances, Tat has angiogenic properties.

Infection-related mortality is particularly high among these patients during the period of neutropenia that follows chemotherapy. We determined the effect of lenograstim (glycosylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) on mortality at eight weeks (the main end point) and the rate of complete remission among patients with AML who were 65 years old or older. METHODS: After induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin (45 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for 4 days) and cytarabine arabinoside (200 mg per square meter per day for 7 days), 173 patients with newly diagnosed AML were randomly assigned on day 8 to receive either lenograstim (5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day) or placebo, starting on day 9, until there was neutrophil recovery or a treatment failure, or for a maximum of 28 days. Salvage chemotherapy was also followed by lenograstim or placebo. Patients with a complete remission received two consolidation courses of chemotherapy without lenograstim or placebo. RESULTS: The mortality rate at eight weeks was similar in the lenograstim and placebo groups (23 and 27 percent, respectively; P = 0.60), as was the incidence of severe infections. The median duration of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < or = 1000 per cubic millimeter) was shorter in the lenograstim group (21 days, as compared with 27 days in the placebo group; P < 0.001). Eight percent of the patients in both groups had regrowth of AML cells. The rate of complete remission was significantly higher in the lenograstim group (70 percent, as compared with 47 percent in the placebo group; P = 0.002). Overall survival, however, was similar in the two groups (P = 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: The administration of lenograstim after chemotherapy for AML did not decrease the mortality rate at eight weeks among patients over the age of 65 years. The patients who received lenograstim had a significantly higher rate of complete remission than those who received placebo. Nevertheless, the overall survival in the two groups did not differ significantly.",,,"['N Engl J Med. 1995 Jun 22;332(25):1712-3. PMID: 7539110', 'N Engl J Med. 1995 Oct 26;333(17):1155-6.

Because wild-type p53 can activate transcription as well as induce apoptosis, we queried whether p53 might upregulate Fas/APO-1. To explore this possibility, we examined human p53-null (H358 non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma and K562 erythroleukemia) and wild-type p53-containing (H460 non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma) cell lines. When H358 or H460 cells were transduced with a replication-deficient adenovirus expression construct containing the human wild-type p53 gene but not with vector alone, a marked upregulation (approximately a three-to fourfold increase) of cell surface Fas/APO-1 was observed by flow cytometry. Similarly, K562, cells stably transfected with a plasmid vector containing the temperature-sensitive human p53 mutant Ala-143 demonstrated a four- to sixfold upregulation of Fas/APO-1 by flow-cytometric analysis at the permissive temperature of 32.5 degrees C. Temperature-sensitive upregulation of Fas/APO-1 in K562 Ala-143 cells was verified by immunoprecipitation and demonstrated to result from enhanced mRNA production by nuclear run-on and Northern (RNA) analyses. Stably transfected K562 cells expressing temperature-insensitive, transcriptionally inactive p53 mutants (His-175, Trp-248, His-273, or Gly-281) failed to upregulate Fas/APO-1 at either 32.5 degrees or 37.5 degrees C. The temperature-sensitive transcription of Fas/APO-1 occurred in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that de novo protein synthesis was not required and suggested a direct involvement of p53. Collectively, these observations argue that Fas/APO-1 is a target gene for transcriptional activation by p53.",PMC230534,,,,,,,,

Using c-raf antisense oligonucleotides to block Raf-1 expression, we have established that Raf-1 is required for hematopoietic growth factor-induced proliferation of murine cell lines stimulated by growth factors whose receptors are members of several different structural classes: (a) the hematopoietin receptor family, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3, IL-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and erythropoietin; (b) the tyrosine kinase receptor class, including Steel factor and CSF-1; and (c) IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M, whose receptors include the gp130 receptor subunit. Although results of previous experiments had suggested that IL-4 does not phosphorylate or activate the Raf-1 kinase, c-raf antisense oligonucleotides inhibited IL-4-induced proliferation of both myeloid and T cell lines, and IL-4 activated Raf-1 kinase activity in an IL-4-dependent myeloid cell line. In colony assays, c-raf antisense oligonucleotides completely inhibited colony formation of unseparated normal murine bone marrow cells stimulated with either IL-3 or CSF-1 and partially inhibited cells stimulated with GM-CSF. In addition, c-raf antisense oligonucleotides completely inhibited both IL-3- and GM-CSF-induced colony formation of CD34+ purified human progenitors stimulated with these same growth factors. Thus, Raf-1 is required for growth factor-induced proliferation of leukemic murine progenitor cell lines and normal murine and human bone marrow-derived progenitor cells regardless of the growth factor used to stimulate cell growth.",PMC2192061,,,,['c-raf'],,,,

At the time of autologous bone marrow transplantation, marrow grafts from patients with leukemia and lymphoma are often still contaminated by malignant cells, even when such patients achieve complete clinical remission. In this study, we evaluated the potential of anti-B4-blocked-ricin (anti-B4-bR) immunotoxin to eliminate residual ALL and NHL cells from bone marrow. Anti-B4-bR binds to the CD19 antigen, which is B-lineage specific, and, at concentrations of 5 x 10(-9) M or greater, could eliminate more than 3 logs of CD19+ Nalm-6 or Namalwa cells in a 20-fold excess of normal irradiated bone marrow after only 5 hr of incubation. This activity was abrogated by the addition of anti-B4 but not by the presence of galactose, which is the natural ligand for native ricin. Also, when used at these high concentrations, anti-B4-bR showed little nonspecific toxicity against normal hematopoietic progenitors. In conclusion, a single short exposure to anti-B4-bR is capable of inducing high levels of depletion of CD19+ leukemia and lymphoma cells without significant nonspecific toxicity against normal marrow progenitors. Therefore, anti-B4-bR offers an interesting approach to the elimination of B-lineage malignant cells prior to autologous bone marrow transplantation.",,,,,,,,,

Longer exposures of leukemia cells to ST.I-RTA resulted in a progressively higher number of target cells escaping IT treatment and becoming resistant to further treatment with ST.I-RTA even in the presence of the RTA-IT enhancer monensin. Resistant Jurkat cells proliferated at the same rate as control untreated cells, and were as sensitive as control cells to a transferrin-RTA IT, indicating that the ST.I-RTA-resistant tumor-cell population did not become insensitive to the enzymatic activity of RTA. Binding studies revealed that the anti-CD5 IT treatment induced a transient modulation of CD5 antigens but not of the functionally related CD3 antigens. The CD5 antigens were re-expressed at the cell surface following removal of the IT molecules from the culture medium with 1.1% of the total CD5 Ag being re-expressed per hr. When our experimental data on the kinetics of cell intoxication by the IT were corrected for the proliferative potential of the resistant and of the sensitive tumor-cell populations, it appeared that the effect of ST.I-RTA treatment on Jurkat cells was only to delay cell growth for a limited time period (20 hr) without reducing effectively the tumor-cell burden. Our results may have implications for the long-term treatment of target tumor cells with IT.",,,,,,,,,

Intra- and extracellular O2- production by PMNs isolated from these patients after 5 days of rhG-CSF therapy was assessed following both fMLP and PMA stimulation. RESULTS: All patients showed a rise in PMN count; administration of rhG-CSF enhanced intra- and extracellular O2- release after fMLP but not after PMA stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: rhG-CSF potentiates in vivo O2- production by PMNs stimulated with receptor-mediated agonists via G-protein (e.g. fMLP), but not by those stimulated with agonists that bypass receptors via protein kinase C (e.g. PMA).",,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of a CD3 x CD19 BsAb binding to both the CD3 T-cell antigen and the CD19 B-cell antigen was already proven in 51Cr-release assays and in 3-day activation cultures. To achieve more quantitative results, a 14-day clonogenic assay, based on limiting-dilution, was performed for the determination of the initial and residual number of clonogenic units obtained with a CD19+ pre-pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-B) cell line. Elimination of up to 5 logs of ALL-B cells by freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultured with BsAb plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) could be detected. The presence of human IgG did not abolish the effect. Repeated addition of each of the two agents was necessary, because a single treatment produced only a 1- to 2-log kill. CD3 monoclonal antibody and IL-2 stimulation (""lymphokine-activated killer cell"" conditions) resulted in only a 2-log kill. The number of T cells proved critical in lysis of ALL-B cells, with a 5-log kill using a T-cell:B-cell ratio of 3:1 but with only a 1-log kill using a ratio of 1:1. PBMCs isolated from patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, both in relapse or remission, proved to be as competent as those from healthy donors in removing ALL-B cells. This clonogenic assay shows the importance of repeated administration of CD3 x CD19 BsAb and IL-2 and offers the possibility to compare it with other therapies in B-cell malignancy.",,,,,,,,,

Although expression of CD34 is regulated in a developmental stage-specific manner, the function of CD34 is not known. Recently we have shown that both a full-length and truncated form of CD34 protein is expressed by hematopoietic cells (Blood 84:691, 1994). To test whether failure to suppress either form of CD34 could affect terminal myeloid differentiation, we constitutively expressed these CD34 proteins in murine M1 myeloid leukemia cells, which can be terminally differentiated to macrophages by treatment with interleukin-6 of leukemia inhibitory factor. Surprisingly our results show that forced expression of the full-length but not the truncated form of CD34 impedes terminal differentiation by these agents. Because the difference between the two forms of CD34 protein resides in the length of their respective cytoplasmic tail domains, our findings strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic domain region of full-length CD34 is responsible for the observed maturation arrest phenotype. These findings suggest a potential negative regulatory role for full-length CD34 in hematopoietic cell differentiation and may explain, at least in part, the block in maturation observed in CD34+ acute myeloid leukemia.",,,,,,,,,

Transduction efficiency has been high in mice but has remained low in large animals and humans. Improved transduction efficiency into hematopoietic progenitor cells of large animals and humans has been achieved in vitro by enriching for CD34+ cells, adding growth factors to the transduction culture, extending the exposure time of hematopoietic cells to retrovirus particles, and by using retrovirus vectors pseudotyped with the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope. Whether these modifications will also result in increased transduction of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells has yet to be demonstrated by in vivo transplantation studies.

Among these is the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation. In this study, we show that exposure of cells to H2O2 increases the catalytic activity of the lymphocyte-specific tyrosine protein kinase p56lck (Lck) and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394, the autophosphorylation site. Using mutant forms of Lck, we found that Tyr-394 is required for H2O2-induced activation of Lck, suggesting that phosphorylation of this site may activate Lck. In addition, H2O2 treatment induced phosphorylation at Tyr-394 in a catalytically inactive mutant of Lck in cells that do not express endogenous Lck. This demonstrates that a kinase other than Lck itself is capable of phosphorylating Lck at the so-called autophosphorylation site and raises the possibility that this as yet unidentified tyrosine protein kinase functions as an activator of Lck. Such an activating enzyme could play an important role in signal transduction in T cells.",PMC41977,,,,,,,,

We examined HEL, a human erythroleukemia cell line, in order to clarify the correlation between the c-kit receptor (KR) expression and lineage-specific phenotype. Although HEL cells are known to express KR, we found two relatively distinct HEL cell populations in terms of KR expression. We then subcloned HEL cell lines with clone sorting on the basis of KR expression and compared their various characteristics. The highly KR-expressing subline, HEL-P1, expressed a high level of glycophorin A (GPA), a known erythroid lineage marker. HEL-N1, in which most of the cells were KR-negative, showed a higher megakaryocytic lineage marker CD41b expression than HEL-P1. However, the expression of granulomonocytic lineage markers were not significantly different between the two subclones. Cell growth rate and cell cycle analysis also did not detect significant differences between the sublines. HEL-P1 cells gradually lost their KR expression in serum-containing culture, while the percentage of KR-positive HEL-N1 cells increased in serum-free culture. These observations indicate that KR expression was associated with the synchronous expression of GPA and inversely correlated with CD41b, and reversible transitions between KR-positive cells and KR-negative cells exist.

On the three nucleotide biosynthesis inhibitors, acivicin and mycophenolic acid were able to differentiate HL60 cells, while alanosine failed to do so. Differentiation of HL60 cells by acivicin and mycophenolic acid was associated with substantial decreases in both the guanylate and adenylate pools and appeared to be dependent on the state of depletion of intracellular GTP. Simultaneous addition of guanosine or guanine to mycophenolic acid-treated cells restored the GTP pool and prevented differentiation from occurring. Adenine or adenosine had no such effect, while hypoxanthine and inosine partially reversed the differentiation. In acivicin-treated cells, simultaneous addition of guanine caused partial prevention of differentiation. Even though treatment of HL60 cells with alanosine resulted in the depletion of guanylates, this effect was secondary to the depletion of adenylates and developed only upon prolonged exposure. In all the inhibitor-treated cells the activities of the key regulatory enzymes of de novo purine biosynthesis were affected. Even though the measurable activity of hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyl transferase was enhanced in inhibitor-treated cells, the activity of the salvage pathway was inhibited in mycophenolic acid and alanosine-treated cells. Besides de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis, de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis was also inhibited in inhibitor-treated cells. The inhibition of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis in mycophenolic acid, acivicin and alanosine-treated cells resulted in an increase in the steady-state concentration of PRPP. Since purine and pyrimidine nucleotides play an important role in the synthesis of important macromolecules, it can be suggested that depletion of guanine ribonucleotide as a result of inhibition of early de novo purine biosynthesis, or due to specific inhibition of de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, may be an obligatory step in the initiation of differentiation in mycophenolic acid and acivicin-treated HL60 cells.",,,,,,,,,

These include the ability of these cells, as compared to CD5- B cells, to undergo an Ig isotype class switch, the subclasses utilized, and the effects that switching may have on antigen binding. To address these issues, ten patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) whose CD5+ leukemic B cell clones produced IgG were studied. Monoclonal IgG was collected from PMA-stimulated CLL cells and from heterohybridomas constructed with these cells, and then analyzed for IgG subclass utilization, autoreactivity, and DNA idiotype expression. The monoclonal B cells from 80% of the CLL patients produced IgG1 and those from 20% produced IgG3. None produced IgG2. In contrast to the known autoreactivity of IgM-producing CD5+ CLL cells (> 50% autoreactive), none of these IgG antibodies reacted significantly with the autoantigens tested. However, three did react significantly with autoantigen after artificially increasing antibody valency by crosslinking. Whereas five of the IgG molecules expressed a cross reactive idiotypic (CRI) marker characteristic of non-mutated kappa anti-DNA antibodies, three expressed a CRI displayed primarily on mutated IgG anti-DNA antibodies. Thus, some CD5+ human B cells can undergo an isotype class switch that for these CLL cells is biased against IgG2 and in favor of the IgG1 and IgG3. In their native state the IgG molecules secreted by these isotype-switched CD5+ cells have diminished autoreactivity, as compared to IgM-producing CLL cells. Since some of the IgG antibodies could be made auto- and poly-reactive by increasing antigen-binding valency, while others expressed idiotypic markers of mutated antibodies, certain of these CD5+ B cells probably utilize non-mutated Ig V genes coding for polyreactive antibodies, whereas others may use genes that have undergone somatic mutation and that code for more restricted specificities. Therefore, both valency and VH gene mutation may account for the diminished autoreactivity of these CD5+ B cell-derived IgG antibodies.",,,,,,,,,

In attempts to increase the transduction efficiency of recombinant murine leukemia virus vectors, endogenous reverse transcription was initiated within cell-free, recombinant murine leukemia virus virions in the presence of relatively high concentrations of dNTPs. As a result, the expression of transduced genes via these retroviral vectors was increased approximately 10-fold by treatment of virions with dNTPs. Combined with our previous data, these observations suggest that virion-associated DNA synthesis can occur in diverse groups of retroviruses and positively alter retroviral infectivity.

In this study, we show that the E-selectin receptor-globulin (E-selectin Rg) affinity chromatography can isolate specifically only one glycoprotein from [3H]glucosamine-labeled HL-60 cells in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. This protein has a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa under reducing conditions, which appears to be identical with the previously characterized glycoprotein ligand for P-selectin.

The chromatographic profile of desialylated O-linked carbohydrates from molecules purified by P- and E-selectin affinity chromatography are identical.

To further elucidate intracellular signal transduction through gp130, we examined the possible involvement of another nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, p92c-fes (Fes). We showed that gp130 stimulation rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Fes and actually activated its kinase activity in hematopoietic lineage cells. Furthermore, Fes associated with gp130 independently of ligand stimulation like Jak, Btk, and Tec tyrosine kinases. These results indicate that multiple nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are involved in the gp130-mediated signal transduction pathway. Because both gp130 and Fes are expressed not only in hematopoietic lineage cells but also in heart and nerve cells, Fes may play a role in signal transduction through gp130 in these tissues.",,,,,"['c-fes', 'fps', 'v-fps']",,,,

We investigated the antitumor effects of this factor in CDF1 male mice inoculated with L1210 cells, a mouse B-cell leukemia line. Mice preinoculated with various numbers of L1210 cells on day 0 were given intravenous injections of vehicle (human serum albumin; HSA) (100 micrograms/kg/day) or hM-CSF (20 micrograms/kg/day) for 3 days from day 1. In mice preinoculated with 10(2) L1210 cells but not with 10(3) or more L1210 cells, a marked increment in survival rate was observed with hM-CSF treatment. We next examined the effect of hM-CSF treatment combined with chemotherapy on the survival of mice that had been preinoculated with 10(5) L1210 cells. In our system, the administration of 4.9 mg/kg adriamycin (ADM) alone slightly prolonged survival of the tumor-bearing mice, but all of the mice died within 20 days. When hM-CSF was injected for 3 days before this ADM treatment, the invasion and proliferation of tumor cells in the liver and spleen were markedly inhibited and 50% of the mice were still alive at day 50. We detected inhibitory activity toward L1210 growth in serum of mice administered with hM-CSF, and the degree of the inhibitory activity was correlated with the level of nitrite (NO2-) in the serum. When L1210 cells were co-cultured with peritoneal macrophages from mice intraperitoneally injected with hM-CSF, the uptake of [3H]thymidine in L1210 cells was inhibited. The inhibition was abolished by the addition of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of NO2- synthesis, suggesting that the reactive nitrogen oxide intermediate is involved in hM-CSF-induced inhibition of L1210 growth.",PMC5920809,,,,,,,,

The cultures were performed in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations (0.5-500 ng/ml) of nerve growth factor (NGF). The growth of 17 of the 22 cell lines was not significantly and reproducibly affected by NGF. There was minor (1.2-fold) but reproducible stimulation of clonal growth in one glioblastoma cell line (86-HG-39) by NGF, but in this cell line NGF induced no growth modulation in a tritiated thymidine uptake assay. However, clonal growth of another glioblastoma cell line (87-HG-31) and all three lung cancer cell lines tested (HTB 119, HTB 120, CCL 185) could be stimulated up to 3-fold by NGF with a dose-response relationship for the growth factor. Growth stimulation by NGF could be completely reversed by neutralizing anti-NGF antibody and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Evaluation of secondary plating efficiency revealed the stimulation of colony formation as representing self-renewal and not terminal differentiation. Reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments in the five responding cell lines showed expression of both low-affinity NGF receptor (glycoprotein 75) and c-trk transcripts on the mRNA level. Of the five responding cell lines, only 86-HG-39, the cell line with the lowest responsiveness, revealed low-affinity NGF receptor on the protein level; the other four cell lines with high responsiveness, including the three lung cancer cell lines, expressed no low-affinity NGF receptor as shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and immunoprecipitation using the ME 20.4 antibody. Immunoprecipitation using anti-trk antibodies was negative in all five responding cell lines. However, binding studies with iodinated NGF showed only low-affinity binding on the 86-HG-39 cell line and only high-affinity binding on the high-responder cell lines CCL 185 and 87-HG-31. In summary, our data suggest that NGF can be operative in stimulation of clonal growth of malignant tumor cells. High-affinity but not low-affinity binding sites mediate signal transduction for clonal growth and signaling involves tyrosine kinase activity.",,,,,,,,,

Therefore, purging of bone marrow to reduce the amount of tumor cells reinfused into the patient is widely used. Immunologic effector cells such as lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells are attractive for purging of bone marrow since these cells might have an additional in vivo effect on tumor cells in contrast to other purging protocols. In patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), LAK cells can only be used in some patients for purging bone marrow since LAK cells possess no or only limited cytolytic activity against autologous CML tumor cells in most cases. In this study, we investigated the effect of autologous and allogeneic cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells on tumor cells from patients with CML. CIK cells have been generated from peripheral blood lymphocytes by incubation with interferon-gamma on day 0, interleukin-1, interleukin-2 and a monoclonal antibody against CD3 on day 1. In contrast to LAK cells, CIK cells were able to lyse both autologous and allogeneic cells from patients with CML as determined by a 51Cr release and a tumor colony assay. The cytotoxicity of CIK cells against CML cells was confined to the CD56+ population. CIK cells showed no major toxic effect on hematopoietic progenitor cells when tested in CFU-GM assays. CIK cells eliminated three orders of magnitude of K562 cells and less than one order of magnitude of progenitor cells (25% reduction). This represents a differential effect of CIK cells on tumor and progenitor cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

Two of six founder mice and the transgenic progeny developed leukemias several months after birth. In the leukemic tissues, the expression of the p210bcr/abl transgene product was detected and the increased tyrosine-phosphorylation of cellular proteins was observed. The expressed p210bcr/abl transgene product was shown to possess an enhanced kinase activity. The leukemic cells showed rearrangements in the T-cell receptor loci, indicating that the leukemic cells were monoclonal and committed to the T-cell lineage. Polymerase chain reaction analysis for tissue distribution of p210bcr/abl expression showed that, in the transgenic line that reproducibly developed leukemias, p210bcr/abl was expressed in the hematopoietic tissues such as thymus and spleen; on the other hand, in the transgenic lines that have not developed leukemias, p210bcr/abl expression was detected only in the nonhematopoietic tissues such as the brain and kidney.

Fractionation of CD34+ Lin- ABM cells with CD45RA, Thy-1, CD38, and HLA-DR failed to absolutely segregate T-cell reconstituting ability, indicating broad distribution of T-progenitor cell potential. Titration experiments showed that low numbers of CD34+ Lin- CD45RA+ (RA+) cells had greater thymus repopulating ability than CD34+ Lin- CD45RA- cells (RA-). The great majority (> 95%) of RA+ cells expressed CD38, HLA-DR and 70% to 90% of RA+ cells lacked Thy-1 surface expression. RA+ cells contained colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitor cells but were depleted of erythroid potential, did not provide hematopoietic reconstitution of human bone fragments implanted into SCID mice, and did not efficiently maintain CD34+ cells with secondary clonogenic potential in bone marrow cultures. Thus, RA+ cells are oligopotent (nonprimitive) CD34+ progenitors with T-cell reconstituting ability. In contrast, these same assays indicated that CD34+ Lin- CD45RA- cells (RA- cells) comprised hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with primitive multilineage (T, B, myeloid, and erythroid) hematopoietic potential. It was confirmed that HSC-containing populations, such as CD34+ Lin- CD45RA- Thy-1+ cells had thymus repopulating ability. Culture of RA- cells on murine bone marrow stromal cells in the presence of interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) generated CD34+ CD45RA+ progeny engrafting in a secondary severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-hu thymus assay. Altogether, our results underscore the fact that T-cell reconstituting potential can be dissociated from HSC activity. Furthermore, we speculate that HSC might develop into the T lineage indirectly, via differentiation into an intermediate oligopotent CD34+ CD45RA+ stage. Finally, T-progenitor cells can be cultured in vitro.",,,,,,,,,

When the antiestrogens are present at sufficiently high concentrations, their cytotoxicity cannot be reversed by estrogens and is demonstrable even with cell lines which lack the estrogen receptor. The mechanism of this cytotoxicity, which is clearly independent of estrogen antagonism, remains unknown. Using two murine cancer cell lines (the K36 leukemia and the EL4 lymphoma cell line), the human breast cancer cell line MCF7, and two non-steroidal antiestrogens (tamoxifen and clomiphene), our laboratory attempted to determine whether the cytotoxic action of non-steroidal antiestrogens was mediated by a mechanism requiring protein or RNA synthesis. In the case of K36 and EL4 cells, inclusion of tamoxifen or clomiphene in the culture medium regularly caused the viable call count to fall below 20-30% of control in 36-48 h. Under these conditions, the addition of inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis consistently increased viable cell count in a dose-dependent manner. With cultures of K36 cells grown in the presence of 10 microM tamoxifen, for example, the addition of appropriate concentrations of emetine, cycloheximide, puromycin, or actinomycin D increased the percentage of viable cells to 5.0, 2.4, 4.0, and 4.0 times that of control, respectively. Additional experiments revealed that the macromolecular synthesis inhibitors, while effective in inhibiting protein or RNA synthesis to varying degrees, did not affect the cellular uptake of [3H]tamoxifen, suggesting that their ability to protect cells against antiestrogen-induced cell death was not due to an inhibition of cellular uptake of antiestrogens. In the case of MCF7 cells, however, inhibition of protein synthesis did not protect the cells against the cytotoxic effect of tamoxifen. These observations suggest that non-steroidal antiestrogens may exert their cytotoxic effect by at least two different mechanisms; only one of these require de novo protein synthesis. The effect of antiestrogens on K36 and EL4 cells may provide a useful system for the identification of proteins involved in cell death.",,,,,,,,,

Kinetic analyses showed that fibronectin and laminin were moderately effective at decreasing activation of plasminogen by u-PA (3-4-fold decrease in kcat/Km), while activation was stimulated slightly by collagen types I and IV (2-4-fold increase in kcat/Km). Ligand-blotting experiments using intact immobilized ECM proteins demonstrated that u-PA binds predominantly to vitronectin. This was supported by ELISA studies, which showed concentration dependent, saturable, reversible binding of u-PA to vitronectin (Kd,app. of 97 nM). Limited proteolysis of vitronectin followed by ligand-blotting analysis demonstrated u-PA binding to a specific vitronectin fragment (M(r) 49,000), and binding was shown to occur through the N-terminal fragment of u-PA. N-terminal sequence analysis indicated that this binding fragment of vitronectin originates with Thr-122 and comprises the hemopexin domain, including the heparin-binding region of the vitronectin molecule. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type I did not compete with u-PA for binding to vitronectin, suggesting both molecules may co-localize on vitronectin. In contrast, binding of u-PA to vitronectin was significantly inhibited by plasminogen, suggesting these molecules share a common binding site on vitronectin. In addition to in vitro studies, experiments were performed to assess the contribution of direct binding of u-PA to vitronectin on the adhesive behaviour of U937 cells. Binding of u-PA-saturated U937 cells to vitronectin was inhibited 66% by excess vitronectin, suggesting that direct binding of u-PA to vitronectin is the mechanism by which u-PA-dependent adhesion of U937 cells to vitronectin is mediated.",PMC1136728,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that RNA transcription of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is inhibited by prostaglandins (Bader and Ankel, J. Gen. Virol. 71, 2823-2832, 1990). Prostaglandins are known to have multiple effects on cells which may or may not be related to their antiviral action. We examined the effects of prostaglandins on cells and on VSV RNA polymerase in vitro to seek the mechanism of antiviral action. Actinomycin D inhibited cellular RNA synthesis but failed to block the antiviral activity of prostaglandins on VSV. Thus induction of host cell RNA transcription is not involved in the antiviral action. Neither modulation of the cellular glutathione level by prostaglandins nor formation of prostaglandin-glutathione conjugates was required for the antiviral action. The relative inhibition of VSV RNA polymerase in vitro by prostaglandins with different structures correlated to inhibition of VSV replication in infected cells. This result indicates that the same step in VSV replication is inhibited by prostaglandins both in the in vitro RNA polymerase assay and in the infected cell.",,,,,,,,,

To analyze the costimulatory role of SCF in leukemic growth, we investigated the effect of SCF in the presence of GM-CSF and/or IL-3 on isolated CD34-positive (CD34+) leukemic blasts from 15 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Cultures of CD34+ cells from normal bone marrow were used as controls. When the proliferation of CD34+ AML blasts in the presence of GM-CSF and/or IL-3 were evaluated in vitro for the effects of SCF, two patterns emerged. In one pattern, CD34+ AML blasts responded with a significant increase in DNA synthesis and/or colony formation when SCF was used with GM-CSF and/or IL-3 relative to the growth with SCF alone; This result is consistent with those CD34+ bone marrow cells from normal donors. Six patients (40%) were included in this category. The addition of SCF as a single factor resulted in colony formation in all six of these cases. In the other pattern, nine of the patients (60%) had CD34+ leukemic cells whose growth with SCF plus either GM-CSF, IL-3, or GM-CSF+IL-3, was not significantly different from the growth noted in the presence of SCF alone. Among them seven cases that did not form colonies in response to SCF alone, and one case showing autocrine, background growth were included. In the six cases in which the costimulating effects of SCF were documented, CD34+ c-kit+ blasts comprised 50.5 +/- 18.7% of the CD34+ leukemic blasts-higher than 21.8 +/- 19.4% of cases in which the costimulating effect of SCF was not documented. In the cases showing high c-kit antigen expression (> or = 40%), SCF had a costimulatory effect in 71% (5/7) of the patients. In conclusion, our data indicate that CD34+ leukemic blasts from a good proportion of patients with AML did not respond to the costimulating effects of SCF in the presence of GM-CSF adn/or IL-3, in contrast to those CD34+ bone marrow cells from normal donors. The possible use of SCF for acute leukemia must await further cytogenetic and molecular studies, which should clarify the preferential costimulating role of SCF in normal hematopoiesis.",,,,,,,,,

It was suggested that CD34 antigen expression adversely affected the prognosis of acute myelogenous leukemia. However, no study has been published so far on clinical and prognostic significance of CD34 antigen expression in MDS. Bone marrow biopsies from 58 patients diagnosed as primary MDS were studied using QBEND/10, a monoclonal antibody which recognized the human progenitor CD34 antigen on routine aldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples. The high percentage of CD34-positive cells (above 3% of total bone marrow nucleated cells) was predominantly observed in cases with RAEB-T, CMML, and to a lesser degree in RAEB. But neither age, hemograms, bone marrow findings including percentage of blasts, ALIP, nor leukemic transformation correlated with the percentage of CD34-positive cells. The median actuarial survival time in the high positive group was significantly shorter (12.0 months) than that of the low group (30.0 months; p = 0.028). The high CD34 aggregate (> or = 3) was selectively found in cases with RAEB, RAEB-T, and CMML.

A pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) assay demonstrated that all of the sxi mutants were impaired in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, thus providing a molecular explanation for the observed X-ray sensitivity. Interestingly, additional PFGE experiments demonstrated that for any given X-ray dose all of the mutants incurred more DNA DSBs than the parental V79-4 cell line indicating there may be some inherent fragility to sxi chromosomes. Cross-sensitivity to other DNA-damaging agents including bleomycin, mitomycin C and methyl methanesulfonate indicated that sxi-2, sxi-3 and sxi-4 appear to be specifically hypersensitive to genotoxic agents that cause DNA DSBs, whereas sxi-1 appeared to be hypersensitive to multiple types of DNA lesions. Lastly, in preliminary experiments all of the sxi mutants demonstrated an inability to carry out V(D)J recombination, a somatic DNA rearrangement process required for the assembly of lymphoid antigen receptor genes.

They elicit and control a cascade of biochemical events, the earliest of which is tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins. Grb2/Ash is composed of SH2 and SH3 domains. The SH2 domain binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, and the SH3 domains bind to proteins containing proline-rich regions. It is considered that Grb2/Ash functions as an adapter protein linking tyrosine kinases and Ras in downstream of receptors for growth factors in fibroblasts. However, the mechanisms of signal transduction through Grb2/Ash and the roles of proteins associated with Grb2/Ash remain to be determined in hematopoietic cells. By means of the binding experiments using the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein including the full-length Grb2/Ash, we have found that Shc and unidentified 130- and 135-kDa proteins are associated with Grb2/Ash and that they are tyrosine phosphorylated by treatment with GM-CSF or Epo in a human leukemia cell line, UT-7. We have purified the 130-kDa protein (pp130) using the glutathione S-transferase-Grb2/Ash affinity column. The amino acid sequence analysis of the three peptides derived from the in situ protease digestion of the purified pp130 showed that the pp130 was identical to the human c-cbl proto-oncogene product (c-Cbl). c-Cbl constitutively binds to the SH3 domain of Grb2/Ash both in vitro and in vivo but not to the SH2 domain of Grb2/Ash, and the binding of Grb2/Ash to c-Cbl or Sos was not altered by GM-CSF stimulation. Moreover, c-Cbl (pp130) becomes tyrosine phosphorylated rapidly and transiently depending on GM-CSF or Epo stimulation. These findings strongly suggest that c-Cbl is implicated in the signal transduction of GM-CSF or Epo in hematopoietic cells and that c-Cbl is involved in another signaling pathway different from the Ras signaling pathway.",,,,,"['Ash', 'Grb2', 'Sos-1', 'c-cbl']",,,,

In order to investigate whether an alteration in the mechanisms involved in the process of apoptosis could contribute to cellular resistance, induction of apoptosis was studied in a cisplatin-resistant cell line (L1210/DDP) derived from a L1210 murine leukemia cell line (L1210/0). Treatments of the parental L1210/0 cell line with two DNA damaging agents (cisplatin and 5-azacytidine) or a protein kinase C inhibitor (staurosporine) led to biochemical events characteristic of apoptosis (as determined by the cell morphology and the oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation). In contrast, the cisplatin-resistant L1210/DDP subline, which was cross-resistant to 5-azacytidine, did not exhibit any DNA fragmentation or morphological changes typical of apoptosis when exposed to toxic concentrations of either cisplatin or 5-azacytidine. The failure of these cells to undergo apoptosis upon cisplatin or 5-azacytidine exposure has been correlated with the lack of a nuclear endonuclease activity present in wild-type cell nuclei. However, staurosporine, which exerted the same toxicity on both cell lines, induced the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and morphological features of apoptosis in both of them. This indicates that a functional pathway for apoptosis is preserved in the resistant cells. The induction of this pathway can be correlated with the presence of a cytoplasmic endonuclease activity whose specificity seems different from that operating in L1210/0 cells in terms of cation and pH dependence. Therefore, in these cell lines, different endonucleases are possibly involved in apoptosis. In response to treatment with drugs having different targets, the apoptotic cell death may operate through different signaling pathways, one of them being possibly defective in the L1210/DDP-resistant cells.",,,,,,,,,

Impairment of biopterin metabolism leading to decreased availability of monoamine neurotransmitters has been suggested to explain methotrexate neurotoxicity. To investigate such a mechanism, we have measured prospectively by HPLC the concentrations of total biopterin, homovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid in cerebrospinal fluid of 57 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A sequential analysis of cerebrospinal fluid was performed for each patient: cerebrospinal fluid samples were obtained before therapy and after each of the four high-dose methotrexate infusions during the CNS prophylaxis phase. A significant increase of total biopterin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid was observed after high-dose methotrexate therapy compared with the pretreatment values. No cumulative effect was noted. In contrast, no significant variation of the homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid levels was observed in cerebrospinal fluid. However, individual analysis revealed a transient decrease of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid of six children. The increase of total biopterin mimicking that observed in inherited dihydropteridine reductase deficiencies suggests that methotrexate inhibits the regenerating system of biopterin in the brain of patients undergoing high-dose methotrexate therapy.",,,,,,,,,

Immunoprecipitation of Shc from cells expressing p210 BCR/abl had 7.5-fold increase in PI 3-Kinase activity compared to parental cells. Tyrosine phosphorylated Shc specifically bound to the C-SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of PI 3-Kinase. The p85 SH3 domain also interacted with Shc in cell lysates from parental and transformed cells. The binding of p85 SH3 domain to Shc was substantially higher in BCR/abl transformed than in parental cells. Phenylphosphate blocked p85 SH2 mediated association with Shc but enhanced the binding of the p85 SH3 domain to Shc. The N-terminal proline-rich region of Shc between A263 and N273 specifically blocked the interaction of p85 SH3 domain with Shc.

A murine leukemia model system was developed to assess the potential role of B7-1 in the induction immunity to leukemia cells. The nonleukemic 32Dc13 myeloid cell line was transformed by transfection of the BCR/ABL gene, generating a subline (32Dp210/clone 26) that was leukemic and rapidly lethal to syngeneic, immunocompetent C3H/HeJ mice or T-cell-deficient nude mice. B7-1-modified leukemic cells remained lethal in nude mice, but caused only a transient, nonlethal leukemia in C3H/HeJ mice. After a single exposure to live, nonirradiated B7-1-modified leukemic cells, C3H/HeJ mice developed protective immunity against subsequent challenge with B7-1(-) leukemic cells.

In the presence of SCF, stromal cells are induced to differentiate, but not to proliferate. In contrast, in the presence of IL-6, stromal cells are induced to proliferate rather than to differentiate in culture. Both SCF and IL-6 are produced by the stromal cells themselves and, thus, act as autocrine factors. In addition, DO64 cells also interact physically with each other in culture when grown under optimal culture conditions (70% to 90% cell confluence and in the presence of serum), thereby supporting proliferation and maintaining viability. Under conditions of lower cell density or low serum or growth factor concentrations in culture, DO64 cells tend to aggregate and form clusters. This increase in local cell concentration is associated with preservation of viability, presumably because of the accumulation of autocrine factors. If no signal, neither intercellular nor soluble, is provided, and DO64 cells are not able to reach a critical cell density or to produce sufficient factors in an autocrine fashion, the cells cease to proliferate and eventually die.",,,,,,,,,

From a three-dimensional model of P-selectin and site-specific mutagenesis studies, a number of residues were previously identified as critical for the binding of P-selectin to HL-60 cells, a human myeloid cell line. Included among them were lysines 111 and 113 (K111 and K113). In this study, the roles of K111 and K113 were further characterized by the generation and specific chemical modification of two cysteine mutants, K111C and K113C, of a P-selectin-immunoglobulin fusion protein (P-selectin-Rg). Both K111C and K113C displayed significantly reduced binding activity compared to the wild-type P-selectin from which they were derived, further illustrating the importance of these particular lysines for ligand binding. Reaction of K111C with aziridine or nipsylcysteamine resulted in the formation of K111C-AZ and K111C-CY, both of which displayed significant increases in HL-60 binding activity. No such increase took place upon reaction of K111C with N-ethylmaleimide, indicating that a free amine at position 111 is important for binding. Residue length at position 111 is not critical, since the synthetic side chains are 0.5-2.0 A longer than lysine yet still impart binding activity. Similar modification studies of K111A and K113C did not lead to any detectable increase in binding of these proteins to HL-60 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

In HL-60 cells, lacking constitutive TGF-alpha mRNA, vitamin D3 caused expression of the TGF-alpha gene and protein as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA). In U-937 cells, showing constitutive TGF-alpha expression, RA but not vitamin D3 or PMA, caused marked increase in TGF-alpha mRNA (approximately 5-fold) and protein (approximately 3-fold) levels. In both cell lines the increase in TGF-alpha mRNA was evident within 24 h and continued throughout the observation period. Thus, it is established that differentiation of human leukemia cells towards monocytes/macrophages may be accompanied by TGF-alpha gene and protein expression in vitro. This is in conformity with the observed ability of mature activated macrophages to produce TGF-alpha.",,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that the IFI 16 gene product is a novel nucleoprotein expressed in association with the differentiation of myeloid precursor cell lines. In Northern blots, IFI 16 mRNA was increased approximately 25-fold above barely detectable levels in unstimulated promyelocytic HL-60 cells, in response to IFN-gamma. Other myeloid cell lines, U937 and K562, also demonstrated a marked IFN-gamma-inducibility of IFI 16 mRNA. However, all three cell lines were far less responsive to IFN-alpha, and there was no response to IL-6. By comparison, a panel of T and B cell lines demonstrated high constitutive expression of IFI 16 mRNA that was not regulated by these cytokines. Culture of HL-60 cells in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide, retinoic acid, and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, agents that stimulate the differentiation of HL-60 along myeloid pathways, also caused the induction of IFI 16 mRNA. To characterize the protein product of IFI 16, a monoclonal antibody was raised against a recombinant bacterial protein comprising the amino terminal 159 amino acids of IFI 16 fused to glutathione S-transferase. The antibody, designated 1G7, was used in Western blotting to demonstrate the strong induction of a cluster of proteins of 85-95 kDa in the nuclear extracts of IFN-gamma-treated HL-60. The nuclear localization of IFI 16 antigen was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of HL-60 cells treated with IFN-gamma, dimethylsulfoxide, and retinoic acid. IFI 16 was also detected in the nuclei of monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in normal peripheral blood. Database comparisons of the IFI 16 amino acid sequence revealed 51% identity with the recently cloned myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA), and extensive similarity to protein products of the Gene 200 cluster of IFN-inducible genes, Ifi 202 and Ifi 204. The amino terminal domain of IFI 16 encodes a putative nuclear localization signal, 124PGAQKRKK, which is strongly conserved in MNDA and 204. Nuclear IFI 16 was able to bind double-stranded DNA in vitro and exhibited a similar elution profile from DNA-cellulose as previously observed for MNDA and 204. Therefore, IFI 16 and MNDA are members of a novel family of human DNA-binding proteins whose expression is associated with myeloid cell differentiation induced by cytokines and chemical agents.",,,,,,,,,

To determine whether SF alone could directly stimulate proliferation of early hematopoietic progenitor cells, isolated CD34+ cells from adult bone marrow and umbilical cord blood were studied in a short-term suspension culture in serum-free medium. Numbers of CD34+ and proliferating cells were quantified by flow cytometry; proliferation was assessed by simultaneous measurement of expression of the nuclear antigen Ki67 and DNA content (propidium iodide [PI]). In the absence of growth factors, the numbers of CD34+ and cycling cells declined over 2 days. Cells cultured in the presence of SF alone maintained the number of CD34+ and cycling cells at levels equal to the starting population. Withdrawal of growth factors led to a dramatic decrease in the number of cells in G1. Compared to cells grown in the absence of growth factors, cells grown in the presence of SF had significantly higher numbers of CD34+ and cycling cells (mean fold increase = 1.3 and 2; p < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). SF increased the numbers of cells in both G1 and later phases of the cell cycle. Addition of interleukin-3 (IL-3) to SF led to further significant increases in CD34+ and cycling cells. The effects of SF could not be attributed to inhibition of apoptosis. CD34+ cells isolated from peripheral blood (PB) from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) displayed similar characteristics. As assessed by binding of phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled ligand and flow cytometry, c-kit was expressed on 65 +/- 6% of isolated CD34+ cells and was detected on HLA-DRlow, CD38low, and Thy1+ subsets, as well as on more mature progenitor cells. Thus, while the effects of SF are most marked in combination with other growth factors, SF appears to bind to and directly maintain the active cell-cycle characteristics of isolated CD34+ cells.",,,,,,,,,

However, most of the signal transduction events distal to Fas ligation have not been elucidated. Here, we show that Ras is activated following ligation of Fas on lymphoid lines. The activation of Ras is a critical component of this apoptotic pathway, since inhibition of Ras by neutralizing antibody or a dominant-negative Ras mutant interfered with Fas-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ligation of Fas also resulted in stimulation of the sphingomyelin signalling pathway to produce ceramides, which, in turn, are capable of inducing both Ras activation and apoptosis. This suggests that ceramides acts as second messengers in Fas signaling via Ras. Thus, ligation of the Fas molecule on lymphocyte lines induces activation of Ras via the action of ceramide, and this activation is necessary, but not sufficient, for subsequent apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,

We here examined whether such constitutive activation of KIT occurred in the rat tumor mast cell line RBL-2H3 as well, which is frequently used as a tool for studying functions of mast cells. In RBL-2H3 cells, KIT was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine and activated in the absence of autocrine production of its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF). Sequencing analysis revealed that one of c-kit genes of RBL-2H3 cells had a point mutation, resulting in amino acid substitution of Tyr for Asp in codon 817. When rat wild-type c-kit cDNA and mutant-type c-kit cDNA encoding KITTyr817 were transfected into cells of a human embryonic kidney cell line (293T), only mutant form KITTyr817 was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine and activated in the absence of SCF. Since mutations at the same Asp codon constitutively activated KIT in all the human HMC-1, murine P-815, and rat RBL-2H3 cell lines, and since the incorporation of antisense oligonucleotides of c-kit messenger RNA significantly suppressed the proliferation of RBL-2H3 cells, the activating mutations in the Asp codon of the c-kit gene appeared to be involved in neoplastic growth of mast cells.",,,,,['c-kit'],,,,

To determine if the cells of the primitive hematopoietic stem cell compartment are involved in the leukemic process, we have used molecular and cell sorting techniques in peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) cells at diagnosis from three patients with APL and t(15; 17). In two of them, clonality analysis was also possible using the BstXI polymorphic site of the PGK gene. The PML-RARA fusion gene was readily identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of BM cells obtained at diagnosis in all three patients. These same samples were then used to sort CD34+ cells and their CD38+ and CD38- subsets by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. In both female patients, CD34+/CD38+ and CD34+/CD38- cell fractions were polyclonal using PCR, whereas a monoclonal pattern was identified at the BM sample obtained at diagnosis either by Southern blotting or by PCR. Because of the high sensitivity of the PCR analysis, the polyclonal pattern of these cell populations could mask the presence of a minor clone. To detect this clone, we preformed RT-PCR analysis for t(15; 17). In one female patient, the abnormal PML-RAR fusion gene was found only in the more mature CD34+/CD38+ cell fraction using a nested PCR approach, whereas the polyclonal CD34+/CD38- fraction was PML-RARA negative. These findings were confirmed in a third patient with APL in whom the PML-RARA transcripts were absent in the CD34+/CD38- cell fraction. To study the clonality at the level of clonogenic progenitors, we used in one patient PGK analysis by PCR of individual burst-forming units-erythroid and colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage obtained from the CD34+/CD38- and CD34+/CD38+ cell populations at diagnosis and from the BM sample obtained during remission. The two highly purified cell populations gave rise to morphologically normal colonies clonal for both the BstXI site containing (A) and the BstXI site lacking (B) PGK allelles, indicating their polyclonal content, a pattern that was also found in clonogenic progenitors obtained at remission. These findings strongly suggest that the primitive hematopoietic stem cells as defined by the CD34+/CD38- antigens are not involved by the neoplastic process in APL. These results may have important implications for autografting strategies of retinoic acid/chemotherapy-resistant or relapsed patients.",,,,,,,,,

P-gp expression was significantly associated with CD34 expression (P = .0003) and chromosome 7 abnormalities (P = .027). A significantly reduced IDA was observed in P-gp+ as compared with P-gp- patients (P = .0007). Of the 87 patients, 51 achieved complete remission (CR).

Soluble forms of several cytokine receptors have been described and may play a role in the modulation of cytokine activity in vivo. For these reasons, we investigated whether human hematopoietic cells produce soluble c-kit receptors. The human leukemia cell lines OCIM1 and MO7e display approximately 80,000 and approximately 35,000 high-affinity cell surface c-kit receptors, respectively. Soluble c-kit receptors were detected by enzyme immunoassay in OCIM1 and MO7e culture supernatants. We determined the molecular weight and binding affinity of soluble c-kit receptor produced by OCIM1 cells, soluble c-kit receptor purified from human serum, and recombinant soluble c-kit receptor expressed in CHO cells. The three soluble c-kit receptors each have a molecular weight of 98 kD. Quantitative binding experiments with 125I-SCF indicate that the soluble c-kit receptors obtained from human serum or OCIM1 cells have binding affinities for SCF of approximately 200 to 300 pmol/L, in contrast to the recombinant form, which has a binding affinity of approximately 1.5 nmol/L. All three forms of the soluble c-kit receptor were able to compete with c-kit receptors on OCIM1 cells for 125I-SCF binding. Thus human hematopoietic cells can produce a soluble form of the c-kit receptor that retains high-affinity SCF binding activity. We speculate that the soluble c-kit receptor may bind SCF and function as a receptor antagonist in vivo.",,,,,['c-kit'],,,,

Using the monoclonal antibody CD61 for the identification of megakaryopoiesis and Gomori's silver impregnation method, number of megakaryocytes and density of argyrophilic (reticulin and collagen) fibers were determined by morphometry. We studied specimens from 26 patients with IFN-alpha 2b (including nine patients with additional IFN gamma) therapy and from 23 patients who had received BU. In both groups, repeated bone marrow biopsies (total 125) revealed a significant increase in the fiber content, as well as in the number of megakaryocytes during treatment. To assess the dynamics of myelofibrosis more precisely, computation of differences in the degree of fiber density between the first and last examination was carried out. Regarding the considerable variations in the biopsy intervals, a so-called myelofibrosis progression index (MPI) was calculated. Following this rationale, we were able to demonstrate that, in comparison to the BU-group, speed of progression of bone marrow fibrosis was significantly increased in CML patients treated with IFN. Preliminary statistical analysis indicated a relationship between myelofibrosis on admission, which was always associated with increased growth of megakaryocytes, and the MPI with survival. Even when these parameters were regarded, prognosis was significantly more favorable in the IFN-treated patients. The failure of IFN and BU to inhibit the evolution of myelofibrosis may be related to several conversely acting pathomechanisms. Among others, the inability of both therapeutic agents to reduce the number of megakaryocytes more effectively should be taken into consideration.",,,,,,,,,

The optimal range for quantitative analysis of hG-CSF was about 4-60 pg ml-1. The stimulatory effect was measured by a colorimetric microassay: the optical density of formazan, which is produced by viable cells from 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), was obtained by reading plates in a multi-channel photometer. The assay was designed as a five-dose parallel line test, employing three or four doses for potency determinations, which fulfil pharmacopoeial requirements for assay validity. Inter-assay relative standard deviation (RSD) varied between 5.2 and 12.0%. Most assay experiments revealed potencies within limits of error of 90-110% and the mean index of precision value was 0.057. The recently developed yeast cell-derived International Standard (88/502) served as a reference for activity of rhG-CSF. Specificity of the assay was demonstrated by absence of response upon exposure to a panel of biomolecules, including recombinant human interleukin-3, and by the suppression of growth stimulation in the presence of neutralizing anti hG-CSF antibodies. Potency readings of unglycosylated rhG-CSF were dependent on pH of assay medium with higher relative activities observed at pH 6.6 than at 7.4. Moreover, SDS-PAGE analysis of the carbohydrate-deficient preparation, following incubation at physiological pH, revealed several high molecular weight rhG-CSF bands and decreased monomeric form. The method described was found suitable for potency assessments of pharmaceutical formulations of hG-CSF.",,,,,,,,,

Proto-oncogene activation is achieved in most leukemias by integration of murine leukemia virus upstream of exons 3 or 4 or by integration into exon 9 with consequent truncation of the protein. The present study investigates the effect of ectopic expression of full-length c-myb or c-myb containing amino- or carboxyl-terminal truncations (minus 47 and 248 amino acids, respectively) on granulocyte differentiation in vitro. Recombinant myb retroviruses were used to infect an interleukin 3-dependent progenitor cell line, 32Dcl3, which undergoes terminal differentiation to mature neutrophilic granulocytes in the presence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Overexpression of c-myb did not abrogate the interleukin 3 dependency of the parental cell line. However, cells expressing all forms of c-myb were blocked at an intermediate stage of granulocyte differentiation and continued to proliferate in the presence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. After 14 days in medium with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, myb-expressing cultures predominantly consisted of promyelocytes with some myelocytes and almost undetectable numbers of neutrophilic granulocytes. This suggested that early stages of granulocyte differentiation were not inhibited, a finding that was further supported by the induction of myeloperoxidase, a biochemical marker of promyelocytes. Interestingly, the expression of lactoferrin, known to be a marker of late stages of granulocyte differentiation, was completely inhibited in the cells infected with myb viruses. It was concluded that c-myb expression blocked granulocyte differentiation to the terminal mitotic stages and that deletion of the NH2-terminal 47 amino acids and/or the COOH-terminal 248 amino acids of c-myb neither enhanced nor diminished this effect.",,,,,['c-myb'],,,,

Two chimeric RTs, having the entire polymerase domain or all but the last 19 amino acids, were expressed. In both cases, these RTs made multiple cuts in PPT-containing substrates, whereas wild-type cleavages occurred primarily at sites consistent with the distance between the polymerase and RNase H active sites. Primer extension assays performed with the chimeric RTs, an RNase H-minus RT, and wild-type showed that the presence of a wild-type viral RNase H domain facilitates processive DNA synthesis. When wild-type RT was bound to primer-template, two retarded bands could be detected in band-shift assays. In the absence of primer extension, a high proportion of enzyme-bound primer-template was associated with the faster-migrating band, whereas with DNA synthesis, more of the bound radioactivity was in the super-shifted complex. This suggests that the super-shifted complex contains the active form of RT. The mutant RTs were deficient in formation of this complex, but the chimeric RTs were somewhat less defective than the RNase H-minus mutant.

Approved cytokines, as well as cytokines not yet released for general use, are included in this review. RESULTS: Clinical applications of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and erythropoietin, the three recombinant hematopoietic growth factors currently commercially available for clinical use in the United States, are discussed. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), PIXY321, stem-cell factor (SCF), IL-1, IL-6, and IL-11 represent cytokines not yet approved; the majority of these newer agents have their principal action at an earlier time point in the hematopoietic cascade than the currently approved cytokines. Current clinical uses of hematopoietic growth factors include decreasing cytopenias associated with chemotherapy, those due to congenital or acquired bone marrow failure states, those that occur after high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, peripheral-blood progenitor mobilization, and supportive care of leukemia patients. CONCLUSION: Hematopoietic growth factors have made a significant impact on the prevention of infections associated with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, shortening of neutropenia following high-dose chemotherapy and progenitor-cell transplantation, and chemotherapy-associated anemia.

We have previously demonstrated that TNF-alpha directly inhibits CSF-induced proliferation of primitive murine lineage-negative bone marrow progenitors (Lin-) and stem cell antigen-1 hematopoietic progenitors through the 75-kDa TNF receptor (TNF-R2), whereas TNF-alpha-induced inhibition of more committed Lin- progenitors is mediated through the 55-kDa TNF-R (TNF-R1), indicating a differential role of the two TNF-Rs in hematopoiesis. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of stem cell factor (SCF), a key regulator of hematopoiesis signaling through c-kit, to synergize with other hematopoietic growth factors, but little is known about cytokines capable of inhibiting hematopoiesis induced by SCF. While TNF-alpha has been demonstrated to enhance SCF-induced proliferation of myeloid leukemia blasts, the present report demonstrates that TNF-alpha, by signaling through TNF-R2, inhibits SCF-induced proliferation of normal murine Lin- and stem cell antigen-1 hematopoietic progenitors. SCF-stimulated proliferation of the hematopoietic cell line FDC-P1 was also potently inhibited by TNF-alpha and was accompanied by down-regulation of c-kit cell surface expression as well as c-kit mRNA levels. Finally, treatment of the FDC-P1 cell line with TNF-alpha resulted in increased levels of the tumor suppressor p53 mRNA, suggesting another mechanism by which hematopoietic effects of TNF-alpha may be mediated.",,,,,"['c-kit', 'p53']",,,,

The phosphorylation of receptor tyrosines was both dose-dependent and saturable in amounts similar to those shown to be active for native heregulin. HAR-TX beta 2 was specifically cytotoxic toward a variety of carcinoma cell lines in the ng/ml range. However, some tumor cell lines were found to be insensitive to the cytotoxic action of the fusion protein even at > 2 micrograms/ml. Relative amounts of HER4, HER3, and HER2 were determined on seven cell lines sensitive and four cell lines insensitive to HAR-TX beta 2. All lines that express HER4 were killed by HAR-TX beta 2, while none lacking HER4 were affected. HAR-TX beta 2 was able to bind to and signal via tyrosine phosphorylation in cell lines that co-express HER2 and HER3 in the absence of HER4 without inducing cytotoxicity.

Our report characterizes RadLV-induced thymic T-cell lines that differ both in their tumorigenic potential and in the level of protein for class-Ia and TL genes. The PD1.1 cell line is CD4-CD8+ and expresses relatively high levels of class-I as compared with the CD4+CD8+ PD1.2 cell line. These class-I-expression levels correlate with thymocytes and splenic T cells of the same phenotype, except that normal cells fail to express TL3b. Interferon-treated PD1.2 cells demonstrate significantly lower levels of class-I expression than do interferon-treated PD1.1 cells, and were shown to contain large amounts of degraded class-I mRNA, at least some of which was TL in origin. These RNA products were not detected in PD1.1 cells, suggesting the existence of a mechanism controlling cell-specific and gene-specific mRNA stability. Such RadLV-induced cell lines provide a means for obtaining stage-specific T cells, which can be used for studying the regulation of class-I gene expression during T-cell differentiation, as well as factors that differentially regulate class-Ia and class-Ib expression and are potentially useful for studying T-cell differentiation in general.",,,,,"['CD1', 'Cdl', 'H-2', 'H-2Q', 'H-M', 'H-T', 'HLA', 'PD1', 'TL']",,,,

However, those molecules which can trigger IL-6 secretion either by tumor cells or non-MM marrow cells are not well characterized. In the present study, we have examined the expression and functional significance of CD40 on MM and plasma cell leukemia (PCL) cells and derived cell lines, as well as long-term bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and derived cell lines. CD40 was expressed on the majority of MM cells (> 90%) and BMSCs (> 70%). Triggering via CD40 using NIH3T3 CD40 ligand transfectant (CD40LT) cells increased (> 30%) cell surface CD80, CD18, CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c expression on MM cell lines. Culture with either fresh or paraformaldehyde fixed NIH3T3 CD40LT cells upregulates IL-6 secretion in MM cells and MM-derived cell lines, as well as normal and MM bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs), BMSCs, and BMSC lines; this effect can be specifically blocked by anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (MoAb). BMMCs and BMSCs from patients with MM secreted significantly more IL-6 than those from healthy donors (n = 3, P < .001); moreover, after stimulation using CD40L, IL-6 secretion was fourfold greater (n = 3, P < .001) from MM BMMCs and BMSCs than from normal BMMCs and BMSCs. Myeloma (CD38+CD45RA-) cells and non-MM (CD38+CD45RA+, CD38-CD45RA+, and CD38-CD45RA-) BMMCs were separated by dual fluorescence cell sorting. The latter secreted fourfold more IL-6 than the former (n = 2, P < .001). Increased IL-6 secretion (up to 28-fold) and proliferation (Stimulation index 10) by CD38+CD45RA-MM cells was triggered by culture with NIH3T3 CD40LT cells. Finally, anti-CD40MoAb partially (30%) blocked tumor cell to BMSC adhesion-induced IL-6 secretion. These studies support the view that CD40L may trigger IL-6 secretion by both MM cells and BMSCs and that IL-6-mediated autocrine and paracrine growth mechanisms may be possible in MM.",,,,,,,,,

Because TCR delta genes lie within the TCR alpha locus, the rearrangement processes, transcription, and translation of TCR delta or TCR alpha variable domain exons require tight regulation. Human precursor B-cell leukemias (eg, the REH cell line) constitute an interesting model to study TCR delta/alpha recombination because they rearrange TCR delta/alpha loci along a hierarchically ordered pathway in which V delta 2D delta 3 segments are joined to the J alpha cluster. We now show for REH cells that chimeric TCR delta/alpha variable domain exons are posttranscriptionally modified by alternative splicing resulting in truncated V delta 2C alpha transcripts. This process also takes place during thymic differentiation. CD7+/CD3- T-cell precursors exhibit V delta 2D delta 3 rearrangements. Further differentiation into CD7+/CD3+ thymocytes is associated with the expression of a truncated V delta 2C alpha RNA species.

PML gene fuses with the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) gene during the t(15; 17) chromosomal translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The epitope recognized by PG-M3 is species-specific and fixative-resistant and is shared by most PML isoforms and PML/RAR alpha fusion proteins. PML is consistently located within the nucleus, although a minority of cells (about 20%), both in vitro and in vivo, show positivity for PML also in the cytoplasm. The nuclear staining pattern of PG-M3 varies from speckled (cells other than APL) to micropunctate (APL cells). Although two physiologically expressed PML isoforms are detectable by immunocytochemistry only or predominantly in the cytoplasm of transfected cells, the cytoplasmic localization of PML is a property also shared by the PML isoforms that predominantly localize to the nuclei. Immunohistologic analysis of normal human tissues with the PG-M3 MoAb showed variable PML expression, with the highest levels of the protein in postmitotic, differentiated cell types, such as endothelial cells, epithelia, and tissue macrophages, especially activated ones. In keeping with this in vivo finding, PML appears strongly upregulated in the U937 promonocyte cell line after exposure to agents that induce monocyte/macrophage activation (interferon gamma) or maturation (vitamin D3 and transforming growth factor beta 1).",,,,,['PML'],,,,

Steel factor (SF), also a product of marrow stromal cells, is an essential positive regulator of hematopoiesis in vivo. TGF-beta 1 has been shown to repress human and murine leukemic cell and murine lin- bone marrow mononuclear cell expression of the receptor for SF (c-kit). We speculated that TGF-beta 1 might exert its inhibitory effect on hematopoiesis in part by decreasing SF/c-kit interactions. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that TGF-beta 1 inhibits both stromal cell expression of SF and hematopoietic progenitor cell expression of c-kit. We measured stromal cell expression of SF protein and hematopoietic progenitor cell expression of membrane-bound c-kit before and after exposure to recombinant human TGF-beta 1. Both stromal cell expression of SF protein and hematopoietic progenitor cell expression of c-kit protein were inhibited 50% to 80% by TGF-beta 1. Using Northern blot and ribonuclease protection assays, we determined that TGF-beta 1 repressed stromal cell SF mRNA, but did not alter SF transcript stability. TGF-beta 1 was also found to repress c-kit mRNA in human leukemic myeloblasts as well as in normal lin- hematopoietic progenitor cells. In contrast with its effect on SF mRNA, TGF-beta 1 accelerated the degradation of c-kit mRNA. We conclude that TGF-beta 1 inhibits stromal cell production of SF by repression of SF gene transcription and represses hematopoietic progenitor cell expression of c-kit by decreasing the stability of c-kit transcripts. Taking into account the importance of SF and c-kit in maintaining steady-state hematopoiesis in vivo, the dual effect of TGF-beta 1 on both SF and c-kit gene expression is likely to be one of the major mechanisms by which TGF-beta 1 inhibits hematopoiesis in vivo.",,,,,"['SF', 'c-kit', 'lin']",,,,

Pharmacologic agents, including the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, have been shown to upregulate fetal and embryonic globin gene expression. In this report we investigate the possibility that metabolic derangements characterized by an inability to metabolize another short-chain fatty acid, propionate, could be associated with a persistence of fetal hemoglobin unrelated to alterations in the beta-globin cluster. Embryonic globin gene upregulation in a murine adult erythroid cell culture was shown by RNase protection after induction with three short-chain fatty acids (C2-C5). Chart reviews and measurement of fetal hemoglobin in five patients with abnormalities in propionate (C3) metabolism were undertaken; SSCP/dideoxy fingerprint analysis of the gamma-globin gene promoters was done in three of these five patients. Twelve patients with other metabolic derangements served as controls. Only the four patients with clinically severe abnormalities in propionate metabolism (ages 2 to 11), but without anemia, showed a sustained elevation in fetal hemoglobin (3% to 10%). The level of elevation of fetal hemoglobin in these patients, who lack erythropoietic stress, suggests that propionic acid and/or its metabolites are potent stimulators of fetal hemoglobin expression. Study of this group of patients should allow unique insights into the long-term effects of sustained exposure to elevations of short-chain fatty acid levels.",,,,,,,,,

Their relative level of expression is variable depending on the cell line examined. The highest level of expression of p95B-raf was found in UT-7 cells, a human pluripotent cell line established from a patient with a megakaryoblastic leukemia. These cells are able to differentiate toward erythroid or myeloid lineage phenotypes in presence of erythropoietin (EPO) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) respectively. We show that treatment of UT-7 cells with EPO, GM-CSF or stem cell factor (SCF) rapidly induces phosphorylation of p95B-raf as indicated by a shift of electrophoretic mobility. This increase in phosphorylation is correlated with a three-fold increase of B-Raf kinase activity. B-Raf activation also increases in a dose-dependent manner in response to EPO and GM-CSF.

Most studies have found that these leukemic CD5+ B cells, like their normal counterparts, use immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) region genes that exhibit minimal, if any, somatic diversity. These and other observations have suggested that CD5+ B cells may be incapable of generating Ig V gene diversity, and therefore may not be able to develop higher affinity binding sites that could be selected by antigen. However, most of the studies of CLL and normal CD5+ B cells have focused on IgM-producing cells. Since somatic mutations are most often seen in B cells that have undergone an isotype class switch, we analyzed the Ig heavy (H) and light (L) chain variable region genes of seven IgG+CD5+ CLL B cells to determine if somatic diversification and antigen selection had occurred. The data derived provide evidence for skewed use, somatic diversification, and antigenic selection of the Ig V region genes. Nonrandom use of both H and L chain V region genes was manifested by an overrepresentation of VH4 and VKI family genes and the underrepresentation of the JH4 gene segment. Furthermore, VH4 gene use was restricted to only two family members (4.21 and 4.18). In four of the seven cases, the VH and VL genes displayed > or = 5% difference from the most homologous known germline counterparts. Polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analyses performed in two of these patients demonstrated that their unique VH CDR2 and adjacent sequences were not present in their germline DNA. In addition, a significant level of diversity was seen in the rearranged DJH segments and at the VL-JL junctions of every patient that occurred both at the time of recombination and subsequently. The localization of replacement changes to complementarity determining regions of some patients suggested that antigen selection had occurred. Furthermore, the mutations identified in the VH and VL genes of each individual patient were strikingly similar, both in number and location. Collectively, the data indicate that a subset of CD5+ CLL B cells can display Ig V region gene mutations. In addition, they are consistent with the notions that in some cases antigen selection of these mutations may have occurred, and that antigen stimulation may be a promoting factor in the evolution of certain CLL clones.",PMC2191964,"['GENBANK/X84333', 'GENBANK/X84334', 'GENBANK/X84335', 'GENBANK/X84336', 'GENBANK/X84337', 'GENBANK/X84338', 'GENBANK/X84339', 'GENBANK/X84340', 'GENBANK/X84341', 'GENBANK/X84342', 'GENBANK/X84343', 'GENBANK/X84344', 'GENBANK/X84345', 'GENBANK/X84346']",,,,,,,

The presence of stem cells in mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) was examined by staining the CD34+Lineage- (Lin-) population for the expression of the Thy-1 antigen. The extent and kinetics of mobilization of CD34+Thy-1+ Lin- cells into peripheral blood were studied. In our analysis the percentage of these cells was found to vary widely depending on the day of leukapheresis and the individual patient. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to isolate Thy-1 subsets from MPB which were analyzed for activity in in vitro long term cultures and in two in vivo models in which SCID-hu mice were implanted with human fetal bone or thymus grafts. The long term culture assay shows that the cells which express Thy-1 are enriched for cobblestone area forming activity (CAFC), an assay which can be used as a measure of detecting PBSC's in vitro. This CD34+Thy-1+ Lin- cell population was capable of producing both B and myeloid cells, and maintaining CD34+Lin- cells in these long term cultures. Moreover, the CD34+Thy-1+Lin- cell subset possessed a higher ability to engraft and to produce multilineage hematopoietic lineages in the SCID-hu bone assay and T cells in the SCID-hu thymus assay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

Among this group are Steel factor (also known as mast cell growth factor, stem cell factor and kit ligand), and the more recently described flt3 ligand. These factors have been shown to function by binding to and activating the c-kit and flt3 tyrosine kinase receptors, respectively. Both of these factors stimulate the growth of mouse and human hematopoietic progenitor cells. These factors therefore differ from such later acting hematopoietic factors as colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1, which regulates the growth, survival and differentiation of monocytic cells through the c-fms tyrosine kinase receptor. Like Steel factor, the flt3 ligand has little biological activity on its own, but synergizes well with a number of other colony stimulating factors and interleukins. One major difference between the two factors appears to be their effect on mast cells. Steel factor stimulates both the proliferation and activation of mast cells, while preliminary data with the flt3 ligand suggests that it has no effect on mast cells. Although the flt3 ligand and Steel factor each act on early hematopoietic cells, differences in their activities suggest that they are not redundant and are both required for normal hematopoiesis.",,,,,,,,,

While the regulation of normal and leukemic myelopoiesis is well investigated, little is known about effects of cytokines on growth and differentiation of lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, we investigated the expression of receptors for G-CSF, GM-CSF, SCF, IL-3, and IL-7 on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts and the effects of these growth factors (GF) on ALL blast colony formation. The binding of fluorescence-tagged cytokines to receptors on ALL blasts was studied by flow-cytometry in 27 cases of ALL (24 precursor B-ALL, 3 T-ALL). Receptor-binding for myeloid-associated GF was observed in the majority of precursor B-ALL (G-CSF = 100%, GM-CSF = 65%, IL-3 = 83%, SCF = 74%), but not in T-ALL. Binding of labelled IL-7 was detected in both precursor B- (92%) and T-ALL (100%). The presence of receptors for SCF in ALL was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction for c-kit mRNA in 19/21 cases tested. Expression of receptors for G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and SCF was not associated with expression of myeloid antigens, or with specific cytogenetic abnormalities. The effects of these GF on clonogenic cells were tested in the ALL blast colony assay and varied between samples, but all cytokines were able to increase clonogenic growth. The GM-CSF/IL-3 fusion molecule PIXY-321 was most effective in promoting colony growth. In some cases inhibition of colony formation was found. We conclude that ALL blast cells have receptors not only for IL-7, but also for G-CSF, GM-CSF, SCF, and IL-3. ALL precursors can respond to these GF with changes in their clonogenic growth indicating the presence of functional receptors. Results may have implications for therapeutic approaches combining cytokines and chemotherapy.",,,,,['c-kit'],,,,

Challenge of NB4 cells with G-CSF, dbcAMP and ATRA causes a much higher induction of LAP relative to that observed in the presence of ATRA+G-CSF or ATRA+dbcAMP. Treatment of NB4 with ATRA and G-CSF results in increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins.

Hematopoiesis requires cytokines, collectively termed colony stimulating factors (CSFs), which act on progenitor cell populations and induce their commitment to a specific lineage. For instance, leukemia, inhibitor factor and stem cell factor act on pluripotent cells and immature progenitors, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) acts at early stages of the development of myelomonocytic lineage, whereas granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) act on more mature cells of the same lineage and are only required later during the differentiation of this cell lineage. A second important element for the hematopoietic process is the presence of extracellular matrix proteins, which bind CSFs and correctly present the molecules to specific receptors present on the surface of the progenitor cells. Finally, stromal cells (i.e. fibroblasts, endothelial cells and adipocytes) which support the growth of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro, are crucial for the production of CSFs and protein matrix and regulate the passage of mature cells from bone marrow to bloodstream. Idiopathic myelofibrosis is an example of the relevance of microenvironment in hematopoiesis. This disease is characterized by fibroblast and basement membrane accumulation, appearance of myofibroblasts and modification of the capillary network and provokes a bone marrow aplasia. In this article we review recent studies on the role of hemopoietic cytokines on stromal cells, in particular on endothelial cells, and propose a double role for CSFs in hematopoiesis: to induce the commitment of progenitor cells and to maintain the behavior of bone marrow endothelial cells.",,,,,,,,,

Four CTL epitopes have been identified by the use of synthetic peptides corresponding to AKR623-encoded amino acid sequences. Here we present both functional and nucleotide sequence data indicating that three closely related Emv share all of these CTL epitopes. We also found that one other murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) was not susceptible to lysis by these CTL. This is the ecotropic component of the LP-BM5 virus complex that causes murine AIDS. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that three of the four epitopes, including the immunodominant peptide, are altered in this virus. The other epitope was unchanged. These data implied that the inability of anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL to lyse cells infected with the LP-BM5 ecotropic (BM5eco) MuLV was due to the functional loss of three of the four CTL epitopes. Using recombinant vaccinia and Sindbis virus vectors, we have shown that the BM5eco-encoded form of the immunodominant epitope, which differs only by an arginine for lysine substitution at the N-terminal residue, fails to induce a CTL response in B6 mice. Immunization with BM5eco-infected cells also failed to induce MuLV-specific CTL. In light of the long in vivo passage history of the LP-BM5 complex in B6 mice, our results are consistent with a contribution of CTL-mediated immune selection to the evolution of the BM5eco MuLV.",,,,,,,,,

Engagement of alpha 4 or beta 1 on Mo, but not members of the beta 2 integrin family, with specific mAbs as surrogate ligands immediately and directly induced high level surface expression of TF, and accumulation of TF mRNA, as well as production of TNF-alpha and HIV-1 virus. The mechanism responsible for induction of TF gene transcription mediated by the engagement of alpha 4 or beta 1 was elucidated by using THP-1 monoblastic leukemia cells. Functional analysis of plasmids containing the TF promoter expressing the luciferase reporter gene identified a cis-acting integrin-responsive element (InRE), which contained two AP-1 sites as well as a single kappa B-like site. Mutation of either the AP-1 sites or kappa B-like site greatly diminished responsiveness to integrin engagement. This InRE also conferred responsiveness to a heterologous promoter in the same reporter plasmid. Binding of mAbs to either alpha 4 or beta 1 led to nuclear translocation of the c-Rel/p65 heterodimer that preferentially bound to the TF kappa B-like site.

With this technology, the earliest stages of myeloid and lymphoid differentiation can easily and reliably be identified using antibodies directed against (pro-)myeloperoxidase/MPO, CD22 and CD3 antigens, respectively. Particularly for the analysis of undifferentiated acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cells, the immunological demonstration of intracellular MPO or its enzymatically inactive proforms is highly relevant, since other myeloid marker molecules such as CD33, CD13, or CDw65 are either not restricted to the granulomonocytic lineage or appear later in differentiation. By combining MPO staining with staining for lactoferrin (LF), undifferentiated cells can be distinguished from the granulomonocytic maturation compartment in bone marrow, since LF is selectively expressed from the myelocyte stage of differentiation onward. The list of informative intracellular antigens to be used in leukemia cell analysis will certainly expand in the near future. One candidate, intracellular CD68, has already been tested by us, and results are presented. Also dealt within this article are surface marker molecules not (as yet) widely used in leukemia cell analysis but with the potential to provide important additional information.

Considering the high prevalence of latent infections by Lymphotropic herpesviruses and their frequent spontaneous reactivation, one wonders whether the stimulation of lymphoid cells by such immunostimulants may further support virus reactivation. We have performed tissue culture experiments using the well defined infectious system of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and the immature T cell HSB2 to test the effects of echinacin, isoprinosine and thymus factors on the frequency and extent of virus antigen expression in infected cells. The results show that various viral antigens related to virus replication and to the synthesis of structural components appear earlier in cells stimulated with such substances as echinacin, timunox and TP-1, but not following the stimulation with isoprinosine. Similarly, virus genome containing cells as determined by in situ hybridization techniques increased after stimulation with thymic preparations (thymostimulin and thymopentin), but not with echinacin and isoprinosine. The data suggest that the synthesis of proteins or DNA of lymphotropic viruses may be transiently enhanced when lymphoid cells are stimulated by certain non-specific immunostimulants. There was no evidence, however, of increased virus replication. Since the data presented here are rather preliminary results from tissue culture studies, the use of such substances in patients should include a critical monitoring of the activity of lymphotropic viruses to exclude untoward effects through persistent viral activity and/or autoimmune dysregulations (e.g. secondary to selective expression of viral antigens). More detailed studies are needed to this effect including long-term controls in patients treated by these substances.",,,,,,,,,

Using various combinations of retroviral vectors and packaging cell lines, we demonstrated high expression of a bacterial beta-Gal activity induced by the LacZ gene, the nlsLacZ gene, or the Sh-ble/LacZ gene, in human hematopoietic cells. The expression of the nlsLacZ construct was stable until the end of the culture in infected CD34+ cell-enriched cell populations, and a slow decrease of transgene expression was observed in a transduced TF-1 cell population during a 1-year long-term culture. Data obtained with the nlsLacZ gene demonstrate that both retroviral transfer and corresponding gene expression were not found to modify the pattern of cell proliferation and differentiation.

Formation of adhesive contacts leads to transduction of signals into the cell and results in altered gene expression and modulation of the cellular phenotype. Specific adhesive interactions of the fibronectin and vitronectin receptors with their ligands in the matrix modulates expression of ECM-degrading metalloproteases. These proteases are involved in the acquisition of the invasive phenotype by a number of cell types. The activity of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) is reduced by endogenous inhibitors referred to as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs). Alterations in the balance between the activity of MMPs and TIMPs alters cellular invasion through effects on matrix degradation. In this study we demonstrate that inhibition of endogenous gelatinase A activity in A2058 human melanoma cells results in enhanced cellular adhesion. To further explore this phenomenon, we have used retroviral infection vectors to control the amount of the MMP inhibitor TIMP-2 in human melanoma A2058 cells. Altering the production of TIMP-2 modulates not only proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, but also the adhesive and spreading properties of the cells and results in altered cell morphology. These effects of TIMP-2 appear to be mediated by inhibition of gelatinase A activity. We conclude that gelatinase A, in addition to contributing to proteolysis of ECM components, also functions to proteolyse cell surface components that mediate attachment of A2058 cells to the ECM. Thus, gelatinase A may function to modulate cell attachment and facilitate cell migration and invasion.",PMC398163,,,,,,,,
