We investigated infections at diagnosis and then assessed the timing of infection at birth in children with ALL and age, gender, and ethnicity matched controls to identify potential causal initiating infections. Comprehensive untargeted virome and bacterial analyses of pretreatment bone marrow specimens (n = 127 ALL in comparison with 38 acute myeloid leukemia cases in a comparison group) revealed prevalent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection at diagnosis in childhood ALL, demonstrating active viral transcription in leukemia blasts as well as intact virions in serum. Screening of newborn blood samples revealed a significantly higher prevalence of in utero CMV infection in ALL cases (n = 268) than healthy controls (n = 270) (odds ratio [OR], 3.71, confidence interval [CI], 1.56-7.92, P = .0016).

Despite a growing number of leukemia clinical trials, tissue specific delivery of therapeutic siRNA is a major roadblock in translating its clinical potential. The most recent reports in the antibody-siRNA-conjugates (ARCs) field add new dimensions to leukemic therapy, where a covalently ligated therapeutic antisense-RNA with the potential to repress the oncogenic transcript is selectively delivered into the cancer cells. Despite ARC localization to leukemic cells due to high affinity antigen-antibody interactions, multiple challenges exist to unlock the therapeutic potential of siRNA targeting. Areas covered: This review focuses on antibody and siRNA-based therapies for leukemia as well as potential antibody engineering-based strategies to generate an optimal ARC platform. Expert opinion: In vitro and clinical results have revealed that non-targeted delivery and inefficient cellular internalization of therapeutic siRNA are major contributing factors for the lack of efficacy in leukemia patients. Rational antibody design and selective protein engineering with the potential to neutralize siRNA charge, stabilize ARC complex, restrict off-targeted delivery, optimize endosomal escape, and extend serum half-life will generate clinically relevant leukemic therapies that are safe, selective, and effective.",,"['Tushir-Singh, Jogender']",['Tushir-Singh J'],"['a Laboratory of Novel Biologics, Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Genetics , University of Virginia Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine , Charlottesville , VA , USA.']",,20161223,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Antibodies', '*RNA induced silencing complex (RISC)', '*RNA interference technology (RNAi)', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)', '*antibody-siRNA conjugates (ARCs)', '*bispecific antibodies', '*cancer therapy', '*chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL)', '*chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', '*complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)', '*non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)', '*small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)', '*small molecules inhibitors (SMI)', '*targeted delivery']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An 8-month-old male infant presented to the ophthalmology clinic with a left orbital mass, which had been increasing in size over the previous 2 months. The mass was initially diagnosed at another clinic as an infantile hemangioma, and had been treated with a topical formulation of timolol. In the ophthalmology clinic, orbital magnetic resonance imaging showed a solid enhancing mass. A biopsy was performed, and histopathology revealed myeloid sarcoma. The disease responded well to a standard chemotherapy regimen. Myeloid sarcoma is a rare, extra-medullary presentation that can occur as an isolated tumor, concurrently with or at relapse of acute myeloid leukemia. Because few cases of myeloid sarcoma in the orbit have been reported, this case report aids in the management of myeloid sarcoma in pediatric patients. The report describes an 8-month-old male infant, the youngest patient to develop myeloid sarcoma without preexisting acute myeloid leukemia.

Neurofibromatoses (NF) are autosomal dominant inherited diseases that can affect tissues such as bone and skin and predispose individuals to tumor development in various parts of the nervous system or body. Optic nerve glioma and brain tumors are common in children with NF, and leukemia and lymphoma incidence is also higher than normal. We therefore aimed to investigate the possible relationship between the MTHFR gene polymorphism and accompanying tumors such as neurofibroma, hamartoma, and optic glioma in children with NF1 found to have the MTHFR 677 and MTHFR 1298 gene polymorphism in this study. We included 55 pediatric patients diagnosed with NF1 between 2005 and 2014 in the study group. The control group included 44 healthy subjects without acute or chronic disease findings. A significant relationship was found between the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and the incidence of optic glioma (p=0.014) (AA vs. AC: OR 11, 95% CI 1.27-95.17; AA vs. CC: OR 7.33, 95% CI 0.35-150.70). We also found a significant relationship between the MTHFR C1298C polymorphism and the incidence of hamartoma (p=0.019) (AA vs. AC: OR 2.12, 95% CI 0.662-6.809; p=0.203). Epilepsy incidence was high in subjects with MTHFR C677C.

Here we investigated the presence of TNTs by live fluorescent microscopy and identified TNT formation between primary AML cells and in AML cell lines. We found that NF-kappaB activity was involved in TNT regulation and formation. Cytarabine downregulated TNTs and inhibited NF-kappaB alone and in combination with daunorubicin, providing additional support for involvement of the NF-kappaB pathway in TNT formation.

In the HL-60 cell line model, synergy was observed for the combination of melflufen and cytarabine, an interaction that appeared sequence dependent with increased synergy when melflufen was added before cytarabine. Also, in primary cultures of AML cells from patients melflufen was highly active, while normal PBMC cultures appeared less sensitive, indicating a 7-fold in vitro therapeutic index.

Using a pharmacological screening approach, we discovered that combined inhibition of B cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-XL) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/4E-BP axis results in selective and synergistic induction of apoptosis in cellular and animal models of PIK3CA mutant breast cancers, including triple-negative tumors. Mechanistically, inhibition of mTOR/4E-BP suppresses myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) protein translation only in PIK3CA mutant tumors, creating a synthetic dependence on BCL-XL This dual dependence on BCL-XL and MCL-1, but not on BCL-2, appears to be a fundamental property of diverse breast cancer cell lines, xenografts, and patient-derived tumors that is independent of the molecular subtype or PIK3CA mutational status. Furthermore, this dependence distinguishes breast cancers from normal breast epithelial cells, which are neither primed for apoptosis nor dependent on BCL-XL/MCL-1, suggesting a potential therapeutic window. By tilting the balance of pro- to antiapoptotic signals in the mitochondria, dual inhibition of MCL-1 and BCL-XL also sensitizes breast cancer cells to standard-of-care cytotoxic and targeted chemotherapies. Together, these results suggest that patients with PIK3CA mutant breast cancers may benefit from combined treatment with inhibitors of BCL-XL and the mTOR/4E-BP axis, whereas alternative methods of inhibiting MCL-1 and BCL-XL may be effective in tumors lacking PIK3CA mutations.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Anderson, Gray R', 'Wardell, Suzanne E', 'Cakir, Merve', 'Crawford, Lorin', 'Leeds, Jim C', 'Nussbaum, Daniel P', 'Shankar, Pallavi S', 'Soderquist, Ryan S', 'Stein, Elizabeth M', 'Tingley, Jennifer P', 'Winter, Peter S', 'Zieser-Misenheimer, Elizabeth K', 'Alley, Holly M', 'Yllanes, Alexander', 'Haney, Victoria', 'Blackwell, Kimberly L', 'McCall, Shannon J', 'McDonnell, Donald P', 'Wood, Kris C']","['Anderson GR', 'Wardell SE', 'Cakir M', 'Crawford L', 'Leeds JC', 'Nussbaum DP', 'Shankar PS', 'Soderquist RS', 'Stein EM', 'Tingley JP', 'Winter PS', 'Zieser-Misenheimer EK', 'Alley HM', 'Yllanes A', 'Haney V', 'Blackwell KL', 'McCall SJ', 'McDonnell DP', 'Wood KC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Statistical Science, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Program in Genetics and Genomics, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Medicine/Oncology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA. kris.wood@duke.edu.']","['K12 HD043446/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK048807/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK048807/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC5626456,,,,,,['NIHMS907644'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 10.,,"DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2alpha) is a prominent target for anticancer drugs whose clinical efficacy is often limited by chemoresistance. Using antibody specific for the N-terminal of TOP2alpha, immunoassays indicated the existence of two TOP2alpha isoforms, 170 and 90 kDa, present in K562 leukemia cells and in an acquired etoposide (VP-16)-resistant clone (K/VP.5). TOP2alpha/90 expression was dramatically increased in etoposide-resistant K/VP.5 compared with parental K562 cells. We hypothesized that TOP2alpha/90 was the translation product of novel alternatively processed pre-mRNA, confirmed by 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing. TOP2alpha/90 mRNA includes retained intron 19, which harbors an in-frame stop codon, and two consensus poly(A) sites. The processed transcript is polyadenylated. TOP2alpha/90 mRNA encodes a 90,076-Da translation product missing the C-terminal 770 amino acids of TOP2alpha/170, replaced by 25 unique amino acids through translation of the exon 19/intron 19 read-through. Immunoassays, utilizing antisera raised against these unique amino acids, confirmed that TOP2alpha/90 is expressed in both cell types, with overexpression in K/VP.5 cells. Immunodetection of complex of enzyme-to-DNA and single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assays demonstrated that K562 cells transfected with a TOP2alpha/90 expression plasmid exhibited reduced etoposide-mediated TOP2alpha-DNA covalent complexes and decreased etoposide-induced DNA damage, respectively, compared with similarly treated K562 cells transfected with empty vector. Because TOP2alpha/90 lacks the active site tyrosine (Tyr(805)) of full-length TOP2alpha, these results strongly suggest that TOP2alpha/90 exhibits dominant-negative properties. Further studies are underway to characterize the mechanism(s) by which TOP2alpha/90 plays a role in acquired resistance to etoposide and other TOP2alpha targeting agents.","['Copyright (c) 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Kanagasabai, Ragu', 'Serdar, Lucas', 'Karmahapatra, Soumendrakrishna', 'Kientz, Corey A', 'Ellis, Justin', 'Ritke, Mary K', 'Elton, Terry S', 'Yalowich, Jack C']","['Kanagasabai R', 'Serdar L', 'Karmahapatra S', 'Kientz CA', 'Ellis J', 'Ritke MK', 'Elton TS', 'Yalowich JC']","['Division of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (R.K., L.S., S.K., C.A.K., J.E., T.S.E., J.C.Y.); James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (J.C.Y.); and Department of Biology, University of Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana (M.K.R.).', 'Division of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (R.K., L.S., S.K., C.A.K., J.E., T.S.E., J.C.Y.); James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (J.C.Y.); and Department of Biology, University of Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana (M.K.R.).', 'Division of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (R.K., L.S., S.K., C.A.K., J.E., T.S.E., J.C.Y.); James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (J.C.Y.); and Department of Biology, University of Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana (M.K.R.).', 'Division of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (R.K., L.S., S.K., C.A.K., J.E., T.S.E., J.C.Y.); James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (J.C.Y.); and Department of Biology, University of Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana (M.K.R.).', 'Division of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (R.K., L.S., S.K., C.A.K., J.E., T.S.E., J.C.Y.); James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (J.C.Y.); and Department of Biology, University of Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana (M.K.R.).', 'Division of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (R.K., L.S., S.K., C.A.K., J.E., T.S.E., J.C.Y.); James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (J.C.Y.); and Department of Biology, University of Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana (M.K.R.).', 'Division of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (R.K., L.S., S.K., C.A.K., J.E., T.S.E., J.C.Y.); James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (J.C.Y.); and Department of Biology, University of Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana (M.K.R.) yalowich.1@osu.edu elton.8@osu.edu.', 'Division of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (R.K., L.S., S.K., C.A.K., J.E., T.S.E., J.C.Y.); James Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio (J.C.Y.); and Department of Biology, University of Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana (M.K.R.) yalowich.1@osu.edu elton.8@osu.edu.']",,20161110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TOP2 poisons are valuable and widely used anticancer drugs, but they are associated with the occurrence of secondary acute myeloid leukemias. These factors have led to the hypothesis that myeloperoxidase inhibition could protect hematopoietic cells from TOP2 poison-mediated genotoxic damage and, therefore, reduce the rate of therapy-related leukemia. We show here that myeloperoxidase activity leads to elevated accumulation of etoposide- and mitoxantrone-induced TOP2A and TOP2B-DNA covalent complexes in cells, which are converted to DNA double-strand breaks. For both drugs, the effect of myeloperoxidase activity was greater for TOP2B than for TOP2A. This is a significant finding because TOP2B has been linked to genetic damage associated with leukemic transformation, including etoposide-induced chromosomal breaks at the MLL and RUNX1 loci. Glutathione depletion, mimicking in vivo conditions experienced during chemotherapy treatment, elicited further MPO-dependent increase in TOP2A and especially TOP2B-DNA complexes and DNA double-strand break formation. Together these results support targeting myeloperoxidase activity to reduce genetic damage leading to therapy-related leukemia, a possibility that is enhanced by the recent development of novel specific myeloperoxidase inhibitors for use in inflammatory diseases involving neutrophil infiltration.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Author(s).'],"['Atwal, Mandeep', 'Lishman, Emma L', 'Austin, Caroline A', 'Cowell, Ian G']","['Atwal M', 'Lishman EL', 'Austin CA', 'Cowell IG']","['Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne.

Normal stem cells exhibit an attenuated DNA damage response (DDR), inefficient DNA repair, and high radiosensitivity. The impact of unique chromatin characteristics of stem cells in DDR regulation is not yet recognized. We demonstrate that murine embryonic stem cells (ES) display constitutively elevated acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) and low H3K9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3). DNA damage-induced local deacetylation of H3K9 was abrogated in ES along with the subsequent H3K9me3. Depletion of H3K9ac in ES by suppression of monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (MOZ) acetyltransferase improved ATM activation, DNA repair, diminished irradiation-induced apoptosis, and enhanced clonogenic survival.

METHODS: Bone marrow samples were collected from 45 children with AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia, AML-M3) at different time points of AML treatment and follow-up. WT1 gene expression levels in bone marrow mononuclear cells were assayed by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The correlation between WT1 expression and prognosis was retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The WT1 expression level in AML children with bone marrow blast cell percentage of >60% was significantly higher than in those with bone marrow blast cell percentage of </= 60% (p<0.05). The lower WT1 expression level was documented in children with AML-M2 compared with in children with other non-M2 subtypes (p<0.05). WT1 expression level in patients in complete remission was significantly lower than that in patients at diagnosis or relapse (p<0.01). The 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with higher WT1 expression was significantly lower than in those with lower WT1 expression at the end of induction chemotherapy (p<0.05). The 2-year overall survival (OS) and DFS in patients with >/=1 log WT1 reduction range were significantly higher than those with <1 log reduction of WT1 expression level at the end of induction chemotherapy (p<0.05). WT1 expression levels tended to rise 2-3 months prior to bone marrow relapse. CONCLUSIONS: WT1 expression level is closely correlated prognosis in children with AML.

Here, we show that the small molecular compound YTX causes a slight but significant reduction of the ability of mast cells to degranulate. Strikingly, further examination revealed that YTX had a marked and selective cytotoxicity for the RBL-2H3 mast cell line inducing apoptosis, while primary bone marrow derived mast cells were highly resistant. In addition, YTX exhibited strong cytotoxicity against the human B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cell line MEC1 and the murine melanoma cell line B16F10. To analyse the potential role of YTX as an anti-cancer drug in vivo we used the well-established B16F10 melanoma preclinical mouse model. Our results demonstrate that a few local application of YTX around established tumours dramatically diminished tumour growth in the absence of any significant toxicity as determined by the absence of weight loss and haematological alterations.

Its annual incidence has increased over the last decades, especially among Latinos. Although most children diagnosed with leukemia are now cured, many suffer long-term complications, and primary prevention efforts are urgently needed. The early onset of leukemia-usually before 5 years of age-and the presence at birth of ""pre-leukemic"" genetic signatures indicate that pre- and postnatal events are critical to the development of the disease. In contrast to most pediatric cancers, there is a growing body of literature-in the United States and internationally-that has implicated several environmental, infectious, and dietary risk factors in the etiology of childhood leukemia, mainly for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common subtype. For example, exposures to pesticides, tobacco smoke, solvents, and traffic emissions have consistently demonstrated positive associations with the risk of developing childhood leukemia. In contrast, intake of vitamins and folate supplementation during the preconception period or pregnancy, breastfeeding, and exposure to routine childhood infections have been shown to reduce the risk of childhood leukemia. Some children may be especially vulnerable to these risk factors, as demonstrated by a disproportionate burden of childhood leukemia in the Latino population of California. The evidence supporting the associations between childhood leukemia and its risk factors-including pooled analyses from around the world and systematic reviews-is strong; however, the dissemination of this knowledge to clinicians has been limited. To protect children's health, it is prudent to initiate programs designed to alter exposure to well-established leukemia risk factors rather than to suspend judgment until no uncertainty remains. Primary prevention programs for childhood leukemia would also result in the significant co-benefits of reductions in other adverse health outcomes that are common in children, such as detriments to neurocognitive development.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-six patients suffering from Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or acute leukemia and receiving anthracyclines were prospectively included. They underwent complete echocardiography on four separate occasions: baseline (V1); after reaching a cumulative dose of 150mg/m(2) (V2); end of treatment (V3); one year follow-up (V4). Six patients developed cardiotoxicity defined by a decrease in LVEF by more than 10 percentage points to a value of at least less than 53% at V4. Both GLS measured at V1 and at V2 were significantly lower in the cardiotoxicity group compared with the control group (P=0.042 and P=0.01, respectively). Compared to GLS at V1, GLS obtained at V2 provided implemental predictive information and appeared to be the strongest predictor of cardiotoxicity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.823). At a threshold of -17.45% for GLS measured at V2, the sensitivity and specificity of detecting cardiotoxicity were 67% (95%CI: [33-100%]) and 97% (95%CI: [94-100%]) respectively. CONCLUSION: GLS>-17.45%, obtained after 150mg/m(2) of anthracycline therapy, is a significant predictor of future anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. This study should encourage physicians to perform echocardiography earlier during treatment with anthracyclines.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

MATERIALS & METHODS: This study analyzed the clinical implications of p16 deletion in adult ALL and investigated the efficacy of allo-HSCT in patients with p16 deletion. RESULTS: Deletion of p16 was identified in 38.4% of the adult ALL patients, and the prevalences of hemizygous deletion, homozygous deletion and mixed hemi/homozygous of p16 were 22.1, 11.6 and 5.5%, respectively. The prevalence of p16 deletion was 39.7% in B-lineage ALL and 33.3% in T-lineage ALL. Deletion of p16 was significantly associated with higher white blood cell count (p = 0.032) and lower platelets (p = 0.023) but was not related to age, sex, percentage of bone marrow blasts, hepatosplenomegaly, CNS leukemia rate, first complete remission and relapse rate (p > 0.05). Deletion of p16 was significantly correlated with poor outcome in terms of event-free survival (EFS; p = 0.028) and overall survival (OS; p = 0.033). Twenty-two of the 33 patients with p16 deletion received allo-HSCT treatment. Patients with p16 deletion after allo-HSCT experienced higher EFS and OS than those without (52.9 vs 0%, p < 0.001; 46.8 vs 29.1%, p = 0.01, respectively). Multivariate analysis found CNS leukemia and poor response to induction chemotherapy to be the risk factors for EFS and OS, whereas no deletions of p16 and allo-HSCT were favorable factors.

Areas covered: Risk factors include younger age, myelomonocytic or monocytic/monoblastic morphology, microgranular variant of acute promyelocitic leukemia and T-cell ALL, and some cytogenetic abnormalities. Poor prognosis due to high early death rate secondary to leukostasis. The mechanisms at the origin of leukostasis are still poorly understood. The management of acute hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis involves supportive measures and reducing the number of circulating leukemic blast cells, with careful monitoring of fluid balance, control of uric acid production and control of urine pH to prevent tumour lysis syndrome. Expert commentary: Several studies have been performed to ameliorate the outcome of this setting of patients. The high number of leukocytes may cause 3 main complications: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), and leukostasis. Although hyperleukocytosis and tumour lysis syndrome are still a challenge for clinicians, a better prognosis for these conditions is emerging in the last years.",,"['Giammarco, Sabrina', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'Piccirillo, Nicola', 'Di Giovanni, Alessia', 'Metafuni, Elisabetta', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Sica, Simona', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Giammarco S', 'Chiusolo P', 'Piccirillo N', 'Di Giovanni A', 'Metafuni E', 'Laurenti L', 'Sica S', 'Pagano L']","[""a Department of Hematology , Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore , Rome , Italy."", ""a Department of Hematology , Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore , Rome , Italy."", ""a Department of Hematology , Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore , Rome , Italy."", ""a Department of Hematology , Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore , Rome , Italy."", ""a Department of Hematology , Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore , Rome , Italy."", ""a Department of Hematology , Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore , Rome , Italy."", ""a Department of Hematology , Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore , Rome , Italy."", ""a Department of Hematology , Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore , Rome , Italy.""]",,20161226,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hyperleucocytosis', '*disseminated intravascular coagulation', '*leukapheresis', '*leukostasis', '*tumor lysis syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this regard, different targeted immunotherapeutic approaches are available, ranging from naked monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to conjugated and multifunctional mAbs (i.e., BiTEs and DARTs). Recently, researchers have focused their attention on novel techniques of genetic manipulation specifically to redirect cytotoxic T cells endowed with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) toward selected tumor associated antigens. So far, CAR T cells targeting the CD19 antigen expressed by B-cell origin hematological cancers have gained impressive clinical results, leading to the possibility of translating the CAR platform to treat other hematological malignancies such as AML. However, one of the main concerns in the field of AML CAR immunotherapy is the identification of an ideal target cell surface antigen, being highly expressed on tumor cells but minimally present on healthy tissues, together with the design of an anti-AML CAR appropriately balancing efficacy and safety profiles.

These side effects were ameliorated by coadministration of a low dose of the naturally occurring glucocorticoid hormone cortisol. This paradoxical finding was predicted by the idea that the synthetic glucocorticoid targets the glucocorticoid receptor, causing suppression of cortisol secretion and, thus, depletion of the brain mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) of its endogenous ligand.

PROCEDURE: Between July 2008 and December 2014, all children (1.0-17.9 years) in the Nordic countries diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated according to the Nordic Organization for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL 2008 protocol, including administration of six to eight high-dose (5 g/m(2) /24 hr) Mtx (HDMtx) courses. The protocol includes recommendations for CPDG2 administration in cases of DME (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01305655). RESULTS: Forty-seven of the 1,286 children (3.6%) received CPDG2 during 50 HDMtx courses at a median dose of 50 IU/kg. In 49% of the cases, CPDG2 was used during the first HDMtx course. Within a median of 6 hr from CPDG2 administration, the Mtx concentration decreased by 75% when measured with immune-based methods, and by 100% when measured with high-performance liquid chromatography. The median time from the start of Mtx infusion to plasma levels </= 0.2 muM was 228 hr (range: 48-438). The maximum increase in plasma creatinine was 375% (range: 100-1,310). Creatinine peaked after a median of 48 hr (range: 36-86). Mtx elimination time was shorter in patients with body surface area < 1 m(2) (median 198.5 vs. 257 hr; P = 0.004) and was inversely correlated to the maximum creatinine increase (209 vs. 258 hr; P = 0.034). All patients normalized their renal function as measured with s-creatinine. CONCLUSIONS: CPDG2 administration is highly effective as rescue in case of delayed Mtx clearance. Subsequent HDMtx courses could be administered without events in most of the patients.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Svahn, Thommy', 'Mellgren, Karin', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Asberg, Ann', 'Kanerva, Jukka', 'Jonsson, Olafur', 'Vaitkeviciene, Goda', 'Stamm Mikkelssen, Torben', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Heldrup, Jesper']","['Svahn T', 'Mellgren K', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Asberg A', 'Kanerva J', 'Jonsson O', 'Vaitkeviciene G', 'Stamm Mikkelssen T', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Heldrup J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Pediatric Department, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.', ""Children's Hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."", ""Children's Hospital, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."", ""Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos and Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",,20161214,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'children', 'delayed methotrexate elimination', 'glucarpidase']",,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01305655'],,,,,,,,,,,,

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: AML patients were identified in MarketScan claims databases between 1 January 2009 and 31 January 2015. Patients had a minimum of two AML diagnosis codes, hospitalization within 14 days after initial diagnosis, and >/=6 months of enrollment before initial diagnosis. Patients were monitored from first-line induction to a record of remission. A subset had a record of a second treatment period, defined as time from relapse to remission. Patient demographics, AML risk factors, and comorbidities were recorded. Descriptive analysis of utilization and expenditures (in 2014 $US) were reported for each cohort. RESULTS: The inclusion criteria were met in 1597 patients (mean age, 58.4 years; 51.0% male). Ninety percent of patients had >/=1 risk factor for AML. Mean (SD) healthcare expenditures for patients from first-line induction to remission (n = 681) were $208,857 ($152,090). Of the 157 who had a record of relapse, 70 had a record of a second remission. Expenditures for these patients (n = 70) from relapse to remission were $142,569 ($208,307); 60% were admitted to a hospital for a mean of 18.5 hospital days, and 20% had >/=1 emergency room visit. CONCLUSIONS: Although this claims-based analysis is limited by a lack of generalizability to noninsured populations and potential underreporting of certain events and diagnoses, we found that treating AML patients poses a significant healthcare burden, during both first-line induction and relapse. With people living longer, the number of cases of AML is expected to increase in the future.",,"['Irish, William', 'Ryan, Michael', 'Gache, Larry', 'Gunnarsson, Candace', 'Bell, Timothy', 'Shapiro, Mark']","['Irish W', 'Ryan M', 'Gache L', 'Gunnarsson C', 'Bell T', 'Shapiro M']","['a CTI Clinical Trial and Consulting Services Inc. , Cincinnati , OH , USA.', 'a CTI Clinical Trial and Consulting Services Inc. , Cincinnati , OH , USA.', 'a CTI Clinical Trial and Consulting Services Inc. , Cincinnati , OH , USA.', 'a CTI Clinical Trial and Consulting Services Inc. , Cincinnati , OH , USA.', 'b Pfizer Inc , New York , NY , USA.', 'b Pfizer Inc , New York , NY , USA.']",,20161214,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Expenditures', '*Induction', '*Relapse', '*Remission', '*Utilization']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier, it was used only as a cell surface marker to identify and differentiate between haematological malignancies. Later, reported to be present in various malignancies, it is thought to play significant role in cancer development and progression. Regulated expression of CD10 is necessary for angiogenesis and so forth. However its expression level is found to be deregulated in different cancers.

The small molecule inhibitor imatinib mesylate was initially developed to target the ABL1 kinase, which is constitutively activated through chromosomal translocation in BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Because of cross-reactivity of imatinib against the KIT kinase, the drug is also successfully used for the treatment of GIST. Although inhibition of KIT clearly has a major role in the therapeutic response of GIST to imatinib, the contribution of concomitant inhibition of ABL in this context has never been explored. We show here that ABL1 is expressed in the majority of GISTs, including human GIST cell lines. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown, we demonstrate that depletion of KIT in conjunction with ABL1 - hence mimicking imatinib treatment - leads to reduced apoptosis induction and attenuated inhibition of cellular proliferation when compared to depletion of KIT alone. These results are explained by an increased activity of the AKT survival kinase, which is mediated by the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2, likely through direct phosphorylation. Our results highlight that distinct inhibitory properties of targeted agents can impede antitumor effects and hence provide insights for rational drug development. Novel KIT-targeted agents to treat GIST should therefore comprise an increased specificity for KIT while at the same time displaying a reduced ability to inhibit ABL1.",,"['Rausch, Jessica L', 'Boichuk, Sergei', 'Ali, Areej A', 'Patil, Sneha S', 'Liu, Lijun', 'Lee, Donna M', 'Brown, Matthew F', 'Makielski, Kathleen R', 'Liu, Ying', 'Taguchi, Takahiro', 'Kuan, Shih-Fan', 'Duensing, Anette']","['Rausch JL', 'Boichuk S', 'Ali AA', 'Patil SS', 'Liu L', 'Lee DM', 'Brown MF', 'Makielski KR', 'Liu Y', 'Taguchi T', 'Kuan SF', 'Duensing A']","['Cancer Therapeutics Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Current address: Department of Pathology, Kazan State Medical University, Kazan, Russia.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kochi Medical School, Nankoku Kochi, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['P30 CA047904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC5354847,['NOTNLM'],"['ABL1', 'KIT', 'gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)', 'imatinib mesylate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is especially true in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which exhibits striking heterogeneity in molecular segmentation. When calibrated to cell-specific data, executable network models can reveal subtle differences in signaling that help explain differences in drug response. Furthermore, they can suggest drug combinations to increase efficacy and combat acquired resistance. Here, we experimentally tested dynamic proteomic changes and phenotypic responses in diverse AML cell lines treated with pan-PIM kinase inhibitor and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor as single agents and in combination. We constructed cell-specific executable models of the signaling axis, connecting genetic aberrations in FLT3, tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) to cell proliferation and apoptosis via the PIM and PI3K kinases. The models capture key differences in signaling that later enabled them to accurately predict the unique proteomic changes and phenotypic responses of each cell line. Furthermore, using cell-specific models, we tailored combination therapies to individual cell lines and successfully validated their efficacy experimentally. Specifically, we showed that cells mildly responsive to PIM inhibition exhibited increased sensitivity in combination with PIK3CA inhibition. We also used the model to infer the origin of PIM resistance engineered through prolonged drug treatment of MOLM16 cell lines and successfully validated experimentally our prediction that this resistance can be overcome with AKT1/2 inhibition.

We compared cancer survival among First Nations to that among non-Aboriginal adults in Canada in the first national study of its kind to date. METHODS: A population-based cohort of approximately 2 million respondents to the 1991 Canadian Long Form Census was followed for cancer diagnoses and deaths using probabilistic linkage to cancer and death registries until 2009. Excess mortality rate ratios (EMRR) and 5-year age-standardized relative survival rates were calculated for 15 cancers using age, sex, ethnicity, and calendar-time-specific life tables derived from the cohort at large. RESULTS: First Nations diagnosed with cancers of the colon and rectum, lung and bronchus, breast, prostate, oral cavity and pharynx, cervix, ovary, or with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia all had significantly poorer 5-year survival than their non-Aboriginal peers. For colorectal cancer, a significant disparity was only present between 2001 and 2009 (EMRR: 1.52; 95% CI, 1.28-1.80). For prostate cancer, a significant disparity was only present between 1992 and 2000 (EMRR: 2.76; 95% CI, 1.81-4.21). Adjusting for income and rurality had little impact on the EMRRs. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with non-Aboriginals, First Nations people had poorer survival for 14 of 15 of the most common cancers, and disparities could not be explained by income and rurality. IMPACT: The results of this study can serve as a benchmark for monitoring progress toward narrowing the gap in survival. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(1); 145-51.

LINE-1 (or L1) is an autonomous non-LTR retrotransposon in the human genome, comprising 17% of its genomic mass and containing an average of 80-100 active L1s per average genome that provide a source of inter-individual variation. New LINE-1 insertions are thought to accumulate mostly during human embryogenesis. Surprisingly, the activity of L1s can further impact the somatic human brain genome. However, it is currently unknown whether L1 can retrotranspose in other somatic healthy tissues or if L1 mobilization is restricted to neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) in the human brain. Here, we took advantage of an engineered L1 retrotransposition assay to analyze L1 mobilization rates in human mesenchymal (MSCs) and hematopoietic (HSCs) somatic stem cells. Notably, we have observed that L1 expression and engineered retrotransposition is much lower in both MSCs and HSCs when compared to NPCs.

He was recently investigated for macrocytic anaemia in the outpatient haematology clinic. Examination of the perineum revealed grade 1 internal haemorrhoids with no signs of bleeding.Initial laboratory tests revealed macrocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 10.5 g/dL, normal 12.9-17.0 g/dL; mean corpuscular haemoglobin 95.3 fL, normal 80.0-95.0 fL). Peripheral blood film showing blasts, dysplastic neutrophils, nucleated red blood cells and hypogranular platelets.The patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy and rubber band ligation of the internal haemorrhoids after persistent fresh per-rectal bleeding. The bleeding persisted with the development of hypotension and a significant drop of haemoglobin to 4.8 g/dL requiring blood transfusions and intensive care monitoring. Repeated endoscopy, including intubation of the terminal ileum, revealed uncomplicated right-sided diverticulosis. CT mesenteric angiography performed during an episode of significant bleeding revealed extravasation of contrast in the ileum, but mesenteric angiography was unsuccessful, possibly due to a temporary cessation of bleeding. Bleeding subsequently recurred and in light of the persistent bleeding with no clear source and with a total of 12 units of packed cell transfused, exploratory laparotomy, on-table enteroscopy (figure 1) with small bowel resection was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen was performed (figures 2-4).gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F1F1GUTJNL2016313252F1Figure 1Multiple ileal lesions with stigmata of recent bleed.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F2F2GUTJNL2016313252F2Figure 2Area of ulceration associated with atypical mononuclear infiltrate.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F3F3GUTJNL2016313252F3Figure 3Atypical mononuclear infiltrate composed of cells with enlarged, irregular nuclei containing variably prominent nucleoli.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F4F4GUTJNL2016313252F4Figure 4Atypical cells displayed cytoplasmic expression of myeloperoxidase.

Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma arising from the ovary is extremely rare and to our knowledge, only 5 cases have been reported in the literature. CASE: A 15-year-old girl presented with bilateral ovarian masses, which, on biopsy proved to be precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. She was treated with a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 90 protocol and she is alive in complete remission for more than 10 years. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: NHL of the ovary should also be considered as a differential diagnosis in adolescent and young adults with ovarian masses. Attempt to make a preoperative diagnosis is crucial because ovarian NHL responds well to chemotherapy and has a good prognosis.","['Copyright (c) 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent', 'Gynecology.

However, it remains unknown that which mechanism is actually responsible for the therapeutic effects against these blood malignancies. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to explore the actual mechanism that ATO exerts its effects in K562 cells and their initiating cells (K562s). MATERIALS AND METHODS: K562s cells were separated and enriched for CD34+/CD38- cells using magnetic microbeads. Cell proliferation was determined by incorporation of BrdU. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin-V binding and PI uptake. Autophagy was estimated by acridine orange and immunofluorescence staining of LC3-B and p62. MC colonic formation was used to examine cell self-renew. ROS generation inside living cells was measured by DCFH-DA. Cell differentiation was assessed by the benzidine staining. The SA-beta-gal assay was used to detect cell senescence. Protein expression was examined by western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: K562s cells were stronger in self-renew and resistance to ATO cytotoxicity and starvation-induced apoptosis than K562 cells. Unexpectedly, we found that ATO at a dose of 0.5muM which had no effect on cell proliferation resulted in maximum suppression on self-renew in both cells and maximum starvation-induced apoptosis in K562s cells but minimum starvation-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. Next, we found that ATO no more than 0.5muM selectively induced K562s cell differentiation indicated by benzidine staining, gamma-globin and CD235a expression. More importantly, we found that ATO no more than 0.5muM led to opposite efficacy in autophagy between K562 and K562s cells, and the opposite autophagy could induced late-phase senescence in both cells. Finally, we used the optimal dose of ATO to eradicate leukemia cells and obtained a satisfied therapeutic outcomes in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the used dose of ATO may determine the fate of cell differentiation senescence or malignant transformation, and the optimal dose of ATO induced opposite efficacy in autophagy between K562 cells and their initiating cells and ultimately leads both cells to late-phase senescence.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We aimed to assess activity and toxicity of fractionated radioimmunotherapy using anti-CD22 (90)Y-epratuzumab tetraxetan as consolidation after front-line induction chemoimmunotherapy in untreated elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. METHODS: We did a prospective, single-group, phase 2 trial at 28 hospitals in France, with patients recruited from 17 hospitals. Eligible patients were aged 60-80 years with bulky stage 2-3 or stage 3-4 CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, previously untreated, and not eligible for transplantation. Patients received six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab [375 mg/m(2)], cyclophosphamide [750 mg/m(2)], doxorubicin [50 mg/m(2)], and vincristine [1.4 mg/m(2), up to 2 mg] all on day 1, and prednisone [40 mg/m(2)] daily for 5 days), administered every 14 days. 6-8 weeks after R-CHOP, responders received two doses of 15 mCi/m(2) (555 MBq/m(2)) (90)Y-epratuzumab tetraxetan administered 1 week apart. The primary endpoint was 2 year event-free survival in all registered eligible patients who received at least 1 day of study treatment; the safety analysis was done in the same population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00906841. FINDINGS: Between Oct 22, 2008, and Dec 16, 2010, we recruited 75 patients, of whom four (5%) were excluded after central pathology review; hence, 71 (95%) patients were included in the analysis. All patients started induction treatment; 57 (80%) received radioimmunotherapy. With a median follow-up of 37 months (IQR 30-44), the estimated 2 year event-free survival was 75% (95% CI 63-84). Radioimmunotherapy toxicity consisted of grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia in 48 (84%) of 57 patients and neutropenia in 45 (79%) of 57 patients. One patient developed myelodysplastic syndrome 28 months after receiving radioimmunotherapy and one patient developed acute myeloid leukaemia 5 months after receiving radioimmunotherapy. INTERPRETATION: Fractionated radioimmunotherapy with (90)Y-epratuzumab tetraxetan might be appropriate for response consolidation after induction chemotherapy in older patients with advanced diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but further comparative studies are needed.

Gubner and colleagues in 1953 used several log-order lower doses of MTX that mimicked the anti-inflammatory properties of cortisone. They used it successfully in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Their work was however overlooked because the Nobel Prize winning drug cortisone held sway in those days. With increasing awareness of the adverse effects of cortisone, interest was rekindled in discovering 'steroid-sparing' drugs. Hoffmeister and Willkens used low-dose MTX (LD-MTX) in treating RA patients in 1960s with impressive results. Pivotal trials in 1984-5 established the efficacy and safety of LD-MTX in treating RA that gained FDA approval in 1988. LD-MTX at doses <25-30 mg weekly as mini-pulses, is presently the standard-of-care for the treatment of RA. Its toxicities and adverse effects are rarely if ever life-threatening. This is in contrast to the high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) for treating malignancies at doses that are several log-orders higher and usually cause serious toxicities. While LD-MTX acts mainly as an anti-inflammatory drug by increasing tissue adenosine levels besides other mechanisms, HD-MTX has anti-proliferative cytotoxic action with different toxicity profile and adverse effects. In practical terms LD-MTX and HD-MTX are 2 different therapeutic agents. However, in developing countries like India the stigma attached to MTX as a cytotoxic 'cancer drug' still persists and most non-rheumatologists fear its use in RA. This review aims to allay such anxiety attached to LD-MTX so that they start using it in appropriate doses for treating RA.",,"['Malaviya, Anand N']",['Malaviya AN'],"['Flat 2015, Sector B-2, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi - 110070, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed trends in hospitalization rates and characteristics of pediatric oncology and non-oncology patients hospitalized with varicella during the first 7 years after introduction of routine varicella vaccination. Our data included children <17 years of age with an International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) main or secondary discharge diagnosis of varicella identified by annual database queries in 22-29 pediatric hospitals in Bavaria (Germany) in 2005-2011. Of a total of 1,245 varicella-associated hospitalizations, 42 children (median age 4 years, interquartile range 3-5) had an underlying malignancy (67% with acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Overall, additional diagnoses potentially associated with varicella were reported less often in oncology than in non-oncology varicella patients (62% vs. 77%, p = 0.041), suggesting earlier hospitalization of high-risk patients. Acute hematological diagnoses (29% vs. 3%, p < 0.001) and coinfections (invasive 12% vs. 2%, p = 0.001; noninvasive 19% vs. 8%, p = 0.019) were more frequent, whereas neurological (5% vs. 19%, p = 0.023) and upper respiratory tract diagnoses (2% vs. 16%, p = 0.014) were less frequent in oncology compared to non-oncology varicella patients. Oncology varicella patients showed a longer hospital stay (median 5 vs. 3 days, p < 0.001). Hospitalization rates in non-oncology varicella patients declined constantly since 2006, from 114.8 (2006) to 30.5 (2011) per 1,000 pediatric beds. The rates of varicella-associated hospitalizations in oncology patients indicated an overall decreasing trend (3.8, 1.9, 4.6, 3.5, 0.4, 2.1 and 0.6 cases per 1,000 pediatric beds in 2005-2011).

Epub 2016 Dec 14.,10.1080/10245332.2016.1265780 [doi],"OBJECTIVES: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a clonal disease that accounts for 20% of acute leukemias in adults. A high percentage of adult patients (ranging from 70 to 80%) reach complete remission; however, the 5-year survival rate is only 20-40%. One of the main obstacles to treatment success is the drug resistance of leukemic cells. Therefore, our research group analyzed the ABCB1 and ABCG2 gene expression levels in 61 patients diagnosed with ALL and assessed whether the levels affected the clinical parameters and 40-month survival rate. METHODS: The ABCB1 and ABCG2 gene expression levels were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction in 61 patients diagnosed with ALL and 99 healthy donors as controls. The association between ABCB1 and ABCG2 gene expression levels and clinical variables was determined using the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. Overall survival (OS) was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The results showed high ABCB1 and ABCG2 gene levels, which were 4.5 and 2.3 times the levels of healthy donors, respectively. A total of 52% of the study patients expressed high ABCB1 levels and were significantly associated with the high-risk patient group and a decreased 40-month survival rate of 78%. Only 49% of the patients expressed high ABCG2 gene levels. No association was found between the clinical parameters and the ABCG2 gene expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of ABCB1 gene expression levels could be important for the diagnosis and monitoring of ALL patients.",,"['Olarte Carrillo, I', 'Ramos Penafiel, C', 'Miranda Peralta, E', 'Rozen Fuller, E', 'Kassack Ipina, J J', 'Centeno Cruz, F', 'Garrido Guerrero, E', 'Collazo Jaloma, J', 'Nacho Vargas, K', 'Martinez Tovar, A']","['Olarte Carrillo I', 'Ramos Penafiel C', 'Miranda Peralta E', 'Rozen Fuller E', 'Kassack Ipina JJ', 'Centeno Cruz F', 'Garrido Guerrero E', 'Collazo Jaloma J', 'Nacho Vargas K', 'Martinez Tovar A']","['a Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular , Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico, ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"" , Ciudad de Mexico , Mexico.', 'b Servicio de Hematologia.

Since complete remission is rare for these diseases, initially an induction therapy is given for patient's remission. Further treatment, which is often an expensive maintenance therapy, is administered only for the patients with remission. If the maintenance therapy is so expensive that the cost of the trial inflates, only a simple random sample of patients will be treated with the expensive maintenance due to budget constraint. In this article, we have implemented a design using ranked sets instead of simple randomization in the second stage and obtained an unbiased estimator of the overall survival distribution for a particular treatment combination.

Its T minor allele is associated with higher STAT4 mRNA and protein expression, indicating a stronger skewed immune response than the norm. Although widely studied in autoimmune disease patients and the general population, its effect on immunocompromised subjects is still unknown. Especially in situations, i.e. post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (post-HSCT), where control of the immune response is crucial. Hence, this study investigates if the presence of the T minor allele in donors would affect immunological response and clinical outcomes post-HSCT. Samples from 161 pediatric patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT for acute leukemia and showed complete chimerism by donor cells were obtained. Six clinical outcomes were investigated; hepatic veno-occlusive disease, acute graft-vs-host disease, chronic graft-vs-host disease, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, relapse and overall survival. The TT genotype was found to be significant in the occurrence of CMV infection (P=0.049), showing higher incidence of CMV infection compared to the others. Multivariate analysis confirmed that association of the TT genotype is independent from other variables in CMV infection occurrence (P=0.010). This is the first study on STAT4 polymorphism rs7574865 in allogeneic HSCT as well as immunocompromised patients. As the TT genotype is associated with autoimmune diseases, our results seem at a paradox with current evidence hinting at a different role of STAT4 in normal circumstances versus immunocompromised patients. Further investigation is needed to elicit the reason behind this and discover novel applications for better post-transplant outcomes.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, both computer simulations and cell experiments in vitro were performed to evaluate these two methods. Simulations were done with different cell diameters (5, 10, 20mum), a broad range of kin values (0.02-30s(-1)) and different SNR's, and simulated kin's were directly compared with the ground truth values. Human leukemia K562 cells were cultured and treated with saponin to selectively change cell transmembrane permeability. The agreement between measured kin's of both methods was also evaluated. The results suggest that, without noise, the CG method provides reasonably accurate estimation of kin especially when it is smaller than 10s(-1), which is in the typical physiological range of many biological tissues. However, although the FEXI method overestimates kin even with corrections for the effects of extracellular water fraction, it provides reasonable estimates with practical SNR's and more importantly, the fitted apparent exchange rate AXR showed approximately linear dependence on the ground truth kin. In conclusion, either CG or FEXI method provides a sensitive means to characterize the variations in transcytolemmal water exchange rate constant kin, although the accuracy and specificity is usually compromised. The non-imaging CG method provides more accurate estimation of kin, but limited to large volume-of-interest. Although the accuracy of FEXI is compromised with extracellular volume fraction, it is capable of spatially mapping kin in practice.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

FIP1L1-PDGFRA is a leukemogenic fusion kinase that causes chronic eosinophilic leukemia. As a constitutively active kinase, FIP1L1-PDGFRA stimulates downstream signaling molecules, leading to cellular proliferation and the generation of an anti-apoptotic state. Contribution of the N-terminal FIP1L1 portion is necessary for FIP1L1-PDGFRA to exert its full transforming activity, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully characterized. We identified PIAS1 as a FIP1L1-PDGFRA association molecule by yeast two-hybrid screening. Our analyses indicate that the FIP1L1 portion of FIP1L1-PDGFRA is required for efficient association with PIAS1. As a consequence of the association, FIP1L1-PDGFRA phosphorylates PIAS1. Moreover, the kinase activity of FIP1L1-PDGFRA stabilizes PIAS1. Therefore, PIAS1 is one of the downstream targets of FIP1L1-PDGFRA. Moreover, we found that PIAS1, as a SUMO E3 ligase, sumoylates and stabilizes FIP1L1-PDGFRA. In addition, suppression of PIAS1 activity by a knockdown experiment resulted in destabilization of FIP1L1-PDGFRA. Therefore, FIP1L1-PDGFRA and PIAS1 form a positive cross-talk through their enzymatic activities. Suppression of sumoylation by ginkgolic acid, a small molecule compound inhibiting a SUMO E1-activating enzyme, also destabilizes FIP1L1-PDGFRA, and while the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib suppresses FIP1L1-PDGFRA-dependent cell growth, ginkgolic acid or siRNA of PIAS1 has a synergistic effect with imatinib. In conclusion, our results suggest that sumoylation by PIAS1 is a potential target in the treatment of FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive chronic eosinophilic leukemia.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Yet studies of CLL in Asian countries using Next generation sequencing have not been reported. We aimed to characterize the genomic profiles of Korean CLL and to find out ethnic differences in somatic mutations with prognostic implications. We performed targeted sequencing for 87 gene panel using next-generation sequencing along with G-banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for chromosome 12, 13q14.3 deletion, 17p13 deletion, and 11q22 deletion. Overall, 36 out of 48 patients (75%) harbored at least one mutation and mean number of mutation per patient was 1.6 (range 0-6). Aberrant karyotypes were observed in 30.4% by G-banding and 66.7% by FISH. Most recurrent mutation (>10% frequency) was ATM (20.8%) followed by TP53 (14.6%), SF3B1 (10.4%), KLHL6 (8.3%), and BCOR (6.25%). Mutations of MYD88 was associated with moderate adverse prognosis by multiple comparisons (P = 0.055). Mutation frequencies of MYD88, SAMHD1, EGR2, DDX3X, ZMYM3, and MED12 showed similar incidence with Caucasians, while mutation frequencies of ATM, TP53, KLHL6, BCOR and CDKN2A tend to be higher in Koreans than in Caucasians. Especially, ATM mutation showed 1.5 fold higher incidence than Caucasians, while mutation frequencies of SF3B1, NOTCH1, CHD2 and POT1 tend to be lower in Koreans than in Caucasians. However, mutation frequencies between Caucasians and Koreans were not significantly different statistically, probably due to low number of patients. Collectively, mutational profile and adverse prognostic genes in Korean CLL were different from those of Caucasians, suggesting an ethnic difference, while profile of cytogenetic aberrations was similar to those of Caucasians.",,"['Kim, Jung-Ah', 'Hwang, Byungjin', 'Park, Si Nae', 'Huh, Sunghoon', 'Im, Kyongok', 'Choi, Sungbin', 'Chung, Hye Yoon', 'Huh, JooRyung', 'Seo, Eul-Ju', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Bang, Duhee', 'Lee, Dong Soon']","['Kim JA', 'Hwang B', 'Park SN', 'Huh S', 'Im K', 'Choi S', 'Chung HY', 'Huh J', 'Seo EJ', 'Lee JH', 'Bang D', 'Lee DS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Bachelor of Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",,20161213,,PMC5154520,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6934-1987'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We enrolled 84 adult patients with AML or MDS in a single-institution trial of decitabine to identify somatic mutations and their relationships to clinical responses. Decitabine was administered at a dose of 20 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for 10 consecutive days in monthly cycles. We performed enhanced exome or gene-panel sequencing in 67 of these patients and serial sequencing at multiple time points to evaluate patterns of mutation clearance in 54 patients. An extension cohort included 32 additional patients who received decitabine in different protocols. RESULTS: Of the 116 patients, 53 (46%) had bone marrow blast clearance (<5% blasts). Response rates were higher among patients with an unfavorable-risk cytogenetic profile than among patients with an intermediate-risk or favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (29 of 43 patients [67%] vs. 24 of 71 patients [34%], P<0.001) and among patients with TP53 mutations than among patients with wild-type TP53 (21 of 21 [100%] vs. 32 of 78 [41%], P<0.001). Previous studies have consistently shown that patients with an unfavorable-risk cytogenetic profile and TP53 mutations who receive conventional chemotherapy have poor outcomes. However, in this study of 10-day courses of decitabine, neither of these risk factors was associated with a lower rate of overall survival than the rate of survival among study patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetic profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AML and MDS who had cytogenetic abnormalities associated with unfavorable risk, TP53 mutations, or both had favorable clinical responses and robust (but incomplete) mutation clearance after receiving serial 10-day courses of decitabine. Although these responses were not durable, they resulted in rates of overall survival that were similar to those among patients with AML who had an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile and who also received serial 10-day courses of decitabine.

Although this difference is often attributed to a stronger immune response in women, we show that differences in the transmission routes that the sexes provide can result in evolution favouring pathogens with sex-specific virulence. Because women can transmit pathogens during pregnancy, birth or breast-feeding, pathogens adapt, evolving lower virulence in women. This can resolve the long-standing puzzle on progression from Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) infection to lethal Adult T-cell Leukaemia (ATL); a progression that is more likely in Japanese men than women, while it is equally likely in Caribbean women and men. We argue that breastfeeding, being more prolonged in Japan than in the Caribbean, may have driven the difference in virulence between the two populations.

Recently, the application of drug-coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to increase water solubility of the drug and to enhance its chemotherapeutic efficiency has attracted much attention. Drugs coated with MNPs are becoming a promising way for better leukemia treatment. This study aimed to assess the possible molecular mechanisms of wogonin-coated MNP-Fe3O4 (Wog-MNPs-Fe3O4) as an antileukemia agent. METHODS: After incubated for 48 h, the antiproliferative effects of MNPs, wogonin, or Wog-MNPs-Fe3O4on K562/A02 cells were determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. The apoptotic rates of K562/A02 cells treated with either wogonin or Wog-MNPs-Fe3O4were determined by flow cytometer (FCM) assay. The cell cycle arrest in K562/A02 cells was determined by FCM assay. The elementary molecular mechanisms of these phenomena were explored by Western blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: With cell viabilities ranging from 98.76% to 101.43%, MNP-Fe3O4was nontoxic to the cell line. Meanwhile, the wogonin and Wog-MNPs-Fe3O4had little effects on normal human embryonic lung fibroblast cells. The cell viabilities of the Wog-MNPs-Fe3O4group (28.64-68.36%) were significantly lower than those of the wogonin group (35.53-97.28%) in a dose-dependent manner in 48 h (P < 0.001). The apoptotic rate of K562/A02 cells was significantly improved in 50 mumol/L Wog-MNPs-Fe3O4group (34.28%) compared with that in 50 mumol/L wogonin group (23.46%; P< 0.001). Compared with those of the 25 and 50 mumol/L wogonin groups, the ratios of G0/G1-phase K562/A02 cells were significantly higher in the 25 and 50 mumol/L Wog-MNPs-Fe3O4groups (all P< 0.001). The mRNA and protein expression levels of the p21 and p27 in the K562/A02 cells were also significantly higher in the Wog-MNPs-Fe3O4group compared with those of the wogonin group (all P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that MNPs were the effective drug delivery vehicles to deliver wogonin to the leukemia cells. Through increasing cells arrested at G0/G1-phase and inducing apoptosis of K562/A02 cells, MNPs could enhance the therapeutic effects of wogonin on leukemia cells. These findings indicated that MNPs loaded with wogonin could provide a promising way for better leukemia treatment.",,"['Peng, Miao-Xin', 'Wang, Xiao-Yue', 'Wang, Fan', 'Wang, Lei', 'Xu, Pei-Pei', 'Chen, Bing']","['Peng MX', 'Wang XY', 'Wang F', 'Wang L', 'Xu PP', 'Chen B']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, China.', 'Department of Laboratory, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, China.']",,,,PMC5198531,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Dec 13.,10.1002/pbc.26363 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Recurrent genomic changes in B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) identified by genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis provide important prognostic information, but gene copy number analysis of its rare lymphoma counterpart, B-lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LBL), is limited by the low incidence and lack of fresh tissue for genomic testing. PROCEDURE: We used molecular inversion probe (MIP) technology to analyze and compare copy number alterations (CNAs) in archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pediatric B-LBL (n = 23) and B-ALL (n = 55). RESULTS: Similar to B-ALL, CDKN2A/B deletions were the most common alteration identified in 6/23 (26%) B-LBL cases. Eleven of 23 (48%) B-LBL patients were hyperdiploid, but none showed triple trisomies (chromosomes 4, 10, and 17) characteristic of B-ALL. IKZF1 and PAX5 deletions were observed in 13 and 17% of B-LBL, respectively, which was similar to the reported frequency in B-ALL. Immunoglobulin light chain lambda (IGL) locus deletions consistent with normal light chain rearrangement were observed in 5/23 (22%) B-LBL cases, compared with only 1% in B-ALL samples. None of the B-LBL cases showed abnormal, isolated VPREB1 deletion adjacent to IGL locus, which we identified in 25% of B-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the copy number profile of B-LBL is distinct from B-ALL, suggesting possible differences in pathogenesis between these closely related diseases.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Meyer, Julia A', 'Zhou, Delu', 'Mason, Clinton C', 'Downie, Jonathan M', 'Rodic, Vladimir', 'Abromowitch, Minnie', 'Wistinghausen, Birte', 'Termuhlen, Amanda M', 'Angiolillo, Anne L', 'Perkins, Sherrie L', 'Lones, Mark A', 'Barnette, Phillip', 'Schiffman, Joshua D', 'Miles, Rodney R']","['Meyer JA', 'Zhou D', 'Mason CC', 'Downie JM', 'Rodic V', 'Abromowitch M', 'Wistinghausen B', 'Termuhlen AM', 'Angiolillo AL', 'Perkins SL', 'Lones MA', 'Barnette P', 'Schiffman JD', 'Miles RR']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", ""Division of Oncology, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'ARUP Institute for Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'ARUP Institute for Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, Utah.']",,20161213,,,['NOTNLM'],"['genomics', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'pediatrics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is more noticeable in low- and middle-income countries. The international 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for this age group is around 80%, with pediatric-inspired protocols offering better results. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of adolescents aged 16-20 diagnosed with ALL during the period 2004-2015 treated with a high-risk pediatric protocol at an academic center from a middle-income country was performed. Five-year OS and EFS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Hazard ratios of relapse and death were estimated by the Cox regression model. RESULTS: Five-year EFS and OS for 57 adolescents were 23.3% and 48.9%, respectively. From the 41 patients who achieved complete remission, 24 (58.5%) relapsed. Bone marrow and central nervous system were the most frequent sites of relapse. Hazard ratio of treatment failure and death for patients with organomegaly at diagnosis was 2.026 and 2.970, respectively. Treatment-related toxicity developed in 31 (54.4%) patients and febrile neutropenia was the most frequent in 14 (24.6%) cases. Twelve patients (21.1%) had poor adherence to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: High relapse rate and low 5-year EFS compared with international standards, was documented. Use of intensified pediatric regimens, adherence to proven effective medications, improved supportive care, and prevention of abandonment are necessary to improve survival rates in these patients.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Jaime-Perez, Jose C', 'Jimenez-Castillo, Raul A', 'Pinzon-Uresti, Monica A', 'Cantu-Rodriguez, Olga G', 'Herrera-Garza, Jose L', 'Marfil-Rivera, Luis J', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Jimenez-Castillo RA', 'Pinzon-Uresti MA', 'Cantu-Rodriguez OG', 'Herrera-Garza JL', 'Marfil-Rivera LJ', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']","['Internal Medicine Division, Department of Hematology, ""Dr. Jose E.

Epub 2016 Dec 13.,10.1002/pbc.26393 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Bone fractures and osteonecrosis frequently complicate therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Bone toxicity has been associated with exposure to corticosteroids and methotrexate (MTX) and age greater than 10 years. We tested whether common genetic polymorphisms were associated with bone toxicity during treatment for ALL. PROCEDURE: A total of 615 of 794 children enrolled on Dana Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium protocol 05-001 (NCT00400946) met eligibility criteria for inclusion in this analysis. Nineteen candidate polymorphisms were selected a priori, targeting genes related to glucocorticoid metabolism, oxidative damage, and folate physiology. Polymorphisms were genotyped using either PCR-based allelic discrimination or PCR product length analysis. RESULTS: Twenty percent of subjects were homozygous for two 28 bp repeats (2R/2R, where 2R is two 28-nucleotide repeats within the 5' untranslated region [UTR] of the thymidylate synthase [TS] gene) within the 5' UTR of the gene for TS. This 2R/2R genotype was associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis among children younger than 10 years at diagnosis (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-5.95; P = 0.013), and with bone fracture among children >/= 10 years (multivariable HR 2.10; 95% CI 1.11-3.96; P = 0.022). No significant association was observed between TS genotype and red blood cell (RBC) folate, RBC MTX, or relapse risk. CONCLUSIONS: A common genetic variant is associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis among children younger than 10 years at diagnosis and with bone fractures among older children. These findings suggest that children and adolescents with the 2R/2R TS genotype should be closely monitored for the development of bone toxicity during therapy for ALL, and support a clinical trial testing the efficacy of protective interventions specifically in this vulnerable population.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Finkelstein, Yaron', 'Blonquist, Traci M', 'Vijayanathan, Veena', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Vrooman, Lynda M', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Cole, Peter D']","['Finkelstein Y', 'Blonquist TM', 'Vijayanathan V', 'Stevenson KE', 'Neuberg DS', 'Silverman LB', 'Vrooman LM', 'Sallan SE', 'Cole PD']","['Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.']",,20161213,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*avascular necrosis', '*fracture', '*methotrexate', '*osteonecrosis', '*therapy-related toxicity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to explore the effect of portulacerebroside A (PCA) on the adhesion, migration, and invasion in human leukemia HL60 cells and U937 cells and clarify the possible mechanisms involved, which could provide potential strategies for the treatment of AML. By methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium analysis, it was found that PCA (1-10 muM) suppressed the cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A total of 1, 2, and 5 muM of PCA dramatically inhibited the adhesion, migration, and invasion of HL60 cells and U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphorylation level of JNK and P38 protein level was measured by Western blot. After the real-time quantification polymerase chain reaction and Western blot detection of the total RNA and protein, messenger RNA, and protein expression levels of Ras homologous C (RhoC), metastasis-associated gene 1 (MTA1) and matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 (MMP-2/9) were decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. The phosphorylation level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38) was decreased dramatically in HL60 cells and U937 cells after PCA treatment. In conclusion, PCA significantly inhibits the adhesion, migration, and invasion of HL60 cells and U937 cells by suppressing the p38/JNK pathway and regulating the expressions of related genes.",,"['Ye, Qidong', 'Liao, Xuelian', 'Fu, Pan', 'Dou, Jiaying', 'Chen, Kai', 'Jiang, Hui']","['Ye Q', 'Liao X', 'Fu P', 'Dou J', 'Chen K', 'Jiang H']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",,20161111,,PMC5113926,['NOTNLM'],"['PCA', 'adhesion', 'invasion', 'leucocythemia', 'migration', 'p38/JNK', 'portulacerebroside A']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous report showed that auranofin induced apoptosis by enhancement of annexin A5 expression in PC-3 cells. To understand the role of annexin A5 in auranofin-mediated apoptosis, we performed microarray data analysis to study annexin A5-controlled gene expression in annexin A5 knockdown PC-3 cells. Of differentially expressed genes, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-2 was increased by annexin A5 siRNA confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot. Treatment with auranofin decreased PAI-2 and increased annexin A5 expression as well as promoting apoptosis. Furthermore, auranofin-induced apoptosis was recovered by annexin A5 siRNA but it was promoted by PAI-2 siRNA. Interestingly, knockdown of annexin A5 rescued PAI-2 expression suppressed by auranofin. Taken together, our study suggests that induction of annexin A5 by auranofin may enhance apoptosis through suppression of PAI-2 expression in PC-3 cells.",,"['Shin, Dong-Won', 'Kwon, Yeo-Jung', 'Ye, Dong-Jin', 'Baek, Hyoung-Seok', 'Lee, Joo-Eun', 'Chun, Young-Jin']","['Shin DW', 'Kwon YJ', 'Ye DJ', 'Baek HS', 'Lee JE', 'Chun YJ']","['College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.']",,,,PMC5340543,['NOTNLM'],"['Annexin A5', 'Apoptosis', 'Auranofin', 'Plasminogen activator inhibitor-2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the use of intensive methodological approaches to eliminate residual undifferentiated cells, the properties of these cells remain elusive. Here, we show that under a serum-free neural differentiation condition, residual undifferentiated cells markedly delay progression of their cell cycle without compromising their pluripotency. This dormant pluripotency was maintained during reculture of the cells under a serum-free condition, whereas upon serum stimulation, the cells exited the dormant state and restarted proliferation and differentiation into all three germ layers. Microarray analysis revealed a set of genes that is significantly upregulated in the dormant ESCs compared with their levels of regulation in proliferating ESCs. Among them, we identified the transcription factor Forkhead box O3 (FoxO3) to be an essential regulator of the maintenance of pluripotency in dormant ESCs. Our study demonstrates that the transition into the dormant state endows residual undifferentiated cells with FoxO3-dependent and leukemia inhibitory factor/serum-independent pluripotency.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Ikeda, Megumi', 'Toyoshima, Fumiko']","['Ikeda M', 'Toyoshima F']","['Department of Biosystems Science, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Mammalian Regulatory Network, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Biosystems Science, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Science, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan ftoyoshi@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Mammalian Regulatory Network, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",,20170215,,PMC5311243,['NOTNLM'],"['*FoxO3', '*embryonic stem cells', '*pluripotency', '*regenerative medicine', '*stem cell quiescence']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Dec 12.,10.1073/pnas.1617929114 [doi],"Oncogenic isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 and IDH2 mutations at three hotspot arginine residues cause an enzymatic gain of function that leads to the production and accumulation of the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which contributes to the development of a number of malignancies. In the hematopoietic system, mutations in IDH1 at arginine (R) 132 and in IDH2 at R140 and R172 are commonly observed in acute myeloid leukemia, and elevated 2HG is observed in cells and serum. However, in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), mutations are almost exclusively restricted to IDH2 R172, and levels of 2HG have not been comprehensively measured. In this study, we investigate the expression pattern of mutant IDH2 in the AITL tumor microenvironment and measure levels of 2HG in tissue and serum of AITL patients. We find that mutant IDH2 expression is restricted to the malignant T-cell component of AITL, and that 2HG is elevated in tumor tissue and serum of patients. We also investigate the differences between the three hotspot mutation sites in IDH1 and IDH2 using conditional knock-in mouse models. These studies show that in the lymphoid system, mutations in IDH2 at R172 produce high levels of 2HG compared with mutations at the other two sites and that lymphoid development is impaired in these animals. These data provide evidence that IDH2 R172 mutations may be the only variants present in AITL because of their capacity to produce significant amounts of the oncometabolite 2HG in the cell of origin of this disease.",,"['Lemonnier, Francois', 'Cairns, Rob A', 'Inoue, Satoshi', 'Li, Wanda Y', 'Dupuy, Aurelie', 'Broutin, Sophie', 'Martin, Nadine', 'Fataccioli, Virginie', 'Pelletier, Romain', 'Wakeham, Andrew', 'Snow, Bryan E', 'de Leval, Laurence', 'Pujals, Anais', 'Haioun, Corinne', 'Paci, Angelo', 'Tobin, Erica R', 'Narayanaswamy, Rohini', 'Yen, Katherine', 'Jin, Shengfang', 'Gaulard, Philippe', 'Mak, Tak W']","['Lemonnier F', 'Cairns RA', 'Inoue S', 'Li WY', 'Dupuy A', 'Broutin S', 'Martin N', 'Fataccioli V', 'Pelletier R', 'Wakeham A', 'Snow BE', 'de Leval L', 'Pujals A', 'Haioun C', 'Paci A', 'Tobin ER', 'Narayanaswamy R', 'Yen K', 'Jin S', 'Gaulard P', 'Mak TW']","['The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5G 2C1, Canada.', 'Inserm U955, Universite Paris Est Creteil, Institut Mondor de Recherche Biomedicale, 94010 Creteil, France.', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5G 2C1, Canada.', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5G 2C1, Canada.', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5G 2C1, Canada.', 'Inserm U955, Universite Paris Est Creteil, Institut Mondor de Recherche Biomedicale, 94010 Creteil, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie, Departement de Biologie et Pathologie Medicales, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, F-94805, Villejuif, France.', 'Inserm U955, Universite Paris Est Creteil, Institut Mondor de Recherche Biomedicale, 94010 Creteil, France.', 'Inserm U955, Universite Paris Est Creteil, Institut Mondor de Recherche Biomedicale, 94010 Creteil, France.', 'Inserm U955, Universite Paris Est Creteil, Institut Mondor de Recherche Biomedicale, 94010 Creteil, France.', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5G 2C1, Canada.', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5G 2C1, Canada.', 'Institut Universitaire de Pathologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, 1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Inserm U955, Universite Paris Est Creteil, Institut Mondor de Recherche Biomedicale, 94010 Creteil, France.', 'Unite Hemopathies Lymphoides, Groupe Henri-Mondor Albert-Chenevier, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, 94010, Creteil, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie, Departement de Biologie et Pathologie Medicales, Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Saclay, F-94805, Villejuif, France.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA 02139; tmak@uhnresearch.ca philippe.gaulard@aphp.fr shengfang.jin@agios.com.', 'Inserm U955, Universite Paris Est Creteil, Institut Mondor de Recherche Biomedicale, 94010 Creteil, France; tmak@uhnresearch.ca philippe.gaulard@aphp.fr shengfang.jin@agios.com.', 'Departement de Pathologie, Groupe Henri-Mondor Albert-Chenevier, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, 94010, Creteil, France.', 'The Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5G 2C1, Canada; tmak@uhnresearch.ca philippe.gaulard@aphp.fr shengfang.jin@agios.com.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada.']",['CIHR/Canada'],20161212,,PMC5206549,['NOTNLM'],"['*2-hydroxyglutarate', '*AITL', '*T cell', '*isocitrate dehydrogenase', '*lymphoma']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) generates the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and has established roles in tumor initiation, progression, and chemotherapy resistance in a wide range of cancers. The role and targeting of SPHK1 in primary AML, however, has not been previously investigated. Here we show that SPHK1 is overexpressed and constitutively activated in primary AML patient blasts but not in normal mononuclear cells. Subsequent targeting of SPHK1 induced caspase-dependent cell death in AML cell lines, primary AML patient blasts, and isolated AML patient leukemic progenitor/stem cells, with negligible effects on normal bone marrow CD34(+) progenitors from healthy donors. Furthermore, administration of SPHK1 inhibitors to orthotopic AML patient-derived xenografts reduced tumor burden and prolonged overall survival without affecting murine hematopoiesis. SPHK1 inhibition was associated with reduced survival signaling from S1P receptor 2, resulting in selective downregulation of the prosurvival protein MCL1. Subsequent analysis showed that the combination of BH3 mimetics with either SPHK1 inhibition or S1P receptor 2 antagonism triggered synergistic AML cell death.

Survival analysis indicated that GAS5 rs55829688 (T > C) was significantly associated with prognosis of AML (p = 0.018). Patients with rs55829688 CC genotype showed higher GAS5 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (p = 0.025) and harbored a longer platelets recovery (p = 0.040) than carriers of rs55829688T allele.

Winter 2016;29(6):411-418. doi: 10.14735/amko2016411.,,"BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clinically complex and very heterogeneous disease at the molecular level. Conventional cytogenetic analysis and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) tests provide important information about the biological and clinical background of the disease and enable the classification of AML patients into three risk groups. However, up to half of patients have normal cytogenetics. Determining prognosis and treatment strategies in this group of patients is challenging. The development of molecular genetic methods, including next generation sequencing in the last decade, has led to the discovery of a number of recurrent mutations that have contributed to increasing the accuracy of prognosis of those patients with cytogenetically normal AML. Besides the prognostic value of these mutations, they may also be used to monitor minimal residual disease during and after treatment of AML and additionally constitute potential targets for the development of new therapeutic agents. The importance of molecular genetic testing of all patients with AML is highlighted by the WHO classification of 2008 in which subgroups of AML are purely defined by molecular genetics markers.

Here we report 38 AML patients with a T/NT karyotype, including 26 men and 12 women with a median age of 65 years. T/NT karyotype was detected at initial diagnosis of AML in 16 patients, and acquired during the course of disease in 22 patients. All patients showed large blasts with frequent prominent nucleoli, cytoplasmic vacuoles and/or inclusions, nuclear irregularity and/or budding. Eleven patients had a non-complex and 27 had a complex T/NT karyotype; 21 patients also had pseudodiploid and/or triploid clones. After T/NT karyotype detection, 32 patients received chemotherapy and 10 also received stem cell transplant. After a median of 6.2 months follow-up, 32 patients died of disease or complications, 5 were alive with complete remission, and 1 alive with persistent AML. Median overall survival (OS) was 5 months. Patients with a non-complex T/NT karyotype had a significantly superior OS compared to those with a complex T/NT karyotype (10.7 vs. 3.4 months, p=0.0280). We conclude that T/NT karyotype in AML is often associated with distinctive morphologic features and conveys generally poor outcomes.

METHODS: We retrospectively studied 46 patients transplanted for CLL and evaluated for post-transplant MRD by flow cytometry. RESULTS: At transplant time, 43% of the patients were in CR, including one with undetectable MRD, 46% were in partial response, and 11% had refractory disease. After transplant, 61% of the patients achieved CR with undetectable MRD status. By multivariate analysis, reaching CR with undetectable MRD 12 months after transplant was the only factor associated with better progression-free survival (P = 0.02) and attaining undetectable MRD, independently of the time of negativity, was the only factor that correlated with better overall survival (P = 0.04).

However, cancer is a mixture of cells with different sensitivity/resistance to drugs. Furthermore, the effects of drugs on cells produce both chemical and morphological changes, the latter could affect the spectra of cells incubated with drugs. Here, we successfully cloned sensitive and resistant leukaemia cells to nilotinib, a drug used in the management of leukaemia. This allowed both the study of a more uniform population and the study of sensitive and resistant cells prior to the addition of the drug with both S-FTIR and Raman microspectroscopies. The incubation with nilotinib produced changes in the S-FTIR and Raman spectra of both sensitive and resistant clones to nilotinib. Principal component analysis was able to distinguish between cells incubated in the absence or presence of the drug, even in the case of resistant clones. The latter would confirm that the spectral differences between the so-called resistant clonal cells prior to and after adding a drug might reside on those more or less sensitive cells that have been able to remain alive when they were collected to be studied with S-FTIR or Raman microspectroscopies. The data presented here indicate that the methodology of cell cloning can be applied to different types of malignant cells. This should facilitate the identification of spectral biomarkers of sensitivity/resistance to drugs. The next step would be a better assessment of sensitivity/resistance of leukaemia cells from patients which could guide clinicians to better tailor treatments to each individual patient.",,"['Siddique, M R', 'Rutter, A V', 'Wehbe, K', 'Cinque, G', 'Bellisola, G', 'Sule-Suso, J']","['Siddique MR', 'Rutter AV', 'Wehbe K', 'Cinque G', 'Bellisola G', 'Sule-Suso J']","['Institute for Science and Technology in Medicine, Keele University, Guy Hilton Research Centre, Thornburrow Drive, Stoke on Trent ST4 7QB, UK. josep.sulesuso@uhns.nhs.uk.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the considerable morbidity which occurs as a result of chemotherapy often restricts the treatment intensity. One of the important dose-limiting and costly adverse effects of cancer therapy is mucositis. Children with hematological malignancies are greatly at risk of developing mucositis. PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of palifermin in preventing mucositis in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) who undergo chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this clinical trial, 90 children with ALL were randomized to receive chlorhexidine (n=45) or palifermin (n=45). One group received 60 mug/ kg/ day palifermin as an intravenous bolus once daily for 3 days before and 3 days after the chemotherapy. Chlorhexidine mouthwash was administered once daily for 3 days before and 3 days after the chemotherapy. The world health organization (WHO) oral toxicity scale was employed for grading the mucositis. The data were analyzed by using two-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The two groups were matched for age and gender. The study groups were significantly different in terms of mucositis grading (P values after 1 and 2 week therapy were 0.00). Palifermin decreased the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. CONCLUSION: Palifermin reduces the oral mucositis in children with ALL. Several mechanisms of action are suggested for keratinocyte growth factor (such as palifermin) including promotion of cell proliferation and cytoprotection, restraining the apoptosis, and changing the cytokine profile.",,"['Gholizadeh, Narges', 'Mehdipoor, Masoumeh', 'Sajadi, Hasan', 'Moosavi, Mahdieh-Sadat']","['Gholizadeh N', 'Mehdipoor M', 'Sajadi H', 'Moosavi MS']","['Dept. of Oral Medicine, School of Dentistry, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran, Dept. of Oral Medicine, School of Dentistry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Oral Medicine, School of Dentistry, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'School of Dentistry, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Dept. of Oral Medicine, School of Dentistry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",,,,PMC5136413,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'Palifermin', 'Oral Mucositis']",['There is no conflict of interest in relation to this study.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are several means by which neck masses in children can be subdivided, for example by age at presentation, anatomical location including compartments and fascia of the neck, their classical appearance when imaged, or by etiology. When imaging children the clinicians must be mindful of radiation exposure and as such ultrasound (US) is often attempted first. Cross sectional imaging can be helpful for problem solving with CT being particularly useful for assessing the patient in more acute scenarios, for example when there is airway compromise. Nuclear medicine scintigraphy has a role in specific circumstances and can aid in staging in the presence of malignancy.

Detecting anti-Toxoplasma antibodies in serum using serological tests is a common method to diagnose toxoplasmosis. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, an indigenous ELISA kit was prepared using tachyzoites from the RH strain of T. gondii, and its sensitivity and specificity were compared with those of commercial kits. METHODS: To produce antigens, 0.02 mL of locally isolated T. gondii RH strain parasites along with 10(9) tachyzoites were injected into the peritoneal cavities of 50 laboratory mice (BALB/C). Parasites were collected after 4 days. After filtering and washing, the concentration of protein in sonicated tachyzoites was calculated using the Lowry protein assay. The dilution of antigen, serum and alkaline phosphatase conjugate was assessed in designing an indigenous ELISA method; then ELISA was performed based on these dilutions, and its sensitivity was determined using 200 serum samples. In addition, the specificity of the assay was evaluated using 40 serum samples from patients with tuberculosis, leukemia or hydatid cyst. RESULTS: Indigenous ELISA was used to examine 100 serum samples containing anti-T. gondii IgG, with a sensitivity of 98% (commercial kits: 100%). Another 100 serum samples containing anti-T. gondii IgM were also tested, with a sensitivity of 99% (commercial kits: 100%). When 40 serum samples from patients with leukemia, hydatid cyst or tuberculosis were examined using anti-T. gondii IgG, the specificity was 100%, identical to commercial kits. However, the specificity of a similar test with anti-T. gondii IgM was just 28.6% for serum samples from leukemia patients, 21.4% for hydatid cyst and 16.7% for tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: We found that purified locally isolated soluble crude antigens of the RH strain of T. gondii from the peritoneal cavity of mice may be one of the most promising antigens for detection of human toxoplasmosis in routine screening.",,"['Mohammadpour, Niloofar', 'Saki, Jasem', 'Rafiei, Abdollah', 'Khodadadi, Ali', 'Tavalla, Mehdi', 'Cheraghian, Bahman']","['Mohammadpour N', 'Saki J', 'Rafiei A', 'Khodadadi A', 'Tavalla M', 'Cheraghian B']","['Department of Medical Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, IR Iran.', 'Department of Medical Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, IR Iran; Health Research Institute, Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, IR Iran.', 'Health Research Institute, Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, IR Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine , Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, IR Iran.', 'Department of Medical Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, IR Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, IR Iran.']",,20160913,,PMC5136452,['NOTNLM'],"['Commercial Kits', 'Designing', 'Indigenous ELISA', 'Iran', 'Tachyzoites RH Strain', 'Toxoplasma gondii']","['Conflict of Interest:The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest', 'regarding the publication of this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that fasting alone robustly inhibits the initiation and reverses the leukemic progression of both B cell and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL and T-ALL, respectively), but not acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in mouse models of these tumors. Mechanistically, we found that attenuated leptin-receptor (LEPR) expression is essential for the development and maintenance of ALL, and that fasting inhibits ALL development by upregulation of LEPR and its downstream signaling through the protein PR/SET domain 1 (PRDM1). The expression of LEPR signaling-related genes correlated with the prognosis of pediatric patients with pre-B-ALL, and fasting effectively inhibited B-ALL growth in a human xenograft model.

Epub 2016 Dec 12.,10.1038/nm.4247 [doi],"In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), therapy resistance frequently occurs, leading to high mortality among patients. However, the mechanisms that render leukemic cells drug resistant remain largely undefined. Here, we identified loss of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and subsequent reduction of histone H3K27 trimethylation as a novel pathway of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and cytotoxic drugs in AML. Low EZH2 protein levels correlated with poor prognosis in AML patients. Suppression of EZH2 protein expression induced chemoresistance of AML cell lines and primary cells in vitro and in vivo. Low EZH2 levels resulted in derepression of HOX genes, and knockdown of HOXB7 and HOXA9 in the resistant cells was sufficient to improve sensitivity to TKIs and cytotoxic drugs. The endogenous loss of EZH2 expression in resistant cells and primary blasts from a subset of relapsed AML patients resulted from enhanced CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of EZH2 at Thr487. This interaction was stabilized by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and followed by proteasomal degradation of EZH2 in drug-resistant cells. Accordingly, inhibitors of HSP90, CDK1 and the proteasome prevented EZH2 degradation, decreased HOX gene expression and restored drug sensitivity. Finally, patients with reduced EZH2 levels at progression to standard therapy responded to the combination of bortezomib and cytarabine, concomitant with the re-establishment of EZH2 expression and blast clearance. These data suggest restoration of EZH2 protein as a viable approach to overcome treatment resistance in this AML patient population.",,"['Gollner, Stefanie', 'Oellerich, Thomas', 'Agrawal-Singh, Shuchi', 'Schenk, Tino', 'Klein, Hans-Ulrich', 'Rohde, Christian', 'Pabst, Caroline', 'Sauer, Tim', 'Lerdrup, Mads', 'Tavor, Sigal', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Herold, Sylvia', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Kohler, Gabriele', 'Pan, Kuan-Ting', 'Urlaub, Henning', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Vick, Binje', 'Jeremias, Irmela', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Hansen, Klaus', 'Zelent, Arthur', 'Wickenhauser, Claudia', 'Muller, Lutz P', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Gollner S', 'Oellerich T', 'Agrawal-Singh S', 'Schenk T', 'Klein HU', 'Rohde C', 'Pabst C', 'Sauer T', 'Lerdrup M', 'Tavor S', 'Stolzel F', 'Herold S', 'Ehninger G', 'Kohler G', 'Pan KT', 'Urlaub H', 'Serve H', 'Dugas M', 'Spiekermann K', 'Vick B', 'Jeremias I', 'Berdel WE', 'Hansen K', 'Zelent A', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Muller LP', 'Thiede C', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Halle (Saale), Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre and Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), Molecular Pathology, London, UK.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, University Hospital of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Halle (Saale), Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Halle (Saale), Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre and Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Goldyne Savad Institute of Gene Therapy, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Medicine, Molecular Hematology, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Molecular Hematology, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Molecular Hematology, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Gerhard Domagk Institute of Pathology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Group, Max Plank Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Group, Max Plank Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Bioanalytics, Institute for Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Center Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, University Hospital of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Center Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Center Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre and Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMHC), University of Miami Hospital and Clinics, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Halle (Saale), Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Halle (Saale), Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Molecular Hematology, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Halle (Saale), Halle (Saale), Germany.']",['681524/European Research Council/International'],20161212,,PMC6548550,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9740-0788', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1773-7677']",,['EMS83109'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detailed karyotype was available for 66/74 (89%) in LAME89/91 and 118/119 (99%) in ELAM02. Several karyotype and transplant characteristics differed according to therapeutic protocol: unfavorable karyotypes were more frequent in ELAM02 (36% vs 18%), pretransplant chemotherapy included high-dose cytarabine in ELAM02 and not in LAME89/91, IV replaced oral busulfan in the conditioning regimen, methotrexate was removed from post-transplant immunosuppression, and matched unrelated donor and cord blood transplantation were introduced. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 78.2% in LAME89 and 81.4% in ELAM02. OS was significantly lower for the unfavorable cytogenetic risk group in LAME89/91 when compared with intermediate and favorable groups (50% vs 90.6 and 86.4%, P=0.001). This difference was no longer apparent in ELAM02 (80.9% vs 71.3% and 5/5, respectively). Survival improvement for children with unfavorable karyotype was statistically significant (P=0.026) and was due to decrease in relapse risk. Five-year transplantation-related mortality was 6.75% in LAME89/91. In ELAM02, it was 3.2% for patients with a sibling donor and 10.9% with an unrelated donor or cord blood.

However, direct evidence of GvL activity in T-PLL is lacking. We correlated minimal residual disease (MRD) kinetics with immune interventions and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity alterations in patients after alloSCT for T-PLL. Longitudinal quantitative MRD monitoring was performed by clone-specific real-time PCR of TCR rearrangements (n=7), and TCR repertoire diversity assessment by next-generation sequencing (NGS; n=3) Although post-transplant immunomodulation (immunosuppression tapering or donor lymphocyte infusions) resulted in significant reduction (>1 log) of MRD levels in 7 of 10 occasions, durable MRD clearance was observed in only two patients. In all three patients analyzed by TCR-NGS, MRD responses were reproducibly associated with a shift from a clonal, T-PLL-driven profile to a polyclonal signature. Novel clonotypes that could explain a clonal GvL effect did not emerge. In conclusion, TCR-based MRD quantification appears to be a suitable tool for monitoring and guiding treatment interventions in T-PLL. The MRD responses to immune modulation observed here provide first molecular evidence for GvL activity in T-PLL which, however, may be often only transient and reliant on a poly-/oligoclonal rather than a monoclonal T-cell response.",,"['Sellner, L', 'Bruggemann, M', 'Schlitt, M', 'Knecht, H', 'Herrmann, D', 'Reigl, T', 'Krejci, A', 'Bystry, V', 'Darzentas, N', 'Rieger, M', 'Dietrich, S', 'Luft, T', 'Ho, A D', 'Kneba, M', 'Dreger, P']","['Sellner L', 'Bruggemann M', 'Schlitt M', 'Knecht H', 'Herrmann D', 'Reigl T', 'Krejci A', 'Bystry V', 'Darzentas N', 'Rieger M', 'Dietrich S', 'Luft T', 'Ho AD', 'Kneba M', 'Dreger P']","['Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Oncology Practice Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genome Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,20161212,,,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7893-401X'],,,,,,['Bone Marrow Transplant. 2017 Apr;52(4):656.

Patients with high-risk acute leukemia were prospectively screened for prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (pDLI). Lymphocytes were administered repeatedly at low and non-escalating doses (0.5-1 x 10(6)/kg). Low-dose alemtuzumab was effective in prevention of acute GvHD after sibling or well-matched unrelated transplantation, whereas a more intensified approach was needed after mismatched transplantation. The cumulative incidence of chronic moderate/severe chronic-GvHD (cGvHD) was 15.6%. In total, 63 high-risk leukemia patients were eligible for pDLI. Only 1 out of the 39 pDLI recipients relapsed as compared with 7 out of the 24 recipients, who did not receive pDLI due to logistical hurdles. In multivariate analysis, the use of adjuvant lymphocyte therapy was significantly associated with reduced incidence of relapse and improved disease-free survival. In summary, low-dose alemtuzumab confers to a low cGvHD incidence and the administration of pDLIs in this context is very likely to reduce relapse risk in high risk leukemia patients. This is translated in an estimated 5-year probability of GvHD-free and relapse-free survival of 43.3% for the 136 leukemia patients.",,"['Tsirigotis, P', 'Liga, M', 'Gkirkas, K', 'Stamouli, M', 'Triantafyllou, E', 'Marangos, M', 'Pessach, I', 'Sarantopoulos, A', 'Spyridis, N', 'Spyridonidis, A']","['Tsirigotis P', 'Liga M', 'Gkirkas K', 'Stamouli M', 'Triantafyllou E', 'Marangos M', 'Pessach I', 'Sarantopoulos A', 'Spyridis N', 'Spyridonidis A']","[""BMT Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, 'Attikon' University Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece."", 'BMT Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Patras, Rio, Greece.', ""BMT Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, 'Attikon' University Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece."", ""BMT Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, 'Attikon' University Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece."", 'BMT Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Patras, Rio, Greece.', 'BMT Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Patras, Rio, Greece.', ""BMT Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, 'Attikon' University Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece."", 'BMT Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Patras, Rio, Greece.', 'BMT Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Patras, Rio, Greece.', 'BMT Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Patras, Rio, Greece.']",,20161212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We selected patients transplanted with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate (MTX)/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) combination. A total of 1516 first myeloablative UCBT between 2000 and 2012 (Cyclosporine A (CyA) plus MTX, 824, Tacrolimus (Tac) plus MTX, 554, Tac plus MMF, 138) were included. With adjusted analyses, Tac plus MMF showed a significantly higher risk for grade II-IV and III-IV acute GvHD than CyA or Tac plus MTX. Although NRM was similar, Tac plus MMF showed a significantly lower risk of relapse than CyA or Tac plus MTX. A significant difference was observed in the risk of overall mortality (OM) between the MTX-containing group and MMF-containing group. In patients with standard-risk disease, there was no significant difference in the risk of OM in any GvHD prophylaxis.

Cure can be assessed by comparing long-term survival of patients to the matched general population. Using data from 2589 patients who received allo-HCT between 2000 and 2010, we used landmark analyses and methods from relative survival analysis to calculate excess mortality compared with an age-, sex- and calendar year-matched general population. Estimated event-free survival, overall survival and non-relapse mortality (NRM) 10 years after allo-HCT were 28% (95% confidence interval (CI), 25-31), 35% (95% CI, 32-38) and 40% (95% CI, 37-42), respectively. Patients who passed the 5-year landmark event-free survival (N=394) had a 79% probability (95% CI, 73-85) of surviving the subsequent 5 years without an event. Relapse and NRM contributed equally to treatment failure. Five-year mortality for 45- and 65-year-old reference patients who were event-free at the 5-year landmark was 8% and 47% compared with 3% and 14% in the matched general population, respectively. The prospect of long-term disease-free survival remains an argument to consider allo-HCT for young patients with high-risk CLL, and programs to understand and prevent late causes of failure for long-term survivors are warranted, especially for older patients.",,"['van Gelder, M', 'de Wreede, L C', 'Bornhauser, M', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Karas, M', 'Anderson, N S', 'Gramatzki, M', 'Dreger, P', 'Michallet, M', 'Petersen, E', 'Bunjes, D', 'Potter, M', 'Beelen, D', 'Cornelissen, J J', 'Yakoub-Agha, I', 'Russell, N H', 'Finke, J', 'Schoemans, H', 'Vitek, A', 'Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Blaise, D', 'Volin, L', 'Chevallier, P', 'Caballero, D', 'Putter, H', 'van Biezen, A', 'Henseler, A', 'Schonland, S', 'Kroger, N', 'Schetelig, J']","['van Gelder M', 'de Wreede LC', 'Bornhauser M', 'Niederwieser D', 'Karas M', 'Anderson NS', 'Gramatzki M', 'Dreger P', 'Michallet M', 'Petersen E', 'Bunjes D', 'Potter M', 'Beelen D', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Russell NH', 'Finke J', 'Schoemans H', 'Vitek A', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Blaise D', 'Volin L', 'Chevallier P', 'Caballero D', 'Putter H', 'van Biezen A', 'Henseler A', 'Schonland S', 'Kroger N', 'Schetelig J']","['Department of Internal Medicine/Hematology, University Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'DKMS, gemeinnutzige GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Hemostasiology, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Charles University Hospital, Pilsen, Czech Republic.', 'BMT Unit, Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center Hospitalier Lyon-Sud - Hematologie, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Klinik fuer Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Leukaemia Myeloma Units, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, Surrey, UK.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Hopital HURIEZ, UAM allo-CSH, CHRU, Lille, France.', 'Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.', 'Department of Medicine-Hematology, Oncology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Hospital Clinic, Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Hematology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Programme de Transplantation and Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', ""Department D'Hematologie, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'DKMS, gemeinnutzige GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",,20161212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These medications are usually administrated concurrently in high doses during the initial induction phase of chemotherapy. As a result, hyperglycemia frequently develops during this phase, with resolution after the steroids and asparaginase have been discontinued or reduced in dose. Various recent studies have evaluated the incidence of hyperglycemia in this particular group of patients and its relationship with chemotherapy. However the incidence of hyperglycemia during induction of remission therapy in children with ALL is not known, and is the subject of this study. To determine the incidence as well as identification of day of onset and duration of hyperglycemia and other complications during induction of remission therapy.

The chronic ZEN-induced injury mouse model was established with the continuous intragastric administration of 40 mg/kg body mass (B.M.) ZEN for 28 days. Then, interventions with different doses (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg B.M.) of Se were conducted on mice to analyse the changes in organ indexes of epididymis and testis, antioxidant capability of testis, serum level of testosterone, sperm concentration and motility parameters, and the expression levels of apoptosis-associated genes and blood testis barrier- (BTB) related genes. Our results showed that Se could greatly improve the ZEN-induced decrease of epididymis indexes and testis indexes. Results also showed that the decrease in sperm concentration, sperm normality rate, and sperm motility parameters, including percentage of motile sperm (motile), tropism percentage (progressive) and sperm average path velocity (VAP), caused by ZEN were elevated upon administration of the higher dose (0.4 mg/kg) and intermediate dose (0.2 mg/kg) of Se. Selenium also significantly reduced the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) but enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the testis tissue. Further research demonstrated that ZEN increased the level of mRNA expression of BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) and caspase 3 (Casp3), decreased the level of mRNA expression of B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), vimentin (Vim) and cadherin 2 (Cdh2), whereas the co-administration of Se reversed these gene expression levels. Our results indicated that high levels of Se could protect against reproductive system damage in male mice caused by ZEN and the mechanism might such be that Se improved mice antioxidant ability, inhibited reproductive cell apoptosis, and increased the decrease of BTB integrity-related genes caused by ZEN.",,"['Long, Miao', 'Yang, Shuhua', 'Wang, Yuan', 'Li, Peng', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Dong, Shuang', 'Chen, Xinliang', 'Guo, Jiayi', 'He, Jianbin', 'Gao, Zenggui', 'Wang, Jun']","['Long M', 'Yang S', 'Wang Y', 'Li P', 'Zhang Y', 'Dong S', 'Chen X', 'Guo J', 'He J', 'Gao Z', 'Wang J']","['Key Laboratory of Zoonosis of Liaoning Province, College of Animal Science & Veterinary Medicine, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China. longjlau@126.com.', 'Institute of Plant Immunology, College of Plant Protection College, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China. longjlau@126.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Zoonosis of Liaoning Province, College of Animal Science & Veterinary Medicine, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China. yangshuhua0001@126.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Zoonosis of Liaoning Province, College of Animal Science & Veterinary Medicine, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China. lm19781013@163.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Zoonosis of Liaoning Province, College of Animal Science & Veterinary Medicine, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China. lipeng79625@163.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Zoonosis of Liaoning Province, College of Animal Science & Veterinary Medicine, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China. sihuo12345@sohu.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Zoonosis of Liaoning Province, College of Animal Science & Veterinary Medicine, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China.

Thus, development of novel immunotherapies to achieve more effective activation of anti-cancer immunity and immuno-monitoring of biomarkers, allowing proper evaluation of immune responses in cancer patients in order to detect responders, are urgent issues.

The involvement of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in the activity of wogonoside was checked. The in vivo effect of wogonoside on T-ALL growth was investigated in a xenograft mouse model. Wogonoside significantly inhibited the viability of MOLT-3 and Jurkat cells, with the IC50 (the half maximal concentration) of 68.5 +/- 3.8 and 52.6 +/- 4.3 muM, respectively. However, healthy T lymphocytes were unaffected. Wogonoside-treated Jurkat cells exhibited a G1-phase cell cycle arrest and significant apoptosis, which was coupled with inactivation of STAT3 signaling. Overexpression of constitutively active STAT3 reversed wogonoside-mediated growth suppression and apoptosis and restored the expression of cyclin D1, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL. In vivo studies demonstrated that wogonoside retarded tumor growth and suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation in Jurkat xenografts.

Synthetic water-soluble copolymers based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) are carriers with tunable architecture and drug loading, tumor-specific accumulation of the drug, and its controlled release. We describe a combination treatment of murine EL4 T cell lymphoma with HPMA-based star conjugates (Mw 250,000gmol(-1)) of doxorubicin (Dox) or docetaxel (Dtx) designed for enhanced tumor accumulation and combination therapy. Although the combination of linear conjugates (Mw=28,000gmol(-1)) containing Dox or Dtx resulted in an additive effect in the treatment of the lymphoma, the opposite was observed in the combination of two star conjugates with Dox or Dtx, as the star Dtx conjugate decreased the treatment efficacy of the star Dox conjugate. The Dtx conjugate alone was virtually ineffective in the reduction of tumor growth or survival time extension; thus, a curative effect could be solely attributed to the Dox-containing conjugate. When Dtx was delivered to the tumor on the same polymer carrier as Dox, the efficacy of the Dox-induced treatment was reduced to a lesser extent. No reduction was found when Dtx was delivered by a linear polymer or applied as a free drug. The phenomenon was strictly related to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, as it was not observed in BCL1 leukemia, a model without EPR. The diminished treatment outcome in the combination therapy with the two star conjugates was underlined by the significantly decreased accumulation of Dox in the tumor. The use of the drug-free polymer carrier instead of the Dtx-containing star conjugate did not reduce the treatment efficacy of the Dox conjugate. Thus, the physicochemical characteristics of the polymer carrier designed for tumor-specific drug delivery systems control the activity of the respective drug, leading to changes within the tumor microenvironment that can determine ultimate efficacy of the combination therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It was observed that the acquisition of MDR phenotype by leukemic cells or their transfection with the extrussion pump, P-gp, modifies the activation profile and regulation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) in cells exposed to low temperatures. More specifically, cold stress provoked the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in sensitive cells, while attenuated JNK signaling was observed in MDR cells. This effect was also observed, although with less intensity, in P-gp-transfected cells. Using pharmacological inhibitors to determine the role of MAPK in leukemic cell survival in physiological conditions or under cold stress, a dual temperature-dependent role was observed for JNK in MDR cell survival. At 37 degrees C JNK is necessary for the survival of parental, resistant and P-gp-transfected cells; however, the use of inhibitors of either extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) or JNK significantly counteracts cold-induced death of resistant and P-gp-transfected cells, supporting a role for ERK and JNK in cold-stress induced cell death. Finally, a connectivity model concerning MAPK is proposed, summarizing how cold stress and MDR-1 might trigger apoptosis in resistant cell lines.

Although macroautophagy is known to serve as a survival pathway in many cancer cells, the role of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective protein degradation system, in cancer is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated that lysosomal proteolysis, but not macroautophagy, attenuated apoptosis induced by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, crizotinib, in the non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, EBC1. In EBC1 cells, crizotinib induced BIM-dependent apoptosis, which was enhanced by inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis. Moreover, degradation of the pro-survival protein, MCL1, by the ubiquitin-proteasome system was induced by inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis, and by inhibition of the expression of the CMA mediators, HSC70 (heat shock cognate protein 70 kDa) and LAMP2A (lysosome membrane protein type 2A), suggesting the existence of a CMA-mediated MCL1 stabilization system in cancer cells. Indeed, the same MCL1 stabilization system was also observed in several NSCLC cell lines; in these cells, their specific molecular-targeted drug or ABT-263 (Navitoclax), the specific inhibitor of BCL-2 and BCL-XL, but not of MCL1, effectively induced apoptosis in combination with CMA inhibition. Therefore, our results indicate a novel mechanism of MCL1 stabilization in lung cancers by CMA, and a candidate efficient combination chemotherapy method against lung cancers.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Somatic IKZF1 alterations are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of leukemia in human subjects. Recently, immunodeficiency caused by germline IKZF1 mutation has been described. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the clinical and immunologic phenotypes of Japanese patients with heterozygous IKZF1 mutations. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing in patients from a dysgammaglobulinemia or autoimmune disease cohort and used a candidate gene approach in 4 patients. Functional and laboratory studies, including detailed lymphopoiesis/hematopoiesis analysis in the bone marrow, were performed. RESULTS: Nine patients from 6 unrelated families were identified to have heterozygous germline mutations in IKZF1. Age of onset was 0 to 20 years (mean, 7.4 years). Eight of 9 patients presented with dysgammaglobulinemia accompanied by B-cell deficiency. Four of 9 patients had autoimmune disease, including immune thrombocytopenic purpura, IgA vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Nonautoimmune pancytopenia was observed in 1 patient. All of the mutant Ikaros protein demonstrated impaired DNA binding to the target sequence and abnormal diffuse nuclear localization. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow revealed reduced levels of common lymphoid progenitors and normal development of pro-B to pre-B cells. CONCLUSIONS: Germline heterozygous IKZF1 mutations cause dysgammaglobulinemia; hematologic abnormalities, including B-cell defect; and autoimmune diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Patients with hematologic neoplasms may share some of these characteristics, and it may be useful clinically to better understand this set of patients. Our objective is to review systematically the characteristics of patients with both hematologic malignancies and NAION. DESIGN: Systematic review. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with NAION diagnosis related in time to a hematologic neoplasm. METHODS: Data sources for the study included MEDLINE, Web of Science, LILACS, SciELO, and OpenGrey. The study eligibility criteria included case reports and case series. RESULTS: We found 261 records, with 15 studies included plus our case report. A total of 19 patients (8 female) with mean age of 54.6 years (range, 12-87) were analyzed: 37% (7) non-Hodgkin lymphoma; 26% (5) myeloproliferative neoplasms; 21% (4) myelodysplasia; 16% (3) leukemias. The limitations included verification bias, inability to test statistical association between NAION and hematologic neoplasms, the small number of cases, and confounding factors related to medical history and specific interventions in each case limited the robustness of our conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identified the characteristics of patients with NAION and hematologic neoplasms related in time.

The lesions of NDH and Sweet syndrome are similar, as indicated in the first report of NDH. Both diagnoses are characterized by an acute onset of fever, leukocytosis, and tender, erythematous infiltrated plaques. There are also bullae and ulceration in NDH, in contrast to Sweet syndrome, in which bullae are quite uncommon, especially at the early stages. Similar to Sweet syndrome, the majority of NDH patients are women (69%). Patients with NDH present with fever, peripheral neutrophilia, leukocytosis, and/or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level, but at a significantly lower rate than those in Sweet syndrome (33%). Similar to Sweet syndrome, NDH has been associated with the following conditions: Malignancies (particularly hematological [21%], most common of which is acute myelogenous leukemia, but many other malignancies as well), inflammatory bowel disease (19%), medication and vaccination-related eruptions, bacterial and viral infections, rheumatologic diseases, and others. The clues to the diagnosis of NDH are the same as for Sweet syndrome. Awareness of this diagnosis is important not only to avoid unnecessary medical and surgical therapy and to expediently initiate the administration of steroids for this highly responsive dermatosis, but also to conduct an appropriate workup to exclude associated diseases, especially malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The amino-terminal region of SU contains conformational epitopes F, G and H, which require a glycosylated SU to be recognized by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and antibodies from BLV-infected cattle. The SU contains eight asparagine (N) residues that are putative N-glycosylation sites. The N129, N203, N230 and N251 appear involved in carbohydrate binding, play an essential role in the in vitro infection. To determine which sites were actually glycosylated, we generated mutated SU forms, where each N-glycosylation site was changed to alanine (A). Subsequently, these N to A mutations were inserted into the env gene to generate Env mutants. The increase of electrophoretic mobility of EnvA256 and EnvA271 derived SU showed that the asparagine residues N256 and N271 were also glycosylated. ELISA revealed that only the N129 oligosaccharide determined the antigenic conformation of SU. The syncytium formation induced by EnvA129 showed that fusogenic capacity was independent of amino-terminal SU glycan conformational structure. Finally, anti-BLV serum inhibited syncytia formation even with the EnvA129 mutant. The latter inhibition was higher than Env, suggesting that the oligosaccharides could be also involved in the glycan shield for viral escape.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Further, free molecular monitoring has been provided to patients at top clinical centers as part of a pilot study that has changed the local treatment pattern and outcomes of patients with CML. This study evaluates the impact of medical insurance coverage and the molecular monitoring frequency on outcomes of patients with CML treated at a central hospital in Jiangsu, China, according to patient-level data. METHODS: The study investigated 335 CML patients receiving medical treatment in a central hospital between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2014. Demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from the patients' clinical records. Univariate and multivariate analyses using the logistic regression model were performed to identify the differences in outcomes of major molecular response (MMR) or complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) between patients who were insured vs uninsured, or between patients with frequency of PCR monitoring </=2 times vs >/=3 times per year. RESULTS: Both the achievement of MMR (BCR-ABL(IS) </=0.1%) (50.4% vs 37.5%) and CCyR (80.7% vs 62.8%) at 12 months have shown significant differences that favored patients with insurance coverage of imatinib, while there was no significant difference in the outcome of BCR-ABL(IS) </=1% between insured and non-insured groups (56.0% vs 51.3%) at 6 months. The long-term results at 24 months demonstrated that there was a statistically significant difference in MMR rates between the group with 3 or more PCR monitoring tests per year and the group of patients with 2 or less PCR tests per year (76.9% vs 52.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that CML patients benefit from insurance coverage of imatinib and higher frequency (>/=3) of regularly scheduled molecular monitoring PCR in China.",,"['Sheng, Guangying', 'Chen, Suning', 'Zhang, Ri', 'Miao, Miao', 'Wu, Depei', 'Tan, Seng Chuen', 'Liu, Chao', 'Xiong, Tengbin']","['Sheng G', 'Chen S', 'Zhang R', 'Miao M', 'Wu D', 'Tan SC', 'Liu C', 'Xiong T']","['a Department of Hematology , Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'b Health Economics & Outcomes Research, IMS Health Asia Pacific , Singapore.', 'c Novartis Oncology (China) , Beijing , PR China.', 'd Health Economics & Outcomes Research, IMS Health China , Shanghai , PR China.']",,20170112,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'China', 'Imatinib', 'Medical insurance coverage', 'Molecular monitoring', 'Patient level data analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of insurance coverage with imatinib as the first-line treatment for patients with CML in China from a societal perspective. METHODS: A decision-analytic model based on previously published and real-world evidence was applied to simulate and evaluate the lifetime clinical and economic outcomes associated with CML treatments before and after imatinib was covered by medical insurance. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated with both costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) discounted at 3% annually. Different assumptions of treatment benefits and costs were taken to address uncertainties and were tested with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In base case analysis, both cost and effectiveness of CML treatments increased after imatinib was covered by the medical insurance; on average, the incremental QALY and cost were 5.5 and yen277,030 per patient in lifetime, respectively. The ICER of insurance coverage with imatinib was yen50,641, which is less than the GDP per capita of China. Monte Carlo simulation resulted in the estimate of 100% probability that the insurance coverage of imatinib is cost-effective. Total cost was substantially saved at 5 years after patients initiated imatinib treatment with insurance coverage compared to no insurance coverage, the saved cost at 5 years was yen99,565, which included the cost savings from both direct (e.g. cost of bone marrow or stem cell transplant) and indirect costs (e.g. productivity loss of patients and care-givers). CONCLUSIONS: The insurance coverage of imatinib is very cost-effective in China, according to the local cost and clinical data in Jiangsu province. More importantly, the insurance coverage of imatinib and nilotinib have changed the treatment patterns of CML patients, thus dramatically increasing life expectancy and quality-of-life (QoL) saving on productivity losses for both CML patients and their caregivers.",,"['Sheng, Guangying', 'Chen, Suning', 'Dong, Chaohui', 'Zhang, Ri', 'Miao, Miao', 'Wu, Depei', 'Tan, Seng Chuen', 'Liu, Chao', 'Xiong, Tengbin']","['Sheng G', 'Chen S', 'Dong C', 'Zhang R', 'Miao M', 'Wu D', 'Tan SC', 'Liu C', 'Xiong T']","['a Department of Hematology , Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'b Institute for Social Security Research, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of P.R.C , Beijing , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University , Suzhou , PR China.', 'c Health Economics & Outcomes Research, IMS Health Asia Pacific , Singapore.', 'd Novartis Oncology (China) , Beijing , PR China.', 'e Health Economics & Outcomes Research, IMS Health China , Shanghai , PR China.']",,20170112,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'China', 'Cost effectiveness', 'Imatinib', 'Insurance coverage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, Jurkat cells were transfected with specific PTPN22 siRNA. Relative PTPN22 mRNA expression was measured by Quantitative Real-time PCR. Western blotting was performed to determine the protein levels of PTPN22, AKT, P-AKT, ERK, and P-ERK. The cytotoxic effects of PTPN22 siRNA were determined using the MTT assay. Apoptosis was quantified using TUNEL assay and flow cytometry. Results showed that in Jurkat cells after transfection with PTPN22 siRNA, the expression of PTPN22 in both mRNA and protein levels was effectively reduced. Moreover, siRNA transfection induced apoptosis on the viability of T-cell acute leukemia cells. More importantly, PTPN22 positively regulated the anti-apoptotic AKT kinase, which provides a powerful survival signal to T-ALL cells as well as the suppression of PTPN22 down regulated ERK activity. Our results suggest that the PTPN22 specific siRNA effectively decreases the viability of T-cell acute leukemia cells, induces apoptosis in this cell line, and therefore could be considered as a potent adjuvant in T-ALL therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The current study shows that the PrPC augments infectivity and plaque formation of a mouse endogenous retrovirus, MuLV. We have established four neuronal cell lines expressing mouse PrPC, PrP+/+; two express wild type PrPC (MoPrPwild) and the other two express mutant PrPC (MoPrPmut). Infection of neuronal cells from various PrP+/+ and PrP-/- (MoPrPKO) lines with MuLV yielded at least three times as many plaques in PrP+/+ than in PrP-/-. Furthermore, among the four PrP+/+ lines, one mutant line, P101L, had at least 2.5 times as many plaques as the other three PrP+/+ lines. Plaques in P101L were four times larger than those in other PrP+/+ lines. Colocalization of PrP and CAgag was seen in MuLV-infected PrP+/+ cells. In the PrP-MuLV interaction, the involvement of galectin-3 and -6 was observed by immunoprecipitation with antibody to PrPC. These results suggest that PrPC combined with galectin-3 and -6 can act as a receptor for MuLV.

Here 229 relapsing Ph- ALL younger adults (18-63 years) treated within the Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL)-2003/-2005 trials were considered. Salvage regimens consisted of potentially curative therapies in 194 cases, low-intensity therapies in 21, allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) in 6 and best supportive care in 8. Overall, 77 patients received allo-SCT after relapse. The median follow-up was 3.1 years. A second complete remission (CR2) was achieved in 121 patients (53%). In multivariate analysis, only younger age <45 years (P=0.008) and CR1 duration 18 months (P=0.009) predicted CR2. Overall survival (OS) at 2 and 5 years was 19.3% (14-24%) and 13.3% (8-18%), respectively. In CR2 patients, disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 and 5 years was 29.0% (21-38%) and 25% (17-33%). In multivariate analysis, CR1 duration 18 months and allo-SCT after relapse were associated with longer DFS (P<0.009 and P=0.004, respectively) and longer OS (P=0.004 and P<0.0001, respectively). In conclusion, although younger adults relapsing after pediatric-inspired ALL therapies retain a poor outcome, some of them may be cured if CR1 duration 18 months and if allo-SCT can be performed in CR2.

This is achieved by rolling circle amplification mediated conversion of enzymatic reactions happening within nanometer dimensions to directly detectable micrometer sized DNA products. The system utilizes the unique integration reaction of IN to generate a surface anchored nicked DNA circle that serves as a substrate for rolling circle amplification and allows for specific, quantitative and sensitive detection of purified recombinant IN or virus particles with a detection limit of less than 30 virus particles per muL of sample. Moreover, by modifying the nucleotide sequences of the utilized DNA it was possible to tailor the system to distinguish between the highly pathogenic lentivirus HIV and the gammaretrovirus murine leukemia virus present in a given sample. Infections with HIV remain a major threat to global health with more than 2 million new infections and 1 million deaths each year. The sensitive and specific detection of HIV particles based on IN activity holds promise for the development of a new type of diagnostic tools suitable for early (within hours of infection) detection of HIV, which would be valuable for prevention strategies as well as for efficient treatment.",,"['Wang, Jing', 'Liu, Jiangnan', 'Thomsen, Jonas', 'Selnihhin, Denis', 'Hede, Marianne S', 'Kirsebom, Freja C M', 'Franch, Oskar', 'Fjelstrup, Soren', 'Stougaard, Magnus', 'Ho, Yi-Ping', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou', 'Knudsen, Birgitta R']","['Wang J', 'Liu J', 'Thomsen J', 'Selnihhin D', 'Hede MS', 'Kirsebom FC', 'Franch O', 'Fjelstrup S', 'Stougaard M', 'Ho YP', 'Pedersen FS', 'Knudsen BR']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. fsp@mbg.au.dk brk@mbg.au.dk.']",,20161209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypoxia renders solid tumors resistant to radiation and chemotherapeutics while providing opportunities for tumor-selective therapies targeting tumor hypoxia. Here we exploit two properties of tumors: propagation of tumor cells and ongoing generation of hypoxic regions to construct a system that preferentially leads to the death of tumor cells and thus hinders tumor growth. We constructed murine leukemia virus replication-competent (RCR) viruses that infect only propagating cells. These viruses express small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting cyclic AMP-response-element binding protein (CREB), hypoxia-inducible factors 1 (HIF)-1 or HIF-2 individually or all three together (X3). These viruses efficiently infected in vitro human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 and FLC4) cells and established persistence of the virus and knocked down the expression of the regulators of the hypoxia-responding genes. Knockdown of either HIF-1 or CREB or both in hypoxia reduced the expression of hypoxia-response elements- and CRE-mediated gene expression, diminished cell proliferation and increased caspase-3 activity. We did not detect any significant effect of the efficiently knocked down HIF-2 on any of the functions tested in vitro. Moreover, severe combined immunodeficiency mice implanted subcutaneously with HepG2 stably infected with recombinant RCRs showed reduction of tumor growth and vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and no hypoxia-guided neovascularization. Combined treatment (RCRs+doxorubicin) improved efficacy in the context of in vitro hypoxia and in vivo (with either vACE-CREB or vACE-X3). This synergistic effect may lead to an improved efficacy and safety profile of the treatment that may result in fewer side effects.",,"['Shneor, D', 'Folberg, R', ""Pe'er, J"", 'Honigman, A', 'Frenkel, S']","['Shneor D', 'Folberg R', ""Pe'er J"", 'Honigman A', 'Frenkel S']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, IMRIC, The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Departments of Pathology, Ophthalmology and Biomedical Sciences, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Rochester, MI, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, IMRIC, The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Hadassah Academic College, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,20161209,,PMC5339434,,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3688-8676'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 110 patients (65 male, 45 female) who underwent total body irradiation for hematopoietic stem cell transplant between May 1998 and March 2013. Median age at total body irradiation was 17 years (range, 1-62 y). Median observation time was 777 days (range, 31-5494 d). Initial diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (24 patients), acute myeloid leukemia (26 patients), chronic myeloid leukemia (7 patients), myelodysplastic syndrome (8 patients), malignant lymphoma (13 patients), mucopolysaccharidosis (12 patients), neuroblastoma (10 patients), and other diseases (10 patients). The total fractionated dose used for total body irradiation was 12 Gy in 69 patients and 6.0-10.8 Gy in 29 patients. Single-dose total body irradiation was administered to 12 patients. Most patients (63 of 110) received chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide alone. RESULTS: Ocular complications were observed in 29.5% of the patients. Hypothyroidism, interstitial pneumonia, obliterative bronchiolitis, and veno-occlusive disease developed in 8.2%, 1.8%, 0.9%, and 2.7% of patients. Growth abnormality was observed in 10 (20%) of the 50 pediatric patients. The use of a lower dose (< 12 Gy vs 12 Gy) of fractionated total body irradiation did not decrease the incidence of adverse events; however, nonmyeloablative conditioning with low-dose singlefraction total body irradiation reduced the incidence of adverse events. Three patients who underwent total body irradiation as reirradiation therapy achieved long-term survival without adverse events.

Hence, to study the influence of the structure and size of the ligand on biological behavior of metal complexes, two water-soluble Pd(II) complexes of phen and FIP ligands (where phen is 1,10-phenanthroline and FIP is 2-(Furan-2-yl)-1H-Imidazo[4,5-f][1, 10]phenanthroline) with the formula of [Pd(phen)(FIP)](NO3)2 and [Pd(FIP)2]Cl2, that were activated against chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562, were selected. Also, the interaction of these anticancer Pd(II) complexes with highly polymerized calf thymus DNA was extensively studied by means of electronic absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism in Tris-buffer. The results showed that the binding was positive cooperation and [Pd(phen)(FIP)](NO3)2 (K f = 127 M(-1) G = 1.2) exhibited higher binding constant and number of binding sites than [Pd(FIP)2]Cl2 (K f = 13 M(-1) G = 1.03) upon binding to DNA.

The following BTLA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs2705511, rs1982809, rs9288952, rs76844316, rs16859633, rs9288953, rs2705535, rs1844089, rs2705565, rs2633580 were genotyped with use of TaqMan probes in 321 CLL pts. and in 470 controls. The mRNA levels of human BTLA were determined in subpopulations of T and B cells from 37 CLL patients with use of Applied Biosystems assays. Three SNPs: rs1982809, rs2705511 and rs9288953 were associated with susceptibility to CLL. The frequency of rs1982809[G] allele and rs2705511[C] allele carriers was higher in patients compared to the controls (0.51 vs. 0.41, OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.14-2.02, p = 0.004 and 0.56 vs. 0.44, OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.22-2.16, p = 0.0009, respectively). Furthermore, rs9288953[TT] genotype was overrepresented in CLL pts. compared to the controls (0.22 vs. 0.14, OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.20-2.53, p = 0.004). The evaluation of the influence of BTLA SNPs on BTLA mRNA expression in CLL pts. showed that the presence of rs1982809[G] allele was associated with lower median (+/-SD) BTLA mRNA expression in T cells (expressed as 2-delta Ct) in CLL pts. as compared to [AA] homozygotes (0.009 +/- 0.013 vs. 0.026 +/- 0.012, p = 0.03).

Using CARs, antitumor activity can be initiated in patients with no prior tumor specific immunity. Although CARs have shown promising clinical results, the technology remains limited by the availability of specific cognate cell target antigens. To increase the repertoire of targetable tumor cell antigens we utilized the immune system of the sea lamprey to generate directed variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs). VLRs serve as membrane bound and soluble immune effectors analogous but not homologous to immunoglobulins. They have a fundamentally different structure than immunoglobulin (Ig)-based antibodies while still demonstrating high degrees of specificity and affinity. To test the functionality of VLRs as the antigen recognition domain of CARs, two VLR-CARs were created. One contained a VLR specific for a murine B cell leukemia and the other contained a VLR specific for the human T cell surface antigen, CD5. The CAR design consisted of the VLR sequence, myc-epitope tag, CD28 transmembrane domain, and intracellular CD3zeta signaling domain. We demonstrate proof of concept, including gene transfer, biosynthesis, cell surface localization, and effector cell activation for multiple VLR-CAR designs.

To date, nearly 100 IL-12-based clinical trials have been initiated worldwide. Yet systemic administration of IL-12 is toxic. Different strategies are being developed to reduce such toxicities by restricting IL-12 distribution. Our previous studies employed lentivector-mediated expression of murine IL-12 in tumor cells and demonstrated effective protection in both mouse leukemia and solid tumor challenge models. In this study, we carried out preclinical validation studies using a novel lentivector to engineer expression of human IL-12 in acute myeloid leukemia blast cells isolated from 21 patients. Acute myeloid leukemia cells were transduced with a bicistronic lentivector that encodes the human IL-12 cDNA as a fusion, as well as a LNGFR (DeltaLNGFR)/mutant thymidylate kinase cassette as a marking and cell-fate control element. A range of 20-70% functional transduction efficiencies was achieved. Transduced acute myeloid leukemia cells produced bioactive IL-12 protein and displayed dose-dependent sensitivity to the prodrug 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine. In vitro immortalization assays using transduced mouse hematopoietic stem cells demonstrated minimal genotoxic risk from our IL-12 vector. Scale-up transduction and cell processing was subsequently validated in a GMP facility to support our (now approved) Clinical Trial Application (CTA).",,"['Huang, Ju', 'Liu, Yuanfeng', 'Au, Bryan C', 'Barber, Dwayne L', 'Arruda, Andrea', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Rothe, Michael', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Paige, Christopher J', 'Medin, Jeffrey A']","['Huang J', 'Liu Y', 'Au BC', 'Barber DL', 'Arruda A', 'Schambach A', 'Rothe M', 'Minden MD', 'Paige CJ', 'Medin JA']","['University Health Network , Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University Health Network , Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University Health Network , Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Laboratory Medicine & Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University Health Network , Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School , Hannover, Germany.', 'University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,20161207,,PMC5142463,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a lack of antibodies recognizing canine NK cell markers has resulted in suboptimal characterization and unknown purity of NK cell products, hindering the development of canine models of NK cell adoptive immunotherapy. To this end, we generated a novel antibody to canine NCR1 (NKp46), the putative species-wide marker of NK cells, enabling purification of NK cells for further characterization. We demonstrate that CD3(-)/NKp46(+) cells in healthy and osteosarcoma-bearing canines have phenotypic similarity to human CD3(-)/NKp46(+) NK cells, expressing mRNA for CD16 and the natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44, and NKp80. Functionally, we demonstrate with the calcein release assay that canine CD3(-)/NKp46(+) cells kill canine tumor cell lines without prior sensitization and secrete IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-10, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as measured by Luminex. Similar to human NK cells, CD3(-)/NKp46(+) cells expand rapidly on feeder cells expressing 4-1BBL and membrane-bound IL-21 (median = 20,283-fold in 21 days). Furthermore, we identify a minor Null population (CD3(-)/CD21(-)/CD14(-)/NKp46(-)) with reduced cytotoxicity against osteosarcoma cells, but similar cytokine secretion as CD3(-)/NKp46(+) cells. Null cells in canines and humans have reduced expression of NKG2D, NKp44, and CD16 compared to NKp46(+) NK cells and can be induced to express NKp46 with further expansion on feeder cells. In conclusion, we have identified and characterized canine NK cells, including an NKp46(-) subset of canine and human NK cells, using a novel anti-canine NKp46 antibody, and report robust ex vivo expansion of canine NK cells sufficient for adoptive immunotherapy.",,"['Foltz, Jennifer A', 'Somanchi, Srinivas S', 'Yang, Yanwen', 'Aquino-Lopez, Arianexys', 'Bishop, Erin E', 'Lee, Dean A']","['Foltz JA', 'Somanchi SS', 'Yang Y', 'Aquino-Lopez A', 'Bishop EE', 'Lee DA']","['Department of Pediatrics-Research, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA; Health Science Center, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics-Research, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas , Houston, TX , USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics-Research, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas , Houston, TX , USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics-Research, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA; Health Science Center, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics-Research, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA; The University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics-Research, MD Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA; Health Science Center, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20161123,,PMC5120128,['NOTNLM'],"['NCR1', 'NKp46', 'canine', 'comparative oncology', 'immunotherapy', 'natural killer', 'osteosarcoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Dec 7.,,"BACKGROUND: In several studies, dioxin exposure has been associated with increased risk from several causes of death. AIMS: To compare the mortality experience of workers exposed to dioxins during trichlorophenol (TCP) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) production to that of the general population and to examine mortality risk by estimated exposure levels. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study which followed up workers' vital status from 1940 to 2011, with serum surveys to support estimation of historical dioxin exposure levels. RESULTS: Among the 2192 study subjects, there were nine deaths in TCP workers from acute non-lymphatic leukaemia [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 2.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-5.47], four mesothelioma deaths (SMR = 5.12, 95% CI 1.39-13.10) and four soft tissue sarcoma (STS) deaths (SMR = 3.08, 95% CI 0.84-7.87). In PCP workers, there were eight deaths from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SMR = 1.92, 95% CI 0.83-3.79), 150 from ischaemic heart disease (SMR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-7.89) and five from stomach ulcers (SMR = 3.38, 95% CI 1.10-7.89). There were no trends of increased mortality with increased dioxin exposure except for STS and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin levels. This finding for STS should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of deaths and the uncertainty in diagnosis and nosology. CONCLUSIONS: While some causes of death were greater than expected, this study provides little evidence of increased risk when dioxin exposures are considered.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Recent studies have revealed that enhancers are bi-directionally transcribed into enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Using single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH), we investigated the eRNA-mediated regulation of transcription during estrogen induction in MCF-7 cells. We demonstrate that eRNAs are localized exclusively in the nucleus and are induced with similar kinetics as target mRNAs. However, eRNAs are mostly nascent at enhancers and their steady-state levels remain lower than those of their cognate mRNAs. Surprisingly, at the single-allele level, eRNAs are rarely co-expressed with their target loci, demonstrating that active gene transcription does not require the continuous transcription of eRNAs or their accumulation at enhancers. When co-expressed, sub-diffraction distance measurements between nascent mRNA and eRNA signals reveal that co-transcription of eRNAs and mRNAs rarely occurs within closed enhancer-promoter loops. Lastly, basal eRNA transcription at enhancers, but not E2-induced transcription, is maintained upon depletion of MLL1 and ERalpha, suggesting some degree of chromatin accessibility prior to signal-dependent activation of transcription. Together, our findings suggest that eRNA accumulation at enhancer-promoter loops is not required to sustain target gene transcription.","['(c) The Author(s) 2016.

Patients receiving first-line or subsequent dasatinib or nilotinib who stopped therapy after at least 3 years of TKI treatment and in molecular response 4.5 (MR4.5) with undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcripts for the 2 preceding years at least were eligible for inclusion. This interim analysis reports outcomes of 60 patients with a minimum follow-up of 12 months (median 47, range: 12-65). Twenty-six patients (43.3%) experienced a molecular relapse defined as the loss of a major molecular response (MMR). Relapses occurred after a median time of 4 months (range: 1-38). Cumulative incidences of molecular relapse by 12 and 48 months were 35% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.79% to 49.41%) and 44.76% (95% CI, 33.35% to 59.91%), respectively. Treatment-free remission (TFR) rates at 12 and 48 months were 63.33% (95% CI, 51.14% to 75.53%) and 53.57% (95% CI, 40.49% to 66.65%), respectively. In univariate analysis, prior suboptimal response or TKI resistance was the only baseline factor associated with significantly worse outcome. A landmark analysis demonstrated that loss of MR4.5 3 months after stopping TKI was predictive of failure to maintain MMR later on. During the treatment-free phase, no progression toward advanced phase CML occurred, and all relapsing patients regained MMR and MR4.5 after restarting therapy. In conclusion, discontinuation of first-line or subsequent 2G-TKI yields promising TFR rates without safety concerns. Further research is encouraged to better define conditions that will offer patients the highest chance to remain free from 2G-TKI therapy.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Rea, Delphine', 'Nicolini, Franck E', 'Tulliez, Michel', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Guilhot, Joelle', 'Guerci-Bresler, Agnes', 'Gardembas, Martine', 'Coiteux, Valerie', 'Guillerm, Gaelle', 'Legros, Laurence', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'Pignon, Jean-Michel', 'Villemagne, Bruno', 'Escoffre-Barbe, Martine', 'Ianotto, Jean-Christophe', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Johnson-Ansah, Hyacinthe', 'Noel, Marie-Pierre', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier']","['Rea D', 'Nicolini FE', 'Tulliez M', 'Guilhot F', 'Guilhot J', 'Guerci-Bresler A', 'Gardembas M', 'Coiteux V', 'Guillerm G', 'Legros L', 'Etienne G', 'Pignon JM', 'Villemagne B', 'Escoffre-Barbe M', 'Ianotto JC', 'Charbonnier A', 'Johnson-Ansah H', 'Noel MP', 'Rousselot P', 'Mahon FX']","[""Service d'Hematologie Adulte and INSERM UMRS-1160, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite and INSERM 1052, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Lyon, Lyon, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Henri Mondor, Creteil, France."", 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU de Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM CIC 1402, CHU de Poitiers, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU Brabois, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France."", ""Service des Maladies du Sang, CHRU d'Angers, France."", 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Huriez, CHRU de Lille, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Morvan, CHRU de Brest, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital de l'Archet, CHU de Nice, France."", 'Centre Regional de Lutte Contre le Cancer de Bordeaux et du Sud-Ouest, Bordeaux, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier de Dunkerque, France."", 'Service de Medecine Onco-Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Departemental Vendee, La Roche sur Yon, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Adulte, CHU de Rennes, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Morvan, CHRU de Brest, France."", ""Service d'Onco-Hematologie, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU de Caen, France; and."", 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital Huriez, CHRU de Lille, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Oncologie et INSERM UMR-1173, Centre Hospitalier de Versailles, Le Chesnay, France."", 'Centre Regional de Lutte Contre le Cancer de Bordeaux et du Sud-Ouest, Bordeaux, France.']",,20161208,"['Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2017 Apr;14 (4):201-202.

The mechanisms of these observations and the kinds of patients they apply to are unclear. Using an in vitro model of the pseudofollicles where CLL cells originate, LDLs were found to increase plasma membrane cholesterol, signaling molecules such as tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3, and activated CLL cell numbers. The signaling effects of LDLs were not seen in normal lymphocytes or glycolytic lymphoma cell-lines but were restored by transduction with the nuclear receptor PPARdelta, which mediates metabolic activity in CLL cells. Breakdown of LDLs in lysosomes was required for the amplification effect, which correlated with down-regulation of HMGCR expression and long lymphocyte doubling times (LDTs) of 53.6+/-10.4months. Cholesterol content of circulating CLL cells correlated directly with blood LDL levels in a subgroup of patients. These observations suggest LDLs may enhance proliferative responses of CLL cells to inflammatory signals. Prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic potential of lowering LDL concentrations in CLL, particularly in patients with indolent disease in the ""watch-and-wait"" phase of management.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

However, most of the mammalian PREs are demonstrated to interact with the repressive polycomb (PcG) complexes only. We have carried out an unbiased search for proteins interacting with human PRE-PIK3C2B (hPRE-PIK3C2B) based on DNA affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry and identified MLL, MLL4 and WDR87 among other proteins in three biological replicates in HEK, U87 and HeLa cell lines. The hPRE-PIK3C2B interacts with the members of multiple activating complexes (COMPASS-like). The increase in the interaction of MLL and MLL4 on depletion of YY1 and the increase in the enrichment of YY1 and EZH2 upon MLL knockdown at the hPRE-PIK3C2B indicate the dual occupancy and suggest a concentration dependent enrichment of the activator or the repressor complex at hPRE-PIK3C2B. Further, we show that the hPRE-PIK3C2B interacts with the Drosophila homologues of PcG and TrxG proteins in transgenic flies. Here, we found that there is an increased enrichment of Pc (Polycomb) in comparison to Trx (TrxG protein) at hPRE-PIK3C2B in the Drosophila transgenic flies and this seems to be the default state while the balance is tipped towards the trithorax complex in PcG mutants.

However, there have been no reports of late graft failure (LGF) due to graft rejection in association with oligoclonal LGL expansion. We herein report a case of LGF associated with the transient expansion of recipient-derived T-LGL after allo-SCT. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old man underwent peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from his human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical son for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, which had evolved from a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Neutrophil engraftment occurred on day 20. A chimerism analysis on day 29 showed both granulocytes and mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood to be completely of donor origin. However, his neutrophil count gradually decreased and a chimerism analysis on day 61 showed that 84% of the patient's T cells were of recipient origin while the granulocytes were 100% donor-derived. His LGLs rapidly increased to 4.01 x 10(9)/L on day 113 and decreased thereafter. The percentage of donor cells in his granulocytes gradually decreased, and the patient's leukocytes were completely replaced by recipient cells on day 177. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course suggests that the expansion of recipient-derived T-LGLs after allo-SCT can be a sign of graft rejection. Early intervention may be needed if the LGL expansion is recipient-derived.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We present the case of a successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation in a patient who relapsed after a first allogeneic stem cell transplantation for myelodysplastic syndrome and who had previously undergone renal transplantation. The prophylaxis in this case for graft-versus-host disease and rejection of the transplanted kidney was mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus. No hyperacute rejection of the transplanted kidney was observed. However, the patient's renal function deteriorated after the cessation of the mycophenolate mofetil and the reduction of the tacrolimus. This deterioration seemed to be due to rejection with humoral immunity of donor lymphocytes, and we were able to control it by resuming the mycophenolate mofetil and local graft irradiation.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

NK cell function is regulated by killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and it has been described that donor KIR genotype influences transplantation outcome. This has led to a requirement of laboratories to have a quality assurance program for validation and control of their KIR genotyping methods. The goal of the 1st and 2nd Spanish KIR Genotyping Workshops was to provide an external proficiency testing program in KIR genotyping for Spanish immunology and transplant laboratories. These workshops were conducted during the years 2014-2016 and consisted of 17 participating laboratories typing a set of 20 samples. The presence/absence of 16 mandatory KIR loci (2DL1, 2DL2, 2DL3, 2DL4, 2DL5, 2DS1, 2DS2, 2DS3, 2DS4, 2DS5, 2DP1, 3DL1, 3DL2, 3DL3, 3DS1, and 3DP1) was evaluated per sample. Methods for KIR genotyping included polymerase chain reaction with the use of sequence-specific primers and sequence-specific oligoprobes. Consensus typing was reached in all samples, and the performance of laboratories in external proficiency testing was satisfactory in all cases. The polymorphism detected in the small sample studied in both workshops is indicative of an ample variety of KIR gene profiles in the Spanish population.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we demonstrated that RARalpha protein was frequently overexpressed in human CRC specimens and CRC cell lines. RARalpha knockdown decreased cell survival, proliferation, and colony formation in vitro and tumorigenic potential in nude mice. Specifically, RARalpha knockdown inhibited cell cycle progression at G1 phase through upregulation of cell cycle inhibitor p21, and downregulation of cyclinD1. Furthermore, RARalpha was directly recruited to the p21 promoter to inhibit the expression of p21. Simultaneously, RARalpha contributed to the progression of CRC cells in part due to upregulation of cyclinD1 via activation of GSK3beta/beta-catenin pathway. Molecular mechanism studies revealed RARalpha interacted with GSK3beta and led to decreased expression of GSK3beta at ser9, followed by increased beta-catenin expression. Taken together, our results signified the importance of RARalpha in CRC and demonstrated that RARalpha promotes CRC progression through suppressing p21 transcription and enhancing GSK3beta/beta-catenin signaling.

STUDY DESIGN: Ecological study. METHODS: Data for urinary bladder, thyroid and leukaemia were abstracted from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry (PCR). Cancer incidence among counties with high, moderate and minimal number of producing wells is compared before drilling activity and thereafter. Observed vs expected cases, standardized incidence ratio and 95% confidence intervals are presented. Data are presented by county, diagnosis and sex for the years 2000-2004, 2004-2008 and 2008-2012. The percent difference between the observed cases from 2000 to 2004 and 2008-2012 was calculated. RESULTS: The observed number of urinary bladder cases was higher than expected in both sexes in counties with shale gas activity. In counties with the fewest number of producing wells, the increase was essentially non-existent. The number of observed cases of thyroid cancer increased substantially among both sexes over the time period in all counties regardless of the number of wells drilled. The pattern for leukaemia was mixed among males and females and among the counties regardless of the extent of shale gas development activities. CONCLUSION: Potential risk factors other than shale gas development must be taken into account to explain the higher than expected cancer cases in counties with and without shale gas wells before and during unconventional shale gas activity.","['Copyright A(c) 2016 The Royal Society for Public Health.

While functioning as the most effective antigen-presenting cells within the immune system, DCs can otherwise induce tolerance in central and peripheral lymphoid organs acting therefore as suppressors rather than stimulators of the immune response. Within mechanisms regulating antitumor immunity, DCs can capture antigens from viable or damaged tumor cells and present the processed peptides to T-cells to prompt the generation and maintenance of an effective tumor-specific T-cell response. Upon a complex cross-talk with other cellular components of the tumor microenvironment, DCs can, on the other hand, exert a potent antigen-dependent and -independent tolerogenic function by favoring the process of tumor immune evasion. Due to this dual-role in balancing antitumor immunity and tolerance, possibly linked to distinct developmental stages and functional subsets, several studies have addressed the regulatory significance of DCs in different types of malignancies. This review summarizes the most significant pieces of evidence highlighting the critical relevance of bone marrow-derived DCs within the immune pathways regulating pathogenesis and progression of hemopoietic tumors.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This multicenter phase 1/2 study evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and clinical activity of pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) and other advanced myeloid malignancies. METHODS: In the phase 1 dose-escalation part of the study, 43 adults with advanced myeloid malignancies received pacritinib 100 to 600 mg once daily (QD). In the phase 2 part of the study, 31 adults with refractory or intermediate- or high-risk newly diagnosed MF and any degree of cytopenia received pacritinib 400 mg QD. The primary endpoint is a >/=35% reduction in spleen volume at week 24 as determined by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Five patients (11.6%) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity during cycle 1 of phase 1. The clinical benefit rate was 86.0% (13 patients achieving clinical improvement and 24 patients having stable disease). The MTD was established at 500 mg QD, and the recommended phase 2 dose was 400 mg QD. In phase 2, the primary endpoint was achieved by 23.5% of evaluable patients (4/17), with 47.4% (9/19) achieving a >/=50% spleen length reduction at week 24 as measured by physical examination. At week 24, 38.9% of evaluable patients (7/18) achieved a >/=50% decrease in MF Quality of Life and Symptom Assessment total score. Gastrointestinal toxicities were the most common adverse events and were predominantly grade 1/2 in severity. Grade 3/4 anemia was reported in 5/31 patients and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 3/31 patients. The most frequent AEs considered to be treatment related were diarrhea (28/31), nausea (15/31), vomiting (9/31), and fatigue (4/31). Grade 3 treatment-related AEs were reported in seven patients (22.6%), four of whom had diarrhea. No grade 4/5 treatment-related AEs were reported. No leukopenia, neutropenia, or lymphopenia were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Pacritinib was well tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity in MF. The study suggests that pacritinib has unique characteristics, namely a lack of substantial myelosuppression and manageable side effects, making it an attractive target for further evaluation in MF.

Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) is an important regulator of cell survival and chemo-resistance in a wide range of malignancies, and thus its inhibition may prove to be therapeutically useful. METHODS: To examine whether targeting MCL-1 may provide an effective treatment for breast cancer, we constructed inducible models of BIMs2A expression (a specific MCL-1 inhibitor) in MDA-MB-468 (MDA-MB-468-2A) and MDA-MB-231 (MDA-MB-231-2A) cells. RESULTS: MCL-1 inhibition caused apoptosis of basal-like MDA-MB-468-2A cells grown as monolayers, and sensitized them to the BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor ABT-263, demonstrating that MCL-1 regulated cell survival. In MDA-MB-231-2A cells, grown in an organotypic model, induction of BIMs2A produced an almost complete suppression of invasion. Apoptosis was induced in such a small proportion of these cells that it could not account for the large decrease in invasion, suggesting that MCL-1 was operating via a previously undetected mechanism. MCL-1 antagonism also suppressed local invasion and distant metastasis to the lung in mouse mammary intraductal xenografts. Kinomic profiling revealed that MCL-1 antagonism modulated Src family kinases and their targets, which suggested that MCL-1 might act as an upstream modulator of invasion via this pathway. Inhibition of MCL-1 in combination with dasatinib suppressed invasion in 3D models of invasion and inhibited the establishment of tumors in vivo. CONCLUSION: These data provide the first evidence that MCL-1 drives breast cancer cell invasion and suggests that MCL-1 antagonists could be used alone or in combination with drugs targeting Src kinases such as dasatinib to suppress metastasis.",,"['Young, Adelaide I J', 'Law, Andrew M K', 'Castillo, Lesley', 'Chong, Sabrina', 'Cullen, Hayley D', 'Koehler, Martin', 'Herzog, Sebastian',

Here, we treated various types of cancer using musk to determine which cancers are sensitive to musk treatment. We also compared effects of native musk and synthetic musk ketone in cancer cells. Furthermore, we investigated mechanisms underlying effects of musk. METHODS: Twenty two cancer cell lines were treated with musk. Cell proliferation and apoptosis analyses were carried out. Native musk and synthetic musk ketone were analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) assay. Differentially expressed genes were determined by microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Native musk strongly induced the growth repression and the apoptosis in the majority of cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, but distinct types of cancer showed significantly different reactions. Cancer cells which originated from epithelial cells showed higher sensitivity for musk treatment. By contrast, leukaemia and lymphoma cells were not sensitive. GC-MS analysis demonstrated that native musk contains more than 30 contents in which musk ketone is a major component; synthetic musk ketone was consistent with natural musk ketone, and the used sample of synthetic musk ketone contained only sole component. Similar to native musk, synthetic musk ketone induced the growth repression and the apoptosis of cancer cells. Additionally, numerous genes were differentially expressed in lung cancer cells after native musk treatment. These differentially expressed genes were involved in many signalling pathways. Among these pathways, apoptosis-related pathways included interleukin family, tumor necrosis factor family, and MAPK signalling pathway. Native musk and synthetic musk ketone can up-regulate IL-24 (interleukin family) and DDIT3 (MAPK signalling pathway) in lung cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: This research provided strong evidence that native musk and synthetic musk ketone can induce the growth repression and the apoptosis of cancer cells. However, the selection of sensitive cancer patient for individualized treatment is a key step in clinical application. Synthetic musk ketone can substitute for native musk to treat cancer patients. Musk might induce the growth repression and the apoptosis of lung cancer cells through up-regulating IL-24 and DDIT3 expressions.",,"['Xu, Ling', 'Cao, Yi']","['Xu L', 'Cao Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Experimental Pathology, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 32 Jiaochang Donglu, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Experimental Pathology, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 32 Jiaochang Donglu, Kunming, Yunnan, 650223, China. caoy@mail.kiz.ac.cn.']",,20161208,,PMC5146870,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cancer', 'DDIT3', 'Differentially expressed gene', 'IL-24', 'Musk', 'Musk ketone', 'Proliferation', 'Traditional Chinese medicine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may be due to BCR-ABL-independent, aberrant signaling pathways, one of which leads to leukotriene (LT) formation. Well-recognized as inflammatory mediators, LT can also affect oncogenic mechanisms of several tumors. We have previously discovered elevated LT-synthesis and up-regulated cysteinyl-LT-inducing enzyme in CML. Here we report on dose-dependent inhibition of CML cell growth exerted by specific blockers of LT-signaling. Thus, the cysteinyl-LT1-receptor-antagonist montelukast significantly reduced the growth of K562, KCL22, and KU812 cells, as well as primary CD34(+) blood cells from two CML patients.

Individuals with DS may experience multiple comorbid health problems including congenital heart defects, endocrine abnormalities, skin and dental problems, seizure disorders, leukemia, dementia, and obesity. These associated conditions may necessitate pharmacotherapeutic management with various drugs. The complex pathobiology of DS may alter drug disposition and drug response in some individuals. For example, reports have documented increased rates of adverse drug reactions in patients with DS treated for leukemia and dementia. Intellectual disability resulting from DS may impact adherence to medication regimens. In this review, we highlight literature focused on pharmacotherapy for individuals with DS. We discuss reports of altered drug disposition or response in patients with DS and explore social factors that may impact medication adherence in the DS setting. Enhanced monitoring during drug therapy in individuals with DS is justified based on reports of altered drug disposition, drug response, and other characteristics present in this population.","['(c) 2016 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']","['Hefti, Erik', 'Blanco, Javier G']","['Hefti E', 'Blanco JG']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York.']","['R01 GM073646/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 HD076055/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",20170113,,PMC5310973,['NOTNLM'],"['*Down syndrome', '*adverse drug reactions', '*gene dosage effect', '*leukemia', '*medication adherence', '*pharmacotherapeutics', '*seizure disorder', '*trisomy 21']",,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0358-2539'],,['NIHMS818636'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to identify how total sleep deprivation affects cytokine levels. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 48 h of total sleep deprivation produced by brief rotation of activity wheels or 3 different controls: home cage, a sedentary wheel, or forced activity. In addition, the serum levels of cytokines were analyzed using a mouse magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassay. RESULTS: The concentrations of some cytokines (fibroblast growth factor-basic [FGF-basic], leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF], and monokine induced by interferon-gamma [MIG]) decreased significantly after total sleep deprivation. However, other cytokines (macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, platelet-derived growth factor-bb, vascular endothelial growth factor) did not show any significant difference. Serum corticosterone levels did not differ significantly among the groups. CONCLUSION: The biochemical mechanisms responsible for sleep regulation are very complex. These results suggest the involvement of 3 cytokines (FGF-basic, LIF, and MIG) in sleep/wake regulation.","['(c) 2016 S.

We assessed the clinical feasibility of using combined HTS and bioinformatics analysis with interactive visualization using Vidjil software. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of HTS for monitoring MRD.

However, the correlation between each subcellular localization of beta-catenin and the prognosis of CRC patients remains undetermined. METHODS: Systematic strategies were applied to search for eligible published studies in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The correlation between each subcellular localizations of beta-catenin expression and patients' clinicopathological features or prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: Finally, this meta-analysis, including 6238 cases from 34 studies, revealed that beta-catenin overexpression in the nucleus (HR: 1.50[95% CI: 1.08-2.10]) or reduced expression of beta-catenin in the membrane (HR: 1.33[95% CI: 1.15-1.54]) significantly correlated with lower 5-year overall survival (OS). Conversely, overexpression of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm (HR: 1.00[95% CI: 0.85-1.18]) did not show significant association with 5-year OS. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that beta-catenin overexpression in the nucleus or reduced expression in the membrane, but not its overexpression in cytoplasm, could serve as a valuable prognostic predictor for CRC.

In addition, extensive sequencing studies have identified recurrent mutations with diagnostic and prognostic impact. Thus, the revised version of the WHO classification combines therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes (t-MDS) and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) in the one entity of t-MNs because of their similar pathogenesis, rapid progression from t-MDS to t-AML, and their equally poor prognosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Fifteen percent of t-AML patients present with favorable risk fusion genes, whereas 50% have adverse cytogenetics. The most frequent molecular aberration in t-AML and t-MDS affects TP53 (33%). Selection of a pre-existing treatment-resistant hematopoietic stem cell clone with TP53 mutation has been shown as an important mechanism in the development of t-MNs and explains the high frequency of TP53 mutations in these patients. Following previous cytotoxic therapy, patients develop specific vulnerabilities, which become especially evident as high nonrelapse mortality of t-MN patients after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. SUMMARY: Patients are treated according to their genetic risk profile. Assessment of minimal residual disease helps to guide allogeneic transplantation for patients with favorable risk and genetic markers.",,"['Ganser, Arnold', 'Heuser, Michael']","['Ganser A', 'Heuser M']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examine the evidence regarding optimal postremission treatment strategy for such patients. RECENT FINDINGS: With chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy/autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), disease recurrence appears inevitable in patients with MRD CR1. Nonrandomized studies indicate that allogeneic HCT improves outcomes over chemotherapy and/or autologous HCT, although relapse risks remain substantial. Emerging data suggest that myeloablative cord blood HCT may overcome the negative impact of MRD to a greater degree than other transplants, but the relative contributions of intensified conditioning and stem cell source to this effect are unknown. SUMMARY: Available evidence supports the recommendation to consider allogeneic HCT for all acute myeloid leukemia patients in MRD CR1. Whether cord blood transplants should be prioritized deserves further investigation. To what degree outcomes of MRD CR1 patients could be improved by treatment intensification during induction, postremission therapy and/or before transplantation to revert the patient into an MRD state is currently unknown, as is the value of post-transplant preemptive therapies.

Despite the significant progress in current treatment, challenges remain the lifelong morbidity after current chemotherapy regimens and postrelapse survival. In addition, patients with T-ALL have inferior outcomes compared with those with B-cell precursor; consequently, novel therapeutic approaches are still necessary to improve the outcome in this cohort. YM155 is an imidazolium derivative originally discovered as a suppressant of survivin expression. It has been reported that YM155 has potent antiproliferative activity on a variety of human cancer cell lines; however, its effects in T-ALL cells have been underexplored. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of YM155 on p53-deficient T-ALL cell lines, JURKAT and CCRF-CEM. Resazurin dye was used to evaluate cell viability. Colony formation was observed in MethoCult methylcellulose medium. Apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry (annexin V labeling and TUNEL assay). Cell cycle analysis was carried out by DNA quantification in flow cytometry. DNA damage was assessed using a comet assay and the survivin expression profile was evaluated by real-time PCR and immunoblotting. YM155 treatment decreased cell viability and clonogenicity capacity of T-ALL cells, increased the apoptosis index and DNA damage, and altered the cell cycle dynamic, independent of survivin inhibition. Taken together, the data reinforce that YM155 may be useful as a therapeutic possibility to combat leukemia.",,"['Sales, Leilane', 'de Sousa, Graziella R', 'Ferreira-Silva, Guilherme A', 'Castro-Gamero, Angel M', 'Ionta, Marisa', 'de Oliveira, Jaqueline C']","['Sales L', 'de Sousa GR', 'Ferreira-Silva GA', 'Castro-Gamero AM', 'Ionta M', 'de Oliveira JC']","['aInstitute of Natural Science bDepartment of Cell and Developmental Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Federal University of Alfenas, Alfenas, Minas Gerais, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are at risk for a diverse spectrum of cutaneous neutrophilic dermatoses such as EED. Herein, we report a 74-year-old man who presented with a large ulcerative, fungating tumor affecting the right flexor ankle caused by CLFLCV. During his workup and management, MDS and Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myeloid leukemia was diagnosed. Surgical excision of the inflammatory mass promptly triggered tumor recurrence, whereas antineutrophil therapy (dapsone coupled with hydroxyurea, and prednisone) lead to tumor regression. Histopathologic examination revealed an eosinophilic-rich small-vessel neutrophilic vasculitis associated with storiform and angiocentric fibrosis (GF-like). In the regions of fibrosis, dilated lymphatic and vascular spaces were numerous, some of which were congested with small CD3-positive lymphocytes (intralymphatic and intravascular lymphocytosis). These findings indicate coexisting localized lymphedema. By direct immunofluorescence, IgM and C4d vessel deposits were detected. The pathogenesis of the fibrotic nodules and plaques of CLFLCV is suspected to be due to recurring bouts of immune-complex vasculitis, creating a cycle of vessel damage followed by reparative granulation tissue. Poor lymphatic drainage may be the underlying factor initiating and maintaining recurrent, localized episodes of immune-complex vasculitis and progressive fibrosis. Although his tumor histopathology resembled GF-eosinophilic rich CLFLCV-the clinical context points to a solitary and paraneoplastic case of EED.",,"['Atallah, Juliana', 'Garces, Juan C', 'Loayza, Enrique', 'Carlson, John A']","['Atallah J', 'Garces JC', 'Loayza E', 'Carlson JA']","['*Department of Pathology, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY; and daggerDepartamento de Dermatologia, Area de Dermatopatologia, Hospital Luis Vernaza, Guayaquil, Ecuador.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acfs allows de novo, accurate and fast identification and abundance quantification of circRNAs from single- and paired-ended RNA-Seq data. On simulated datasets, acfs achieved the highest F1 accuracy and lowest false discovery rate among current state-of-the-art tools. On real-world datasets, acfs efficiently identified more bona fide circRNAs. Furthermore, we demonstrated the power of circRNA analysis on two leukemia datasets. We identified a set of circRNAs that are differentially expressed between AML and APL samples, which might shed light on the potential molecular classification of complex diseases using circRNA profiles. Moreover, chromosomal translocation, as manifested in numerous diseases, could produce not only fusion transcripts but also fusion circRNAs of clinical relevance.

Patients diagnosed with acute leukemia usually undergo chemotherapy, which involves the induction of remission, consolidation of remission and maintenance therapy. Patients are still vulnerable to relapse due to differences in the sensitivity of leukemia cells to the chemotherapeutic agent, because of the active drugs removal from the cells, improving the repair of DNA damage or abnormalities in the apoptotic pathway. Cell adhesion and miRNA expression level also affect the drug resistance. New candidate genes and genes correlated with the disease have been sought to increase the survival of patients with leukemia. Candidate gene is usually a loci located in a certain chromosomal region suspected of involvement to the disease course or its expression product regulates disease progression. There are classic and digital methods of finding candidate genes. These techniques are inexpensive, quick and easy to carry out. Unfortunately, due to insufficient knowledge of the disease etiology and low accuracy, researchers cannot detect all genes, involved in leukemogenesis and cell resistance. Currently, scientists have many tools used for selecting genes, such as expression microarrays, comparative genomic hybridization and next generation sequencing. Among the validation techniques for candidate genes, the mostly used ones are fluorescent in situ hybridization and real-time PCR. In our review we present 18 candidate genes of resistance to therapy in childhood leukemia.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Bereza, Weronika', 'Szczepanek, Joanna', 'Laskowska, Joanna', 'Tretyn, Andrzej']","['Bereza W', 'Szczepanek J', 'Laskowska J', 'Tretyn A']","['Department of Plant Physiology and Biotechnology, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Lwowska 1, 87-100 Torun, Poland.', 'Centre for Modern Interdisciplinary Technologies, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Wilenska 4, 87- 100 Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Plant Physiology and Biotechnology, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Lwowska 1, 87-100 Torun, Poland.', 'Centre for Modern Interdisciplinary Technologies, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Wilenska 4, 87-100 Torun, Poland.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Quantative trait loci (QTL)', '*biomarkers', '*genetic profiling', '*genome-wide association studies (GWAS)', '*linkage mapping approach', '*multidrug resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a 30-36 kDa type II transmembrane protein, expression of which is induced by type I interferon. Mouse tetherin inhibits nascent cell-free particle release. However, it is unclear whether mouse tetherin restricts cell-to-cell spread of moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) or whether is the mouse tetherin involved in syncytium formation. To examine cell-to-cell spread and syncytium formation of Mo-MLV in the presence or absence of mouse tetherin, R peptide (the cytoplasmic tail of the transmembrane protein (TM); 16 amino acids) truncated Env expressing vector was constructed. It contained enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the proline rich region (PRR) of Env. This R(-)Env full-length molecular clone could rule out virus-cell transmission due to the slightly reduced R(-)Env protein incorporation into the viral particles. When NIH3T3 cells stably expressing mouse tetherin were transfected with R(-)Env full-length molecular clone, syncytium formation was significantly enhanced in the tetherin-expressing cells. These data suggest that tetherin-mediated retention of R-defective virions on the cell surface could enhance syncytium formation.

IgVH mutational status distinguishes two major types of CLL, each associated with a different prognosis and survival. Sequencing identified NOTCH1 and SF3B1 as the two main recurrent mutations. We described a novel method to clarify how these mutations affect gene expression by finding small-scale signatures that predict the IgVH, NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations. We subsequently defined the biological pathways and correlation networks involved in disease development, with the potential goal of identifying new drugable targets. METHODS: We modeled a microarray dataset consisting of 48807 probes derived from 163 samples. The use of Fisher's ratio and fold change combined with feature elimination allowed us to identify the minimum number of genes with the highest predictive mutation power and, subsequently, we applied network and pathway analyses of these genes to identify their biological roles. RESULTS: The mutational status of the patients was accurately predicted (94-99%) using small-scale gene signatures: 13 genes for IgVH, 60 for NOTCH1 and 22 for SF3B1. LPL plays an important role in the case of the IgVH mutation, whereas MSI2, LTK, TFEC and CNTAP2 are involved in the NOTCH1 mutation, and RPL32 and PLAGL1 are involved in the SF3B1 mutation. Four high discriminatory genes (IGHG1, MYBL1, NRIP1 and RGS1) are common to these three mutations. The IL-4-mediated signaling events pathway appears to be involved as a common mechanism and suggests an important role of the immune response mechanisms and antigen presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis served to provide a deeper understanding of the effects of the different mutations in CLL disease progression, with the expectation that these findings will be clinically applied in the near future to the development of new drugs.","['Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Fernandez-Martinez, Juan Luis', 'deAndres-Galiana, Enrique J', 'Sonis, Stephen T']","['Fernandez-Martinez JL', 'deAndres-Galiana EJ', 'Sonis ST']","['Group of Inverse Problems, Optimization and Machine Learning, Department of Mathematics, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.', 'Group of Inverse Problems, Optimization and Machine Learning, Department of Mathematics, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.', 'Artificial Intelligence Center, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.', 'Biomodels LLC, Watertown, MA, USA.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'gene expression', 'hematologic', 'leukemia', 'mathematical modeling', 'oncology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NLRP3 inflammasome as a component of immune system has been found related to several cancers. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NLRP3 inflammasome genes may be related to pathogenesis and prognosis of AML. METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined polymorphisms of NLRP3 (rs35829419), CARD8 (rs2043211), IL-1beta (rs16944), IL-18 (rs1946518) and NF-kappaB -94 ins/del ATTG in de novo AML patients to find out whether they play roles in the susceptibility and severity of AML. In our study, 383 AML cases and 300 randomly selected healthy individuals were examined for the polymorphisms and expression of NLRP3 genes. IL-1beta (rs16944) polymorphism in different risk AML subgroups was found statistically different, with more GA genotype in favorable-risk cytogenetics group. We also demonstrated that the bone marrow blasts of patients carrying IL-18 (rs1946518) GG or GT genotype were higher than patients of TT genotype. IL-18 plasma level of patients with IL-18 (rs1946518) GT or TT genotype was higher than GG genotype. Moreover, the GT genotype of IL-18 (rs1946518) led to statistically poorer AML-specific survival.

Moreover, even for such diseases, few methods are available to predict whether drug administration is effective for each individual patient whose disease is expected to respond to the drug(s). We have previously developed a biosensor based on the principle of Forster resonance energy transfer to measure the activity of the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL and its response to drug treatment in patient-derived chronic myeloid leukemia cells. The biosensor harbors CrkL, one of the major substrates of BCR-ABL, and is therefore named Pickles after phosphorylation indicator of CrkL en substrate. The efficacy of this technique as a clinical test has been demonstrated, but the number of cells available for analysis is limited in a case-dependent manner, owing to the cleavage of the biosensor in patient-derived leukemia cells. Here, we describe an improved biosensor with an amino acid substitution and a nuclear export signal being introduced. Of the two predicted cleavage positions in CrkL, the mutations inhibited one cleavage completely and the other cleavage partially, thus collectively increasing the number of cells available for drug evaluation. This improved version of the biosensor holds promise in the future development of companion diagnostics to predict responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.",,"['Horiguchi, Mika', 'Fujioka, Mari', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Fujioka, Yoichiro', 'Li, Xinxin', 'Horiuchi, Kosui', 'O Satoh, Aya', 'Nepal, Prabha', 'Nishide, Shinya', 'Nanbo, Asuka', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Ohba, Yusuke']","['Horiguchi M', 'Fujioka M', 'Kondo T', 'Fujioka Y', 'Li X', 'Horiuchi K', 'O Satoh A', 'Nepal P', 'Nishide S', 'Nanbo A', 'Teshima T', 'Ohba Y']","['Department of Cell Physiology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine.']",,20161208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Dec 7.,10.3324/haematol.2016.148510 [doi],"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is increasingly used as treatment for patients with life-threatening blood diseases. Its curative potential is largely based on immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia effects caused by donor T cells contained in the graft. Unfortunately, donor T cells are also the cause of graft-versus-host disease. The vast majority of human leukocyte antigen-matched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants are nowadays carried out with peripheral blood stem cells as the stem cell source. In comparison with bone marrows, peripheral blood stem cells contain more hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells but also one log more T cells. Consequently, the use of peripheral blood stem cells instead of bone marrow has been associated with faster hematologic recovery and a lower risk of relapse in patients with advanced disease, but also with a higher incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease. These observations have been the basis for several studies aimed at assessing the impact of immunoregulation with anti-thymocyte globulin on transplantation outcomes in patients given human leukocyte antigen-matched peripheral blood stem cells from related or unrelated donors. After a brief introduction on anti-thymocyte globulin, this article reviews recent studies assessing the impact of anti-thymocyte globulin on transplantation outcomes in patients given peripheral blood stem cells from human leukocyte antigen-matched related or unrelated donors as well as in recipients of grafts from human leukocyte antigen haploidentical donors.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Baron, Frederic', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Gorin, Norbert Claude', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Baron F', 'Mohty M', 'Blaise D', 'Socie G', 'Labopin M', 'Esteve J', 'Ciceri F', 'Giebel S', 'Gorin NC', 'Savani BN', 'Schmid C', 'Nagler A']","['Giga-Hematology University of Liege, Belgium f.baron@ulg.ac.be.', 'Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre & Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMRs U938, Paris, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, CRCM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'AP-HP, Hematology Transplantation, Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMRs U938, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Ospedale San Raffaele, Universita degli Studi, Milano, Italy.', 'Maria Sklodowska-Curie Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Long term Transplant Clinic, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Klinikum Augsburg, Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Munich, Augsburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'EBMT Paris Office, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.']",,20161207,,PMC5286931,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-cell functions also depend on co-signaling receptors, inhibitory or stimulatory, known as immune checkpoints, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1). Here we analyzed the T-cell phenotype focusing on immune checkpoints and activation markers in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (n=80) with different clinical characteristics and compared them to healthy controls. In general, patients had higher absolute numbers of CD3(+) cells and the CD8(+) subset was particularly expanded in previously treated patients. Progressive patients had higher numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells expressing PD-1 compared to healthy controls, which was more pronounced in previously treated patients (P=0.0003 and P=0.001, respectively). A significant increase in antigen-experienced T cells was observed in patients within both the CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets, with a significantly higher PD-1 expression. Higher numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells with intracellular CTLA-4 were observed in patients, as well as high numbers of proliferating (Ki67(+)) and activated (CD69(+)) CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, more pronounced in patients with active disease. The numbers of Th1, Th2, Th17 and regulatory T cells were substantially increased in patients compared to controls (P<0.05), albeit decreasing to low levels in pre-treated patients. In conclusion, chronic lymphocytic leukemia T cells display increased expression of immune checkpoints, abnormal subset distribution, and a higher proportion of proliferating cells compared to healthy T cells.

Rebastinib was identified as a switch control inhibitor of BCR-ABL1 and FLT3 and may be active against resistant mutations. A Phase 1, first-in-human, single-agent study investigated rebastinib in relapsed or refractory chronic or acute myeloid leukemia. The primary objectives were to investigate the safety of rebastinib and establish the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose. Fifty-seven patients received treatment with rebastinib. Sixteen patients were treated using powder-in-capsule preparations at doses from 57 mg to 1200 mg daily, and 41 received tablet preparations at doses of 100 mg to 400 mg daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were dysarthria, muscle weakness, and peripheral neuropathy. The maximum tolerated dose was 150 mg tablets administered twice daily. Rebastinib was rapidly absorbed. Bioavailability was 3- to 4-fold greater with formulated tablets compared to unformulated capsules. Eight complete hematologic responses were achieved in 40 evaluable chronic myeloid leukemia patients, 4 of which had a T315I mutation. None of the 5 patients with acute myeloid leukemia responded. Pharmacodynamic analysis showed inhibition of phosphorylation of substrates of BCR-ABL1 or FLT3 by rebastinib. Although clinical activity was observed, clinical benefit was insufficient to justify continued development in chronic or acute myeloid leukemia. Pharmacodynamic analyses suggest that other kinases inhibited by rebastinib, such as TIE2, may be more relevant targets for the clinical development of rebastinib (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:00827138).",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Cortes, Jorge', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Smith, Hedy P', 'Snyder, David S', 'Khoury, Jean', 'Bhalla, Kapil N', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Larson, Richard', 'Mitchell, David', 'Wise, Scott C', 'Rutkoski, Thomas J', 'Smith, Bryan D', 'Flynn, Daniel L', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Rosen, Oliver', 'Van Etten, Richard A']","['Cortes J', 'Talpaz M', 'Smith HP', 'Snyder DS', 'Khoury J', 'Bhalla KN', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Larson R', 'Mitchell D', 'Wise SC', 'Rutkoski TJ', 'Smith BD', 'Flynn DL', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Rosen O', 'Van Etten RA']","['University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA jcortes@mdanderson.org.', 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'H.

Natural killer (NK) cells mediate important innate immunity that provides a temporal bridge until the reconstruction of adaptive immunity. Here, we show that the development of GVHD after allo-BMT prevented NK-cell reconstitution, particularly within the maturing M1 and M2 NK-cell subsets in association with exaggerated activation, apoptosis, and autophagy. Donor T cells were critical in this process by limiting the availability of interleukin 15 (IL-15), and administration of IL-15/IL-15Ralpha or immune suppression with rapamycin could restore NK-cell reconstitution. Importantly, the NK-cell defect induced by GVHD resulted in the failure of NK-cell-dependent in vivo cytotoxicity and graft-versus-leukemia effects. Control of cytomegalovirus infection after allo-BMT was also impaired during GVHD.

We did this study to investigate whether chemotherapy-treated patients with cancer who have CHIP are at increased risk of developing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. METHODS: We did a nested, case-control, proof-of-concept study to compare the prevalence of CHIP between patients with cancer who later developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (cases) and patients who did not develop these neoplasms (controls). We identified cases from our internal biorepository of 123 357 patients who consented to participate in the Total Cancer Care biobanking protocol at Moffitt Cancer Center (Tampa, FL, USA) between Jan 1, 2006, and June 1, 2016. We included all individuals who were diagnosed with a primary malignancy, were treated with chemotherapy, subsequently developed a therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, and were 70 years or older at either diagnosis. For inclusion in this study, individuals must have had a peripheral blood or mononuclear cell sample collected before the diagnosis of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm. Controls were individuals who were diagnosed with a primary malignancy at age 70 years or older and were treated with chemotherapy but did not develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Controls were matched to cases in at least a 4:1 ratio on the basis of sex, primary tumour type, age at diagnosis, smoking status, chemotherapy drug class, and duration of follow-up. We used sequential targeted and whole-exome sequencing and described clonal evolution in cases for whom paired CHIP and therapy-related myeloid neoplasm samples were available. The primary endpoint of this study was the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm and the primary exposure was CHIP. FINDINGS: We identified 13 cases and 56 case-matched controls. The prevalence of CHIP in all patients (23 [33%] of 69 patients) was higher than has previously been reported in elderly individuals without cancer (about 10%). Cases had a significantly higher prevalence of CHIP than did matched controls (eight [62%] of 13 cases vs 15 [27%] of 56 controls, p=0.024; odds ratio 5.75, 95% CI 1.52-25.09, p=0.013). The most commonly mutated genes in cases with CHIP were TET2 (three [38%] of eight patients) and TP53(three [38%] of eight patients), whereas controls most often had TET2 mutations (six [40%] of 15 patients). In most (four [67%] of six patients) cases for whom paired CHIP and therapy-related myeloid neoplasm samples were available, the mean allele frequency of CHIP mutations had expanded by the time of the therapy-related myeloid neoplasm diagnosis. However, a subset of paired samples (two [33%] of six patients) had CHIP mutations that decreased in allele frequency, giving way to expansion of a distinct mutant clone. INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer who have CHIP are at increased risk of developing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. The distribution of CHIP-related gene mutations differs between individuals with therapy-related myeloid neoplasm and those without, suggesting that mutation-specific differences might exist in therapy-related myeloid neoplasm risk.

Abnormal function in human Tribbles has been implicated in a number of diseases including leukaemia, metabolic syndromes and cardiovascular diseases. Caenorhabditis elegans Tribbles NIPI-3 was previously shown to activate host defense upon infection by promoting the conserved PMK-1/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway. Despite the prominent role of Tribbles proteins in many species, our knowledge of their mechanism of action is fragmented, and the in vivo functional relevance of their interactions with other proteins remains largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, by characterizing nipi-3 null mutants, we show that nipi-3 is essential for larval development and viability. Through analyses of genetic suppressors of nipi-3 null mutant lethality, we show that NIPI-3 negatively controls PMK-1/p38 signalling via transcriptional repression of the C/EBP transcription factor CEBP-1. We identified CEBP-1's transcriptional targets by ChIP-seq analyses and found them to be enriched in genes involved in development and stress responses. Unlike its cell-autonomous role in innate immunity, NIPI-3 is required in multiple tissues to control organismal development.

The duration of the neutropenia is particularly long following umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). Areas covered: After briefly reviewing the impact of hematopoietic growth factors administration to hasten hematologic reconstitution after allo-HCT or intensive AML chemotherapy, this article summarizes recent approaches that have been investigated to prompt hematologic reconstruction after UCBT or intensive AML chemotherapy. Expert opinion: In the allo-HCT setting, administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF shortened the duration of the neutropenia but failed to decrease infection-related mortality or to improve survival. Novel approaches to hasten hematological reconstruction after UCBT such as double UCBT with expansion of one of the 2 UCB units with Notch ligand, mesenchymal stromal cells, nicotinamide, or StemRegenin 1, co-transplanting a single UCB unit with HLA-haploidentical CD34+ cells, or increasing UCB HSC homing to marrow niches via direct intra bone UCB administration, pulse treatment with dmPGE2 or enforced fucosylation are promising and deserve further investigations in prospective phase III studies.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the usage and clinical impact of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in 1696 patients enrolled between 2008 and 2014. METHODS: The effects of ESAs on outcomes were assessed using proportional hazards models weighting observations by propensity to receive ESA treatment within a subset of anaemic patients with or without a regular transfusion need. RESULTS: ESA treatment (median duration of 27.5 months, range 0-77 months) was administered to 773 patients (45.6%). Outcomes were assessed in 897 patients (484 ESA treated and 413 untreated). ESA treatment was associated with a nonsignificant survival benefit (HR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.65-1.04, P = 0.09); this benefit was larger amongst patients without prior transfusions (P = 0.07). Amongst 539 patients for whom response to ESA treatment could be defined, median time to first post-ESA treatment transfusion was 6.1 months (IQR: 4.3-15.9 months) in those transfused before ESA treatment compared to 23.3 months (IQR: 7.0-47.8 months) in patients without prior transfusions (HR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.7-3.3, P < 0.0001). Responding patients had a better prognosis in terms of a lower risk of death (HR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.45-0.893, P = 0.018), whereas there was no significant effect on the risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (HR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.39-1.29, P = 0.27). CONCLUSION: Appropriate use of ESAs can significantly delay the onset of a regular transfusion need in patients with lower-risk MDS.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Epub 2016 Dec 7.,10.1038/nature20598 [doi],"Refractoriness to induction chemotherapy and relapse after achievement of remission are the main obstacles to cure in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). After standard induction chemotherapy, patients are assigned to different post-remission strategies on the basis of cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities that broadly define adverse, intermediate and favourable risk categories. However, some patients do not respond to induction therapy and another subset will eventually relapse despite the lack of adverse risk factors. There is an urgent need for better biomarkers to identify these high-risk patients before starting induction chemotherapy, to enable testing of alternative induction strategies in clinical trials. The high rate of relapse in AML has been attributed to the persistence of leukaemia stem cells (LSCs), which possess a number of stem cell properties, including quiescence, that are linked to therapy resistance. Here, to develop predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers related to stemness, we generated a list of genes that are differentially expressed between 138 LSC(+) and 89 LSC(-) cell fractions from 78 AML patients validated by xenotransplantation. To extract the core transcriptional components of stemness relevant to clinical outcomes, we performed sparse regression analysis of LSC gene expression against survival in a large training cohort, generating a 17-gene LSC score (LSC17). The LSC17 score was highly prognostic in five independent cohorts comprising patients of diverse AML subtypes (n = 908) and contributed greatly to accurate prediction of initial therapy resistance. Patients with high LSC17 scores had poor outcomes with current treatments including allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The LSC17 score provides clinicians with a rapid and powerful tool to identify AML patients who do not benefit from standard therapy and who should be enrolled in trials evaluating novel upfront or post-remission strategies.",,"['Ng, Stanley W K', 'Mitchell, Amanda', 'Kennedy, James A', 'Chen, Weihsu C', 'McLeod, Jessica', 'Ibrahimova, Narmin', 'Arruda, Andrea', 'Popescu, Andreea', 'Gupta,

We tested its effect on BCR-ABL phosphorylation and expression, as well as cell proliferation and apoptosis in CML cells. We found that SPOA remarkably dephosphorylated BCR-ABL Y177, prevented GRB2 recruitment, and uncoupled RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT signals. Meanwhile, SPOA degraded BCR-ABL oncoprotein in ubiquitin-independent manner and depressed the signal transduction of STAT5 and CRKL by BCR-ABL.

It requires the interaction between adhesion receptors such as E-selectin present on endothelial cells and their ligands on cancer cells. Notably, E-selectin influences the metastatic potential of breast, bladder, gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal carcinoma as well as of leukemia and lymphoma. Here, we show that E-selectin expression induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta is directly and negatively regulated by miR-31. The transcription of miR-31 is activated by IL-1beta. This activation depends on p38 and JNK MAP kinases, and their downstream transcription factors GATA2, c-Fos and c-Jun. The miR-31-mediated repression of E-selectin impairs the metastatic potential of colon cancer cells by decreasing their adhesion to, and migration through, the endothelium.

In the present study, we hypothesized that targeting EZH2 might induce apoptosis in myeloma cells including stem cell-like cells (CSCs). We investigated the effect of EZH2 inhibition on MM cells using a potent inhibitor (GSK126). The results showed that GSK126 effectively abrogated the methylated histone 3 (H3K27me3) level in MM.1S and LP1 cells, and inhibited the number of live cells and colony formation in soft agar of six MM cell lines. GSK126 induced massive apoptosis in MM.1S, LP1 and RPMI8226 cells. Progressive release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and AIF into the cytosol was detected in GSK126-treated MM cells. GSK126 treatment elicited caspase-3-dependent MCL-1 cleavage with accumulation of proapoptotic truncated MCL-1. These results suggested that GSK126 triggers the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Enhanced apoptosis was observed in the combination of GSK126 with bortezomib. Using ALDH and side population (SP) assays to characterize CSCs, we found that GSK126 eliminated the stem-like myeloma cells by blocking the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. The in vivo anti-tumor effect of GSK126 was confirmed by using RPMI8226 cells in a xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, our findings suggest that EZH2 inactivation by GSK126 is effective in killing MM cells and CSCs as a single agent or in combination with bortezomib.

The Cancer Registry of Norway has registered data on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia since 1953. We aimed to analyze trends in incidence and survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Norway. We identified 7664 patients reported with chronic lymphocytic leukemia to the registry between 1953 and 2012. We gathered information on sex, age at diagnosis, date of death and basis for diagnosis. The age-standardized incidence increased from 0.6/100.000 person-years in 1953 to 3.1/100,000 person-years in 2012. We found a significant decrease in median age between 1993-2002 and 2003-2012 (75 vs. 72 years, 95%CI: 2.52-3.98, P < 0.001). Men were diagnosed at a significantly younger age than women. Immunophenotyping has become the most important diagnostic method after 2002. Median observed survival increased from 3 years in 1952-1963 to 8.5 years in 2003-2012. Five- and 10-year age-standardized net survival increased throughout the whole period across age groups and reached 79% and 57%, respectively. Median observed survival was significantly shorter in men than in women in 1993-2002 (4.9 vs. 6.1 years, P < 0.001). The gap between survival rates for men and women was diminishing in 2003-2012 in patients younger than 60 years while it remained considerable in older patients. Despite an aging Norwegian population, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients become younger at diagnosis.

We report the outcome of relapsed/refractory AML patients treated with ASCT. Method:: A retrospective cohort from 1994 to 2013 that included 61 patients with diagnosis of relapsed/refractory AML. Outcomes of interest were transplant-related mortality (TRM), incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse incidence, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results:: The median age was 61 years (range 1 to 65). The cumulative incidence of 90 days, 1 year, and 3 years TRM were 60%, 26.7%, and 13.3%, respectively (p<0.001). The incidence of relapse was 21.7% at 1 year, 13% at 3 years, and 8.7% at 5 years.

In a recent meta-analysis, we identified associations of childhood leukemia with occupational and household product benzene exposure and traffic-related pollution. Residential proximity to gasoline stations or automobile repair facilities may be another source of benzene, and in 3 studies assessing these sources, we identified a summary relative risk of 1.59 (95% confidence interval: 0.70, 3.62). Although not statistically significant, this summary relative risk was of a magnitude similar to that of our other positive findings. In this issue of the Journal (Am J Epidemiol 2017;185(1):5-7), Dr. Infante suggested that meta-analyses of studies on childhood leukemia and proximity to gasoline stations should involve some criteria that differ from those we used. These suggested criteria involved combining leukemia subtypes, excluding automobile repair facilities, and using nonleukemia cancers as control subjects. We redid our meta-analysis using these new criteria and obtained a summary relative risk of 2.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.51, 3.89). Overall, although this result should be interpreted in light of the relatively small sample size (3 studies) and its post-hoc nature, it provides additional new evidence for associations of childhood leukemia with both residential proximity to gasoline stations and exposure to benzene.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Evidence suggests that individuals with clonal haemopoiesis have increased risk of developing haematological malignancies. We aimed to identify whether patients with cancer who have clonal haemopoiesis are at an increased risk of developing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. METHODS: We did this retrospective case-control study to compare the prevalence of clonal haemopoiesis between patients treated for cancer who later developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (cases) and patients who did not develop these neoplasms (controls). All patients in both case and control groups were treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) from 1997 to 2015. We used the institutional medical database to locate these patients. Patients were included as cases if they were treated for a primary cancer, subsequently developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, and had available paired samples of bone marrow from the time of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm diagnosis and peripheral blood from the time of primary cancer diagnosis. Patients were eligible for inclusion as age-matched controls if they were treated for lymphoma, received combination chemotherapy, and did not develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasms after at least 5 years of follow-up. We used molecular barcode sequencing of 32 genes on the pretreatment peripheral blood samples to detect clonal haemopoiesis. For cases, we also used targeted gene sequencing on bone marrow samples and investigated clonal evolution from clonal haemopoiesis to the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. To further clarify the association between clonal haemopoiesis and therapy-related myeloid neoplasm development, we also analysed the prevalence of clonal haemopoiesis in an external cohort of patients with lymphoma who were treated in a randomised trial of front-line chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, with or without melatonin. This trial was done at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1999 and 2001 (protocol number 98-009). FINDINGS: We identified 14 cases and 54 controls. Of the 14 cases, we detected clonal haemopoiesis in the peripheral blood samples of ten (71%) patients. We detected clonal haemopoiesis in 17 (31%) of the 54 controls. The cumulative incidence of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms in both cases and controls at 5 years was significantly higher in patients with clonal haemopoiesis (30%, 95% CI 16-51) than in those without (7%, 2-21; p=0.016). In the external cohort, five (7%) of 74 patients developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, of whom four (80%) had clonal haemopoiesis; 11 (16%) of 69 patients who did not develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasms had clonal haemopoiesis. In the external cohort, the cumulative incidence of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms at 10 years was significantly higher in patients with clonal haemopoiesis (29%, 95% CI 8-53) than in those without (0%, 0-0; p=0.0009). In a multivariate Fine and Gray model based on the external cohort, the presence of clonal haemopoiesis significantly increased the risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm development (hazard ratio 13.7, 95% CI 1.7-108.7; p=0.013). INTERPRETATION: Preleukaemic clonal haemopoiesis is common in patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms at the time of their primary cancer diagnosis and before they have been exposed to treatment. Our results suggest that clonal haemopoiesis could be used as a predictive marker to identify patients with cancer who are at risk of developing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms.

Specialized nerve cells in the body periphery, so called nociceptors, are fundamental to mediate pain perception and humans without pain perception are at permanent risk for injuries, burns and mutilations. Pain insensitivity can be caused by sensory neurodegeneration which is a hallmark of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs). Although mutations in several genes were previously associated with sensory neurodegeneration, the etiology of many cases remains unknown. Using next generation sequencing in patients with congenital loss of pain perception, we here identify bi-allelic mutations in the FLVCR1 (Feline Leukemia Virus subgroup C Receptor 1) gene, which encodes a broadly expressed heme exporter. Different FLVCR1 isoforms control the size of the cytosolic heme pool required to sustain metabolic activity of different cell types. Mutations in FLVCR1 have previously been linked to vision impairment and posterior column ataxia in humans, but not to HSAN. Using fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with sensory neurodegeneration, we here show that the FLVCR1-mutations reduce heme export activity, enhance oxidative stress and increase sensitivity to programmed cell death. Our data link heme metabolism to sensory neuron maintenance and suggest that intracellular heme overload causes early-onset degeneration of pain-sensing neurons in humans.",,"['Chiabrando, Deborah', 'Castori, Marco', 'di Rocco, Maja', 'Ungelenk, Martin', 'Giesselmann, Sebastian', 'Di Capua, Matteo', 'Madeo, Annalisa', 'Grammatico, Paola', 'Bartsch, Sophie', 'Hubner, Christian A', 'Altruda, Fiorella', 'Silengo, Lorenzo', 'Tolosano, Emanuela', 'Kurth, Ingo']","['Chiabrando D', 'Castori M', 'di Rocco M', 'Ungelenk M', 'Giesselmann S', 'Di Capua M', 'Madeo A', 'Grammatico P', 'Bartsch S', 'Hubner CA', 'Altruda F', 'Silengo L', 'Tolosano E', 'Kurth I']","['Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Unit of Medical Genetics, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, San Camillo-Forlanini Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Unit of Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Gaslini Institute, Genoa, Italy.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Uniklinik RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', ""Unit of Neurophysiopathology, Department of Neuroscience, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", 'Unit of Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, Gaslini Institute, Genoa, Italy.', 'Unit of Medical Genetics, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, San Camillo-Forlanini Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Uniklinik RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.']",,20161206,,PMC5140052,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8080-9480'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-infections with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are common due to the geographical overlap of these pathogens. Helminth and viral infections induce antagonistic cytokine responses in their hosts. Helminths shift the immune system to a type 2-dominated immune response, while viral infections skew the cytokine response towards a type 1 immune response. Moreover, chronic helminth infections are often associated with a generalized suppression of the immune system leading to prolonged parasite survival, and also to a reduced defence against unrelated pathogens. To test whether helminths affect the outcome of a viral infection we set up a filarial/retrovirus co-infection model in C57BL/6 mice. Although Friend virus (FV) infection altered the L. sigmodontis-specific immunoglobulin response towards a type I associated IgG2 isotype in co-infected mice, control of L. sigmodontis infection was not affected by a FV-superinfection. However, reciprocal control of FV infection was clearly impaired by concurrent L. sigmodontis infection. Spleen weight as an indicator of pathology and viral loads in spleen, lymph nodes (LN) and bone marrow (BM) were increased in L. sigmodontis/FV-co-infected mice compared to only FV-infected mice. Numbers of FV-specific CD8+ T cells as well as cytokine production by CD4+ and CD8+ cells were alike in co-infected and FV-infected mice. Increased viral loads in co-infected mice were associated with reduced titres of neutralising FV-specific IgG2b and IgG2c antibodies. In summary our findings suggest that helminth infection interfered with the control of retroviral infection by dampening the virus-specific neutralising antibody response.",,"['Dietze, Kirsten Katrin', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Koudaimi, Daniel Karim', 'Schimmer, Simone', 'Reitz, Martina', 'Breloer, Minka', 'Hartmann, Wiebke']","['Dietze KK', 'Dittmer U', 'Koudaimi DK', 'Schimmer S', 'Reitz M', 'Breloer M', 'Hartmann W']","['Institute of Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.']",,20161206,,PMC5140070,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sleep hygiene education and relaxation techniques are recommended to improve sleep in healthy children and adult cancer survivors. No studies have tested these interventions to improve sleep and fatigue for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the home setting. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a sleep hygiene and relaxation intervention to improve sleep and fatigue for children receiving maintenance chemotherapy for ALL. The child's fatigue and sleep data were collected to inform sample size calculations for a future trial. METHODS: In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 20 children were allocated randomly to the sleep intervention or control group. The sleep intervention group received a 60-minute educational session to discuss sleep and fatigue in children with cancer and strategies to improve sleep, including use of 2 storybooks to teach deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. Objective sleep data were collected using actigraphy and fatigue was measured using the Childhood Cancer Fatigue Scale. RESULTS: The intervention was acceptable to families, and feasibility of the intervention and data collection was clearly established. Although not statistically significant, increases in mean nighttime sleep and decreases in mean wake time after sleep onset in the sleep intervention group represented clinically important improvements. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a sleep hygiene and relaxation intervention for children undergoing maintenance chemotherapy for ALL. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Given the clinically important improvements in sleep observed, replication in a larger, adequately powered randomized controlled trial is merited.",,"['Zupanec, Sue', 'Jones, Heather', 'McRae, Lyndsey', 'Papaconstantinou, Efrosini', 'Weston, Julie', 'Stremler, Robyn']","['Zupanec S', 'Jones H', 'McRae L', 'Papaconstantinou E', 'Weston J', 'Stremler R']","['Author Affiliations: Division of Haematology/Oncology (SickKids) (Mss Zupanec and Jones) and Division of Neurosurgery, Neurology, & Trauma (Ms McRae), The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ontario Institute of Technology (Dr Papaconstantinou), Oshawa; Lawrence S.

This review provides a summary of the clinical and pathophysiologic aspects of IBM. RECENT FINDINGS: The development of diagnostic blood testing for IBM followed from the discovery of a B-cell pathway in IBM muscle and circulating autoantibodies against NT5C1A, further establishing IBM's status as an autoimmune disease. The key role of cytotoxic T cells in IBM is further supported by the identification of a link between IBM and T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia. The testing of research diagnostic criteria in patients is improving its accuracy. Increases in estimated prevalences may be due to a combination of true increases and improved recognition of disease. SUMMARY: IBM has high unmet medical need. Advances in the mechanistic understanding of IBM as an autoimmune disease will drive effective therapeutic approaches. The identification of a B-cell pathway has resulted in the first identification of an IBM autoantigen and emphasized its status as an autoimmune disease. The recognition that large granular lymphocyte CD8+ T-cell expansions are present in both blood and muscle provides additional biomarkers for IBM and suggests a mechanistic relationship to the neoplastic disease T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia.",,"['Greenberg, Steven A']",['Greenberg SA'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we assessed the role of ERK5 in AraC-induced cell death in AML cell lines HL60 and U937 using ERK5 inhibitors BIX02189 and XMD8-92. We report that inhibition of MEK5/ERK5 activity reduces AraC-induced cell death, DNA damage, the upregulated DNA damage biomarkers, and produced G2 phase cell cycle arrest. In addition, the pro-survival protein P-Bcl2 Ser70 was found to be associated with decreased AraC-induced cell death following XMD8-92 treatment, suggesting a regulatory role of ERK5 on Bcl2 phosphorylation.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty-nine Chinese pediatric patients with pre-B-cell ALL were enrolled in this study from December 2008 to September 2013. Of these, 20 patients with E2A-PBX1 expression and 223 without the gene expression were stratified into two cohorts. Clinical and biological characteristics and 5-year event-free survival (EFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed and compared between these two groups. RESULTS: The E2A-PBX1 fusion transcript was detected in 20 of 349 (5.7%) patients. Compared with the gene-negative subgroup, patients with E2A-PBX1 were younger in age but did not show significant differences in white blood cell (WBC) count or gender distribution at primary diagnosis. Moreover, there were more inferior karyotypes detected in the E2A-PBX1 subgroup (P=0.035). With the CCLG-ALL2008 treatment protocol, patients with E2A-PBX1 showed a favorable treatment response with lower minimal residual disease (MRD) levels (<10(-4)) at time point 1 (TP1, P=0.039) but no superior steroid response or histological remission. We also observed a promising survival outcome, with a 5-year EFS reaching 95.0%+/-4.9% versus 66.3%+/-3.9% in the gene-negative group (P=0.039). However, we did not find significant differences in RFS (P=0.061) and OS (P=0.113). CONCLUSION: Our data provided clinical observation of Chinese pediatric patients. Patients with E2A-PBX1-positive ALL benefited well from the CCLG-ALL2008 protocol, a risk-based intensified treatment trial, with lower levels of MRD and longer RFS duration though they had no favorable characteristics at primary diagnosis.",,"['Hu, Yixin', 'He, Hailong', 'Lu, Jun', 'Wang, Yi', 'Xiao, Peifang', 'Li, Jianqin', 'Li, Jie', 'Sun, Yina', 'Lv, Hui', 'Fan, Junjie', 'Yao, Yanhua', 'Chai, Yihuan', 'Hu, Shaoyan']","['Hu Y', 'He H', 'Lu J', 'Wang Y', 'Xiao P', 'Li J', 'Li J', 'Sun Y', 'Lv H', 'Fan J', 'Yao Y', 'Chai Y', 'Hu S']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",,20161122,,PMC5125801,['NOTNLM'],"['CCLG-ALL2008 protocol', 'E2A-PBX1 gene transcript', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'pediatric', 'prognosis']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a major challenge confronting combination therapy for virtually every disease indication is the inability to pinpoint drug doses that are optimized for each patient, and the ability to adaptively and continuously optimize these doses to address comorbidities and other patient-specific physiological changes. To address this challenge, we developed a powerful digital health technology platform based on phenotypic personalized medicine (PPM). PPM identifies patient-specific maps that parabolically correlate drug inputs with phenotypic outputs. In a disease mechanism-independent fashion, we individualized drug ratios/dosages for two pediatric patients with standard-risk ALL in this study via PPM-mediated retrospective optimization. PPM optimization demonstrated that dynamically adjusted dosing of combination chemotherapy could enhance treatment outcomes while also substantially reducing the amount of chemotherapy administered. This may lead to more effective maintenance therapy, with the potential for shortening duration and reducing the risk of serious side effects.",,"['Lee, Dong-Keun', 'Chang, Vivian Y', 'Kee, Theodore', 'Ho, Chih-Ming', 'Ho, Dean']","['Lee DK', 'Chang VY', 'Kee T', 'Ho CM', 'Ho D']","['1 Division of Oral Biology and Medicine, School of Dentistry, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '2 Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '3 Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '4 Department of Bioengineering, Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '3 Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '4 Department of Bioengineering, Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '5 Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '1 Division of Oral Biology and Medicine, School of Dentistry, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '3 Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '4 Department of Bioengineering, Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '6 Jane and Jerry Weintraub Center for Reconstructive Biotechnology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', '7 California NanoSystems Institute, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['U54 CA151880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20161213,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*combination therapy', '*digital health', '*drug cocktails', '*drug development', '*oncology', '*personalized medicine', '*precision medicine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modification at quinone ring enhanced apoptosis over necrosis. Thus, bishydroquinone renieramycin M (HQ-RM) was prepared and evaluated for apoptosis induction in lung cancer cells. METHODS: HQ-RM was examined for cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction in human lung cancer H292 cells by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazoliumbromide and Hoechst/propidium iodide staining, respectively. The key molecular markers of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway were determined by western blot analysis. RESULTS: HQ-RM exhibited stronger cytotoxicity than RM. HQ-RM reduced vitality of lung cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Nuclear staining assay indicated that apoptotic cell death was the main mechanism of toxicity caused by HQ-RM. Protein analysis revealed that HQ-RM-mediated apoptosis involved the increase of pro-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 associated X (BAX) protein, and the decrease of anti-apoptosis myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) proteins. Moreover, caspase-9 and -3 and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were dramatically cleaved in response to HQ-RM treatment. CONCLUSION: HQ-RM has highly potent anticancer activity, greater than its parental RM, and induces lung cancer cell apoptosis through a mitochondrial apoptosis caspase-dependent mechanism. This information benefits the development of this compound for cancer therapy.","['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Pinkhien, Tatchakorn', 'Maiuthed, Arnatchai', 'Chamni, Supakarn', 'Suwanborirux, Khanit', 'Saito, Naoki', 'Chanvorachote, Pithi']","['Pinkhien T', 'Maiuthed A', 'Chamni S', 'Suwanborirux K', 'Saito N', 'Chanvorachote P']","['Pharmaceutical Technology (International) Program, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Cell-Based Drug and Health Product Development Research Unit, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Cell-Based Drug and Health Product Development Research Unit, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Center for Bioactive Natural Products from Marine Organisms and Endophytic Fungi, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Center for Bioactive Natural Products from Marine Organisms and Endophytic Fungi, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand pithi_chan@yahoo.com.', 'Cell-Based Drug and Health Product Development Research Unit, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL2', 'Renieramycin M', 'apoptosis', 'bishydroquinone renieramycin M', 'lung cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are conflicting data on the incidence and prognosis of Ph-like ALL in adults. Patients with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL (B-ALL) who received frontline chemotherapy at MD Anderson Cancer Center underwent gene expression profiling of leukemic cells. Of 148 patients, 33.1% had Ph-like, 31.1% had Ph(+), and 35.8% had other B-ALL subtypes (B-other). Within the Ph-like ALL cohort, 61% had cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) overexpression. Patients with Ph-like ALL had significantly worse overall survival (OS), and event-free survival compared with B-other with a 5-year survival of 23% (vs 59% for B-other, P = .006). Sixty-eight percent of patients with Ph-like ALL were of Hispanic ethnicity. The following were associated with inferior OS on multivariable analysis: age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.299; P < .001), white blood cell count (HR, 1.910; P = .017), platelet count (HR, 7.437; P = .005), and Ph-like ALL (HR, 1.818; P = .03). Next-generation sequencing of the CRLF2(+) group identified mutations in the JAK-STAT and Ras pathway in 85% of patients, and 20% had a CRLF2 mutation. Within the CRLF2(+) group, JAK2 mutation was associated with inferior outcomes.

Cities have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions as most of the traffic, industry, commerce and more than 50% of world population is situated in urban areas. Southern Europe is a region that faces financial turmoil, enhanced migratory fluxes and climate change pressure. The case study of Thessaloniki is presented, one of the only two cities in Greece with established climate change action plans. The effects of feasible traffic policies in year 2020 are assessed and their potential health impact is compared to a business as usual scenario. Two types of measures are investigated: operation of underground rail in the city centre and changes in fleet composition. Potential co-benefits from reduced greenhouse gas emissions on public health by the year 2020 are computed utilizing state-of-the-art concentration response functions for PMx, NO2 and C6H6. Results show significant environmental health and monetary co-benefits when the city metro is coupled with appropriate changes in the traffic composition. Monetary savings due to avoided mortality or leukaemia incidence corresponding to the reduction in PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and C6H6 exposure will be 56.6, 45, 37.7 and 1.0 million Euros respectively. Promotion of 'green' transportation in the city (i.e. the wide use of electric vehicles), will provide monetary savings from the reduction in PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and C6H6 exposure up to 60.4, 49.1, 41.2 and 1.08 million Euros. Overall, it was shown that the respective GHG emission reduction policies resulted in clear co-benefits in terms of air quality improvement, public health protection and monetary loss mitigation.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Current estimates on the burden of cancer are needed for cancer control planning. Objective: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 32 cancers in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. Evidence Review: Cancer mortality was estimated using vital registration system data, cancer registry incidence data (transformed to mortality estimates using separately estimated mortality to incidence [MI] ratios), and verbal autopsy data. Cancer incidence was calculated by dividing mortality estimates through the modeled MI ratios. To calculate cancer prevalence, MI ratios were used to model survival. To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Countries were categorized by SDI quintiles to summarize results. Findings: In 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths. Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with population aging contributing 16%, population growth 13%, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the most common cancer globally was prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for women (523000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (-6.1% [95% uncertainty interval (UI), -10.6% to -1.3%]). The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant. Conclusion and Relevance: As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, further straining limited health care resources. Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and palliative care requires detailed knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study results demonstrate that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major findings also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet.",,"['Fitzmaurice, Christina', 'Allen, Christine', 'Barber, Ryan M', 'Barregard, Lars', 'Bhutta, Zulfiqar A', 'Brenner, Hermann', 'Dicker, Daniel J', 'Chimed-Orchir, Odgerel', 'Dandona, Rakhi',

Base excision and mismatch repair pathways also restrict the accumulation of oxidized lesions in DNA by removing the mis-inserted 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosines (8-oxodGs). In this study, we aimed to investigate the interplay between hMYH DNA glycosylase and hMTH1 for cancer cell survival by using mismatch repair defective T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. To this end, MYH and MTH1 were silenced individually or simultaneously using small hairpin RNAs. Increased sub-G1 population and apoptotic cells were observed upon concurrent depletion of both enzymes. Elevated cell death was consistent with cleaved caspase 3 accumulation in double knockdown cells. Importantly, overexpression of the nuclear isoform of hMYH could remove the G1 arrest and partially rescue the toxicity observed in hMTH1-depleted cells. In addition, expression profiles of human DNA glycosylases were generated using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR in MTH1 and/or MYH knockdown cells. NEIL1 DNA glycosylase, involved in repair of oxidized nucleosides, was found to be significantly downregulated as a cellular response to MTH1-MYH co-suppression. Overall, the results suggest that hMYH and hMTH1 functionally cooperate for effective repair and survival in mismatch repair defective T-ALL Jurkat A3 cells.",,"['Eshtad, S', 'Mavajian, Z', 'Rudd, S G', 'Visnes, T', 'Bostrom, J', 'Altun, M', 'Helleday, T']","['Eshtad S', 'Mavajian Z', 'Rudd SG', 'Visnes T', 'Bostrom J', 'Altun M', 'Helleday T']","['Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,20161205,,PMC5177770,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Dec 4.,10.1002/pbc.26361 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivorship issues represent an established public health challenge. Most late adverse effects (LAEs) have been demonstrated to be time and treatment dependent. The PETALE study is a multidisciplinary research project aiming to comprehensively characterize LAEs and identify associated predictive biomarkers in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) survivors. METHODS: cALL survivors treated at Sainte-Justine University Health Center with Dana-Farber Cancer Institution-ALL protocols 87-01 through 2005-01 were eligible. During Phase I of the study, the participants underwent comprehensive clinical, biologic, and psychosocial investigation targeting metabolic syndrome, cardiotoxicity, bone morbidity, neurocognitive problems, and quality of life issues. Whole-exome sequencing was performed for all participants. Subjects identified with an extreme phenotype during Phase I were recalled for additional testing (Phase II). RESULTS: Phase I included 246 survivors (recall rate 71.9%). Of those, 85 participants completed Phase II (recall rate 88.5%). Survivors agreeing to participate in Phase I (n = 251) were similar to those who refused (n = 31) in terms of relapse risk profile, radiotherapy exposure, and age at the time of study. Participants, however, tended to be slightly older at diagnosis (6.1 vs. 4.7 years old, P = 0.08), with a higher proportion of female agreeing to participate compared with males (93.2 vs. 86.5%, P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: The PETALE study will contribute to comprehensively characterize clinical, psychosocial, biologic, and genomic features of cALL survivors using an integrated approach. Expected outcomes include LAE early detection biomarkers, long-term follow-up guidelines, and recommendations for physicians and health professionals.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Marcoux, Sophie', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Alos, Nathalie', 'Andelfinger, Gregor U', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Curnier, Daniel', 'Friedrich, Matthias G', 'Kritikou, Ekaterini A', 'Lefebvre, Genevieve', 'Levy, Emile', 'Lippe, Sarah', 'Marcil, Valerie', 'Raboisson, Marie-Josee', 'Rauch, Frank', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Samoilenko, Mariia', 'Seguin, Chantal', 'Sultan, Serge', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Marcoux S', 'Drouin S', 'Laverdiere C', 'Alos N', 'Andelfinger GU', 'Bertout L', 'Curnier D', 'Friedrich MG', 'Kritikou EA', 'Lefebvre G', 'Levy E', 'Lippe S', 'Marcil V', 'Raboisson MJ', 'Rauch F', 'Robaey P', 'Samoilenko M', 'Seguin C', 'Sultan S', 'Krajinovic M', 'Sinnett D']","['Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'McGill University Health Center Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite du Quebec a Montreal (UQAM), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Shriners Hospitals for Children, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'Universite du Quebec a Montreal (UQAM), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'McGill University Health Center Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['Canadian Institutes of Health Research /International'],20161204,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*biomarkers', '*childhood cancer', '*late adverse effects', '*next-generation sequencing', '*survivorship']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sizes of major immune cell populations in 50 clinical grafts from a single HSCT Centre were analyzed using flow cytometry. A statistical comparison between cell levels and clinical outcomes of HSCT was performed. Overall survival, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), and relapse were used as the primary endpoints. Individual HSCT grafts showed considerable variation in their numbers of immune cell populations, including CD123(+) dendritic cells and CD34(+) cells, which may play a role in GVHD. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who developed aGVHD were transplanted with higher levels of effector CD3(+) T, CD19(+) B, and CD123(+) dendritic cells than AML patients without aGVHD, whereas grafts with a high CD34(+) content protected against aGVHD. AML patients with cGVHD had received grafts with a lower level of monocytes and a higher level of CD34(+) cells than those without cGVHD.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) plays important post-transcriptional modulation roles by acting on multiple signaling pathways, but the underlying mechanism in proliferation and tumorigenicity is unclear. Here, we identified the role of miR-150 in proliferation and tumorigenicity in leukemia stem cells (LSCs; CD34+CD38- cells). miR-150 expression was significantly down-regulated in LSCs from leukemia cell lines and clinical samples. Functional assays demonstrated that increased miR-150 expression inhibited proliferation and clonal and clonogenic growth, enhanced chemosensitivity, and attenuated tumorigenic activity of LSCs in vitro. Transplantation animal studies revealed that miR-150 overexpression progressively abrogates tumor growth. Immunohistochemistry assays demonstrated that miR-150 overexpression enhanced caspase-3 level and reduced Ki-67 level. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays indicated Nanog is a direct and functional target of miR-150. Nanog silencing using small interfering RNA recapitulated anti-proliferation and tumorigenicity inhibition effects. Furthermore, miR-150 directly down-regulated the expression of other cancer stem cell factors including Notch2 and CTNNB1. These results provide insights into the specific biological behavior of miR-150 in regulating LSC proliferation and tumorigenicity.

In two independent cohorts of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients, compared to low expression of CPT1A (CPT1A(low)), high expression of CPT1A (CPT1A(high)) was significantly associated with adverse outcomes, which was also shown in European Leukemia Network (ELN) Intermediate-I category.

The aim of the present study was to compare outcomes of pediatric patients with AML undergoing HSCT using 3 different conditioning regimens: total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide (Cy); busulfan (Bu) and Cy; or Bu, Cy, and melphalan (Mel). In this retrospective study, registry data for patients > 2 and <18 years age undergoing matched allogeneic HSCT for AML in first complete remission (CR1) in 204 European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation centers between 2000 and 2010 were analyzed. Data were available for 631 patients; 458 patients received stem cells from a matched sibling donor and 173 from a matched unrelated donor. For 440 patients, bone marrow was used as stem cell source, and 191 patients received peripheral blood stem cells. One hundred nine patients received TBICy, 389 received BuCy, and 133 received BuCyMel as their preparatory regimen. Median follow-up was 55 months. Patients receiving BuCyMel showed a lower incidence of relapse at 5 years (14.7% versus 31.5% in BuCy versus 30% in TBICy, P < .01) and higher overall survival (OS) (76.6% versus 64% versus 64.5%, P = .04) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) (74.5% versus 58% versus 61.9%, P < .01), with a comparable nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (10.8% versus 10.5% versus 8.1%, P = .79). Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades III and IV but not chronic GVHD, was higher in patients receiving BuCyMel. Older age at HSCT had an adverse impact on NRM and the use of peripheral blood as stem cell source was associated with increased chronic GVHD and NRM as well as lower LFS and OS. Among pediatric patients receiving HSCT for AML in CR1, the use of BuCyMel conditioning proved superior to TBICy and BuCy in reducing relapse and improving LFS.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP were enrolled and assigned to receive either Xinwei or Glivec at an initial dose of 400 mg/d according to patients' financial capability. The efficacy and adverse effects were evaluated. Results: From January 2014 to September 2015, 145 eligible patients were assigned to Xinwei (n=89) or Glivec (n=56) group. All patients were treated and followed up at least 3 months. At 3 months, the complete response rates were 95.5%(85/89) and 100%(56/56), major cytogenetic response rates were 74.2%(66/89) and 80.4%(45/56), and the proportions of achieving BCR-ALB(IS)</=10% were 76.1%(67/88) and 82.1%(46/56) in Xinwei and Glivec groups respectively (all P>0.05). With a median follow-up of 12 months, 2 patients in each group progressed to accelerate or blast phase. Hematologic and non-hematologic side effects were similar between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Early hematological, cytogenetic and molecular responses between Xinwei and Glivec are comparable in newly-diagnosed CML-CP patients.

Epub 2016 Dec 2.,,"The incidence of invasive fungal disease (IFD) has varied during the last decades. However, over the years, we have observed a progressive reduction of mortality, mainly due to wider use of prophylactic antifungal therapy (i.e., new azoles, such as posaconazole), the development of new and more effective antifungal drugs (lipid compounds of amphotericin B, candins, and azoles of the previous generation) and improvement of diagnostic tools. Based on a number of international studies across three decades, the attributable mortality rate for IFD and invasive aspergillosis (IA) among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has progressively declined. In the first report, in 2001, the attributable mortality rate for aspergillosis observed in AML patients by the GIMEMA (Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto) group was near 60%. A subsequent multicenter Italian study by SEIFEM (Sorveglianza Epidemiologica Infezioni Fungine nelle Emopatie Maligne) reported an attributable mortality of 38% among 3,012 patients recruited from 1999 through 2003. Further reduction to 27% was reported for patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 in another SEIFEM study. Over the last few years, a different trend in mortality for IA has been observed in the various phases of therapy in patients with acute leukemia: while in the induction phase of treatment, characterized by a higher incidence of IA, we observed a reduction of mortality over the years, among relapsed/refractory patients, the mortality remains dramatically high.","['(c) The Author 2016.

The aim of the study was to assess the safety and clinical activity of intravenous ofatumumab monotherapy for untreated and relapsed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia. METHODS: We did a phase 2, open-label, single-arm study at six centres (hospitals and cancer clinics) in the USA. Patients aged at least 18 years who were diagnosed with untreated or relapsed Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia and required treatment, received up to three cycles of weekly ofatumumab for 5 weeks. For cycle 1, patients received one of two treatment regimens. Group A received ofatumumab 300 mg during week 1 followed by 1000 mg during weeks 2-4. Because of the acceptable safety of the 1000 mg dose in treatment group A and clinical activity of the 2000 mg dose established in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the study was amended on Dec 9, 2009, to change cycle 1 for group B who received ofatumumab 300 mg during week 1 and 2000 mg during weeks 2-5. We followed up patients during weeks 5-16 for treatment group A and during weeks 6-16 for treatment group B (no treatment was given during this follow-up). Patients in both groups with stable disease or a minor response after 16 weeks were eligible to then receive a redosing cycle of ofatumumab 300 mg during week 1 and 2000 mg during weeks 2-5. We followed up patients during weeks 6-16 after the redosing cycle (no treatment was given during this follow-up). Patients responding to cycle 1 or the redosing cycle who developed disease progression within 36 months could receive cycle 2 of ofatumumab 300 mg during week 1 and 2000 mg during weeks 2-5. The primary endpoint for this study was the proportion of patients who achieved an overall response (complete responses plus partial responses plus minor responses) after each treatment cycle in the intent-to-treat population every 4 weeks starting at week 8. This trial is registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00811733, and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between March 17, 2009, and Feb 24, 2011, we enrolled and assigned 37 patients to treatment (15 in treatment group A and 22 in treatment group B). All 37 were included in the efficacy and safety analyses. 19 (51%, 95% CI 34.4-68.1) of 37 patients achieved an overall response after cycle 1 and 22 (59%, 42.1-75.2) of 37 achieved an overall response after the redosing cycle; 15 (41%) with partial responses, seven (19%) with minor responses. 13 patients received treatment cycle 2; ten (77%) of the 13 achieved a response. All 37 patients had at least one adverse event; 16 (43%) patients had events of grade 3 or more (30 grade 3, one grade 4). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were infusion reactions (four [11%] of 37), chest pain (two [5%] of 37), haemolysis (two [5%] of 37), and neutropenia (two [5%] of 37). Two (9%) of 22 patients (both in treatment group B) had an IgM flare. 12 patients reported serious adverse events; haemolysis and pyrexia were the most common (each occurring in two [5%] of 37 patients). INTERPRETATION: A high proportion of patients achieved an overall response with ofatumumab monotherapy and this treatment was well tolerated, with a low incidence of IgM flare. This therapy might be a non-chemotherapeutic treatment option for patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, especially those with high IgM concentrations.

We aimed to analyze the safety and efficacy of a fludarabine 150 mg/m(2) and treosulfan 42 g/m(2) (FluTreo) conditioning regimen in medically infirm patients. Outcomes were compared with those of a similar historical group treated with fludarabine 150 mg/m(2) to 180 mg/m(2), busulfan 6.4 mg/kg, and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) 5 mg/kg to 7.5 mg/kg (FluBuATG). Thirty-one consecutive patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 21), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 6), or treatment-related AML (n = 4) received FluTreo conditioning. The historical group consisted of 26 consecutive patients treated with FluBuATG. In the FluTreo group, engraftment was prompt in all patients and 74% achieved >99% donor chimerism by day +30. No grades III or IV organ toxicities were noted. One-year cumulative incidences (CI) of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 19.4% and 58.4%. The groups were similar for age, disease risk, lines of treatment, hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index, and acute or chronic GVHD incidence, except that there were more matched unrelated donor recipients in the FluTreo group (P < .001). With 20 (range, 2 to 36) months follow-up for FluTreo and 14 (range, 2 to 136) for FluBuATG, the 1-year cumulative overall survival (OS) probability was 76% versus 57%, respectively (P = .026); 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 79% versus 38% (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, the only significantly favorable factor for OS and DFS was FluTreo (P = .010 and P = .012). The CI of relapse mortality was markedly decreased in FluTreo versus FluBuATG (7.4% versus 42.3%, P < .001). In conclusion, the treosulfan-based regimen resulted in favorable OS and DFS with acceptable toxicity and low relapse rates compared with busulfan-based conditioning.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the lack of potent Mcl-1-specific inhibitors and a targetable delivery system has limited the ability to exploit Mcl-1 as a therapeutic strategy to eliminate HCMV-infected monocytes. In this study, we found a lead compound from a novel class of Mcl-1 small-molecule inhibitors rapidly induced death of HCMV-infected monocytes. Moreover, encapsulation of Mcl-1 antagonists into myeloid cell-targeting nanoparticles was able to selectively increase the delivery of inhibitors into HCMV-activated monocytes, thereby amplifying their potency.

These workers' external radiation exposures were primarily to photons, resulting in an estimated average career absorbed dose to the colon of 17.4 milligray. The association between cumulative ionizing radiation dose and cancer mortality was evaluated in general relative risk models that describe modification of the excess relative risk (ERR) per gray (Gy) by time since exposure and age at exposure. Methods analogous to a nested-case control study using conditional logistic regression of sampled risks sets were used. Outcomes included: all solid cancers, lung cancer, leukemias excluding chronic lymphocytic, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Significant risk heterogeneity was evident in chronic myeloid leukemia with time since exposure, where we observed increased ERR per Gy estimates shortly after exposure (2-10 year) and again later (20-30 years). We observed delayed effects for acute myeloid leukemia although estimates were not statistically significant. Solid cancer excess risk was restricted to exposure at age 35+ years and also diminished for exposure 30 years prior to attained age. Persistent or late effects suggest additional follow-up may inform on lifetime risks.

However, MDS with der(5;19)(p10;q10) and 5q- syndrome are generally characterized as distinct subtypes. Here, we report a case of a patient with 5q- syndrome-like features as the first manifestation of MDS with der(5; 19)(p10;q10). A 59-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for anemia without leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. She had received chemotherapy comprising carboplatin and docetaxel for endometrial cancer eight years before. Bone marrow aspirate (BM) revealed low blast counts with trilineage dysplastic cells, and fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed the loss of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signals at 5q33-34. Although the initial manifestation was 5q- syndrome, G-banded metaphase analysis and spectral karyotyping analysis revealed der(5;19)(p10;q10). Consequently, a diagnosis of therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) was made. She failed to respond to azacitidine and lenalidomide therapy.

We aimed to assess the presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in childhood ALL and if it is associated with early cardiovascular dysfunction. METHODS: In total, 53 childhood ALL survivors and 34 controls underwent auxological evaluation, biochemical assay, liver, heart and vascular ultrasound study. RESULTS: NAFLD was more frequent in ALL patients than in controls (39.6% vs 11.7%, P < 0.01). Patients with NAFLD were more obese and insulin resistant than patients without NAFLD. Flow-mediated dilatation and interventricular septum were lower in the ALL group than those in the control group (P < 0.001 for both). The patients with NAFLD showed lower left ventricular ejection fraction than those without NAFLD (P = 0.011). In ALL survivors, BMI-SDS and subcutaneous fat were the strongest predictors of NAFLD, whereas preperitoneal adipose tissue and C-reactive protein were the strongest predictors of left ventricular ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood ALL survivors had higher prevalence of NAFLD than healthy controls, which is associated with early left ventricular impairment. In the case of fatty liver, a comprehensive heart evaluation is mandatory. We strongly recommend to prevent visceral adiposity in ALL survivors, to search for metabolic syndrome or its components and to reinforce the need of intervention on diet and lifestyle during the follow-up of these patients.",['(c) 2017 European Society of Endocrinology.'],"['Delvecchio, Maurizio', 'Muggeo, Paola', 'Monteduro, Mariantonietta', 'Lassandro, Giuseppe', 'Novielli, Chiara', 'Valente, Federica', 'Salinaro, Emanuela', 'Zito, Annapaola', 'Ciccone, Marco Matteo', 'Miniello, Vito Leonardo', 'Santoro, Nicola', 'Giordano, Paola', 'Faienza, Maria Felicia']","['Delvecchio M', 'Muggeo P', 'Monteduro M', 'Lassandro G', 'Novielli C', 'Valente F', 'Salinaro E', 'Zito A', 'Ciccone MM', 'Miniello VL', 'Santoro N', 'Giordano P', 'Faienza MF']","[""Department of Biomedicine and Human OncologyPediatric Section, University 'A.

Because B-cell leukemia is associated with mutations in transcription factors of importance for stable preservation of lineage identity, we here investigated the potential lineage plasticity of leukemic cells. We report that primary pro-B leukemia cells from mice carrying heterozygous mutations in either or both the Pax5 and Ebf1 genes, commonly mutated in human leukemia, can be converted into T lineage leukemia cells. Even though the conversion process involved global changes in gene expression and lineage-restricted epigenetic reconfiguration, the malignant phenotype of the cells was preserved, enabling them to expand as T lineage leukemia cells in vivo. Furthermore, while the transformed pro-B cells displayed plasticity toward myeloid lineages, the converted cells failed to cause myeloid leukemia after transplantation. These data provide evidence that a malignant phenotype can be transferred between hematopoietic lineages. This has important implications for modern cancer medicine because lineage targeted treatment of leukemia patients can be predicted to provoke the emergence of phenotypically altered subclones, causing clinical relapse.",['(c) 2016 Somasundaram et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],"['Somasundaram, Rajesh', 'Ahsberg, Josefine', 'Okuyama, Kazuki', 'Ungerback, Jonas', 'Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Strid, Tobias', 'Sigvardsson, Mikael']","['Somasundaram R', 'Ahsberg J', 'Okuyama K', 'Ungerback J', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Fioretos T', 'Strid T', 'Sigvardsson M']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, 58183 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, 58183 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, 58183 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, 58183 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, 22184 Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, 22184 Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, 58183 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, 58183 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology Lund University, 22184 Lund, Sweden.']",,20161202,,PMC5159664,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-ALL', '*lineage conversion', '*transcription factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Underlying genetic predisposition is recognized in an increasing number of patients. Germ line GATA2 mutation is found in 70% of adolescents with MDS and monosomy 7. It is challenging to distinguish RCC from aplastic anemia, inherited bone marrow failure, and reactive conditions. RCC is often hypoplastic and may respond to immunosuppressive therapy. In case of immunosuppressive therapy failure, hypercellular RCC, or RCC with monosomy 7, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using reduced-intensity conditioning regimens is indicated. Almost all patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts are candidates for HSCT; children age 12 years or older have a higher risk of treatment-related death, and the conditioning regimens should be adjusted accordingly. Unraveling the genetics of JMML has demonstrated that JMML in patients with germ line PTPN11 and CBL mutations often regresses spontaneously, and therapy is seldom indicated. Conversely, patients with JMML and neurofibromatosis type 1, somatic PTPN11, KRAS, and most of those with NRAS mutations have a rapidly progressive disease, and early HSCT is indicated. The risk of relapse after HSCT is high, and prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease and monitoring should be adapted to this risk.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

Although very similar regimens are used to treat T-ALL and B-ALL, distinctions in response to different elements of therapy have been observed. Similar to B-ALL, the key prognostic determinant in T-ALL is minimal residual disease (MRD) response. Unlike B-ALL, other factors including age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, and genetics of the ALL blasts are not independently prognostic when MRD response is included. Recent insights into T-ALL biology, using modern genomic techniques, have identified a number of recurrent lesions that can be grouped into several targetable pathways, including Notch, Jak/Stat, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and MAPK. With contemporary chemotherapy, outcomes for de novo T-ALL have steadily improved and now approach those observed in B-ALL, with approximately 85% 5-year event-free survival. Unfortunately, salvage has remained poor, with less than 25% event-free and overall survival rates for relapsed disease.

Most importantly, intensive chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation (SCT) is less well tolerated in older patients.

Residual disease after therapy may reflect the sum of all diagnosis and postdiagnosis resistance mechanisms/factors; its measurement could hypothetically be very instrumental for guiding treatment. The possibility of defining residual disease (minimal residual disease [MRD]) far below the level of 5% blast cells is changing the landscape of risk classification. In this manuscript, the various methods, all different in sensitivity, specificity, and phase of development, to assess MRD are discussed. Currently, the 2 methods mostly used are flow cytometry-based immune MRD (multiparameter flow cytometry [MPFC]) and molecular MRD assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Both have advantages and disadvantages that are summarized in detail. Many studies in children as well as adults already demonstrated that MRD detection by MPFC or molecular MRD provides strong prognostic information in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after both induction and consolidation. These studies are summarized in this review. The general conclusion of this review is that a better definition of disease burden than morphological CR is now emerging. MRD assessed by flow or molecular techniques should become standard in every clinical trial in AML. Harmonization of antibody panels, introduction of single-cell tube systems (for determination of residual leukemic stem cells), and standardized analytical programs will pave the way for individual risk assessment and become a surrogate end point for survival in studies investigating new drugs, hopefully resulting in faster drug approval in AML.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

Assessing fit, vulnerable, and frail older adults with AML remains a challenge for the treating oncologist. A majority of AML patients are elderly and often have significant comorbidities, lack of social support, and older caregivers. Performance status (PS), a subjective measure of how a patient will tolerate cancer chemotherapy, has been strongly correlated with mortality in older AML patients. However, a large portion of older adults have poor PS as a result of their underlying AML, and these patients may end up being undertreated. Conversely, some patients with excellent PS unexpectedly end up with excessive toxicity and mortality. The treating physician thus needs a more objective and comprehensive method to differentiate patients along the fit-frail spectrum irrespective of their chronological age. For more than a decade, comprehensive geriatric assessment has been shown to improve routine oncology assessment by adding information about the functional, emotional, cognitive, and social status of older patients with cancer. In addition to the chronological and functional age, there is an attempt to quantify a patient's biological age to aid in better decision making. This chapter attempts to review the clinical challenges of AML treatment in the elderly population and to highlight the current literature and future research required to be able to assess fitness and maximize therapeutic options in this heterogeneous patient population.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

Other late effects have also been identified, such as pulmonary dysfunction, endocrinopathies (thyroid dysfunction, infertility), neck muscle atrophy, and persistent fatigue. HL survivors have two- to fourfold increased risks to develop SMNs and CVD compared with the general population. With respect to SMNs, radiotherapy is associated with 1.5- to 15-fold increased risk of solid malignancies. The relative risk (RR) of solid tumors increases steadily with increasing follow-up time from 5 to 15 years since radiotherapy, and remains elevated for at least 40 years. The RR of solid SMNs increases strongly with younger age at first treatment. Risks of lung, breast, and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers increase with higher radiation dose. Alkylating agent chemotherapy, especially procarbazine, does not only increase risk of leukemia but also of solid malignancies, in particular, cancers of the lung and GI tract. In contrast, gonadotoxic chemotherapy decreases the risk of radiation-associated breast cancer, through induction of premature menopause. Smoking appears to multiply the radiation- and chemotherapy-associated risks of lung cancer. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy for HL may cause cardiovascular toxicity. Radiotherapy increases the risk of coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure (HF), and pericarditis, whereas anthracycline-containing chemotherapy increases the risks of HF and valvular heart disease. Cardiovascular toxicity following radiotherapy is usually observed from 5 to at least 35 years after therapy, whereas anthracycline-related toxicity is already observed during treatment, up to at least 25 years. The joint effects of anthracyclines, radiotherapy, and conventional cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, smoking, and physical inactivity) appear to be additive rather than multiplicative. HL survivors need lifelong risk-based screening for selected SMNs and CVDs. Furthermore, preventive strategies should include lifestyle and drug-based interventions to minimize exposure to conventional risk factors for cancer and CVD.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

Therefore, many centers have adopted the molecular technique for measuring BCR-ABL1 and rely on conversion of values to the international reporting scale for appropriate clinical interpretation. However, the technique has a degree of inherent variability despite standardized procedures, which means care should be taken by the clinician when assessing response based on BCR-ABL1 cutoff limits. The last few years have witnessed the emergence of a new molecular response target, which is the achievement and maintenance of a deep molecular response. The ability to achieve treatment-free remission for some patients has shifted the relevant boundary for molecular response. However, the definitive safe BCR-ABL1 transcript level and length of the maintenance phase after which treatment cessation can be attempted has not yet been determined. For patients with TKI resistance, BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation analysis remains an essential assessment to guide therapy. Furthermore, low-level mutation detection is clinically relevant for response prediction to subsequent TKI therapy for some patients. Multiple low-level mutations may be a biomarker of a clonally diverse disease with the propensity for resistance evolution.

Although any single inherited marrow failure disorder is rare, multiplexed genetic sequencing that allows simultaneous evaluation of marrow failure genes en masse demonstrated that, as a group, these inherited disorders compose a significant subset (5% to 10%) of patients with BMF. Early diagnosis of a germ line genetic marrow failure disorder allows individualized monitoring and tailored therapy. Recent studies of somatic variants in marrow failure revealed a high frequency of clonal hematopoiesis with the acquisition of mutations in genes associated with MDS or AML. Investigation of somatic mutations in marrow failure revealed important insights into the mechanisms promoting clonal disease but also raised additional questions.

BPDCN presents most commonly with skin lesions with or without extramedullary organ involvement before leukemic dissemination. As a result of its clinical ambiguity, differentiating BPDCN from benign skin lesions or those of acute myeloid leukemia with leukemia cutis is challenging. BPDCN is most easily defined by the phenotype CD4(+)CD56(+)CD123(+)lineage(-)MPO(-), although many patients will present with variable expression of CD4, CD56, or alternate plasmacytoid markers, which compounds the difficulty in differentiating BPDCN from other myeloid or lymphoid malignancies. Chromosomal aberrations are frequent, and the mutational landscape of BPDCN is being rapidly characterized although no obvious molecular target for chemoimmunotherapy has been identified. Chemotherapy regimens developed for acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome have all been used to treat BPDCN. Relapse is frequent, and overall survival is quite poor. Allogeneic transplantation offers a chance at prolonged remission and possible cure for those who are eligible; unfortunately, relapse remains high ranging from 30% to 40%. Novel therapies such as SL-401, a diphtheria toxin conjugated to interleukin-3 (IL-3) is commonly overexpressed in BPDCN and other aggressive myeloid malignancies and has shown considerable promise in ongoing clinical trials. Future work with SL-401 will define its place in treating relapsed or refractory disease as well as its role as a first-line therapy or bridge to transplantation.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.

However, the underlying pathways and their implications in human disease are poorly understood. Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded CAG repeats in the N terminal of the huntingtin gene (mutant Huntingtin, mtHtt). In this study, we show an extensive degradation of the OMM protein MCL1 (Myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) in both HD mouse striatal cells and HD patient fibroblasts. The decrease in MCL1 level is associated with mitochondrial and cellular damage. Valosin-containing-protein (VCP) is an AAA-ATPase central to protein turnover via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). We found that VCP translocates to mitochondria and promotes MCL1 degradation in HD cell cultures. Either down-regulation of VCP by RNA interference or inhibition of VCP by a dominant negative mutant abolishes MCL1 degradation in HD cell cultures. We further show that UBX-domain containing protein 1 (UBXD1), a known co-factor of VCP assisting in the recognition of substrates for protein degradation, selectively binds to MCL1 and interacts with VCP to mediate MCL1 extraction from the mitochondria. These results indicate that the OMM protein MCL1 is degraded by the VCP-UBXD1 complex and that the process is promoted by the presence of mtHtt. Therefore, our finding provides a new insight into the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in HD.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It is known that the RIIalpha regulatory subunit of PKA, is modified by RA (retinoylated) in the early stages of differentiation. We have investigated the effects of RA on PKA during cell differentiation in order to understand the potential significance of this process in the retinoylation of RIIalpha subunits. METHODS: Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, PCR, and PKA activity assays were employed for characterizing the effects of RA on PKA. RESULTS: We found that RA induces intracellular mobility of RIIalpha and the activation of PKA in HL60 cells. Increases in RIIalpha levels were observed in RA-treated HL60 cells. RA treatment altered intracellular localization of the PKA subunits, RIIalpha and Calpha, and increased their protein levels in the nuclei as detected by both immunoblotting and immunostaining analyses. Coincident with the increase in nuclear Calpha, RA-treated HL60 cells showed increases in both the protein phosphorylation activity of PKA and the levels of phosphorylated proteins in nuclear fractions as compared to control cells. In addition, RIIalpha protein was stabilized in RA-treated HL60 cells as compared to control cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that RA stabilizes RIIalpha protein and activates PKA in the nucleus, with a resultant increase in the phosphorylation of nuclear proteins. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our evidence suggests that retinoylation of PKA might contribute to its stabilization and activation and that this could potentially participate in RA's ability to induce granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It has also been demonstrated in Ewing's sarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia and acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia but could not be found in other epithelial tumors, Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We aimed to analyze ERG expression in multiple myeloma, following an index case of a patient with metastases of unknown origin in the spine strongly expressing ERG, which were thought to be of prostatic origin but turned out to be plasmacytic lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We subsequently selected 12 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of multiple myeloma from our archives and performed immunohistochemical staining for ERG. RESULTS: All 12 analyzed cases showed strong nuclear expression of ERG in >90% of tumor cells (myeloma cells). CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights a potential and critical diagnostic pitfall in biopsy specimens where morphology is only of limited assistance in reaching the correct diagnosis. It urges pathologists to exercise caution in cases where strong ERG-positivity implicates the presence of a prostatic neoplasia and illustrates the need for further immunohistochemical examination.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Molecular analysis of Th2 cell differentiation and maintenance of function has led to recent discoveries that have refined our understanding of Th2 cell biology. Epigenetic regulation of Gata3 expression by chromatin remodeling complexes such as Polycomb and Trithorax is crucial for maintaining Th2 cell identity. In the context of allergic diseases, memory-type pathogenic Th2 cells have been identified in both mice and humans.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) arises from a genetic alteration in a normal haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) giving rise to a leukaemic stem cell (LSC) within the bone marrow (BM) 'niche'. CML is characterised by the presence of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase fusion protein breakpoint cluster region-abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR-ABL), which is responsible for driving the disease through activation of downstream signal transduction pathways. Recent evidence from our group and others indicates that important regulatory networks involved in establishing primitive and definitive haemopoiesis during development are reactivated in myeloid leukaemia, giving rise to an LSC population with altered self-renewal and differentiation properties. In this review, we explore the role the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling plays in stem cell pluripotency, developmental haemopoiesis, HSC maintenance and the implication of altered BMP signalling on LSC persistence in the BM niche. Overall, we emphasise how the BMP and Wnt pathways converge to alter the Cdx-Hox axis and the implications of this in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies.","['(c) 2016 The Author(s); published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the', 'Biochemical Society.']","['Toofan, Parto', 'Wheadon, Helen']","['Toofan P', 'Wheadon H']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, 1053 Great Western Road, Glasgow G12 0XB, U.K."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, 1053 Great Western Road, Glasgow G12 0XB, U.K.""]","['NC/K500331/1/National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of', 'Animals in Research/United Kingdom']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cdx-Hox', '*bone marrow (BM) niche', '*bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway', '*chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)', '*haemopoiesis', '*leukaemic stem cell (LSC)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite a well-characterized genetic and molecular landscape, targeted therapies for AML have failed to significantly improve clinical outcomes. Over the past decade, proteasome inhibition has been demonstrated to be an effective therapeutic strategy in several hematologic malignancies. Proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib and carfilzomib, have become mainstays of treatment for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. In light of this success, there has been a surge of literature exploring both the role of the proteasome and the effects of proteasome inhibition in AML. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that proteasome inhibition disrupts proliferative cell signaling pathways, exhibits cytotoxic synergism with other chemotherapeutics and induces autophagy of cancer-related proteins. Meanwhile, clinical trials incorporating bortezomib into combination chemotherapy regimens have reported a range of responses in AML patients, with complete remission rates >80% in some cases. Taken together, this preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that inhibition of the proteasome may be efficacious in this disease.

Alternatively, adequate energy supply reduces heart failure and increases survival. However, the approach to regulating energy metabolism conductive to vital organs is limited, and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. This study assesses the ability of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) to preserve cardiac energy metabolism during lethal hemorrhagic injury. In the lethally hemorrhagic rat and hypoxic myocardial cells, energy metabolism and heart function were well maintained following HDACI treatment, as evident by continuous ATP production with normal cardiac contraction. Valproic acid (VPA) regulated the energy metabolism of hemorrhagic heart by reducing lactate synthesis and protecting the mitochondrial ultrastructure and respiration, which were attributable to the inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase A activity and the increased myeloid cell leukemia-1 (mcl-1) gene expression, ultimately facilitating ATP production and consumption. MCL-1, the key target of VPA, mediated this cardioprotective effect under acute severe hemorrhage conditions.

Epub 2017 Jan 10.,10.1111/tid.12643 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Few studies have been performed to identify factors that are associated with an increased risk of infections during the neutropenic period in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). The aim of this study was to identify the host immune cells responsible for infections before engraftment. METHODS: A total of 282 patients who underwent allo-SCT were enrolled. Peripheral blood samples were collected before conditioning therapy. Expression of CD161-expressing T cells, natural killer cells, and immature myeloid cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Microbially and clinically defined infections and fevers of unknown origin as proposed by the Immunocompromised Host Society were included in this study. RESULTS: The median age was 45 years (range, 16-68 years). Patients had various hematologic disorders and were transplanted from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched siblings, unrelated donors, and familial HLA-mismatched donors. In univariate analysis, younger age and a familial HLA-mismatched donor were risk factors for the occurrence of infections. After adjusting for potential variables in univariate analysis, multivariate analyses revealed that a lower frequency of CD3(+) CD4(+) CD161(+) cells was significantly associated with the occurrence of neutropenic infections. An age of 35 years or younger and allografting from familial HLA-mismatched donors showed a trend toward higher infection rates. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that a lower frequency of CD3(+) CD4(+) CD161(+) T cells in peripheral blood before conditioning therapy was associated with a higher incidence of infection during the neutropenic period. These results suggest that recipient innate T cells with expression of C-type lectin CD161 can guard against infections before engraftment.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Only few recurrent cytogenetic aberrations have been identified in the T-cell NHL and the best known is the ALK gene translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Since lymph node or other tissue is seldom submitted for conventional cytogenetics study, alternative approaches for translocation detection are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH is more sensitive than PCR in the detection of lymphoma translocations since directly labeled large FISH probes that span the translocation breakpoints are used. Although the recurrent chromosomal abnormalities in NHL are not completely sensitive and specific for disease entities, unlike the scenario in acute leukemia, cytogenetic and molecular genetic study is commonly used to aid lymphoma diagnosis and classification. Currently, the main clinical utility is in the employment of interphase FISH panels to predict disease aggressiveness to guide therapy, for example identification of double-hit lymphoma, or in prognostication, for example risk-stratification in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The recent application of high-throughput sequencing to NHL not only advances the understanding of disease pathogenesis and classification, but allows the discovery of new drug targets, such as BRAF gene inhibition in hairy cell leukemia. Coupled with the increasing availability of novel molecular targeted therapeutic agents, the hope for the future is to translate the genetics and genomics information to achieve personalized medicine in NHL.",,"['Ma, Edmond S K']",['Ma ES'],"['Department of Pathology, Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital, 2 Village Road, Happy Valley, Hong Kong. eskma@hksh.com.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chromosomal translocation', '*Classification', '*Cytogenetics', '*Diagnosis', '*FISH', '*Molecular targeted therapy', '*Non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*PCR', '*Personalized medicine', '*Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past five decades, innovative technical advances in the field of cancer cytogenetics have greatly enhanced the detection ability of chromosomal alterations, and have facilitated the research and diagnostic potential of chromosomal studies in neoplasms. These developments notwithstanding, chromosome analysis of a single cell is still the easiest way to delineate and understand the relationship between clonal evolution and disease progression of cancer cells. The use of advanced fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques allows for the further identification of chromosomal alterations that are unresolved by the karyotyping method. It overcame many of the drawbacks of assessing the genetic alterations in cancer cells by karyotyping. Subsequently, the development of DNA microarray technologies provides a high-resolution view of the whole genome, which may add massive amounts of new information and opens the field of cancer cytogenomics. Strikingly, cancer cytogenetics does not only provide key information to improve the care of patients with malignancies, but also acts as a guide to identify the genes responsible for the development of these neoplastic states and has led to the emergence of molecularly targeted therapies in the field of personalized medicine.",,"['Wan, Thomas S K']",['Wan TS'],"['Haematology Division, Department of Anatomical & Cellular Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong. thomaswan@cuhk.edu.hk.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer cytogenetics', '*FISH', '*Karyotyping', '*Molecular cytogenetics', '*Review']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall survival (OS) was significantly prolonged in patients with high BM lymphocytes and T cells (P values = 0.047 and P 0.002, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that BM T-cell percentage and cytogenetics were independent prognostic factors predictive of OS (HR 4.7, P value = 0.011).

METHODS: A systematic review established the disease areas with the strong sources of evidence of the short, medium and long-term benefits of human milk for preterm infants as opposed to the use of formula milk. The analysis assessed the economic impact of reducing rates of necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, sudden infant death syndrome, leukaemia, otitis media, obesity and neurodevelopmental impairment. RESULTS: Based on the number of preterm babies born in 2013, if 100% of premature infants being fed mother's milk could be achieved in the NICU, the total lifetime cost savings to the NHS due to improved health outcomes is estimated to be pound46.7 million ( pound30.1 million in the first year) with a total lifetime QALY gain of 10,594, There would be 238 fewer deaths due to neonatal infections and SIDS, resulting in a reduction of approximately pound153.4 million in lifetime productivity. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust to a wide range of inputs. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis established that increasing the use of human milk in NICUs in the UK would lead to cost savings to the NHS.

To increase safety and tolerability of the conditioning, we previously reported the feasibility to substitute the TBI component by treosulfan in elderly AML patients. We now present long-term follow-up data on patients treated with FLAMSA/treosulfan compared to the original FLAMSA/4Gy TBI protocol. We retrospectively analyzed 130 consecutive patients with high-risk or relapsed AML after aSCT following FLAMSA conditioning at our center. Fifty-eight patients were treated with FLAMSA/treosulfan due to age and/or comorbidities. Seventy-two patients were treated with FLAMSA/TBI. Median age of patients treated with FLAMSA/treosulfan was 60 years compared to 46 years in those treated with FLAMSA/TBI. The cumulative incidence of a non-relapse mortality at 4 years was 28% in FLAMSA/treosulfan patients as compared to 13% in FLAMSA/TBI. Cumulative incidence of relapse was higher in patients treated with FLAMSA/TBI (46 vs. 32%). This difference was even more prominent for patients treated in blast persistence prior to transplant (relapse incidence 70% for TBI vs. 35% for treosulfan). The overall and relapse-free survival rates at 4 years were 47 and 41%, respectively, for patients treated with FLAMSA/TBI as compared to 43 and 40% in patients treated with FLAMSA/treosulfan. These data indicate an anti-leukemic activity by FLAMSA/treosulfan especially in patients with a blast persistence prior to transplant. Older age was an independent factor for a higher non-relapse mortality. Translating FLAMSA/treosulfan to younger patients, a lower non-relapse mortality, and an improved anti-leukemic activity might add up to improved overall survival. Randomized studies are required to demonstrate an improved efficacy of treosulfan- versus TBI-based FLAMSA conditioning.",,"['Holtick, Udo', 'Herling, Marco', 'Pflug, Natali', 'Chakupurakal, Geothy', 'Leitzke, Silke', 'Wolf, Dominik', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Scheid, Christof', 'Chemnitz, Jens M']","['Holtick U', 'Herling M', 'Pflug N', 'Chakupurakal G', 'Leitzke S', 'Wolf D', 'Hallek M', 'Scheid C', 'Chemnitz JM']","['BMT Program, Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50924, Koln, Germany. udo.holtick@uk-koeln.de.', 'BMT Program, Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50924, Koln, Germany.', 'BMT Program, Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50924, Koln, Germany.', 'BMT Program, Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50924, Koln, Germany.', 'BMT Program, Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50924, Koln, Germany.', 'Department III of Internal Medicine, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'BMT Program, Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50924, Koln, Germany.', 'BMT Program, Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50924, Koln, Germany.', 'BMT Program, Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50924, Koln, Germany.']",,20161201,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'Conditioning regimen']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5543-0257'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His tumors were badly neglected for a long period of time and presented at an advanced stage. Methods: This type of reconstruction was performed utilizing a multidisciplinary approach. Our patient required calvarial reconstruction with titanium mesh, dural reconstruction, latissimus dorsi free flap, and an overlying skin graft. Results: The patient had appropriate resection of his tumor while maintaining flap viability. Postoperatively, he presented with excellent soft-tissue thickness and aesthetic result. Conclusion: We believe that this type of reconstruction was best, considering our patient had a significant scalp and calvarial defect at presentation.

Eighty-seven bleeding episodes in 39 patients were registered (85 Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 1 or 2, 2 CTC grade 3) during a median observation period of 10.9 months. At times of bleeding, RIPA values were significantly lower (14 vs 28 U; P<0.0001). RIPA was impaired in patients receiving concomitant antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation (14 vs 25 U, P=0.005). A gradual decline of median RIPA values was observed with increasing bleeding severity. Importantly, no CTC grade 2 or 3 bleeding were observed with RIPA values of >36 U. Sequential monitoring indicated a decrease of RIPA values from a median of 17 to 9 U within 2 weeks after initiation of treatment as well as an increase above the critical threshold of 36 U within 7 days when ibrutinib was paused.

Using high-resolution genomic profiling, we delimit a 58 kb minimal deleted region (MDR) on 1p22.1 encompassing two genes: ectopic viral integration site 5 (EVI5) and ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5). Low mRNA expression of EVI5 and RPL5 was associated with worse survival in diagnostic cases. Patients with 1p22 deletion had lower mRNA expression of EVI5 and RPL5, however, 1p22 deletion status is a bad predictor of RPL5 expression in some cases, suggesting that other mechanisms downregulate RPL5 expression. Interestingly, RPL5 but not EVI5 mRNA levels were significantly lower in relapsed patients responding to bortezomib and; both in newly diagnosed and relapsed patients, bortezomib treatment could overcome their bad prognosis by raising their progression-free survival to equal that of patients with high RPL5 expression. In conclusion, our genetic data restrict the MDR on 1p22 to EVI5 and RPL5 and although the role of these genes in promoting MM progression remains to be determined, we identify RPL5 mRNA expression as a biomarker for initial response to bortezomib in relapsed patients and subsequent survival benefit after long-term treatment in newly diagnosed and relapsed patients.",,"['Hofman, I J F', 'van Duin, M', 'De Bruyne, E', 'Fancello, L', 'Mulligan, G', 'Geerdens, E', 'Garelli, E', 'Mancini, C', 'Lemmens, H', 'Delforge, M', 'Vandenberghe, P', 'Wlodarska, I', 'Aspesi, A', 'Michaux, L', 'Vanderkerken, K', 'Sonneveld, P', 'De Keersmaecker, K']","['Hofman IJF', 'van Duin M', 'De Bruyne E', 'Fancello L', 'Mulligan G', 'Geerdens E', 'Garelli E', 'Mancini C', 'Lemmens H', 'Delforge M', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Wlodarska I', 'Aspesi A', 'Michaux L', 'Vanderkerken K', 'Sonneveld P', 'De Keersmaecker K']","['KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Oncology, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussels (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Oncology, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Center for Human Genetics, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB Center for the Biology of Disease, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Dipartimento Scienze della Sanita Pubblica e Pediatriche, Univ.Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Univ.Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Center for Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Center for Human Genetics, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.', ""Department of Health Sciences, Universita' del Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy."", 'Center for Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussels (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Oncology, LKI - Leuven Cancer Institute, Leuven, Belgium.']",['334946/European Research Council/International'],20161202,,PMC5380219,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4719-1935', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7420-9531']",,['EMS70615'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have suggested that a small isoform of FOXP1 rather than full-length FOXP1, may possess this oncogenic activity. Corroborating those studies, we herein show that activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells predominantly express a small FOXP1 isoform, and that the 5'-end of the Foxp1 gene is a common insertion site in murine lymphomas in leukemia virus- and transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis screens. By combined mass spectrometry, (quantative) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction/sequencing, and small interfering ribonucleic acid-mediated gene silencing, we determined that the small FOXP1 isoform predominantly expressed in activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma lacks the N-terminal 100 amino acids of full-length FOXP1. Aberrant overexpression of this FOXP1 isoform (DeltaN100) in primary human B cells revealed its oncogenic capacity; it repressed apoptosis and plasma cell differentiation. However, no difference in potency was found between this small FOXP1 isoform and full-length FOXP1. Furthermore, overexpression of full-length FOXP1 or this small FOXP1 isoform in primary B cells and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines resulted in similar gene regulation. Taken together, our data indicate that this small FOXP1 isoform and full-length FOXP1 have comparable oncogenic and transcriptional activity in human B cells, suggesting that aberrant expression or overexpression of FOXP1, irrespective of the specific isoform, contributes to lymphomagenesis. These novel insights further enhance the value of FOXP1 for the diagnostics, prognostics, and treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['van Keimpema, Martine', 'Gruneberg, Leonie J', 'Schilder-Tol, Esther J M', 'Oud, Monique E C M', 'Beuling, Esther A', 'Hensbergen, Paul J', 'de Jong, Johann', 'Pals, Steven T', 'Spaargaren, Marcel']","['van Keimpema M', 'Gruneberg LJ', 'Schilder-Tol EJ', 'Oud ME', 'Beuling EA', 'Hensbergen PJ', 'de Jong J', 'Pals ST', 'Spaargaren M']","['Department of Pathology, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Academic Medical Center, Leiden University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Academic Medical Center, Leiden University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Academic Medical Center, Leiden University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Academic Medical Center, Leiden University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Academic Medical Center, Leiden University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Netherlands Cancer institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Academic Medical Center, Leiden University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Academic Medical Center, Leiden University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands marcel.spaargaren@amc.uva.nl.']",,20161201,,PMC5394978,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acquired mutations in calreticulin or myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene are found in a significant number of patients with essential thrombocythemia or myelofibrosis, and mutations in numerous epigenetic regulators and spliceosome components are also seen. Although the cellular and molecular consequences of many of these mutations remain unclear, it seems likely that they interact with germline and microenvironmental factors to influence disease pathogenesis.

Epub 2016 Dec 1.,10.1182/blood-2016-08-735365 [doi],"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a major unmet medical need. Most patients have poor long-term survival, and treatment has not significantly changed in 40 years. Recently, bispecific antibodies that redirect the cytotoxic activity of effector T cells by binding to CD3, the signaling component of the T-cell receptor, and a tumor target have shown clinical activity. Notably, blinatumomab is approved to treat relapsed/refractory acute lymphoid leukemia. Here we describe the design, discovery, pharmacologic activity, pharmacokinetics, and safety of a CD3 T cell-dependent bispecific (TDB) full-length human IgG1 therapeutic antibody targeting CLL-1 that could potentially be used in humans to treat AML. CLL-1 is prevalent in AML and, unlike other targets such as CD33 and CD123, is not expressed on hematopoietic stem cells providing potential hematopoietic recovery. We selected a high-affinity monkey cross-reactive anti-CLL-1 arm and tested several anti-CD3 arms that varied in affinity, and determined that the high-affinity CD3 arms were up to 100-fold more potent in vitro. However, in mouse models, the efficacy differences were less pronounced, probably because of prolonged exposure to TDB found with lower-affinity CD3 TDBs. In monkeys, assessment of safety and target cell depletion by the high- and low-affinity TDBs revealed that only the low-affinity CD3/CLL1 TDB was well tolerated and able to deplete target cells. Our data suggest that an appropriately engineered CLL-1 TDB could be effective in the treatment of AML.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Leong, Steven R', 'Sukumaran, Siddharth', 'Hristopoulos, Maria', 'Totpal, Klara', 'Stainton, Shannon', 'Lu, Elizabeth', 'Wong, Alfred', 'Tam, Lucinda', 'Newman, Robert', 'Vuillemenot, Brian R', 'Ellerman, Diego', 'Gu, Chen', 'Mathieu, Mary', 'Dennis, Mark S', 'Nguyen, Allen', 'Zheng, Bing', 'Zhang, Crystal', 'Lee, Genee', 'Chu, Yu-Waye', 'Prell, Rodney A', 'Lin, Kedan', 'Laing, Steven T', 'Polson, Andrew G']","['Leong SR', 'Sukumaran S', 'Hristopoulos M', 'Totpal K', 'Stainton S', 'Lu E', 'Wong A', 'Tam L', 'Newman R', 'Vuillemenot BR', 'Ellerman D', 'Gu C', 'Mathieu M', 'Dennis MS', 'Nguyen A', 'Zheng B', 'Zhang C', 'Lee G', 'Chu YW', 'Prell RA', 'Lin K', 'Laing ST', 'Polson AG']","['Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Research and Early Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.']",,20161201,,PMC5290988,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of 1b in K562 cells. Treatment with compound 1b caused K562 cells to adopt a typical apoptotic morphology. Flow cytometric analysis also confirmed the presence of an apoptotic cell population following treatment of Annexin-V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) double-labeled K562 cells with 1b. Furthermore, we observed dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activation, and a reduction of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in these cells, which suggest that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is induced by 1b in K562 cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that compound 1b notably induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells, which might have a potential anticancer activity.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In order to achieve more effective chemotherapeutic treatments, it is important to develop P-gp inhibitors to block/decrease its activity. Curcumin (1) is a secondary metabolite isolated from the turmeric of Curcuma longa L.. Diverse biological activities have been identified for this compound, particularly, MDR modulation in various cancer cell models. However, curcumin (1) has low chemical stability, which severely limits its application. In order to improve stability and P-gp inhibitory effect, two potential more stable curcumin derivatives were synthesized as building blocks, followed by several curcumin derivatives. These compounds were then analyzed in terms of antitumor and anti-P-gp activity, in two MDR and sensitive tumor lines (from chronic myeloid leukemia and non-small cell lung cancer). We identified from a series of curcumin derivatives a novel curcumin derivative (1,7-bis(3-methoxy-4-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)phenyl)hepta-1,6-diene-3,5-dione, 10) with more potent antitumor and anti-P-gp activity than curcumin (1). This compound (10) was shown to promote cell cycle arrest (at the G2/M phase) and induce apoptosis in the MDR chronic myeloid leukemia cell line. Therefore it is a really interesting P-gp inhibitor due to its ability to inhibit both P-gp function and expression.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To improve therapeutic strategies, it is critical to better understand the mechanisms that underlie AML progression. Here we show that the integrin binding glycoprotein CD98 plays a central role in AML. CD98 promotes AML propagation and lethality by driving engagement of leukemia cells with their microenvironment and maintaining leukemic stem cells. Further, delivery of a humanized anti-CD98 antibody blocks growth of patient-derived AML, highlighting the importance of this pathway in human disease. These findings indicate that microenvironmental interactions are key regulators of AML and that disrupting these signals with targeted inhibitors such as CD98 antibodies may be a valuable therapeutic approach for adults and children with this disease.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Imatinib, an ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is dramatically effective in CML patients; however, 30% of CML patients will need further treatment due to progression of CML to blast crisis (BC). Aberrant high expression of ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) is frequently observed in CML during myeloid-BC as a potent driver with a CML stem cell signature; however, the precise molecular mechanism of EVI1 transcriptional regulation during CML progression is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate the transcriptional activity of EVI1 is dependent on activation of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1)/beta-catenin complex by BCR-ABL with loss of p53 function during CML-BC. The activation of beta-catenin is partly dependent on BCR-ABL expression through enhanced GSK3beta phosphorylation, and EVI1 expression is directly enhanced by the LEF1/beta-catenin complex bound to the EVI1 promoter region. Moreover, the loss of p53 expression is inversely correlated with high expression of EVI1 in CML leukemia cells with an aggressive phase of CML, and a portion of the activation mechanism of EVI1 expression is dependent on beta-catenin activation through GSK3beta phosphorylation by loss of p53. Therefore, we found that the EVI1 activation in CML-BC is dependent on LEF1/beta-catenin activation by BCR-ABL expression with loss of p53 function, representing a novel selective therapeutic approach targeting myeloid blast crisis progression.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The atypical pseudokinase domain retains a regulated binding platform for substrates, which are ubiquitinated by context-specific E3 ligases. This plastic configuration has also been exploited as a scaffold to support the modulation of canonical MAPK and AKT modules. In this review, we discuss the evolution of TRIBs and their roles in vertebrate cell biology. TRIB2 is the most ancestral member of the family, whereas the emergence of TRIB3 homologs in mammals supports additional biological roles, many of which are currently being dissected.

Accordingly, induction of complete senescence is a sensible strategy for anti-leukemia therapy. However, effective senescence-based anti-leukemia drugs with low toxicity are currently lacking. In this study, we found that triptonide (chemical name diterpene triepoxide), a small molecule derived from the herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook, strongly induced complete senescence in cultured acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, and potently inhibited growth and colony formation of U937 and HL-60 AML cell line with IC50 values of 7.5 and 12nM, respectively. Strikingly, triptonide (4mg/kg) nearly completely suppressed human leukemia cell tumorigenicity (>99%) without obvious toxicity in a mouse xenograft model. Mechanistic studies showed that triptonide induced senescence followed by apoptosis mainly by suppressing transcription of TERT and oncogenic c-Myc, while concomitantly promoting transcription of senescence-promoting genes p16 and p21 and the pro-apoptotic gene encoding DNA damage-inducible transcript 3. These effects of triptonide are mediated by selective mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-3/p38 signaling pathway activation. Our study provides a conceptual framework for inducing complete senescence as an effective anti-leukemia therapeutic strategy through a ""multiple-hits"" model and supports further development of triptonide as an anti-cancer agent.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of this agent against CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis and oxidative status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental fibrosis was induced in Wistar male rats by 12 weeks of CCl4 administration (i.p.). During the last 8 weeks of injection, rats were gavaged daily with Dasatinib (10 mg/kg). To evaluate anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of Dasatinib, histopathological examination of liver tissue was performed and serum ALT and AST activities, oxidant, antioxidant parameters and hepatic tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were examined. Moreover, transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and TNF-alpha mRNA expressions were also evaluated by real time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Dasatinib administration induced a significant reduction of ALT and AST activities (p < .001) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) content in CCl4 injected rats (p < .05). Concomitantly hepatic protein and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, mRNA expression of TGF-beta1 and PDGF were increased due to CCl4 intoxication (p < .001), but Dasatinib treatment could significantly ameliorate these mediators at the level of gene expression (p < .01) and protein level of TNF-alpha (p < .001). The necro-inflammatory changes in histopathological finding, nitric oxide and hydroxyproline level were also increased during 12 weeks of CCl4 administration which was significantly attenuated by Dasatinib (p < .01).

Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) is an adrenal androgen commonly used as a marker of HPA function. In the general population, a low level of DHEAS has been associated with poorer cognition. At >/=2years post-treatment, we examined the association of DHEAS with attention outcomes in 35 male and 34 female long-term survivors of childhood ALL (mean[standard deviation] age at evaluation 14.5[4.7] years; 7.5[1.9] years post-diagnosis) who were treated with only chemotherapy and without prophylactic cranial irradiation. Male survivors with low-normal levels of DHEAS had worse performance than male survivors with high levels of DHEAS on multiple measures of attention (all P's<0.05). However, association between DHEAS and attention measures were not found in female survivors. Our results suggest that survivors of ALL who suffer from partial but persistent adrenal insufficiency may be at risk for neurocognitive deficits.

We describe the establishment and molecular characteristics of the DLBCL cell line U-2946. This cell line was derived from a 52-year-old male with DLBCL. U-2946 cells carried the chromosomal translocation t(8;14) and strongly expressed MYC, but not the mature B-cell lymphoma associated oncogenes BCL2 and BCL6. Instead, U-2946 cells expressed the antiapoptotic BCL2 family member MCL1 which was highly amplified genomically (14n). MCL1 amplification is recurrent in DLBCL, especially in the activated B cell (ABC) variant. Results of microarray expression cluster analysis placed U-2946 together with ABC-, but apart from germinal center (GC)-type DLBCL cell lines. The 1q21.3 region including MCL1 was focally coamplified with a short region of 17p11.2 (also present at 14n). The MCL1 inhibitor A-1210477 triggered apoptosis in U-2946 (MCL1pos/BCL2neg) cells. In contrast to BCL2pos DLBCL cell lines, U-2946 did not respond to the BCL2 inhibitor ABT-263.

Several parts of the plant are used in folk medicine, and the leaf and bark extracts have anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and antimicrobial properties. In this study, we investigated the chemical composition of the ethanolic extract of Hancornia speciosa leaves (EEHS) and its antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities as well as the mechanisms involved in cell death. The chemical compounds were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The antioxidant activity of the EEHS was investigated using the method that involves the scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radicals as well as the inhibition of oxidative hemolysis and lipid peroxidation induced by 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) in human erythrocytes. The antimicrobial activity was determined by calculating the minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, minimum fungicidal concentration, and zone of inhibition. Kasumi-1 leukemic cells were used to assess the cytotoxic activity and mechanisms involved in cell death promoted by the EEHS. The chemical compounds identified were quinic acid, chlorogenic acid, catechin, rutin, isoquercitrin, kaempferol-rutinoside, and catechin-pentoside. The EEHS demonstrated antioxidant activity via the sequestration of free radicals, inhibition of hemolysis, and inhibition of lipid peroxidation in human erythrocytes incubated with an oxidizing agent. The antimicrobial activity was observed against American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and hospital strains of bacteria and fungi, filamentous fungi and dermatophytes. The cytotoxic activity of the EEHS was induced by apoptosis, reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of cathepsins. Together, these results indicate the presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in the EEHS and that their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities in acute myeloid leukemia cells are mediated by apoptosis.",,"['Santos, Uilson P', 'Campos, Jaqueline F', 'Torquato, Heron Fernandes V', 'Paredes-Gamero, Edgar Julian', 'Carollo, Carlos Alexandre', 'Estevinho, Leticia M', 'de Picoli Souza, Kely', 'Dos Santos, Edson Lucas']","['Santos UP', 'Campos JF', 'Torquato HF', 'Paredes-Gamero EJ', 'Carollo CA', 'Estevinho LM', 'de Picoli Souza K', 'Dos Santos EL']","['School of Environmental and Biological Science, Federal University of Grande Dourados, Rodovia Dourados Ithaum, Dourados, MS, Brazil.', 'School of Environmental and Biological Science, Federal University of Grande Dourados, Rodovia Dourados Ithaum, Dourados, MS, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Center for Interdisciplinary Research Biochemistry, University of Mogi das Cruzes, Av.

Mast cells can regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses and are key effectors in allergic diseases and inflammation. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are one of the most prevalent nanomaterials used in consumer products due to their antimicrobial properties. We have previously shown that AgNPs induce mast cell degranulation that was dependent on nanoparticle physicochemical properties. Furthermore, we identified a role for scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) in AgNP-mediated mast cell degranulation. However, it is completely unknown how SR-B1 mediates mast cell degranulation and the intracellular signaling pathways involved. In the current study, we hypothesized that SR-B1 interaction with AgNPs directs mast cell degranulation through activation of signal transduction pathways that culminate in an increase in intracellular calcium signal leading to mast cell degranulation. For these studies, we utilized bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) isolated from C57Bl/6 mice and RBL-2H3 cells (rat basophilic leukemia cell line). Our data support our hypothesis and show that AgNP-directed mast cell degranulation involves activation of PI3K, PLCgamma and an increase in intracellular calcium levels. Moreover, we found that influx of extracellular calcium is required for the cells to degranulate in response to AgNP exposure and is mediated at least partially via the CRAC channels. Taken together, our results provide new insights into AgNP-induced mast cell activation that are key for designing novel ENMs that are devoid of immune system activation.",,"['Alsaleh, Nasser B', 'Persaud, Indushekhar', 'Brown, Jared M']","['Alsaleh NB', 'Persaud I', 'Brown JM']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.']",['R01 ES019311/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],20161201,,PMC5131952,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant about 25% of patients still succumb to disease relapse, therefore, novel strategies are needed to improve the outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed an immunotherapeutic strategy targeting the CD33 myeloid antigen, expressed in ~ 85-90% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, using chimeric antigen receptor redirected T-cells. Considering that administration of CAR T-cells has been associated with cytokine release syndrome and other potential off-tumor effects in patients, safety measures were here investigated and reported. We genetically modified human activated T-cells from healthy donors or patients with acute myeloid leukemia with retroviral supernatant encoding the inducible Caspase9 suicide gene, a DeltaCD19 selectable marker, and a humanized third generation chimeric antigen receptor recognizing human CD33. DeltaCD19 selected inducible Caspase9-CAR.CD33 T-cells had a 75+/-3.8% (average +/- standard error of the mean) chimeric antigen receptor expression, were able to specifically lyse CD33+ targets in vitro, including freshly isolated leukemic blasts from patients, produce significant amount of tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, express the CD107a degranulation marker, and proliferate upon antigen specific stimulation. Challenging DeltaCD19 selected inducible Caspase9-CAR.CD33 T-cells with programmed-death-ligand-1 enriched leukemia blasts resulted in significant killing like observed for the programmed-death-ligand-1 negative leukemic blasts fraction. Since the administration of 10 nanomolar of a non-therapeutic dimerizer to activate the suicide gene resulted in the elimination of only 76.4+/-2.0% gene modified cells in vitro, we found that co-administration of the dimerizer with either the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199, the pan-BCL inhibitor ABT-737, or mafosfamide, resulted in an additive effect up to complete cell elimination. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy could be investigated for the safety of CAR T-cell applications, and targeting CD33 could be used as a 'bridge"" therapy for patients coming to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, as anti-leukemia activity from infusing CAR.CD33 T-cells has been demonstrated in an ongoing clinical trial.

The results of in vivo testing, using the L1210 lymphocytic leukaemia model, at the equimolar doses of Pt with cisplatin (2 mg/kg) confirmed the activity of complex 8 comparable to cisplatin. From the mechanistic point of view, evaluated ex vivo by Western blot analyses on the samples of isolated tumour tissues, the treatment of the animals with complex 8, contrary to cisplatin, decreased the levels of tumour suppressor p53 and increased significantly the amount of intracellular anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1L (37 kDa). Additionally, the active form of caspase 3 was significantly elevated in the sample of tumour tissues treated with complex 8, indicating that the activation of p53-independent cell-death pathway was initiated. The light and electron microscopy observations of the cancerous tissues revealed necrosis as a dominant mechanism of cell death, followed by scarce signs of apoptosis. The additional results (e.g. in vitro interaction experiments with selected biomolecules, cell cycle perturbations, gel electrophoretic studies on pUC19 plasmid DNA) supported the hypothesis that the complexes might be involved in the mechanism of action quite different from cisplatin.",,"['Starha, Pavel', 'Vanco, Jan', 'Travnicek, Zdenek', 'Hosek, Jan', 'Klusakova, Jarmila', 'Dvorak, Zdenek']","['Starha P', 'Vanco J', 'Travnicek Z', 'Hosek J', 'Klusakova J', 'Dvorak Z']","['Department of Inorganic Chemistry & Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials, Faculty of Science, Palacky University in Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Inorganic Chemistry & Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials, Faculty of Science, Palacky University in Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Inorganic Chemistry & Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials, Faculty of Science, Palacky University in Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Inorganic Chemistry & Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials, Faculty of Science, Palacky University in Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Human Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Genetics & Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials, Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Palacky University in Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",,20161201,,PMC5131915,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The glycolytic enzyme alpha-enolase (ENO1) is the most frequently recognized antigen (i.e. 54% of CLL sera). We show that ENO1 is upregulated in the proliferating B-cell fraction of CLL lymph nodes. In CLL cells of the peripheral blood, ENO1 is exclusively expressed at the intracellular level, whereas it is exposed on the surface of apoptotic leukemic cells.From the clinical standpoint, patients with progressive CLL show a higher number of antigen recognitions compared to patients with stable disease. Consistently, the anti-ENO1 antibodies are prevalent in sera from patients with progressive disease and their presence is predictive of a shorter time to first treatment. This clinical inefficacy associates with the inability of patients' sera to trigger complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against leukemic cells.Together, these results indicate that antibody responses toward tumor-derived antigens are frequently detectable in sera from patients with CLL, but they are expression of a disrupted immune system and unable to hamper disease progression.",,"['Griggio, Valentina', 'Mandili, Giorgia', 'Vitale, Candida', 'Capello, Michela', 'Macor, Paolo', 'Serra, Sara', 'Castella, Barbara', 'Peola, Silvia', 'Foglietta, Myriam', 'Drandi, Daniela', 'Omede, Paola', 'Sblattero, Daniele', 'Cappello, Paola', 'Chiarle, Roberto', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Novelli, Francesco', 'Massaia, Massimo', 'Coscia, Marta']","['Griggio V', 'Mandili G', 'Vitale C', 'Capello M', 'Macor P', 'Serra S', 'Castella B', 'Peola S', 'Foglietta M', 'Drandi D', 'Omede P', 'Sblattero D', 'Cappello P', 'Chiarle R', 'Deaglio S', 'Boccadoro M', 'Novelli F', 'Massaia M', 'Coscia M']","['Division of Hematology, University of Torino, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Torino, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences -

DNA was degraded to its deoxynucleotides for quantification by LC-MS-MS, gradient chromatography on a Phenomenex prodigy-3-ODS with positive ionization.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar puncture is an invasive procedure, causing psychological changes and physical discomfort in patients. In a previous study, it was proved that distraction intervention, such as music therapy, relieves pain and anxiety. There is limited evidence regarding the experience and needs of school-age children during lumbar puncture after being diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. To minimise their anxiety and pain during the procedure, it is important to collect information directly from these children. DESIGN: A descriptive qualitative research. METHODS: Twenty-one school-age children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia participated in semi-structured interviews at a Children's Hospital in China. Data were collected by an experienced and trained interviewer. Qualitative content analysis was chosen to describe experiences of children undergoing lumbar puncture. RESULTS: While undergoing lumbar puncture for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, school-age Chinese children experienced complex psychological feelings (fear, tension, helplessness, sadness and anxiety). They also experienced physical discomfort. They had multipolar needs, such as information, communication, respect, self-actualisation, environment and equipment. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified important areas that must be closely monitored by healthcare staff, performing lumbar puncture on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia children. Thus, a successful and smooth procedure can be performed on these patients, and their quality of life can be improved. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The experiences described in this study contribute to a better understanding of the needs of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia children undergoing lumbar puncture. They also provide valuable information to professional medical care staff that develops future nursing assessments.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Xie, Anwei', 'Shan, Yuying', 'Niu, Mei E', 'Chen, Yi', 'Wang, Xiya']","['Xie A', 'Shan Y', 'Niu ME', 'Chen Y', 'Wang X']","[""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",,20170217,,,['NOTNLM'],"['leukaemia', 'lumbar puncture', 'nursing needs', 'qualitative research', 'school age']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Dec 1.,10.1002/cncr.30400 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a valid therapeutic option for patients with good-risk and intermediate-risk disease. The authors used the registry of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation to compare combined busulfan and melphalan (BUMEL) with combined busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BUCY) before transplantation. METHODS: From 2005 to 2013, 853 patients with available cytogenetics underwent ASCT in first remission, including 257 after receiving BUMEL and 596 after receiving BUCY. The proportion of patients with good-risk AML was lower in those who received BUMEL (14% vs 20%; P = .02). More patients who received BUMEL underwent autograft in molecular remission (89% vs 78%; P = .02). Three years after transplantation, the relapse incidence (RI) was 48.7%, the leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate was 47.7%, the overall survival (OS) rate was 66.2%, and the nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate was 3.6%. RESULTS: Patients who underwent an autograft after receiving BUMEL fared better than those who underwent an autograft after receiving BUCY with a lower RI (39.5% vs 52.2%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.87; P = .003) a better LFS (55.4% vs 44.6%; HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.89; P = .005), and a better OS (73.8% vs 63%; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47-0.82; P = .0007). There was no difference in the NRM rate (BUMEL vs BUCY, 4.5% vs 3.2%, respectively). Among 74 patients in the BUMEL group and 187 in the BUCY group who underwent autograft in molecular remission, the RI was 30% versus 51%, respectively (univariate analysis; P = .01), and the LFS rate was 66% versus 47%, respectively (univariate analysis; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AML in first complete remission who undergo ASCT, the BUMEL combination is a better preparative regimen. Cancer 2017;123:824-31.

The NPM1-mutated cell line OCI-AML3 and normal karyotype primary AML cells with NPM1 mutations were significantly more sensitive towards AVA than cells expressing wild-type (wt) NPM1. Furthermore, the presence of wt p53 sensitized cells toward AVA. Cells exhibiting fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication mutations also displayed a trend toward increased sensitivity to AVA. AVA treatment induced nuclear retention of the NPM1 mutant protein (NPMc+) in OCI-AML3 cells and primary AML cells, caused proteasomal degradation of NPMc+ and the nuclear export factor CRM1 and downregulated wt FLT3 protein. In addition, both AVA and its analog induced differentiation of OCI-AML3 cells together with an increased phagocytotic activity and oxidative burst potential.

According to this approval of idelalisib, the G-BA distinguished between 2 subindications within the therapeutic indication CLL: pretreated patients and treatment-naive patients with 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation. The G-BA further divided pretreated patients into 4 subpopulations. Accordingly, the assessment was conducted for a total of 5 research questions versus the ACT specified by the G-BA. The research questions and the corresponding ACTs are shown. For research questions 1a to 1d, the company deviated from the G-BA's differentiation of the therapeutic indication. In contrast to the G-BA, the company summarized the populations of patients with relapsed and refractory CLL. This approach was not followed in the present benefit assessment. The following deviations versus the ACT specified by the G-BA result from the different division of the target population by the company for research question 1c:The company named chemotherapy in combination with rituximab specified by the physician and under consideration of the approval status as ACT for patients with refractory CLL for whom antineoplastic treatment including chemotherapy is indicated. This regimen is an option within the ACT defined by the G-BA, but it is not indicated in all patients eligible for chemotherapy in the population of research question 1c. For example, rituximab-refractory patients may be treated with a different, individually optimized treatment. For patients for whom antineoplastic treatment, but no chemotherapy is indicated, the company specified best supportive care (BSC) as comparator therapy. However, other antineoplastic treatments (except chemotherapy), which are to be used individually, are an option for these patients.","['Copyright (c) 2014 by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare', '(IQWiG).']",,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['idelalisib', 'leukemia -- lymphocytic -- chronic -- B-cell', 'Benefit assessment']",,,['Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care'],,,,,,,,20161202,['Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG)'],['IQWiG Dossier Assessment Extracts'],['Idelalisib -- Benefit Assessment According to section sign35a Social Code Book V'],['2016/12/02 06:01'],,

Epub 2017 Feb 7.,10.1111/his.13137 [doi],"AIMS: Richter transformation (RT) occurs in 5-10% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), and is associated with a poor outcome. The histological manifestations of RT are variable, and include an increase in the proportion of prolymphocytes, immunoblasts, and other pleomorphic cells, along with an increased proliferation rate and often necrosis. Rarely, superimposed herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection involving lymph nodes in patients with CLL/SLL may mimic RT clinically and histologically. In this study, we describe four cases of CLL/SLL with superimposed HSV lymphadenitis, and we review the literature. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe the clinicopathological and immunophenotypic findings of four cases of CLL/SLL with superimposed HSV infection. The patients presented with B-type symptoms, and laboratory and imaging findings suggested progression of lymphoma. Histologically, there were geographical areas of necrosis and increased numbers of prolymphocytes and immunoblasts, in some areas forming sheets, with increased mitotic figures and a high proliferation (Ki67) rate. However, the necrotic regions were associated with acute inflammatory cells and larger cells, mostly necrotic, showing viral cytopathic effects. Therapy with antiviral agents resulted in improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory and imaging findings. Additionally, we identified 11 cases of CLL/SLL with superimposed HSV infection described in the English-language literature, and integrated the cases that we report here into this wider context. CONCLUSIONS: Herpes simplex virus infection of lymph nodes in patients with CLL/SLL results in clinicopathological and radiological findings that may mimic RT. It is essential to refrain from misclassifying these cases as RT, as patients can respond remarkably well to antiviral therapy.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Salem, Alireza', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Agbay, Rose Lou Marie C', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['Salem A', 'Loghavi S', 'Khoury JD', 'Agbay RL', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",,20170207,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL/SLL', 'Richter', 'Transformation', 'herpes']",,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8980-3202', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2621-3584', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5309-7104', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6577-8006']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the beta-like globin gene locus is tightly regulated by DNA methylation, is HMA-sensitive in vitro, and fetal haemoglobin (HbF) expression is under study as a potential biomarker for response of MDS patients to azacitidine. We determined HbF expression in 16 MDS and 36 AML patients receiving decitabine (DAC). Pre-treatment HbF was already elevated (>1.0% of total haemoglobin) in 7/16 and 12/36 patients, and HbF was induced by DAC in 81%/54% of MDS/AML patients, respectively. Elevated pre-treatment HbF was associated with longer median overall survival (OS): 26.6 vs. 8.6 months for MDS (hazard ratio [HR] 8.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.74-42.49, P = 0.008, with similarly longer progression-free and AML-free survival), and 10.0 vs. 2.9 months OS for AML (HR 3.01, 95% CI 1.26-7.22, P = 0.014). In a multivariate analysis, the prognostic value of HbF was retained. Time-dependent Cox models revealed that the prognostic value of treatment-induced HbF induction was inferior to that of pre-treatment HbF.

Epub 2016 Dec 1.,10.18388/abp.2016_1396 [doi] 1396 [pii],"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) results from the t(9;22) reciprocal chromosomal translocation producing the BCR-ABL1 gene, conferring growth and proliferation advantages in the CML cells. CML progresses from chronic, often syndrome-free, to blast phase, fatal if not treated. Although the involvement of BCR-ABL1 in some signaling pathways is considered as the cause of CML, the mechanisms resulting in its progression are not completely known. However, BCR-ABL1 stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which levels increase with CML progression and induce BCR-ABL1 self-mutagenesis. Introducing imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to CML therapy radically improved its outcome, but TKIs-resistance became an emerging problem. TKI resistance can be associated with even higher ROS production than in TKI-sensitive cells. Therefore, ROS-induced self-mutagenesis of BCR-ABL1 can be crucial for CML progression and TKI resistance and in this way should be taken into account in therapeutic strategies. As a continuous production of ROS by BCR-ABL1 would lead to its self-destruction and death of CML cells, there must be mechanisms controlling this phenomenon. These can be dependent on DNA repair, which is modulated by BCR-ABL1 and can be different in CML stem and progenitor cells. Altogether, the mechanisms of the involvement of BCR-ABL1 in ROS signaling can be engaged in CML progression and TKI-resistance and warrant further study.",,"['Antoszewska-Smith, Joanna', 'Pawlowska, Elzbieta', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Antoszewska-Smith J', 'Pawlowska E', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Maxillofacial Orthopedics and Orthodontics, Medical University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Orthodontics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",,20161201,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA damage', '*DNA repair', '*cancer stem cells', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*imatinib resistance', '*reactive oxygen species']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we report the first case of an autochthonous mycetoma case in continental France that originated from a new Nocardia species. A Gram-positive filamentous bacterium (OFN 14.177(T)) was isolated from a pus sample from the mycetoma of a male French patient 92 years old suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The isolate was analyzed by a polyphasic taxonomic approach by coupling morphological, biochemical, physiological, and chemotaxonomic aspects to genomic and phylogenetic analyses. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) using four housekeeping genes (16S rRNA gene, secA1, hsp65, and sod) combined with phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strain OFN 14.177(T) is phylogenetically closer not only to Nocardia altamirensis but also to all other species comprising the Nocardia brasiliensis clade (i.e., N. brasiliensis, N. altamirensis, N. vulneris, N. iowensis, and N. tenerifensis), some of which present cutaneous tropism. The G+C content of isolate OFN 14.177(T) was 68.2 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridization analyses demonstrated 38.25% relative reassociation with N. altamirensis. The strain OFN 14.177(T) is different from the closest species at genetic and phenotypical levels, and the data obtained indicate that it should be recognized as a new species, for which the name of Nocardia boironii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is OFN 14.177(T) (= EML 1451 = DSM 101696). IMPORTANCE Bacterial mycetoma is an endemic infection in areas with tropical and subtropical climates. Thus, its presence in temperate climate areas remains rare. We report here the first case of autochthonous actinomycetoma in continental France originating from a Nocardia species other than N. brasiliensis, namely, Nocardia boironii. Considering the history of the patient, the infection source of strain OFN 14.177(T) may be from frequent contact with the soil over many years because of his gardening activities.

This research aimed to investigate the mechanisms regulating CREMalpha expression in SLE. RESULTS: From the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) microarray data, we found a sharply increased H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) amount at the CREMalpha promoter in SLE CD4+ T cells compared to controls. Then, by ChIP and real-time PCR, we confirmed this result. Moreover, H3K4me3 amount at the promoter was positively correlated with CREMalpha mRNA level in SLE CD4+ T cells. In addition, a striking increase was observed in SET domain containing 1 (Set1) enrichment, but no marked change in mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) enrichment at the CREMalpha promoter in SLE CD4+ T cells. We also proved Set1 enrichment was positively correlated with both H3K4me3 amount at the CREMalpha promoter and CREMalpha mRNA level in SLE CD4+ T cells. Knocking down Set1 with siRNA in SLE CD4+ T cells decreased Set1 and H3K4me3 enrichments, and elevated the levels of DNMT3a and DNA methylation, while the amounts of H3 acetylation (H3ac) and H4 acetylation (H4ac) didn't alter greatly at the CREMalpha promoter. All these changes inhibited the expression of CREMalpha, then augmented IL-2 and down-modulated IL-17A productions. Subsequently, we observed that DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 3a enrichment at the CREMalpha promoter was down-regulated significantly in SLE CD4+ T cells, and H3K4me3 amount was negatively correlated with both DNA methylation level and DNMT3a enrichment at the CREMalpha promoter in SLE CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: In SLE CD4+ T cells, increased Set1 enrichment up-regulates H3K4me3 amount at the CREMalpha promoter, which antagonizes DNMT3a and suppresses DNA methylation within this region. All these factors induce CREMalpha overexpression, consequently result in IL-2 under-expression and IL-17A overproduction, and contribute to SLE at last.

The objective of this study was to estimate the relapse-free survival of ALL patients treated uniformly with MCP 841 protocol on the basis of various prognostic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study design was retrospective and it was conducted in a regional cancer center of Northwest India. Three hundred and ten ALL patients who underwent treatment with MCP 841 protocol and regular follow-up for up to 5 years were selected for this study. Relapse-free survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazards ratio (HR) using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software for windows version 20.0. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent patients were <15 years of age and 69% were males. 53.2% patients were in remission at the end of 5 years of starting the treatment. Relapse-free survival at 5 years by Kaplan-Meir analysis for B-cell ALL was 62% [HR 0.67 {95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.95}] with patients with unknown lineage taken as reference] while for T cell it was 28% [HR 1.41 (95% CI 1.19-1.63), P 0.001].

The effects of IDH mutations on clinical features and treatment outcome in AML-NK have been widely investigated, but only a few studies monitored these mutations during follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our study samples from 110 adult de novo AML-NK were studied for the presence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, their associations with other prognostic markers and disease outcome. We also analyzed the stability of these mutations during the course of the disease in complete remission (CR) and relapse. RESULTS: IDH mutations were found in 25 (23%) patients. IDH+ patients tend to have lower CR rate compared to IDH-patients (44% vs 62.2%, p = 0.152), and had slightly lower disease free survival (12 months vs 17 months; p = 0.091). On the other hand, the presence of IDH mutations had significant impact on overall survival (2 vs 7 months; p = 0.039). The stability of IDH mutations were studied sequentially in 19 IDH+ patients. All of them lost the mutation in CR, and the same IDH mutations were detected in relapsed samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the presence of IDH mutations confer an adverse effect in AML-NK patients, which in combination with other molecular markers can lead to an improved risk stratification and better treatment.

The patients underwent clinical examination, human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) screening, skin biopsy with hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry staining. RESULTS: Among 35 cases, 33 (94.3%) were T-cell, and 2 (5.7%) were B-cell lymphomas. The mean age was 52.66, and the male to female ratio was 2.5:1.

The morphological types of MF included polymorphic, poikilodermatous, folliculotropic, hypopigmented, hyperpigmented, mixed, and purpuric. Skin manifestations of ATL included ulcerated plaques and erythroderma. Epidermotropism was very marked in ATL (83.3%) than in MF (70%). Larger Pautrier's microabscess was noted in ATL compared to smaller ones in MF. Markedly dense, diffuse infiltrate of atypical cells was noted in ATL in contrast to mild to moderate nodular or perivascular infiltrate in MF. ATL had an extremely poor prognosis. LIMITATIONS: Identification of DNA integration of HTLV-1 by Southern blot could not be analyzed, and the number of cases studied is limited.

Considering the inherent limitations of NGS, we deployed bioinformatics algorithms for qualitative curation of T-cell receptor rearrangements, and included multiple types of controls. Overall, we document the clonal architecture of the T-cell repertoire in CLL. These T-cell clones persist and further expand overtime, and can be shared by different patients, most especially patients belonging to the same stereotyped subset. Notably, these shared clonotypes appear to be disease-specific, as they are found in neither public databases nor healthy controls. Altogether, these findings indicate that antigen drive likely underlies T-cell expansions in CLL and may be acting in a CLL subset-specific context. Whether these are the same antigens interacting with the malignant clone or tumor-derived antigens remains to be elucidated.",,"['Vardi, A', 'Vlachonikola, E', 'Karypidou, M', 'Stalika, E', 'Bikos, V', 'Gemenetzi, K', 'Maramis, C', 'Siorenta, A', 'Anagnostopoulos, A', 'Pospisilova, S', 'Maglaveras, N', 'Chouvarda, I', 'Stamatopoulos, K', 'Hadzidimitriou, A']","['Vardi A', 'Vlachonikola E', 'Karypidou M', 'Stalika E', 'Bikos V', 'Gemenetzi K', 'Maramis C', 'Siorenta A', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Pospisilova S', 'Maglaveras N', 'Chouvarda I', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Hadzidimitriou A']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

A lower rate of very good partial response (VGPR) or better was observed in patients with t(11;14) treated with bortezomib-based (52% vs 77%; P=0.004) and IMiD-based regimens (13% vs 54%; P=0.04) compared with those lacking t(11;14). This corresponded to an inferior overall survival (OS) in t(11;14)-positive bortezomib-treated (median 15 vs 27 months; P=0.05) and IMiD-treated patients (median 12 vs 32 months; P=0.05).

Epub 2016 Dec 1.,10.1038/leu.2016.368 [doi],"Signaling via the B cell receptor (BCR) plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This is underscored by the clinical effectiveness of ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) that can block BCR-signaling. However, ibrutinib cannot induce complete responses (CR) or durable remissions without continued therapy, suggesting alternative pathways also contribute to CLL growth/survival that are independent of BCR-signaling. ROR1 is a receptor for Wnt5a, which can promote activation of Rac1 to enhance CLL-cell proliferation and survival. In this study, we found that CLL cells of patients treated with ibrutinib had activated Rac1. Moreover, Wnt5a could induce Rac1 activation and enhance proliferation of CLL cells treated with ibrutinib at concentrations that were effective in completely inhibiting BTK and BCR-signaling. Wnt5a-induced Rac1 activation could be blocked by cirmtuzumab (UC-961), an anti-ROR1 mAb. We found that treatment with cirmtuzumab and ibrutinib was significantly more effective than treatment with either agent alone in clearing leukemia cells in vivo. This study indicates that cirmtuzumab may enhance the activity of ibrutinib in the treatment of patients with CLL or other ROR1(+) B-cell malignancies.",,"['Yu, J', 'Chen, L', 'Cui, B', 'Wu, Christina', 'Choi, M Y', 'Chen, Y', 'Zhang, L', 'Rassenti, L Z', 'Widhopf Ii, G F', 'Kipps, T J']","['Yu J', 'Chen L', 'Cui B', 'Wu C', 'Choi MY', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang L', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Widhopf Ii GF', 'Kipps TJ']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20161201,,PMC5462858,,,,,,['NIHMS828202'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, TIMP-1 has been shown to be involved in cancer progression. However, its role in leukemic microenvironment has not been addressed. Here, we investigated the activity of TIMP-1 on Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) cell functions. First, we found that TIMP-1 levels were increased in the BM plasma of AML patients at diagnosis. In vitro, recombinant human (rh)TIMP-1 promoted the survival and cell cycle S-phase entry of AML cells. These kinetic effects were related to the downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. rhTIMP-1 increases CXCL12-driven migration of leukemic cells through PI3K signaling. Interestingly, activation of CD63 receptor was required for TIMP-1's cytokine/chemokine activity. Of note, rhTIMP-1 stimulation modulated mRNA expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF)-1alpha, downstream of PI3K/Akt activation. We then co-cultured AML cells with normal or leukemic mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to investigate the interaction of TIMP-1 with cellular component(s) of BM microenvironment. Our results showed that the proliferation and migration of leukemic cells were greatly enhanced by rhTIMP-1 in presence of AML-MSCs as compared to normal MSCs. Thus, we demonstrated that TIMP-1 modulates leukemic blasts survival, migration and function via CD63/PI3K/Akt/p21 signaling.

In this study, we combined a genome-wide haplotype association study (GWHAS) and gene prioritization strategy to mine AML-related genetic affect factors and understand its pathogenesis. A total of 175 AML patients were downloaded from the public GEO database (GSE32462) and 218 matched Caucasian controls were from the HapMap Project. We first identified the linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks and performed a GWHAS to scan AML-related haplotypes. Then we mapped these haplotypes to the corresponding genes as candidate. And finally, we prioritized all the AML candidate genes based on the similarity with 38 known AML susceptibility genes. The results showed that 1754 haplotypes were significant associated with AML (P<1E-5) and mapped to 591 candidate genes. After prioritizing all 591 AML candidate genes, we obtained four genes ranking at the front as AML risk genes: RUNX1, JAK1, PDGFRA, and FGFR2. Among them, RUNX1, JAK1 and PDGFRA had been confirmed as AML risk genes. In particular, we found that the gene FGFR2 was a novel AML susceptibility gene with a haplotype TT (rs7090018 and rs2912759) showed significant association with AML (P-value = 7.07E-06).

PML and other NB proteins act as cellular restriction factors against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV); however, this intrinsic defense is counteracted by the immediate early protein 1 (IE1) of HCMV. IE1 directly interacts with the PML coiled-coil domain via its globular core region and disrupts NB foci by inducing a loss of PML SUMOylation. Here, we demonstrate that IE1 acts via abrogating the de novo SUMOylation of PML. In order to overcome reversible SUMOylation dynamics, we made use of a cell-based assay that combines inducible IE1 expression with a SUMO mutant resistant to SUMO proteases. Interestingly, we observed that IE1 expression did not affect preSUMOylated PML; however, it clearly prevented de novo SUMO conjugation. Consistent results were obtained by in vitro SUMOylation assays, demonstrating that IE1 alone is sufficient for this effect. Furthermore, IE1 acts in a selective manner, since K160 was identified as the main target lysine. This is strengthened by the fact that IE1 also prevents As2O3-mediated hyperSUMOylation of K160, thereby blocking PML degradation. Since IE1 did not interfere with coiled-coil-mediated PML dimerization, we propose that IE1 affects PML autoSUMOylation either by directly abrogating PML E3 ligase function or by preventing access to SUMO sites. Thus, our data suggest a novel mechanism for how a viral protein counteracts a cellular restriction factor by selectively preventing the de novo SUMOylation at specific lysine residues without affecting global protein SUMOylation. IMPORTANCE: The human cytomegalovirus IE1 protein acts as an important antagonist of a cellular restriction mechanism that is mediated by subnuclear structures termed PML nuclear bodies. This function of IE1 is required for efficient viral replication and thus constitutes a potential target for antiviral strategies. In this paper, we further elucidate the molecular mechanism for how IE1 antagonizes PML NBs. We show that tight binding of IE1 to PML interferes with the de novo SUMOylation of a distinct lysine residue that is also the target of stress-mediated hyperSUMOylation of PML. This is of importance since it represents a novel mechanism used by a viral antagonist of intrinsic immunity. Furthermore, it highlights the possibility of developing small molecules that specifically abrogate this PML-antagonistic activity of IE1 and thus inhibit viral replication.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Schilling, Eva-Maria', 'Scherer, Myriam', 'Reuter, Nina', 'Schweininger, Johannes', 'Muller, Yves A', 'Stamminger, Thomas']","['Schilling EM', 'Scherer M', 'Reuter N', 'Schweininger J', 'Muller YA', 'Stamminger T']","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Biotechnology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Biotechnology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany thomas.stamminger@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de.']",,20170131,,PMC5286881,['NOTNLM'],"['*PML nuclear bodies', '*human cytomegalovirus', '*immediate early 1', '*intrinsic immunity', '*nuclear domain 10', '*sumoylation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 30.,10.1177/1933719116681515 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Adenomyosis was found to have negative impacts on embryo implantation. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), proposed to be a molecular marker for endometrial receptivity, works through the LIF receptor (LIFR) on both the embryo and the endometrium. We aimed to evaluate the endometrial expression of LIF and LIFR and its subsequent signaling in patients with adenomyosis during the window of implantation (WOI). METHODS: Endometrium was obtained during the WOI from patients with adenomyosis (age <45 years) who underwent hysterectomy and from age-matched controls who had no endometriosis or adenomyosis. The LIF and LIFR expressions were measured by polymerase chain reaction for messenger RNA expression, immunohistochemistry for protein intensity and localization, and immunofluorescent staining for colocalization. The ratio of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation was measured by Western blot of both the endometrium and the isolated human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). RESULTS: Patients with adenomyosis showed significantly and parallelly reduced LIF and LIFR expressions in the eutopic endometrium during WOI as compared with the control women and subsequently with remarkably reduced activation of STAT3 and ERK signaling. The significantly increased STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation induced by the LIF treatment in the cultured ESCs supported the linkage between the LIF-LIFR reaction and the signaling cascade. CONCLUSION: Significant reduction in LIFR expression and the reduced activation of subsequent signaling strongly suggest a working model of how the implantation markers, LIF, may affect the endometrium of patients with adenomyosis. These molecular changes supported the declined implantation rates reported in patients with adenomyosis.",,"['Yen, Chih-Feng', 'Liao, Shuen-Kuei', 'Huang, S Joseph', 'Tabak, Selcuk', 'Arcuri, Felice', 'Lee, Chyi-Long', 'Arici, Aydin', 'Petraglia, Felice', 'Wang, Hsin-Shih', 'Kayisli, Umit A']","['Yen CF', 'Liao SK', 'Huang SJ', 'Tabak S', 'Arcuri F', 'Lee CL', 'Arici A', 'Petraglia F', 'Wang HS', 'Kayisli UA']","['1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kwei-Shan, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', '2 Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', '2 Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', '3 The PhD Program of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, Center of Excellence for Cancer Research, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', '4 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, E-Da Hospital, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', '5 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.', '6 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', '7 Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', '8 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Keelung, Taiwan.', '6 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', '7 Department of Molecular and Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', '1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kwei-Shan, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', '2 Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', '5 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.']",,20161130,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*adenomyosis', '*endometrium', '*leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)', '*signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3', '*window of implantation (WOI)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How these structures and other posttranscriptional signals affect RNA trafficking and translation in the context of single cells is poorly understood. Herein we describe a multicolor, long-term (>24 h) imaging strategy for measuring integrated aspects of viral RNA regulatory control in individual cells. We apply this strategy to demonstrate differential mRNA trafficking behaviors governed by RNA elements derived from three retroviruses (HIV-1, murine leukemia virus, and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus), two hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B virus and woodchuck hepatitis virus), and an intron-retaining transcript encoded by the cellular NXF1 gene. Striking behaviors include ""burst"" RNA nuclear export dynamics regulated by HIV-1's Rev response element and the viral Rev protein; transient aggregations of RNAs into discrete foci at or near the nuclear membrane triggered by multiple elements; and a novel, pulsiform RNA export activity regulated by the hepadnaviral posttranscriptional regulatory element. We incorporate single-cell tracking and a data-mining algorithm into our approach to obtain RNA element-specific, high-resolution gene expression signatures. Together these imaging assays constitute a tractable, systems-based platform for studying otherwise difficult to access spatiotemporal features of viral and cellular gene regulation.","['(c) 2017 Pocock et al.

Here, we describe the antileukemic activity and mechanism of action of T-3775440, a novel irreversible LSD1 inhibitor. Cell growth analysis of leukemia cell lines revealed that acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia cells (AMKL) were highly sensitive to this compound. T-3775440 treatment enforced transdifferentiation of erythroid/megakaryocytic lineages into granulomonocytic-like lineage cells. Mechanistically, T-3775440 disrupted the interaction between LSD1 and growth factor-independent 1B (GFI1B), a transcription factor critical for the differentiation processes of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineage cells. Knockdown of LSD1 and GFI1B recapitulated T-3775440-induced transdifferentiation and cell growth suppression, highlighting the significance of LSD1-GFI1B axis inhibition with regard to the anti-AML effects of T-3775440. Moreover, T-3775440 exhibited significant antitumor efficacy in AEL and AMKL xenograft models.

Epub 2016 Nov 10.,,"In hematological malignancies complex interactions exist between the immune system, microorganisms and malignant cells. On one hand, microorganisms can induce cancer, as illustrated by specific infection-induced lymphoproliferative diseases such as Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. On the other hand, malignant cells create an immunosuppressive environment for their own benefit, but this also results in an increased risk of infections. Disrupted innate immunity contributes to the neoplastic transformation of blood cells by several mechanisms, including the uncontrolled clearance of microbial and autoantigens resulting in chronic immune stimulation and proliferation, chronic inflammation, and defective immune surveillance and anti-cancer immunity. Restoring dysfunction or enhancing responsiveness of the innate immune system might therefore represent a new angle for the prevention and treatment of hematological malignancies, in particular lymphoid malignancies and associated infections. Recently, it has been shown that cells of the innate immune system, such as monocytes/macrophages and natural killer cells, harbor features of immunological memory and display enhanced functionality long-term after stimulation with certain microorganisms and vaccines. These functional changes rely on epigenetic reprogramming and have been termed 'trained immunity'. In this review the concept of 'trained immunity' is discussed in the setting of lymphoid malignancies. Amelioration of infectious complications and hematological disease progression can be envisioned to result from the induction of trained immunity, but future studies are required to prove this exciting new hypothesis.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Stevens, Wendy B C', 'Netea, Mihai G', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'van der Velden, Walter J F M']","['Stevens WB', 'Netea MG', 'Kater AP', 'van der Velden WJ']","['Department of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Radboud University Medical Centre, and Radboud Center for Infectious Diseases, Nijmegen.', 'Radboud Institute of Health Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen.', 'Department of Hematology, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen walter.vandervelden@radboudumc.nl.', 'Radboud Institute of Health Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen.']",['310372/European Research Council/International'],20161110,,PMC5479617,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 30.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-0463 [doi],"Purpose: Acalabrutinib (ACP-196) is a novel, potent, and highly selective Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, which binds covalently to Cys481 in the ATP-binding pocket of BTK. We sought to evaluate the antitumor effects of acalabrutinib treatment in two established mouse models of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).Experimental Design: Two distinct mouse models were used, the TCL1 adoptive transfer model where leukemic cells from Emu-TCL1 transgenic mice are transplanted into C57BL/6 mice, and the human NSG primary CLL xenograft model. Mice received either vehicle or acalabrutinib formulated into the drinking water.Results: Utilizing biochemical assays, we demonstrate that acalabrutinib is a highly selective BTK inhibitor as compared with ibrutinib. In the human CLL NSG xenograft model, treatment with acalabrutinib demonstrated on-target effects, including decreased phosphorylation of PLCgamma2, ERK, and significant inhibition of CLL cell proliferation. Furthermore, tumor burden in the spleen of the mice treated with acalabrutinib was significantly decreased compared with vehicle-treated mice. Similarly, in the TCL1 adoptive transfer model, decreased phosphorylation of BTK, PLCgamma2, and S6 was observed. Most notably, treatment with acalabrutinib resulted in a significant increase in survival compared with mice receiving vehicle.Conclusions: Treatment with acalabrutinib potently inhibits BTK in vivo, leading to on-target decreases in the activation of key signaling molecules (including BTK, PLCgamma2, S6, and ERK). In two complementary mouse models of CLL, acalabrutinib significantly reduced tumor burden and increased survival compared with vehicle treatment. Overall, acalabrutinib showed increased BTK selectivity compared with ibrutinib while demonstrating significant antitumor efficacy in vivo on par with ibrutinib. Clin Cancer Res; 23(11); 2831-41.

Epub 2016 Nov 30.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-1025 [doi],"Purpose: The oncogenic miR-155 is upregulated in many human cancers, and its expression is increased in more aggressive and therapy-resistant tumors, but the molecular mechanisms underlying miR-155-induced therapy resistance are not fully understood. The main objectives of this study were to determine the role of miR-155 in resistance to chemotherapy and to evaluate anti-miR-155 treatment to chemosensitize tumors.Experimental Design: We performed in vitro studies on cell lines to investigate the role of miR-155 in therapy resistance. To assess the effects of miR-155 inhibition on chemoresistance, we used an in vivo orthotopic lung cancer model of athymic nude mice, which we treated with anti-miR-155 alone or in combination with chemotherapy. To analyze the association of miR-155 expression and the combination of miR-155 and TP53 expression with cancer survival, we studied 956 patients with lung cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Results: We demonstrate that miR-155 induces resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents in vitro, and that downregulation of miR-155 successfully resensitizes tumors to chemotherapy in vivo We show that anti-miR-155-DOPC can be considered non-toxic in vivo We further demonstrate that miR-155 and TP53 are linked in a negative feedback mechanism and that a combination of high expression of miR-155 and low expression of TP53 is significantly associated with shorter survival in lung cancer.Conclusions: Our findings support the existence of an miR-155/TP53 feedback loop, which is involved in resistance to chemotherapy and which can be specifically targeted to overcome drug resistance, an important cause of cancer-related death.

Epub 2016 Nov 30.,10.1101/gr.209163.116 [doi],"Chromosomal translocations are a genomic hallmark of many hematologic malignancies. Often as initiating events, these structural abnormalities result in fusion proteins involving transcription factors important for hematopoietic differentiation and/or signaling molecules regulating cell proliferation and cell cycle. In contrast, epigenetic regulator genes are more frequently targeted by somatic sequence mutations, possibly as secondary events to further potentiate leukemogenesis. Through comprehensive whole-transcriptome sequencing of 231 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we identified 58 putative functional and predominant fusion genes in 54.1% of patients (n = 125), 31 of which have not been reported previously. In particular, we described a distinct ALL subtype with a characteristic gene expression signature predominantly driven by chromosomal rearrangements of the ZNF384 gene with histone acetyltransferases EP300 and CREBBP ZNF384-rearranged ALL showed significant up-regulation of CLCF1 and BTLA expression, and ZNF384 fusion proteins consistently showed higher activity to promote transcription of these target genes relative to wild-type ZNF384 in vitro. Ectopic expression of EP300-ZNF384 and CREBBP-ZNF384 fusion altered differentiation of mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and also potentiated oncogenic transformation in vitro. EP300- and CREBBP-ZNF384 fusions resulted in loss of histone lysine acetyltransferase activity in a dominant-negative fashion, with concomitant global reduction of histone acetylation and increased sensitivity of leukemia cells to histone deacetylase inhibitors. In conclusion, our results indicate that gene fusion is a common class of genomic abnormalities in childhood ALL and that recurrent translocations involving EP300 and CREBBP may cause epigenetic deregulation with potential for therapeutic targeting.",['(c) 2017 Qian et al.;

We investigate clonal relationships of various NK-cell subsets, including the adaptive population, by taking advantage of naturally occurring X-linked somatic PIGA mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The affected HSPCs and their progeny lack expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors on their cell surface, allowing quantification of PIGA-mutant (GPI-negative) HSPC-derived peripheral blood cell populations. The fraction of GPI-negative cells within the CD56(dim) NK cells was markedly lower than that of neutrophils and the CD56(bright) NK-cell compartments. This discrepancy was most prominent within the adaptive CD56(dim) NK-cell population lacking PLZF expression. The functional properties of these adaptive NK cells were similar in PNH patients and healthy individuals.

Because more patients are being treated with alternative programs, comparison of results will require general agreement on definitions of response, relapse, and methods of determining minimal residual disease. The development of internationally accepted, reproducible criteria is of paramount importance in evaluating and comparing clinical trials to provide optimal care. Despite the success achieved in managing these patients, continued participation in available clinical trials in the first-line and particularly in the relapse setting is highly recommended. The Hairy Cell Leukemia Foundation convened an international conference to provide common definitions and structure to guide current management. There is substantial opportunity for continued research in this disease. In addition to the importance of optimizing the prevention and management of the serious risk of infection, organized evaluations of minimal residual disease and treatment at relapse offer ample opportunities for clinical research.

Leukocyte markers and the corresponding antibodies and fluorochromes were selected based on their contribution in separating BCP-ALL cells from normal/regenerating BCP cells in multidimensional principal component analyses. After 5 multicenter design-test-evaluate-redesign phases with a total of 319 BCP-ALL patients at diagnosis, two 8-color antibody tubes were selected, which allowed separation between normal and malignant BCP cells in 99% of studied patients. These 2 tubes were tested with a new erythrocyte bulk-lysis protocol allowing acquisition of high cell numbers in 377 bone marrow follow-up samples of 178 BCP-ALL patients. Comparison with RQ-PCR-based MRD data showed a clear positive relation between the percentage concordant cases and the number of cells acquired. For those samples with >4 million cells acquired, concordant results were obtained in 93% of samples. Most discordances were clarified upon high-throughput sequencing of antigen-receptor rearrangements and blind multicenter reanalysis of flow cytometric data, resulting in an unprecedented concordance of 98% (97% for samples with MRD < 0.01%). In conclusion, the fully standardized EuroFlow BCP-ALL MRD strategy is applicable in >98% of patients with sensitivities at least similar to RQ-PCR (</=10(-5)), if sufficient cells (>4 x 10(6), preferably more) are evaluated.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Theunissen, Prisca', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Sedek, Lukasz', 'van der Sluijs-Gelling, Alita J', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe', 'Bartels, Marius', 'Sobral da Costa, Elaine', 'Kotrova, Michaela', 'Novakova, Michaela', 'Sonneveld, Edwin', 'Buracchi, Chiara', 'Bonaccorso, Paola', 'Oliveira, Elen', 'Te Marvelde, Jeroen G', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Lhermitte, Ludovic', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Lecrevisse, Quentin', 'Grigore, Georgiana Emilia', 'Fronkova, Eva', 'Trka, Jan', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J']","['Theunissen P', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Sedek L', 'van der Sluijs-Gelling AJ', 'Gaipa G', 'Bartels M', 'Sobral da Costa E', 'Kotrova M', 'Novakova M', 'Sonneveld E', 'Buracchi C', 'Bonaccorso P', 'Oliveira E', 'Te Marvelde JG', 'Szczepanski T', 'Lhermitte L', 'Hrusak O', 'Lecrevisse Q', 'Grigore GE', 'Fronkova E', 'Trka J', 'Bruggemann M', 'Orfao A', 'van Dongen JJ', 'van der Velden VH']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Hopital Necker-Enfants-Malades and Unite Mixte de Recherche Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 8147, University of Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Cancer Research Center (Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas), Department of Medicine and Cytometry Service, University of Salamanca, Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; and.', 'Cytognos SL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Cancer Research Center (Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas), Department of Medicine and Cytometry Service, University of Salamanca, Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; and.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,20161130,['Cytometry B Clin Cytom. 2019 Jan;96(1):12-15.

The major objective of this study was to explore the metabolic activation of BBM in vitro and in vivo. Two oxidative metabolites (M1 and M2) and an N-acetylcysteine (NAC) conjugate (M3) were detected in human liver microsomal incubations of BBM supplemented with NAC, and the formation of all metabolites was NADPH dependent. Microsomal inhibition and recombinant P450 enzyme incubation studies demonstrated that P450 3A4 was the major enzyme responsible for the metabolic activation of BBM.

Although the highest quality databases require manual curation, text mining tools can facilitate the curation process, increasing accuracy, coverage, and productivity. However, to date there are no available text mining tools that offer high-accuracy performance for extracting such triplets from biomedical literature. In this paper we propose a high-performance machine learning approach to automate the extraction of disease-gene-variant triplets from biomedical literature. Our approach is unique because we identify the genes and protein products associated with each mutation from not just the local text content, but from a global context as well (from the Internet and from all literature in PubMed). Our approach also incorporates protein sequence validation and disease association using a novel text-mining-based machine learning approach. We extract disease-gene-variant triplets from all abstracts in PubMed related to a set of ten important diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, Alzheimer's disease, hemochromatosis, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetes mellitus, and cystic fibrosis). We then evaluate our approach in two ways: (1) a direct comparison with the state of the art using benchmark datasets; (2) a validation study comparing the results of our approach with entries in a popular human-curated database (UniProt) for each of the previously mentioned diseases. In the benchmark comparison, our full approach achieves a 28% improvement in F1-measure (from 0.62 to 0.79) over the state-of-the-art results. For the validation study with UniProt Knowledgebase (KB), we present a thorough analysis of the results and errors. Across all diseases, our approach returned 272 triplets (disease-gene-variant) that overlapped with entries in UniProt and 5,384 triplets without overlap in UniProt. Analysis of the overlapping triplets and of a stratified sample of the non-overlapping triplets revealed accuracies of 93% and 80% for the respective categories (cumulative accuracy, 77%). We conclude that our process represents an important and broadly applicable improvement to the state of the art for curation of disease-gene-variant relationships.",,"['Singhal, Ayush', 'Simmons, Michael', 'Lu, Zhiyong']","['Singhal A', 'Simmons M', 'Lu Z']","['National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",,20161130,,PMC5130168,,,['The authors have no competing interests to declare.'],['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2378-3795'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since immunosuppression following transplant allows resurgence of many other viruses, we retrospectively evaluated the impact of viral reactivations on relapse and survival in a cohort of 136 AML patients undergoing alloSCT in first remission from sibling (68%) or unrelated (32%) donors. Myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning regimen were given to 71 and 65 patients, respectively. Including CMV reactivations, at least 1 viral reactivation was recorded in 76 patients. Viral reactivations were associated with a lower risk of relapse (adjusted HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.07-0.30; P < 0.01), better disease-free survival (aHR 0.29; 95% CI 0.16-0.54; P < 0.01) but higher non relapse mortality.

Recent studies suggest that autophagy plays such a role in the context of the anti-tumor immune response, make it an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. Defective autophagy in hematopoietic stem cells may contribute to the development of hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and lymphoproliferative disorder. In blood cancer cells, autophagy can either result in chemoresistance or induce autophagic cell death that may act as immunogenic. Based on the successful experimental findings in vitro and in vivo, clinical trials of autophagy inhibitor such as hydroxychloroquine in combination with chemotherapy in patients with blood cancers are currently underway. However, autophagy inactivation might impair autophagy-triggered anticancer immunity, whereas induction of autophagy might become an effective immunotherapy. These aspects are discussed in this review together with a brief introduction to the autophagic molecular machinery and its roles in hematologic malignancies.",,"['You, Liangshun', 'Jin, Shenhe', 'Zhu, Li', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['You L', 'Jin S', 'Zhu L', 'Qian W']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, P.R.

In this study, a novel gene therapy target for childhood T-ALL to overcome chemoresistance was discovered: TFDP3 increased in the minimal residual disease (MRD) positive childhood T-ALL patients. Then, we established a preclinical model of resistance to induction therapy to examine the functional relevance of TFDP3 to chemoresistance in MRD derived from Jurkat/E6-1. Jurkat xenografts in NOD/SCID mice were exposed to a four drug combination (VXLD) of vincristine (VCR), dexamethasone (DEX), L-asparaginase (L-asp) and daunorubicin (DNR). During the 4-week VXLD treatment, the level of TFDP3 increased 4-fold. High expression of TFDP3 was identified in the re-emerging lines (Jurkat/MRD) with increased chemoresistance, which is correlated with partially promoter demethylation of TFDP3. Downregulation of TFDP3 by RNA interference reversed chemoresistance in Jurkat/MRD accompanied by reinstated E2F1 activity that coincided with increased levels of p53, p73, and associated proapoptotic target genes. Importantly, TFDP3 silencing in vivo induced apparent benefit to overcome chemoresistance in combination with VXLD treatment.

Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) and third-generation (ponatinib) have added complexity to the treatment paradigm for this disease. Areas covered: Second generation TKIs, approved as second-line treatment in all phases of the disease, are highly effective in patients resistant to and/or intolerant to imatinib and are extremely active against all the resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations, with the exception of T3151. Ponatinib, active against all BCR-ABL1 mutants including T315I, became widely used for resistant patients in all phases of disease after previous therapies. Other drugs, such as ABL001, which targets the myristoyl pocket of the ABL1 kinase, are currently in development, to offer therapeutic alternatives for resistant patients to ATP-binders. Expert opinion: In this review, we summarize the efficacy of second line small molecules available. Specific safety profiles have emerged for each drug from sponsored clinical trials in the long-term. Stratification of patients according to comorbidities and cardiovascular risk is now needed to individualize second line treatment. Combinations of different drugs with different mechanisms of action will be used in the future to decrease the incidence of resistance.",,"['Molica, Matteo', 'Massaro, Fulvio', 'Breccia, Massimo']","['Molica M', 'Massaro F', 'Breccia M']","['a Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology , Sapienza University , Rome , Italy.', 'a Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology , Sapienza University , Rome , Italy.', 'a Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology , Sapienza University , Rome , Italy.']",,20161209,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*efficacy', '*safety', '*second line', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS/METHODS: Data from 310 adults who were diagnosed with acute leukemia and underwent allo-HSCT between March 2001 and December 2011 were analyzed. According to the suggested BMI categories for Asian population, patients with BMIs of 23 and 25 kg/m(2) were identified as overweight and obese, respectively. Cox proportional hazards models was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The median follow-up time among the patients was 19.7 months (interquartile range=8.1-37.7). A total of 93 (34.8%) people died within the follow-up period. After adjusting for the potential confounders, normal-weight, overweight and obese patients showed significantly lower HRs than those of underweight patients, with a significant trend of OS improvement upon increasing BMI (P=0.019). Overweight and obese patients survived longer, with a significantly decreased HR by ~40% (HR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.38-0.95) compared with underweight and normal-weight patients. CONCLUSIONS: An increased OS was seen in allo-HSCT patients with BMI23 kg/m(2) compared to those with lower BMI.

In the present study, the prognostic significance of B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI1) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was evaluated. BMI1 and MMP9 expression in tumors from 132 surgical NSCLC patients [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), n=79; and adenocarcinoma (AD), n=53] was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The clinical significance was determined using multivariate Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. High BMI1 expression was more frequent in SCC compared with that in AD (P=0.015). Comparisons between the expression of BMI1 and that of other known biological markers revealed that the expression of BMI1 was correlated with that of MMP9 (chi(2)=4.241, P=0.039) in SCC. Although an association was not identified between high BMI1 expression and overall survival (OS) in NSCLC or AD, high BMI1 expression was an unfavorable predictor of survival in SCC according to the survival curves (P=0.038). In addition, combined high BMI1 and MMP9 expression levels were significantly correlated with SCC nodal/distant metastasis (chi(2)=6.392, P=0.014). Multivariate Cox proportional model analysis demonstrated that this combined marker was an independent prognostic indicator of OS in SCC (P=0.025; hazard ratio = 12.963; 95% confidence interval: 1.142-7.637). Therefore, this study demonstrated that combined BMI1 and MMP9 expression may be used as a marker for the progression and metastasis of SCC.

Tumor metastasis and angiogenesis significantly contribute to the progression of cancer and create challenges for cancer therapy. In the present study, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that PBX3 was upregulated in gastric cancer (GC) tissues and Transwell assay revealed that the overexpression of PBX3 promoted GC invasion and metastasis in vitro. In addition, a nude mouse xenograft model was established, which demonstrated that PBX3 promoted peritoneal metastases in vivo. Furthermore, the overexpression of PBX3 in GC promoted the tubular formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Western blot analysis revealed that overexpressed PBX3 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in GC, as measured by increases in the EMT protein markers N-cadherin and vimentin, while E-cadherin expression was reduced in PBX3-overexpressing GC cells. Contrasting results were observed in PBX3-knockdown GC cells. Additionally, the overexpression of PBX3 increased the levels of phosphorylated AKT (Ser473), which is involved in the progression of a variety of human cancers. Gelatin zymography assay demonstrated that the overexpression of PBX3 also elevated matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity in GC, which was closely associated with tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. Based on these findings, it may be concluded that PBX3 enhances invasion and metastasis in GC by promoting EMT, possibly via the AKT signaling pathway.",,"['Wang, Shuanhu', 'Li, Chenglong', 'Wang, Wenbin', 'Xing, Chungen']","['Wang S', 'Li C', 'Wang W', 'Xing C']","['Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215000, P.R.

The present niche models concentrate on a two-dimensional (2D) co-culture system in vitro, which does not imitate the in vivo environment, while the 3D scaffolds are more reflective of this. Osteopontin (Opn) secreted by bone marrow osteoblasts, may participate in protecting leukemia cells from apoptosis by binding to its receptor alphavbeta3, which can be expressed on the surface of the leukemia MV4-11 cell line. However, the association between the Opn/alphavbeta3 axis and leukemia cells is unknown. In the present study, experiments were conducted on 3D polystyrene scaffolds coated with osteoblasts and leukemia cells. The cells were exposed to cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val) [c(RGDfV)] (35 nmol/ml), which blocks alphavbeta3, for a period of 24 h. Cytarabine was applied 24 h later. The adhesion, migration and apoptosis rates, and the cell cycle of the leukemia cells were analyzed after incubation for 24 and 48 h. In contrast to the 2D culture system, the stromal cells in the scaffolds secreted significantly more alkaline phosphatase and Opn (P<0.05). c(RGDfV) disrupted the adhesion and migration between the tumor cells and the matrix, induced the leukemia cells to leave the protective microenvironment and increased their sensitivity to cell cycle-dependent agents (P<0.05). In summary, the data certified that the 3D scaffolds are suitable for the growth of cells, and that c(RGDfV) inhibits the adhesion and migration abilities of leukemia cells in the endosteal niche.

In this study, we found that miR-150 is downregulated in samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia, and normalized after patients achieved complete remission. Restoration of miR-150 markedly inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of leukemia cells, and reduced tumorigenicity in a xenograft leukemia murine model. Microarray analysis identified multiple novel targets of miR-150, which were validated by quantitative real-time PCR and luciferase reporter assay. Gene ontology and pathway analysis illustrated potential roles of these targets in small-molecule metabolism, transcriptional regulation, RNA metabolism, proteoglycan synthesis in cancer, mTOR signaling pathway, or Wnt signaling pathway. Interestingly, knockdown one of four miR-150 targets (EIF4B, FOXO4B, PRKCA, and TET3) showed an antileukemia activity similar to that of miR-150 restoration.

Also, alkylating chemotherapy or radiation can cause MDS/preleukemia, which nearly always progress to AML.

This preleukemic clone represents involvement of an early hematopoietic stem cells, which is resistant to standard therapy.

The dissection of the molecular determinants of T-cell survival and differentiation is paramount for the manipulation of healthy or transformed T cells in cancer (immuno)therapy. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase whose anti-apoptotic functions have been described in various hematological and solid tumors. Here we disclose an unanticipated role of CK2 in healthy human thymocytes that is selective to the gammadelta T-cell lineage. gammadelta thymocytes display higher (and T-cell receptor inducible) CK2 activity than their alphabeta counterparts, and are strikingly sensitive to death upon CK2 inhibition. Mechanistically, we show that CK2 regulates the pro-survival AKT signaling pathway in gammadelta thymocytes and, importantly, also in gammadelta T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. When compared with healthy thymocytes or leukemic alphabeta T cells, gammadelta T-ALL cells show upregulated CK2 activity, potentiated by CD27 costimulation, and enhanced apoptosis upon CK2 blockade using the chemical inhibitor CX-4945. Critically, this results in inhibition of tumor growth in a xenograft model of human gammadelta T-ALL. These data identify CK2 as a novel survival determinant of both healthy and leukemic gammadelta T cells, and may thus greatly impact their therapeutic manipulation.",,"['Ribeiro, S T', 'Tesio, M', 'Ribot, J C', 'Macintyre, E', 'Barata, J T', 'Silva-Santos, B']","['Ribeiro ST', 'Tesio M', 'Ribot JC', 'Macintyre E', 'Barata JT', 'Silva-Santos B']","['Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Institut Necker Enfants Malades, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, APHP et Universite Paris, Paris, France.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Institut Necker Enfants Malades, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, APHP et Universite Paris, Paris, France.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.']",['646701/European Research Council/International'],20161130,,PMC5357576,,,,,,['EMS70538'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Better understanding of the biology of chronic GVHD has provided novel targets for treatment, and structured guidelines in diagnosis and in clinical trial design have provided a common language and pathways for research in this area. These, combined with the surge of drug development in Oncology and Immunology, are factors that have contributed to the accelerating field of drug development and clinical research in chronic GVHD.

Their mutational and transcriptional landscape, as well as the respective patterns at relapse remain largely elusive. We, therefore, performed an integrated analysis of whole-exome and RNA sequencing in 41 major clone fusion-positive cases including 19 matched diagnosis/relapse pairs. We detected a variety of frequently subclonal and highly instable JAK/STAT but also RTK/Ras pathway-activating mutations in 76% of cases at diagnosis and virtually all relapses. Unlike P2RY8-CRLF2 that was lost in 32% of relapses, all other genomic alterations affecting lymphoid development (58%) and cell cycle (39%) remained stable. Only IKZF1 alterations predominated in relapsing cases (P=0.001) and increased from initially 36 to 58% in matched cases. IKZF1's critical role is further corroborated by its specific transcriptional signature comprising stem cell features with signs of impaired lymphoid differentiation, enhanced focal adhesion, activated hypoxia pathway, deregulated cell cycle and increased drug resistance. Our findings support the notion that P2RY8-CRLF2 is dispensable for relapse development and instead highlight the prominent rank of IKZF1 for relapse development by mediating self-renewal and homing to the bone marrow niche.

The basis of therapyfor leukemia is a combination of anti-cancer drugs based on risk stratification. The overall 5-year survival rate in leukemia patients of all ages is still 40%, although it has improved in pediatric patients. Leuke- mia itself is a heterogeneous disease that includes various entities/subtypes with different pathogenic gene aberrations. Selection of the treatment strategylargelydepends on risk stratification, and this in turn is mainlybased on specific recurrent chromosome aberrations. However, in acute myeloid leukemia(AML), a significant proportion of patients present with a normal karyotype according to conventional cytogenetic analysis and are classified into an intermediate-risk group, which actuallyconsists of various subtypes with different prognoses. In addition, leukemic cells usuallyharbor one or more driver mutations among their various genetic aberrations, and these driver mutations could affect prognosis. The discoveryof additional mutations in genes such as NPM1, CEBPA and FLT3, which are frequent in AML patients with a normal karyotype, have improved the precision of risk stratification in AML. In this regard, array-based gene expression analysis and whole exome/ transcriptome sequencing could be useful tools for identifying the whole spectrum of genetic aberrations, or for compiling a complete list of mutated genes within leukemic cells. Genetic profiling information obtained using these newlydeveloped methods could provide more accurate information for molecular subtyping and risk stratification in leukemia.",,"['Eguchi-Ishimae, Minenori', 'Eguchi, Mariko']","['Eguchi-Ishimae M', 'Eguchi M']","['Dept. of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is composed of the membrane-bound immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain, surrogate light chain components, and the signaling subunits Igalpha and Igbeta. We developed monovalent quantum dot (QD)-labeled probes specific for Igbeta to study the behavior of pre-BCRs engaged in autonomous, ligand-independent signaling in live B cells. Single-particle tracking revealed that QD-labeled pre-BCRs engaged in transient, but frequent, homotypic interactions. Receptor motion was correlated at short separation distances, consistent with the formation of dimers and higher-order oligomers. Repeated encounters between diffusing pre-BCRs appeared to reflect transient co-confinement in plasma membrane domains. In human B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells, we showed that frequent, short-lived, homotypic pre-BCR interactions stimulated survival signals, including expression of BCL6, which encodes a transcriptional repressor. These survival signals were blocked by inhibitory monovalent antigen-binding antibody fragments (Fabs) specific for the surrogate light chain components of the pre-BCR or by inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. For comparison, we evaluated pre-BCR aggregation mediated by dimeric galectin-1, which has binding sites for carbohydrate and for the surrogate light chain lambda5 component. Galectin-1 binding resulted in the formation of large, highly immobile pre-BCR aggregates, which was partially relieved by the addition of lactose to prevent the cross-linking of galectin-BCR complexes to other glycosylated membrane components.

Signaling through the pre-BCR, an immature form of the BCR, promotes the survival of B cell progenitors and has been implicated in the pathology of BCP-ALL. Erasmus et al found that pre-BCRs formed transient homomeric complexes that correlated with pro-survival signaling. Preventing homotypic interactions between pre-BCRs sensitized B cells to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that interfering with such interactions may improve the efficacy of existing chemotherapies for BCP-ALL.Listen to Podcast.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Wilson, Bridget S', 'VanHook, Annalisa M']","['Wilson BS', 'VanHook AM']","['Department of Pathology and the UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131, USA.', 'Web Editor, Science Signaling, American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1200 New York Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20005, USA.']",,20161129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 29.,,"In mice, generation of autoreactive CD5(+) B cells occurs as a consequence of BCR signaling induced by (self)-ligand exposure from fetal/neonatal B-1 B cell development. A fraction of these cells self-renew and persist as a minor B1 B cell subset throughout life. Here, we show that transfer of early generated B1 B cells from Emu-TCL1 transgenic mice resulted in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with a biased repertoire, including stereotyped BCRs. Thus, B1 B cells bearing restricted BCRs can become CLL during aging. Increased anti-thymocyte/Thy-1 autoreactive (ATA) BCR cells in the B1 B cell subset by transgenic expression yielded spontaneous ATA B-CLL/lymphoma incidence, enhanced by TCL1 transgenesis. In contrast, ATA B-CLL did not develop from other B cell subsets, even when the identical ATA BCR was expressed on a Thy-1 low/null background. Thus, both a specific BCR and B1 B cell context were important for CLL progression. Neonatal B1 B cells and their CLL progeny in aged mice continued to express moderately up-regulated c-Myc and down-regulated proapoptotic Bmf, unlike most mature B cells in the adult. Thus, there is a genetic predisposition inherent in B-1 development generating restricted BCRs and self-renewal capacity, with both features contributing to potential for progression to CLL.",['(c) 2016 Hayakawa et al.'],"['Hayakawa, Kyoko', 'Formica, Anthony M', 'Brill-Dashoff, Joni', 'Shinton, Susan A', 'Ichikawa, Daiju', 'Zhou, Yan', 'Morse, Herbert C 3rd', 'Hardy, Richard R']","['Hayakawa K', 'Formica AM', 'Brill-Dashoff J', 'Shinton SA', 'Ichikawa D', 'Zhou Y', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Hardy RR']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111 Kyoko.Hayakawa@fccc.edu.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD 20852.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.']","['R01 CA129330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI113320/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI117429/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI049335/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20161129,,PMC5154941,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Macrodissection of small and large cell lymphomatous components was performed. This was followed by flow cytometric analysis along with molecular B-cell immunoglobulin (heavy and light chains) and T-cell receptor (gamma and beta chains) gene rearrangement studies to investigate a clonal relationship between the components. RESULTS: The immunophenotypic profile was similar between small and large cell components of the lymphoma by flow cytometry. Furthermore, shared clonal peaks were observed between both components based on molecular B-cell and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies, confirming a clonal relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/SLL may rarely undergo Richter transformation to a DLBCL demonstrating lineage infidelity. This is a potentially important diagnostic pitfall and such cases should not be confused with a de novo T-cell lymphoma.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Therefore, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should always be an initial consideration for eligible patients with a suitable donor. Nontransplant approaches for treating aCML have otherwise largely relied on adopting treatment strategies used for MDS and MPN. However, such therapies, including hypomethylating agents, are based on a paucity of data.

Recently, asthma also has been suggested as a risk factor for MDS. METHODS: We undertook this nationwide population-based cohort study on patients with a first-time hospital-based asthma diagnosis during 2002-2013 and followed them for the development of MDS/chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). RESULTS: We identified 75 995 patients with incident asthma and no previous MDS/CMML diagnosis. Seventy-eight patients subsequently developed MDS and nine patients developed CMML during 402 892 person-years. The cumulative risks of developing MDS/CMML among asthma patients were 0.02% (95% CI: 0.01-0.04%) and 0.07% (95% CI: 0.05-0.09%) during the first year and the first five years of follow-up, respectively. The standardised incidence ratio of MDS/CMML among asthma patients overall was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3-2.0) with little variation across subgroups.

While these metabolic differences provide promising avenues for cancer treatments, much work remains to be done in understanding how metabolism is rewired in malignant tissues. To that end, constraint-based models provide a powerful computational tool for the study of metabolism at the genome scale. To generate meaningful predictions, however, these generalized human models must first be tailored for specific cell or tissue sub-types. Here we first present two improved algorithms for (1) the generation of these context-specific metabolic models based on omics data, and (2) Monte-Carlo sampling of the metabolic model ux space. By applying these methods to generate and analyze context-specific metabolic models of diverse solid cancer cell line data, and primary leukemia pediatric patient biopsies, we demonstrate how the methodology presented in this study can generate insights into the rewiring differences across solid tumors and blood cancers.",,"['Schultz, A', 'Mehta, S', 'Hu, C W', 'Hoff, F W', 'Horton, T M', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Qutub, A A']","['Schultz A', 'Mehta S', 'Hu CW', 'Hoff FW', 'Horton TM', 'Kornblau SM', 'Qutub AA']","['Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005, U.S.A.']","['R01 CA164024/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM106027/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC5173378,,,,,,['NIHMS832148'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are limited data using screening tools to aid in the diagnosis of neuropathic pain in cancer patients. Our primary objective was to determine the proportion of adolescent and young adult cancer patients reporting neuropathic pain on a patient-completed, neuropathic pain screening tool. PROCEDURES: This prospective, cohort study enrolled patients 14-39 years of age who were receiving therapy for primary cancer diagnosis, cancer relapse, or had recently completed treatment. The painDETECT, a patient-completed, neuropathic pain screening tool used down to age 14, was administered a maximum of three times in on-therapy patients and once in off-therapy patients. Provider documentation of neuropathic pain at the corresponding visit was abstracted from the medical record. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients participated. Median (interquartile range) age at study enrollment was 18.1 (16-19.4) years and 47% were female. Cancer diagnoses included 41% leukemia, 26% solid tumor, 23% lymphoma, and 10% central nervous system tumor. The proportion of patients reporting neuropathic pain was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16-40%) in on-therapy patients and 11% (95% CI 3-27%) in off-therapy patients. In patients reporting neuropathic pain, only 26% had a clinical diagnosis of neuropathic pain documented in the medical record at the corresponding visit. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropathic pain occurs in one in four adolescents and young adults receiving cancer therapy. Use of screening tools may increase the detection of neuropathic pain in adolescents and young adults receiving cancer therapy and could ultimately improve pain treatment.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Acquazzino, Melissa A', 'Igler, Eva C', 'Dasgupta, Mahua', 'Simpson, Pippa', 'Browning, Meghen B', 'Brandow, Amanda M']","['Acquazzino MA', 'Igler EC', 'Dasgupta M', 'Simpson P', 'Browning MB', 'Brandow AM']","[""Section of Hematology/Oncology, Sanford Children's Hospital and Specialty Clinic, Sioux Falls, South Dakota."", 'University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Quantitative Health Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Quantitative Health Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.']",,20161128,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*neuropathic pain']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 28.,10.1007/s00262-016-1938-y [doi],"Due to its immunogenicity and overexpression concomitant with leukemia progression, Wilms tumor protein 1 (WT1) is of particular interest for immunotherapy of AML relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). So far, WT1-specific T-cell responses have mainly been induced by vaccination with peptides presented by certain HLA alleles. However, this approach is still not widely applicable in clinical practice due to common limitations of HLA restriction. Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines electroporated with mRNA encoding full-length protein have also been tested for generating WT1-derived peptides for presentation to T-cells. Alternatively, an efficient and broad WT1 peptide presentation could be elicited by triggering receptor-mediated protein endocytosis of DCs. Therefore, we developed antibody fusion proteins consisting of an antibody specific for the DEC205 endocytic receptor on human DCs and various fragments of WT1 as DC-targeting recombinant WT1 vaccines (anti-hDEC205-WT1). Of all anti-hDEC205-WT1 fusion proteins designed for overcoming insufficient expression, anti-hDEC205-WT110-35, anti-hDEC205-WT191-138, anti-hDEC205-WT1223-273, and anti-hDEC205-WT1324-371 were identified in good yields.

Furthermore, the DC-targeted WT191-138-induced specific T-cells showed a strong cytotoxic activity by lysing WT1-overexpressing THP-1 leukemia cells in vitro while sparing WT1-negative hematopoietic cells.

We concluded that other cellular events induced by FTIs may trigger activation of caspase-3 and subsequent apoptosis, but the expression of proapoptotic molecules, as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and antiapoptotic, as Bcl-X(s), were not modified by FTIs.

This is supported by in vivo studies showing that 67LR downregulation reduces tumour cell proliferation and tumour formation by inducing apoptosis. 67LR association with the anti-apoptotic protein PED/PEA-15 activates a signal transduction pathway, leading to cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. However, the main function of 67LR is to enhance tumor cell adhesion to the LM of basement membranes and cell migration, two crucial events in the metastasis cascade. Thus, inhibition of 67LR binding to LM has been proved to be a feasible approach to block metastatic cancer cell spread.

In addition, the target gene of miR-21 was identified by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results demonstrated that miR-21 expression in Jurkat cells was markedly upregulated. Furthermore, upregulating miR-21 expression in Jurkat cells promoted cell proliferation and invasion and decreased the apoptosis rate. By contrast, knockdown of miR-21 in Jurkat cells suppressed proliferation and invasion and increased the apoptosis rate. Furthermore, the results indicated that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 was targeted by miR-21, and that miR-21 inhibited STAT3 expression at the protein level rather than at the messenger RNA level.

However, the effect of SENP1 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has not been elucidated. In the present study, it was observed that SENP1 deficiency had no effect on the spontaneous apoptosis or differentiation of NB4 cells. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) could induce the upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, resulting in the apoptosis of NB4 cells. Additionally, knockdown of SENP1 significantly increased As2O3-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells transfected with small interfering RNA targeting SENP1. SENP1 deficiency also increased the accumulation of SUMOylated X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), which was accompanied by the downregulation of the messenger RNA expression and transcriptional activity of the XBP1 target genes endoplasmic reticulum-localized DnaJ 4 and Sec61a, which were involved in ER stress and closely linked to the apoptosis of NB4 cells. Taken together, these results revealed that the specific de-SUMOylation activity of SENP1 for XBP1 was involved in the ER stress-mediated apoptosis caused by As2O3 treatment in NB4 cells, thus providing insight into potential therapeutic targets for APL treatment via manipulating XBP1 signaling during ER stress by targeting SENP1.",,"['Wang, Fei-Fei', 'Liu, Ming-Zhu', 'Sui, Yi', 'Cao, Qing', 'Yan, Bo', 'Jin, Mei-Ling', 'Mo, Xi']","['Wang FF', 'Liu MZ', 'Sui Y', 'Cao Q', 'Yan B', 'Jin ML', 'Mo X']","[""Institute for Pediatric Translational Medicine, Shanghai Children's Medical Center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, P.R.

It is essential for normal embryonic development and haematopoiesis and frequently mutated in cancer. The catalytic properties and targeting of KMT2A/MLL1 depend on the proteins with which it complexes and the post-translational protein modifications which some of these proteins put in place, though detailed mechanisms remain unclear. RESULTS: KMT2A/MLL1 (both native and FLAG-tagged) and Msk1 (RPS6KA5) co-immunoprecipitated in various cell types. KMT2A/MLL1 and Msk1 knockdown demonstrated that the great majority of genes whose activity changed on KTM2A/MLL1 knockdown, responded comparably to Msk1 knockdown, as did levels of H3K4 methylation and H3S10 phosphorylation at KTM2A target genes HoxA4, HoxA5. Knockdown experiments also showed that KMT2A/MLL1 is required for the genomic targeting of Msk1, but not vice versa. CONCLUSION: The KMT2A/MLL1 complex is associated with, and functionally dependent upon, the kinase Msk1, part of the MAP kinase signalling pathway. We propose that Msk1-catalysed phosphorylation at H3 serines 10 and 28, supports H3K4 methylation by the KMT2A/MLL1 complex both by making H3 a more attractive substrate for its SET domain, and improving target gene accessibility by prevention of HP1- and Polycomb-mediated chromatin condensation.",,"['Wiersma, Maaike', 'Bussiere, Marianne', 'Halsall, John A', 'Turan, Nil', 'Slany, Robert', 'Turner, Bryan M', 'Nightingale, Karl P']","['Wiersma M', 'Bussiere M', 'Halsall JA', 'Turan N', 'Slany R', 'Turner BM', 'Nightingale KP']","['Chromatin and Gene Expression Group, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.', 'Chromatin and Gene Expression Group, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK ; Molecular Imaging and Photonics, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 22f, Box 2404, 3001 Louvain, Belgium.', 'Chromatin and Gene Expression Group, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.', 'Chromatin and Gene Expression Group, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.', 'Department of Biology, Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.', 'Chromatin and Gene Expression Group, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.']","['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",20161111,,PMC5106815,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chromatin', '*Gene regulation', '*Histone modification', '*MLL1 complex', '*Signal transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, resulting from t(12;21)(p13;q22), is associated with an excellent outcome in younger children with B-ALL.

High-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism microarray (SNP array) revealed the iAMP21 to be chromothripsis of 21q and subsequent metaphase FISH further delineated complex genomic aberrations. Although the patient received intensive chemotherapy with allogenic stem cell transplant, he died 26 months after initial diagnosis. We searched the literature and identified six cases showing coexisting iAMP21 and ETV6-RUNX1. The median age for these six patients was 10 years (range, 2-18) and males predominated.

The purpose of this study was to analyze cancer patients' use of oral chemotherapies and identify opportunities to improve adherence. Methods We developed a 30-question survey to address frequency and reasons for reducing/skipping doses; sources of information for oral chemotherapy use; perceived importance of food-drug effects; and ease of understanding labeling directions. Results Ninety-three patients taking oral chemotherapies with chronic myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer completed the survey. This was a well-educated population with 69% (n = 62) having completed some college; 51% (n = 47) female and 59% (n = 54) older than 50 years of age. Thirty percent of patients reported forgetting to take their oral chemotherapy at least ""sometimes"". Younger patients (<50 vs. >/=50, p = 0.002), shorter treatment duration (<6 vs. >/=6 months p = 0.03), or with chronic myeloid leukemia (vs. other diagnoses, p = 0.015) forget to take their oral chemotherapy at higher rates. Twenty-three percent (n = 21) indicated they intentionally skipped their oral chemotherapies and 38% (n = 8) of those did not inform their physicians. Forty-one percent (n = 28) taking drugs with significant food-drug effects did not think about their last meal before taking their oral chemotherapy and 80% (n = 55) did not understand the potential interactions. Additionally, 39% (n = 36/92) never looked at labeling and 15% (n = 14/91) had difficulty understanding label directions. Conclusion There are three main barriers associated with appropriate use of oral chemotherapies: misunderstanding about the timing of drug with food; stopping drug without informing physicians; and difficulty understanding labeling directions. A multipronged approach is needed to optimize communication of directions for optimal oral chemotherapy use.",,"['Muluneh, Benyam', 'Deal, Allison', 'Alexander, Maurice D', 'Keisler, Meredith D', 'Markey, Janell M', 'Neal, Jennifer M', 'Bernard, Stephen', 'Valgus, John', 'Dressler, Lynn G']","['Muluneh B', 'Deal A', 'Alexander MD', 'Keisler MD', 'Markey JM', 'Neal JM', 'Bernard S', 'Valgus J', 'Dressler LG']","['1 Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center.', '2 Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina.', '3 Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina.', '1 Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center.', '2 Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina.', '1 Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center.', '2 Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina.', '3 Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina.', '4 School of Pharmacy, Virginia Commonwealth University.', '5 School of Medicine, University of North Carolina.', '1 Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center.', '2 Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina.', '3 Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina.', '2 Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina.', '6 Fullerton Genetics Center, Mission Health Systems.']",,20161130,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Oral chemotherapy', 'adherence', 'compliance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PARP inhibitors are used as cutting-edge treatments for patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR)-defective breast cancers harboring mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Other tumors defective in HRR, including some hematological malignancies, are predicted to be good candidates for treatment with PARP inhibitors. Screening of leukemia-derived cell lines revealed that lymphoid lineage-derived leukemia cell lines, except for those derived from mature B cells and KMT2A (MLL)-rearranged B-cell precursors, were relatively sensitive to PARP inhibitors. By contrast, acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines, except for RUNX1-RUNXT1 (AML1-ETO)-positive lines, were relatively resistant. Intriguingly, TCF3 (E2A)-HLF-positive leukemia was sensitive to PARP inhibitors. TCF3-HLF expression suppressed HRR activity, suggesting that PARP inhibitor treatment induced synthetic lethality. Furthermore, TCF3-HLF expression decreased levels of MCPH1, which regulates the expression of BRCA1, resulting in attenuation of HRR activity. The PARP inhibitor olaparib was also effective in an in vivo xenograft model. Our results suggest a novel therapeutic approach for treating refractory leukemia, particularly the TCF3-HLF-positive subtype.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Conventional NK cell function depends on a licensing signal, classically delivered by an inhibitory receptor engaging its cognate MHC class I ligand. How licensing status integrates with cytokine-induced memory-like NK cell responses is unknown. We investigated this interaction using killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor- and HLA-genotyped primary human NK cells. Memory-like differentiation resulted in enhanced IFN-gamma production triggered by leukemia targets or FcgammaRIIIa ligation within licensed NK cells, which exhibited the highest functionality of the NK cell subsets interrogated. IFN-gamma production by unlicensed memory-like NK cells was also enhanced to a level comparable with that of licensed control NK cells. Mechanistically, differences in responses to FcgammaRIIIa-based triggering were not explained by alterations in key signaling intermediates, indicating that the underlying biology of memory-like NK cells is distinct from that of adaptive NK cells in human cytomegalovirus-positive individuals. Additionally, memory-like NK cells responded robustly to cytokine receptor restimulation with no impact of licensing status. These results demonstrate that both licensed and unlicensed memory-like NK cell populations have enhanced functionality, which may be translated to improve leukemia immunotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Depending on cell types and stimulators, cAMP could either promote or attenuate cell death. cAMP signal can be transduced by protein kinase A (PKA) and/or exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC). In CML cells, cAMP may suppress their proliferation and enhance their differentiation. However, the role of cAMP on DNA damaging agent toxicity and the mechanism involved has not been studied. In this study, we studied the effect of cAMP on the sensitivity of CML cells to DNA damaging agents. We observed that forskolin (FSK) and dibutyryl-cAMP (DBcAMP) decreased cisplatin and etoposide-induced cell death in K562 cells. Moreover, PKA activator prevented K562 cells from DNA damaging agent-induced cell death while EPAC activator had no effect. Furthermore, we found that the PKA subtype, PKAIA, was involved in cAMP-attenuated resistance in K562 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that increased cAMP level confers CML cells to acquire a novel mechanism against DNA damaging agent toxicity via PKAIA. Thus, PKAIA inhibitor may be helpful in overcoming the resistance to DNA damaging agents in CML cells.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

BD requires metabolic activation to different epoxides that are known to bind to DNA, inducing also DNA-DNA and DNA-protein crosslinks. The DNA damage leading to mutations has been identified as the mode of action of BD. Experimental studies in rodents revealed widely different BD carcinogenic/mutagenic potency in rat and mice, associated to differences in BD metabolism. The available biomonitoring studies in workers occupationally exposed to BD, considering different genetic endpoints, do not allow to reach a conclusion on the BD carcinogenic/mutagenic risk in humans. The present systematic review retrieves and analyzes the published studies on the application of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in peripheral lymphocytes (L-CBMN) of BD exposed subjects. Ten articles were retrieved related to seven studies on BD exposure and one study on exposure to a mixture of compounds in a styrene-butadiene tire manufacturing plant. Four studies carried out in Europe related to heterogeneous groups of workers exposed in BD monomer or polymer manufacturing and processing industries, reporting mean individual exposure levels below 3ppm, failed to find any increase of MN frequency. Three studies, including mixed groups of workers involved in different stages of the production and manufacturing of BD in China, show increased MN frequencies associated with the intensity of the exposure, with a relevant positive response (FR=2.29) when the mean cumulative dose was estimated as 266ppm/year. These results are consistent with the data on the exposure-response curve for total leukemia mortality showing no increase for cumulative exposure less than or equal to 200 BD ppm-years. The L-CBMN assay, measuring both chromosome breakage and chromosome loss, events involved in induction of leukemia, seems to be a promising biomarker for cancer risk induced by BD.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This BCR-ABL1-like subtype shows a high frequency of B-cell development gene aberrations and tyrosine kinase-activating lesions. To evaluate the clinical significance of tyrosine kinase gene fusions in children with BCP-ALL, we studied the frequency of recently identified tyrosine kinase fusions, associated genetic features, and prognosis in a representative Dutch/German cohort. We identified 14 tyrosine kinase fusions among 77 BCR-ABL1-like cases (18%) and none among 76 non-BCR-ABL1-like B-other cases. Novel exon fusions were identified for RCSD1-ABL2 and TERF2-JAK2. JAK2 mutation was mutually exclusive with tyrosine kinase fusions and only occurred in cases with high CRLF2 expression. The non/late response rate and levels of minimal residual disease in the fusion-positive BCR-ABL1-like group were higher than in the non-BCR-ABL1-like B-others (p<0.01), and also higher, albeit not statistically significant, compared with the fusion-negative BCR-ABL1-like group. The 8-year cumulative incidence of relapse in the fusion-positive BCR-ABL1-like group (35%) was comparable with that in the fusion-negative BCR-ABL1-like group (35%), and worse than in the non-BCR-ABL1-like B-other group (17%, p=0.07). IKZF1 deletions, predominantly other than the dominant-negative isoform and full deletion, co-occurred with tyrosine kinase fusions.

The etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1), contains highly immunogenic CTL epitopes, but ATL patients typically have low frequencies of cytokine-producing HTLV-1-specific CD8+ cells in the circulation. It remains unclear whether patients with ATL possess CTLs that can kill the malignant HTLV-1 infected clone. Here we used flow cytometric staining of TCRVbeta and cell adhesion molecule-1 (CADM1) to identify monoclonal populations of HTLV-1-infected T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with ATL. Thus, we quantified the rate of CD8+-mediated killing of the putative malignant clone in ex vivo blood samples. We observed that CD8+ cells from ATL patients were unable to lyse autologous ATL clones when tested directly ex vivo. However, short in vitro culture restored the ability of CD8+ cells to kill ex vivo ATL clones in some donors. The capacity of CD8+ cells to lyse HTLV-1 infected cells which expressed the viral sense strand gene products was significantly enhanced after in vitro culture, and donors with an ATL clone that expressed the HTLV-1 Tax gene were most likely to make a detectable lytic CD8+ response to the ATL cells.

Epub 2016 Nov 28.,10.1038/onc.2016.439 [doi],"B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI1) is a component of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) complex that is overexpressed in breast and other cancers, and promotes self-renewal of cancer stem-like cells. The oncogenic mucin 1 (MUC1) C-terminal (MUC1-C) subunit is similarly overexpressed in human carcinoma cells and has been linked to their self-renewal. There is no known relationship between MUC1-C and BMI1 in cancer. The present studies demonstrate that MUC1-C drives BMI1 transcription by a MYC-dependent mechanism in breast and other cancer cells. In addition, we show that MUC1-C blocks miR-200c-mediated downregulation of BMI1 expression. The functional significance of this MUC1-C-->BMI1 pathway is supported by the demonstration that targeting MUC1-C suppresses BMI1-induced ubiquitylation of H2A and thereby derepresses homeobox HOXC5 and HOXC13 gene expression. Notably, our results further show that MUC1-C binds directly to BMI1 and promotes occupancy of BMI1 on the CDKN2A promoter. In concert with BMI1-induced repression of the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor, we found that targeting MUC1-C is associated with induction of p16(INK4a) expression. In support of these results, analysis of three gene expresssion data sets demonstrated highly significant correlations between MUC1-C and BMI1 in breast cancers. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for MUC1-C in driving BMI1 expression and in directly interacting with this stem cell factor, linking MUC1-C with function of the PRC1 in epigenetic gene silencing.",,"['Hiraki, M', 'Maeda, T', 'Bouillez, A', 'Alam, M', 'Tagde, A', 'Hinohara, K', 'Suzuki, Y', 'Markert, T', 'Miyo, M', 'Komura, K', 'Ahmad, R', 'Rajabi, H', 'Kufe, D']","['Hiraki M', 'Maeda T', 'Bouillez A', 'Alam M', 'Tagde A', 'Hinohara K', 'Suzuki Y', 'Markert T', 'Miyo M', 'Komura K', 'Ahmad R', 'Rajabi H', 'Kufe D']","['Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']","['R01 CA097098/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166480/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20161128,,PMC5436937,,,,,,['NIHMS822602'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, myeloid and other hematologic malignancies often express CD30. We retrospectively examined the prevalence of CD30 expression in 41 patients (median age 59) and 55 biopsies with the diagnosis of leukemia cutis (LC) to determine whether an extensive immunohistochemical workup is warranted in all large, round cell CD30 cutaneous infiltrates. Each patient had refractory or recurrent disease, the histologic presence of a large mononuclear cell infiltrate, and varied cytogenetics. CD30 mononuclear cells within the infiltrate ranged from rare to many in 22 biopsies (22/55). In 18 biopsies, CD30 cells were interpreted as lymphocytic based on morphology, strong cytoplasmic and Golgi staining for CD30, and negative CD34 and CD117 staining. One case showing 3+ staining of lymphocytes was identified as a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. The second 3+ case was favored to represent a subset of CD30-positive acute myeloid leukemia. Three other cases with 1+ membranous and cytoplasmic staining were interpreted as myeloid leukemia. In conclusion, CD30 positivity in myeloid leukemia in the skin is rare and does not often exhibit the strong membranous (2+ or 3+) and/or Golgi staining seen in reactive lymphocytes. Acute myeloid leukemia or myeloid LC may occasionally show 1+ (and rarely 2-3+) cytoplasmic/membranous or nonspecific blush nuclear CD30 labeling. Strong diffuse staining for CD30 should prompt consideration of a reactive lymphoid/lymphoproliferative process, and, when the clinical likelihood of CD30 LC is low, may obviate the need for further immunohistochemistry.",,"['Ogunrinade, Olakunle', 'Terrano, David', 'Chiu, April', 'Pulitzer, Melissa']","['Ogunrinade O', 'Terrano D', 'Chiu A', 'Pulitzer M']","['*Department of Dermatology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; and daggerDepartment of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC5398922,,,,,,['NIHMS812384'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the critical roles that GAS6 and AXL play in refractory disease, this signaling axis represents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. However, the strong picomolar binding affinity between GAS6 and AXL and the promiscuity of small molecule inhibitors represent important challenges faced by current anti-AXL therapeutics. Here, we have addressed these obstacles by engineering a second-generation, high-affinity AXL decoy receptor with an apparent affinity of 93 femtomolar to GAS6. Our decoy receptor, MYD1-72, profoundly inhibited disease progression in aggressive preclinical models of human cancers and induced cell killing in leukemia cells. When directly compared with the most advanced anti-AXL small molecules in the clinic, MYD1-72 achieved superior antitumor efficacy while displaying no toxicity. Moreover, we uncovered a relationship between AXL and the cellular response to DNA damage whereby abrogation of AXL signaling leads to accumulation of the DNA-damage markers gammaH2AX, 53BP1, and RAD51.

Therefore, developing a deeper understanding of the contribution of sunitinib's numerous targets to the clinical response or to resistance is crucial. Here, we have shown that cancer cells respond to clinically relevant doses of sunitinib by enhancing the stability of the antiapoptotic protein MCL-1 and inducing mTORC1 signaling, thus evoking little cytotoxicity. Inhibition of MCL-1 or mTORC1 signaling sensitized cells to clinically relevant doses of sunitinib in vitro and was synergistic with sunitinib in impairing tumor growth in vivo, indicating that these responses are triggered as prosurvival mechanisms that enable cells to tolerate the cytotoxic effects of sunitinib. Furthermore, higher doses of sunitinib were cytotoxic, triggered a decline in MCL-1 levels, and inhibited mTORC1 signaling. Mechanistically, we determined that sunitinib modulates MCL-1 stability by affecting its proteasomal degradation. Dual modulation of MCL-1 stability at different dose ranges of sunitinib was due to differential effects on ERK and GSK3beta activity, and the latter also accounted for dual modulation of mTORC1 activity. Finally, comparison of patient samples prior to and following sunitinib treatment suggested that increases in MCL-1 levels and mTORC1 activity correlate with resistance to sunitinib in patients.",,"['Elgendy, Mohamed', 'Abdel-Aziz, Amal Kamal', 'Renne, Salvatore Lorenzo', 'Bornaghi, Viviana', 'Procopio, Giuseppe', 'Colecchia, Maurizio', 'Kanesvaran, Ravindran', 'Toh, Chee Keong', 'Bossi, Daniela', 'Pallavicini, Isabella', 'Perez-Gracia, Jose Luis', 'Lozano, Maria Dolores', 'Giandomenico, Valeria', 'Mercurio, Ciro', 'Lanfrancone, Luisa', 'Fazio, Nicola', 'Nole, Franco', 'Teh, Bin Tean', 'Renne, Giuseppe', 'Minucci, Saverio']","['Elgendy M', 'Abdel-Aziz AK', 'Renne SL', 'Bornaghi V', 'Procopio G', 'Colecchia M', 'Kanesvaran R', 'Toh CK', 'Bossi D', 'Pallavicini I', 'Perez-Gracia JL', 'Lozano MD', 'Giandomenico V', 'Mercurio C', 'Lanfrancone L', 'Fazio N', 'Nole F', 'Teh BT', 'Renne G', 'Minucci S']",,,20161128,['Mol Cell Oncol. 2017 Feb 23;4(2):e1285385.

These syndromes might be confounders because they are associated with an increased cancer risk and may increase the likelihood of pediatric CT scans. We identify CSS predisposing to leukemia and brain tumors through a systematic literature search and summarize prevalence and risk. Since empirical evidence is lacking in published literature on patterns of CT use for most types of CSS, we estimate confounding bias of relative risks (RR) for categories of radiation exposure based on expert opinion about patterns of CT scans among CSS patients. We estimate that radiation-related RRs for leukemia are not meaningfully confounded by Down syndrome, Noonan syndrome and other CSS. Moreover, tuberous sclerosis complex, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1 and other CSS do not meaningfully confound RRs for brain tumors. Empirical data on the use of CT scans among CSS patients is urgently needed. Our assessment indicates that associations with radiation exposure from pediatric CT scans and leukemia or brain tumors reported in previous studies are unlikely to be substantially confounded by unmeasured CSS.",,"['Meulepas, Johanna M', 'Ronckers, Cecile M', 'Merks, Johannes', 'Weijerman, Michel E', 'Lubin, Jay H', 'Hauptmann, Michael']","['Meulepas JM', 'Ronckers CM', 'Merks J', 'Weijerman ME', 'Lubin JH', 'Hauptmann M']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['12-1155/AICR_/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],20161128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WT1 is known to be a player in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and FOXP3 has a crucial role in regulating the immune response. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of overexpression of WT1and FOXP3 genes on clinical course in adult and pediatric AML patients in Egypt. Patients and methods: Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples were obtained from 97 de novo non M3 AML patients (63 adult and 34 pediatric). Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect overexpression WT1 and FOXP3 genes. Patient follow up ranged from 0.2 to 39.0 months with a median of 5 months. Results: In the pediatric group; WT1 was significantly expressed with a high total leukocyte count median 50X109/L (p=0.018). In the adult group, WT1 had an adverse impact on complete remission induction, disease-free survival and overall survival (p=0.02, p=0.035, p=0.019 respectively). FOXP3 overexpression was associated with FAB subtypes AML M0 +M1 vs. M2, M4+M5 (p =0.039) and the presence of hepatomegaly (p=0.005). Conclusions: WT1 and FOXP3 overexpression has an adverse impact on clinical presentation, treatment response and survival of pediatric and adult Egyptian AML patients.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],"['Assem, Magda', 'Osman, Ahmed', 'Kandeel, Eman', 'Elshimy, Reham', 'Nassar, Hanan', 'Ali, Radwa']","['Assem M', 'Osman A', 'Kandeel E', 'Elshimy R', 'Nassar H', 'Ali R']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo university, Cairo, Egypt.

METHODS: We treated eight patients with FLT3-ITD+ AML who had relapsed in median 91 d (range, 28-249) following allo-SCT with a combination of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib and the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine (Aza). RESULTS: Patients received a median of five cycles of Aza (range, 2-9) and sorafenib with a median daily dosage of 750 mg (range 400-800) for 129 d (range, 61-221). Six of eight patients received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) with a median number of two DLI per patient (range, 1-4). Following this treatment, four patients (50%) achieved a complete remission and three of them a complete molecular remission. Median duration of CR was 182 d (range, 158-406), and two patients remain in ongoing remission for 406 and 168 d. Median overall survival was 322 d (range, 108-574 d) with three patients being currently alive.

Among 115 patients who received pre-SCT HMT, comparison analysis of the prognostic values between the IPSS-R at the time of HMT (IPSS-R@HMT) and at the time of SCT after HMT (IPSS-R@SCT) showed a significantly higher predictive power for overall survival (OS) of the latter. Alteration in IPSS-R risk occurred in 60%, while the patients with 'down-staged' IPSS-R@SCT showed better OS compared with those with 'unchanged' or 'up-staged' risk. On multivariate analysis in all 201 patients, IPSS-R@SCT, monosomal karyotype, treatment failure to pre-SCT treatment, and high hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index were independently associated with OS. Constructed using these factors, the MDS Transplantation Prognostic Scoring System (MTPSS) identified four risk groups with 4-year OS of 76.4% in low, 61.4% in intermediate-1 and 21.9% in intermediate-2 risk groups, whereas all in the high risk group died within 2 years after SCT (P<0.001).

Genetic resistance and susceptibility has been mapped to the Major Histocompatibility Complex class II DRB3 gene (BoLA DRB3). The aim of this work was to determine the effect of Mycobacterium bovis infection on certain virological and host immunological parameters of BLV experimental infection. Twenty-six Argentinian Holstein calves carrying the resistance-associated marker allele BoLA DRB3*0902, susceptibility-associated marker allele BoLA DRB3*1501, or neutral BoLA DRB3 alleles, exposed to M. bovis were used. Twenty calves were inoculated with BLV, three were naturally infected and other three were BLV-negative. Seven from twenty six (27%) of the animals resulted positive to the PPD test. The proviral load, absolute leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, time to seroconversion, antibody titer against BLV, and viral antigen expression in vitro at various times post inoculation were determined and compared between PPD+ and PPD- animals. From a total of 23 BLV positive animals (naturally and experimentally infected), 13 (56.5%) developed HPL, and 10 (43.5%) developed LPL. None of the investigated parameters were affected by infection with M. bovis. We concluded that the ability of cattle carrying resistance-associated marker to control BLV and to progress towards a LPL phenotype was not altered by M. bovis co-infection.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigated the anticancer activity of Allium roseum L. extracts, a wild edible species in North Africa, on human Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) K562 cells. The dehydrated aqueous extract (DAE) disturbed the cell cycle progression and induced the apoptosis of K562 cells. Chemical analysis of DAE showed a diversity of organosulfur compounds S-alk(en)yl-cysteine sulfoxides (RCSO) and high amount of allicin, suggesting that such molecule may be behind its antitumor effect. DAE was efficient in inhibiting K562 cell viability. DAE inhibitory effect was associated with the dephosphorylation of the BCR-ABL kinase and interfered with ERK1/2, Akt, and STAT5 pathways. Furthermore, we found that DAE-induced inactivation of Akt kinase led to the activation of its target FOXO3 transcription factor, enhancing the expression of FOXO3-regulated proapoptotic effectors, Bim and Bax, and cell cycle inhibitor p27. Finally, we found that DAE reduced the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor. Overall, our data suggest that A. roseum extract has great potential as a nontoxic cheap and effective alternative to conventional chemotherapy.",,"['Souid, Soumaya', 'Najjaa, Hanen', 'Riahi-Chebbi, Ichrak', 'Haoues, Meriam', 'Neffati, Mohamed', 'Arnault, Ingrid', 'Auger, Jacques', 'Karoui, Habib', 'Essafi, Makram', 'Essafi-Benkhadir, Khadija']","['Souid S', 'Najjaa H', 'Riahi-Chebbi I', 'Haoues M', 'Neffati M', 'Arnault I', 'Auger J', 'Karoui H', 'Essafi M', 'Essafi-Benkhadir K']","[""a Institut Pasteur de Tunis, LR11IPT04 Laboratoire d'Epidemiologie Moleculaire et de Pathologie Experimentale Appliquee Aux Maladies Infectieuses , Tunis , Tunisie."", 'b Universite de Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisie.', ""c Laboratoire d'Ecologie Pastorale , Institut des regions Arides de Medenine , Tunisie."", ""a Institut Pasteur de Tunis, LR11IPT04 Laboratoire d'Epidemiologie Moleculaire et de Pathologie Experimentale Appliquee Aux Maladies Infectieuses , Tunis , Tunisie."", 'b Universite de Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisie.', 'b Universite de Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisie.', 'd Institut Pasteur de Tunis, LTCII LR11IPT02 , Tunis , Tunisie.', ""c Laboratoire d'Ecologie Pastorale , Institut des regions Arides de Medenine , Tunisie."", 'e CETU Innophyt , Universite Francois Rabelais, avenue Monge , France, Tours.', 'f IRBI, UMR CNRS 6035 , Universite Francois Rabelais, avenue Monge , France, Tours.', ""a Institut Pasteur de Tunis, LR11IPT04 Laboratoire d'Epidemiologie Moleculaire et de Pathologie Experimentale Appliquee Aux Maladies Infectieuses , Tunis , Tunisie."", 'b Universite de Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisie.', 'b Universite de Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisie.', 'd Institut Pasteur de Tunis, LTCII LR11IPT02 , Tunis , Tunisie.', ""a Institut Pasteur de Tunis, LR11IPT04 Laboratoire d'Epidemiologie Moleculaire et de Pathologie Experimentale Appliquee Aux Maladies Infectieuses , Tunis , Tunisie."", 'b Universite de Tunis El Manar , Tunis , Tunisie.']",,20161128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, aberrant DNA methylation was also found as a dominant mechanism of disease progression in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This study intended to explore GPX3 promoter methylation and its clinical relevance in 110 patients with MDS. GPX3 methylation was examined by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RQ-MSP) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP). GPX3 methylation was identified in 15% (17/110) MDS patients, and significantly higher than controls, and lower than acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (P = 0.024 and 0.041). GPX3 methylated patients had older age and higher frequency of DNMT3A mutation (P = 0.015 and 0.066). Cases with GPX3 methylation showed significantly shorter overall survival (OS) time than those with GPX3 unmethylation analyzed with Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.012). Moreover, Cox regression analysis revealed that GPX3 methylation might act as an independent prognostic indicator in MDS (HR = 1.847, P = 0.072). GPX3 methylation density was significantly increased during the progression from MDS to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) in three follow-up paired patients.

These membrane structures contain immunoglobulin E receptors, are resistant to detergents, and lack detectable fluorescence labeling of F-actin and fibronectin. The formation of these membrane structures correlates with a loss of contact inhibition between RBL cells. We observe similar cellular responses towards GO for NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.

The role of radiation is not well-defined. AIM: To evaluate the effect of radiation in OGS and to define an optimal dose for achieving adequate local control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 11 patients who received radiation therapy to orbit for Granulocytic Sarcoma (GS) between 2007 and 2014 at a tertiary cancer center in India. Radiotherapy was planned by three dimensional conformal (3DCRT) techniques. Demographic and disease characteristics, including clinical, imaging, histopathology and treatment details in this patient cohort were recorded and their response to therapy was assessed. RESULTS: The median age was 7 years (Range: 2-16 years). There were 3 female and 8 male patients. Eight patients were diagnosed as Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), two patients had Primary Orbital Granulocytic Sarcoma (POGS) and one had bi-phenotypic leukemia. Median dose was 24.5Gy (Range-15-45 Gy). Two anterior oblique field design were used most commonly. Out of 11 patients, 5 (45.4%) had complete response, 3 (27.27%) had partial response, 1 patient had stable disease (9%) and 2 developed progressive disease (18%). Median follow-up was 24 months (Range 24-84 months). At last follow-up, 7 (63.6%) patients were alive and 4 patients (37.4%) were dead due to progressive disease.

Sparse recent published data are available documenting the aetiological profile and management of patients with splenic abscess from India. AIM: To study the clinical profile of splenic abscess. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from case records of admitted patients with splenic abscesses, to Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences and Hospital which is a multispecialty, tertiary care referral hospital over a period of 15 months (from March 2014 to May 2015) and parameters studied were age, sex, symptoms, signs, risk factors, investigations like Ultrasound, CT scan, blood & microbiological culture, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Most common presenting symptom was fever (90%). Mean age was 33.5 years. Five patients (55%) had risk factors like HIV, leukaemia and diabetes. From pus culture Escherichia coli was the most common organism (22%) grown. Staphylococcus saureus, Enterococcus faecium were seen in one each, blood culture grown Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudomonas aeroginosa in one each, Plasmodium falciparum was seen on peripheral smear in one. Three were empirically treated as disseminated koch's. Another was treated as possible infective endocarditis. All were given antimicrobials, five (55%) were treated with antimicrobials alone, three (33%) with PCD (Per Cutaneous Drainage) and one (11%) with sub-total splenectomy. All patients recovered. CONCLUSION: With early diagnosis and increased use of ultrasound guided procedures like aspiration or drainage, spleenectomy can be avoided.

In acute leukaemia, complications like bleeding and infection cause significant morbidity and mortality, thus overshadowing the thromboembolic events. Among the various malignant haematological disorders, the association of thromboembolic events is often noted with acute promyelocytic leukemia, though the overall frequency of such events remains very low. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is, however, more common than Acute non-lymphoblastic Leukaemia. Usually patients present with symptoms because of cytopenias, organomegaly, lymphadenopathy and bone pain, including other skeletal abnormalities. Granular Acute lymphoblastic Leukaemia (G-ALL) may be misdiagnosed as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) because of the presence of cytoplasmic granules in the lymphoblasts. This variant of ALL is usually noted in children, but may be seen in adults too. It is also important to note that asymptomatic skeletal involvement can be seen in 40-60% of patients with ALL, but pathological fractures and osteolytic lesions along with hypercalcemia at the time of presentation are very rare.

Epigenetic mechanisms, which orchestrate fetal growth and development, may offer insight on the early programming of health and disease. We investigated whether birth weight-for-gestational is associated with DNA methylation at birth and mid-childhood, measured via the Infinium 450K array. METHODS/RESULTS: Participants were from Project Viva, a pre-birth cohort of pregnant women and their children in Eastern Massachusetts. After exclusion of participants with maternal type 1 or 2 diabetes and gestational age <34 weeks, we used DNA methylation assays from 476 venous umbilical cord blood samples and a subset of 235 who additionally had peripheral blood samples available in mid-childhood (age 7-10 years). Among 392,918 CpG sites analyzed, birth weight-for-gestational age z-score was associated with cord blood DNA methylation at 34 CpGs (false discovery rate P < 0.05), after adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, parity, delivery mode, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational diabetes status, child sex, and estimated cord blood cell proportions based on a cord blood reference panel. Two of these CpGs were previously reported in epigenome-wide analyses of birth weight, and several other CpGs map to genes relevant to fetal growth and development. Namely, higher birth weight-for-gestational age was associated with higher methylation at four CpGs at the PBX1 locus (e.g., beta (95% CI) for lead signal at cg06750897 = 1.9 (1.2, 2.6)), which encodes a transcription factor that regulates embryonic development. Birth weight-for-gestational age was also associated with mid-childhood blood DNA methylation at four of the 34 CpGs identified in cord blood analyses, including sites at the PBX1 locus described. CONCLUSIONS: We identified CpG sites where birth weight-for-gestational age was associated with DNA methylation at birth, and for a subset of these sites, birth weight-for-gestational age was also associated with DNA methylation at mid-childhood.",,"['Agha, Golareh', 'Hajj, Hanine', 'Rifas-Shiman, Sheryl L', 'Just, Allan C', 'Hivert, Marie-France', 'Burris, Heather H', 'Lin, Xihong', 'Litonjua, Augusto A', 'Oken, Emily', 'DeMeo, Dawn L', 'Gillman, Matthew W', 'Baccarelli, Andrea A']","['Agha G', 'Hajj H', 'Rifas-Shiman SL', 'Just AC', 'Hivert MF', 'Burris HH', 'Lin X', 'Litonjua AA', 'Oken E', 'DeMeo DL', 'Gillman MW', 'Baccarelli AA']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, 722 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032 USA.', ""Division of Newborn Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA USA."", 'Obesity Prevention Program, Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston, MA USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY USA.', 'Obesity Prevention Program, Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston, MA USA.', 'Diabetes Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA USA.', 'Department of Neonatology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA USA.', 'Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.H.

In this multi-center, prospective clinical trial (EURO-SKI, NCT01596114) we analyzed the function and phenotype of T and NK cells and their relation to successful TKI cessation. Lymphocyte subclasses were measured from 100 imatinib-treated patients at baseline and 1 month after the discontinuation, and functional characterization of NK and T cells was done from 45 patients. The proportion of NK cells was associated with the molecular relapse-free survival as patients with higher than median NK-cell percentage at the time of drug discontinuation had better probability to stay in remission. Similar association was not found with T or B cells or their subsets. In non-relapsing patients the NK-cell phenotype was mature, whereas patients with more naive CD56(bright) NK cells had decreased relapse-free survival. In addition, the TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma cytokine secretion by NK cells correlated with the successful drug discontinuation.

EGR2 mutations were detected in 91/2403 (3.8%) investigated cases, and associated with younger age at diagnosis, advanced clinical stage, high CD38 expression and unmutated IGHV genes. EGR2-mutated patients frequently carried ATM lesions (42%), TP53 aberrations (18%) and NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations (16%). EGR2 mutations independently predicted shorter time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) and overall survival (OS) in the screening cohort; they were confirmed associated with reduced TTFT and OS in the CRC cohort and independently predicted short OS from randomization in the UK CLL4 cohort. A particularly dismal outcome was observed among EGR2-mutated patients who also carried TP53 aberrations. In summary, EGR2 mutations were independently associated with an unfavorable prognosis, comparable to CLL patients carrying TP53 aberrations, suggesting that EGR2-mutated patients represent a new patient subgroup with very poor outcome.",,"['Young, E', 'Noerenberg, D', 'Mansouri, L', 'Ljungstrom, V', 'Frick, M', 'Sutton, L-A', 'Blakemore, S J', 'Galan-Sousa, J', 'Plevova, K', 'Baliakas, P',

Previous studies suggest that BET inhibitors constrain tumor cell proliferation and survival mainly through the suppression of MYC transcription and activity. However, suppression of the transcription of additional genes also contributes to the antitumor activity of BET inhibitors but is less well understood. Here we examined the therapeutic potential of CPI-0610, a potent BET inhibitor currently undergoing phase I clinical testing, in multiple myeloma (MM). CPI-0610 displays potent cytotoxicity against MM cell lines and patient-derived MM cells through G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. CPI-0610-mediated BET inhibition overcomes the protective effects conferred by cytokines and bone marrow stromal cells. We also confirmed the in vivo efficacy of CPI-0610 in a MM xenograft mouse model. Our study found IKZF1 and IRF4 to be among the primary targets of CPI-0610, along with MYC. Given that immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) stabilize cereblon and facilitate Ikaros degradation in MM cells, we combined it with CPI-0610. Combination studies of CPI-0610 with IMiDs show in vitro synergism, in part due to concomitant suppression of IKZF1, IRF4 and MYC, providing a rationale for clinical testing of this drug combination in MM patients.",,"['Siu, K T', 'Ramachandran, J', 'Yee, A J', 'Eda, H', 'Santo, L', 'Panaroni, C', 'Mertz, J A', 'Sims Iii, R J', 'Cooper, M R', 'Raje, N']","['Siu KT', 'Ramachandran J', 'Yee AJ', 'Eda H', 'Santo L', 'Panaroni C', 'Mertz JA', 'Sims Iii RJ', 'Cooper MR', 'Raje N']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",,20161128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two subsets differ in their levels of anergy, defined by low surface immunoglobulin M levels/signaling capacity, and in their DNA methylation profile, particularly variable in M-CLL. We have now found that levels of IL-10 produced by activated CLL cells were highly variable. Levels were higher in M-CLL than in U-CLL and correlated with anergy. DNA methylation analysis of IL10 locus revealed two previously uncharacterized 'variably methylated regions' (CLL-VMRs1/2) in the gene body, but similarly low methylation in the promoter of both U-CLL and M-CLL. CLL-VMR1/2 methylation was lower in M-CLL than in U-CLL and inversely correlated with IL-10 induction. A functional signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) binding site in CLL-VMR2 was confirmed by proximity ligation and luciferase assays, whereas inhibition of SYK-mediated STAT3 activation resulted in suppression of IL10. The data suggest epigenetic control of IL-10 production. Higher tumor load may compensate the reduced IL-10 production in U-CLL, accounting for clinical immunosuppression in both subsets.

The glycoengineered anti-CD20 mAb obinutuzumab was developed to induce enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent phagocytosis and direct cell death and was shown to lead to improved outcomes in a randomized study in B-CLL. We hypothesized that immune stimulation through Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonism in combination with obinutuzumab would further enhance lymphoma clearance and the generation of long-term antitumor immune responses. Here we demonstrate, in syngeneic human CD20 (hCD20)-expressing models of lymphoma, that systemic administration of a TLR7 agonist (R848) increases responses when administered in combination with obinutuzumab and protects against disease recurrence. Depletion studies demonstrate that primary antitumor activity is dependent on both NK cells and CD4(+) T cells but not on CD8(+) T cells. However, both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells appear necessary for the generation of protective immunological memory. Importantly, increased tumor-free survival post obinutuzumab and R848 combination therapy was seen in hCD20 transgenic mice, which express hCD20 on normal B cells.

Here, we show that trichostatin A, romidepsin and panobinostat induce apoptosis across a panel of malignant B cell lines, including lines that are intrinsically resistant to bortezomib, etoposide, cytarabine and BH3 mimetics. Further analysis traces the pro-apoptotic effects of HDAC inhibitors to increased acetylation of the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), causing release and degradation of the HSP90 client proteins RASGRP1 and CRAF, which in turn leads to downregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway signaling and upregulation of the pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member BIM in vitro and in vivo.

Intravital imaging enabled detailed visualization of single Sca-1(+), c-Kit(+), Lineage(-) (SKL) cell migration to bone marrow niches and subsequent proliferation to reconstitute hematopoiesis. This longitudinal study allowed direct observation of dynamic HSC/HPC activities during engraftment in full color for up to 6 days in live recipients. Individual SKL cells, but not mature or committed progenitor cells, preferentially homed to a limited number of niches near highly vascularized endosteal regions, and clonally expanded. Engraftment of SKL cells in P-selectin and osteopontin knockout mice showed abnormal homing and expansion of SKL cells. CD150(+), CD48(-) SKL populations initially engrafted in the central marrow region, utilizing only a subset of niches occupied by the parent SKL cells.

Here we demonstrate specific and rapid induction of the AP-1 family member JunB in MM cells when co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells. Supporting a functional key role of JunB in MM pathogenesis, knockdown of JUNB significantly inhibited in vitro MM cell proliferation and survival. Consistently, induced silencing of JUNB markedly decreased tumor growth in a murine MM model of the microenvironment. Subsequent gene expression profiling revealed a role for genes associated with apoptosis, DNA replication and metabolism in driving the JunB-mediated phenotype in MM cells. Importantly, knockdown of JUNB restored the response to dexamethasone in dexamethasone-resistant MM cells. Moreover, 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced activation of a JunB-ER fusion protein protected dexamethasone-sensitive MM cells against dexamethasone- and bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity. In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time a specific role for AP-1/JunB in MM cell proliferation, survival and drug resistance, thereby strongly supporting that this transcription factor is a promising new therapeutic target in MM.",,"['Fan, F', 'Bashari, M H', 'Morelli, E', 'Tonon, G', 'Malvestiti, S', 'Vallet, S', 'Jarahian, M', 'Seckinger, A', 'Hose, D', 'Bakiri, L', 'Sun, C', 'Hu, Y', 'Ball, C R', 'Glimm, H', 'Sattler, M', 'Goldschmidt, H', 'Wagner, E F', 'Tassone, P', 'Jaeger, D', 'Podar, K']","['Fan F', 'Bashari MH', 'Morelli E', 'Tonon G', 'Malvestiti S', 'Vallet S', 'Jarahian M', 'Seckinger A', 'Hose D', 'Bakiri L', 'Sun C', 'Hu Y', 'Ball CR', 'Glimm H', 'Sattler M', 'Goldschmidt H', 'Wagner EF', 'Tassone P', 'Jaeger D', 'Podar K']","['Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""University 'Magna Graecia' of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy."", 'Functional Genomics of Cancer Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Section Multiple Myeloma, Department of Internal Medicine V, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Section Multiple Myeloma, Department of Internal Medicine V, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genes Development and Disease Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Section Multiple Myeloma, Department of Internal Medicine V, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genes Development and Disease Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.', ""University 'Magna Graecia' of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy."", 'Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, University Hospital Krems, Krems an der Donau, Austria.']",,20161128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a monogenic disease, it is an optimum target for RNA silencing therapy. We developed a siRNA-based therapeutic approach in which the siRNA is delivered by pepM or pepR, two cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) derived from the dengue virus capsid protein. These peptides have a dual role: siRNA delivery into cells and direct action as bioportides, i.e. intracellularly bioactive CPPs, targetting cancer-related signaling processes. Both pepM and pepR penetrate the positive Bcr-Abl(+) Cell Line (BV173). Five in silico designed anti-Bcr-Abl siRNA were selected for in vitro analysis after thorough screening. The Bcr-Abl downregulation kinetics (48h to 168h) was followed by quantitative PCR. The bioportide action of the peptide vectors was evaluated by genome-wide microarray analysis and further validated by testing BV173 cell cycle and cell proliferation monitoring different genes involved in housekeeping/cell stress (RPL13A, HPRT1), cell proliferation (ki67), cell apoptosis (Caspase 3 and Caspase 9) and cell cycle steps (CDK2, CCDN2, CDKN1A). Assays with a commercial transfection agent were carried out for comparison purposes. Maximal Bcr-Abl gene knockdown was observed for one of the siRNA when delivered by pepM at 120h. Both pepM and pepR showed downregulation effects on proliferative CML-related signaling pathways having direct impact on BV173 cell cycle and proliferation, thus reinforcing the siRNA effect by acting as anticancer molecules. With this work we show the therapeutic potential of a CPP shuttle that combines intrinsic anticancer properties with the ability to deliver functional siRNA into CML cell models. By such combination, the pepM-siRNA conjugates lowered Bcr-Abl gene expression levels more extensively than conventional siRNA delivery technologies and perturbed leukemogenic cell homeostasis, hence revealing their potential as novel alternative scaffolds for CML therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, limited information is available on intra-ovarian factors that mediate the actions of gonadotropins. In this study, we identified that the early growth response 2 gene (EGR2) is a gonadotropin-inducible gene in granulosa cells of rats and humans. Analysis of consensus EGR-binding elements (EBEs) showed that the immediate early response 3 gene (IER3) is a novel transcriptional target gene of EGR2 as confirmed by the luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and western blot analysis. Overexpression of EGR2 promoted survival of KGN human granulosa-derived cells in which IER3 acts as a mediator; knockdown of EGR2 induced death in KGN cells. Additionally, EGR2 was found to regulate the expression of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), which belongs to the BCL-2 family of proteins regulating cell survival. Thus, this study identified a novel signaling axis, comprised of gonadotropins-EGR2-IER3, which is important for the survival of granulosa cells during folliculogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We studied 161 consecutive patients with acute leukemia who underwent HSCT at our hospital between 2006 and 2014, of whom 109 also received leukemia induction/consolidation on our unit. All inpatients had weekly VRE stool surveillance. Pre-HSCT colonization was not associated with increases in HSCT mortality but did identify a subgroup of HSCT recipients with a higher risk for VRE bacteremia and possibly bacteremia from other organisms. The major risk factor for pre-HSCT colonization was the number of hospital inpatient days between initial admission for leukemia and HSCT. One-third of evaluable patients colonized before HSCT were VRE-culture negative on admission for HSCT; these patients had an increased risk for subsequent VRE stool surveillance positivity but not VRE bacteremia. Molecular typing of VRE isolates obtained before and after HSCT showed that VRE strains frequently change. Postengraftment VRE bacteremia was associated with a much higher mortality than pre-engraftment VRE bacteremia. Pre-engraftment bacteremia from any organism was associated with an alternative donor and resulted in an increase in hospital length of stay and cost. Mortality was similar for pre-engraftment VRE bacteremia and pre-engraftment bacteremia due to other organisms, but mortality associated with post-engraftment VRE bacteremia was higher and largely explained by associated severe graft-versus-host disease and relapsed leukemia. These data emphasize the importance of distinguishing between VRE colonization before HSCT and at HSCT, between pre-engraftment and postengraftment VRE bacteremia, and between VRE bacteremia and bacteremia from other organisms.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Intensive chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI), or second transplantation have some value, but most reported series describe only a limited number of patients surviving beyond 2 or 3 years following relapse. Additionally, understandable selection-bias of reports describing the outcomes of intensive management approaches for relapsed leukemia confound generalizability to a broader population. However numerous reports suggest that second allogeneic transplantation for relapsed leukemia following an initial transplant may produce extended disease control and survival for patients with favorable performance status, remission at the time of second transplant, and most importantly a long interval between initial transplant and relapse. Reduced intensity conditioning for second allografts may be preferable and little data exists to suggest that a new donor will improve disease control by inducing a stronger graft-versus-leukemia effect.

Efforts to control relapse by promoting donor T-cell alloreactivity, such as withdrawal of immune suppression or donor lymphocyte infusions, are limited by the propensity to induce graft versus host disease (GVHD) and by inadequate efficacy. Therefore, options for AML patients who have relapsed AML after allo HCT are few and outcomes are poor. Similar to T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells have potent anti-leukemia effector capacity, and yet unlike T-cells, NK cells do not mediate GVHD. Furthermore, their function does not require matching of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) between donor and recipient. Maximizing donor NK alloreactivity thus holds the exciting possibility to induce the graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect without engendering GVHD. Among the array of activating and inhibitory NK cell surface receptors, the killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) play a central role in modulating NK effector function. Here we will review how KIR mediates donor alloreactivity, discuss the role of KIR gene and allele typing to optimize allo HCT donor selection, and discuss how KIR may aid adoptive NK and other cell therapies.",['Copyright A(c) 2016.

The most effective form of post-remission therapy relies on T cell immunotherapy in the form of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, patients with active disease cannot usually expect to be cured with HCT. This inherent dichotomy implies that traditional T cell-based immunotherapy in the form of allogeneic HCT stops being efficacious somewhere between the measurable residual disease (MRD) and the morphologically obvious range. This is in part because the full power of T cells must be restrained in order to avoid lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and partly because only a sub-population of donor T cells are expected to be able to recognize AML cells via their T cell receptor. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, most advanced in the treatment of patients with B-cell malignancies, may circumvent some of these limitations.

This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of switching to nilotinib vs imatinib dose escalation for patients with suboptimal cytogenetic response on imatinib. METHODS: We did a phase 3, open-label, randomised trial in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase with suboptimal cytogenetic response to imatinib according to the 2009 European LeukemiaNet criteria, in Latin America, Europe, and Asia (59 hospitals and care centres in 12 countries). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Before enrolment, all patients had received 3-18 months of imatinib 400 mg once daily and had a suboptimal cytogenetic response according to 2009 ELN recommendations, established through bone marrow cytogenetics. By use of an interactive response technology using fixed blocks, we randomly assigned patients (1:1) to switch to nilotinib 400 mg twice per day or an escalation of imatinib dose to 600 mg once per day (block size of 4). Investigators and participants were not blinded to study treatment. Crossover was allowed for loss of response or intolerance at any time, or for patients with no complete cytogenetic response at 6 months. The primary endpoint was complete cytogenetic response at 6 months in the intention-to-treat population. Efficacy endpoints were based on the intention-to-treat population, with all patients assessed according to the treatment group to which they were randomised (regardless of crossover); the effect of crossover was assessed in post-hoc analyses, in which responses achieved after crossover were excluded. We present the final results at 24 months' follow-up. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00802841). FINDINGS: Between July 7, 2009, and Aug 29, 2012, we enrolled 191 patients. 96 patients were randomly assigned to nilotinib and 95 patients were randomly assigned to imatinib. Complete cytogenetic response at 6 months was achieved by 48 of 96 patients in the nilotinib group (50%, 95.18% CI 40-61) and 40 of 95 in the imatinib group (42%, 32-53%; difference 7.9% in favour of nilotinib; 95% CI -6.2 to 22.0, p=0.31). Excluding responses achieved after crossover, 48 (50%) of 96 patients in the nilotinib group and 34 (36%) of 95 patients in the imatinib group achieved complete cytogenic response at 6 months (nominal p=0.058). Grade 3-4 non-haematological adverse events occurring in more than one patient were headache (nilotinib group, n=2 [2%, including 1 after crossover to imatinib]; imatinib group, n=1 [1%]), blast cell crisis (nilotinib group, n=1 [1%]; imatinib group, n=1 [1%]), and QT prolongation (nilotinib group, n=1 [1%]; imatinib group, n=1 [1%, after crossover to nilotinib]). Serious adverse events on assigned treatment were reported in 11 (11%) of 96 patients in the nilotinib group and nine (10%) of 93 patients in the imatinib group. Seven (7%) of 96 patients died in the nilotinib group and five (5%) of 93 patients died in the imatinib group; no deaths were treatment-related. INTERPRETATION: While longer-term analyses are needed to establish whether the clinical benefits observed with switching to nilotinib are associated with improved long-term survival outcomes, our results suggest that patients with suboptimal cytogenetic response are more likely to achieve improved cytogenetic and molecular responses with switching to nilotinib than with imatinib dose escalation, although the difference was not statistically significant when responses achieved after crossover were included.

First, the addition of CD20-targeting antibodies to conventional chemotherapy has improved the therapeutic outcome in the majority of CLL patients. Since the establishment of the critical role of the B cell receptor signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of CLL, several agents have been developed to target this pathway. Ibrutinib and idelalisib, 2 potent kinase inhibitors, have both become available for CLL therapy in the first and second line. Additionally, the observation of high expression levels of the anti-apoptotic mitochondrial protein Bcl-2 in CLL has led to the development of venetoclax, a BH3 mimetic compound that inhibits Bcl-2 and has shown high efficacy in CLL. This short review summarizes preclinical and clinical data on currently available agents in CLL and provides an outlook on upcoming new challenges in the targeted therapy of CLL.","['(c) 2016 S.

When investigating possible gene expression network partners of WT1 in a large acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient cohort, one of the genes with the highest correlation to WT1 was quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), a key enzyme in the de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthesis pathway. To investigate the possible relationship between WT1 and QPRT, we overexpressed WT1 in hematopoietic progenitor cells and cell lines, resulting in an increase of QPRT expression. WT1 knock-down gave a corresponding decrease in QPRT gene and protein expression. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation revealed WT1 binding to a conserved site in the first intron of the QPRT gene. Upon overexpression in leukemic K562 cells, QPRT conferred partial resistance to the anti-leukemic drug imatinib, indicating possible anti-apoptotic functions, consistent with previous reports on glioma cells. Interestingly, the rescue effect of QPRT overexpression was not correlated to increased NAD + levels, suggesting NAD + independent mechanisms. We conclude that QPRT, encoding a protein with anti-apoptotic properties, is a novel and direct target gene of WT1 in leukemic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

PML-NBs provide a platform for efficient posttranslational modification of targets and protein-protein interaction, contributing to the adjustment of gene expression and chromatin integrity. Although PML SUMOylation is thought to play important roles in diverse cellular functions, the control mechanisms of adequate modification levels have remained unsolved. Here, we report that Cullin-related protein CACUL1/CAC1 (CACUL1) inhibits PML posttranslational modification. CACUL1 interacts with PML and suppresses PML SUMOylation, leading to the regulation of PML-NB size in the nucleus. We also found that Ubc9, a SUMO-conjugating enzyme, binds to CACUL1 and antagonizes the interaction between CACUL1 and PML. Furthermore, CACUL1 attenuates p53 transcriptional activity. These data suggest that CACUL1 is a novel regulator that negatively controls p53 activity through the regulation of PML SUMOylation.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Vascular endothelial function has been studied in adult cancers. Limited data exist regarding CVD risk factors among childhood ALL survivors. We aimed to assess endothelial function, metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in young survivors of childhood ALL. METHODS: Auxological parameters, blood pressure, glucose, lipid profile, hemostatic markers (total adiponectin and high-molecular-weight subfraction, endothelin-1, von Willebrand factor antigen, thrombin-antithrombin complex, D-dimers, fibrinogen), high sensitive C-reactive protein and ultrasound parameters of endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation-FMD, common carotid intima-media thickness-C-IMT, and antero-posterior diameter of infra-renal abdominal aorta-APAO) were assessed in 52 ALL survivors and 34 sex and age-matched controls. RESULTS: ALL patients and controls were not statistically different as regards body mass index and waist circumference. Blood pressure, glucose, total and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, high sensitive C-reactive protein were statistically higher in ALL than in controls, while HDL-cholesterol was lower in ALL than in controls. Patients showed statistically lower high-molecular-weight adiponectin and thrombin-antithrombin complex (p=0.003 and p<0.001, respectively) and higher vonWillebrand factor antigen (p=0.002) than controls. FMD was lower in patients than in controls (p<0.001). Biomarkers of endothelial function, systolic blood pressure and waist circumference were correlated to FMD. CONCLUSIONS: ALL survivors showed derangement of endothelial function, which likely occurs during chemotherapy and lasts till follow up. They showed metabolic alterations even though obesity was not documented. Endothelial vascular parameters should be evaluated earlier during follow-up to detect preclinical onset of CVD.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, recent clinical trials revealed that arsenite is not always effective for non-APL malignancies. Another arsenical, S-dimethylarsino-glutathione ([DMA(III)(GS)]), which is a putative metabolic intermediate in the hepatic metabolism of iAs(III), shows promise for treating several types of lymphoma. However, the metabolism of [DMA(III)(GS)] has not been well investigated, probably because [DMA(III)(GS)] is not stable in biological fluids where the concentration of glutathione is low. In the present study, we injected [DMA(III)(GS)] intravenously into mice and compared the tissue distribution and metabolic dynamics of [DMA(III)(GS)] with those of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2). We found a unique organ preference for the distribution of [DMA(III)(GS)] to the lung and brain in comparison to NaAsO2. Furthermore, [DMA(III)(GS)] appeared to bind to serum albumin by exchanging its glutathione moiety quickly after administration, providing novel insights into the longer retention of [DMA(III)(GS)] in plasma.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrate the enhanced anti-cancer activity of a heterocyclic ring (indole) incorporated curcumin analogue ((1E, 6E)-1, 7-di (1H-indol-3-yl) hepta-1, 6-diene-3, 5-Dione), ICA in short, in comparison to curcumin. METHOD: ICA was synthesized by a one pot condensation reaction. Anti-cancer potential of ICA was assessed in three human cancer cell lines of different origin (Lung adenocarcinoma (A549), leukemia (K562) and colon cancer (SW480)) by MTT assay. Mode of cell death was determined by acridine orange-ethidium bromide (Ao-Eb) staining. Putative cellular targets of ICA were investigated by molecular docking studies. Cell cycle analysis following curcumin or ICA treatment in SW480 cell line was carried out by flow cytometry. Expression levels of Cyclin D1 and apoptotic markers, such as Caspase 3, 8 and 9 were studied by western blot analysis in SW480 cell line treated with or without ICA and curcumin. RESULTS: The yield of ICA synthesis was found to be 69% with a purity of 98%. ICA demonstrated promising anti-cancer activity compared to curcumin alone, as discerned by MTT assay. ICA was non-toxic to the cell line of normal origin. We further observed that ICA is approximately 2 fold more potent than curcumin in inhibiting the growth of SW480 cells. Ao-Eb staining revealed that ICA could induce apoptosis in all the cell lines tested. Molecular docking studies suggest that ICA may possibly exhibit its anticancer effect by inhibiting EGFR in A549, Bcr-Abl in K562 and GSK-3beta kinase in SW480 cell line. Moreover, ICA showed strong binding avidity for Bcl-2 protein in silico, which could result in induction of apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed that both curcumin and ICA induced concomitant cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and G2/M phase. Western blot shows that ICA could effectively down regulate the expression of cell cycle protein cyclin D1, while promoting the activation of Caspase 3, 8 and 9 when compared to curcumin in human colon cancer cell line SW480. CONCLUSION: The result of this study indicates that ICA could hold promise to be a potential anti-cancer agent. Since ICA has shown encouraging results in terms of its anti-cancer activity compared to curcumin, further research is necessary to fully delineate the underlying molecular mechanism of its anticancer potential.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing illustrates that NHA9 and MLL1 co-localize on chromatin and are found associated with Hox gene promoter regions. Furthermore, MLL1 is required for the proliferation of NHA9 cells in vitro and in vivo. Inactivation of MLL1 leads to decreased expression of genes bound by NHA9 and MLL1 and reverses a gene expression signature found in NUP98-rearranged human leukemias.

Thus, new drugs to overcome chemoresistance in ALL are urgently needed. To this end, we established a cytarabine (araC)-resistant ALL cell line (NALM-6/R), which interestingly displayed cross-resistance towards doxorubicin (ADM). Here we report that low dose of triptolide (TPL), a natural product used for treating inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, could reverse araC and ADM resistance and in NALM-6/R cells as well as primary cells from patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) ALL, reflected by inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in vitro, and repression of tumor growth in vivo in a mouse xenograft model. Mechanistically, these events were associated with impaired mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Co-treatment with TPL and araC or ADM upregulated pro-apoptotic caspase-9 protein, inhibited checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and 2 (Chk2) phosphorylation, and induced gammaH2A.X (a DNA damage marker). Notably, the combination regimen of TPL and conventional chemotherapeutics also rapidly diminished tumor burden in a patient with R/R ALL.

However, the development of GC resistance remains an obstacle in GC-based treatment. In the present investigation we found that miR-103 is upregulated in GC-sensitive leukemia cells treated by the hormone. Transfection of GC resistant cells with miR-103 sensitized them to GC induced apoptosis (GCIA), while miR-103 sponging of GC sensitive cells rendered them partially resistant. miR-103 reduced the expression of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK2) and its cyclin E1 target, thereby leading to inhibition of cellular proliferation. miR-103 is encoded within the fifth intron of PANK3 gene. We demonstrate that the GC receptor (GR) upregulates miR-103 by direct interaction with GC response element (GRE) in the PANK3 enhancer. Consequently, miR-103 targets the c-Myc activators c-Myb and DVL1, thereby reducing c-Myc expression. Since c-Myc is a transcription factor of the miR-17~92a poly-cistron, all six miRNAs of the latter are also downregulated. Of these, miR-18a and miR-20a are involved in GCIA, as they target GR and BIM, respectively. Consequently, GR and BIM expression are elevated, thus advancing GCIA.

Ewing sarcoma is a developmental tumor that is associated with widespread de-regulation of developmental transcription programs, including HOX programs. Posterior HOXD genes are abnormally over-expressed by Ewing sarcoma and HOXD13, in particular, contributes to the tumorigenic phenotype. In MLL1 fusion-driven leukemia, aberrant activation of HOXA genes is epigenetically mediated by the TrxG complex and HOXA gene expression and leukemogenesis are critically dependent on the protein-protein interaction between the TrxG proteins MLL1 and menin. Based on these data, we investigated whether posterior HOXD gene activation and Ewing sarcoma tumorigenicity are similarly mediated by and dependent on MLL1 and/or menin. Our findings demonstrate that Ewing sarcomas express high levels of both MLL1 and menin and that continued expression of both proteins is required for maintenance of tumorigenicity. In addition, exposure of Ewing sarcoma cells to MI-503, an inhibitor of the MLL1-menin protein-protein interaction developed for MLL1-fusion driven leukemia, leads to loss of tumorigenicity and down-regulated expression of the posterior HOXD gene cluster.

Here we studied the phenotype of Per LAMs, their subpopulations in Notch1-induced acute lymphoblastic leukemia mice and compared with LAMs from BM or spleen in the same model. Peritoneal macrophages and Per LAMs simultaneously expressed high level iNOS and Arg1, which was not commonly observed in macrophages from different origins. Furthermore, LAMs from peritoneal, BM and spleen expressed lower level CSF-1, TGF-beta1 and VEGF-A than tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Moreover, diverse responses in the expression of some phenotype-associated genes to leukemia microenvironments were detected among those LAMs. In addition, Per LAMs can be sub-divided into CD206(+) and CD206(-) sub-populations, which expressed both M1- and M2-associated genes.

Transplantation of bone marrow progenitor cells retrovirally engineered to express VENTX caused massive expansion of primitive erythroid cells and partly acute erythroleukemia in transplanted mice. The leukemogenic potential of VENTX was confirmed in the AML1-ETO transplantation model, as in contrast to AML1-ETO alone co-expression of AML1-ETO and VENTX induced acute myeloid leukemia, partly expressing erythroid markers, in all transplanted mice. VENTX was highly expressed in patients with primary human erythroleukemias and knockdown of VENTX in the erythroleukemic HEL cell line significantly blocked cell growth.

One of the key players involved in the crosstalk between CLL cells and the microenvironment is the B-cell receptor (BCR). Syk protein, a tyrosine kinase essential for BCR signaling, is therefore a rational candidate for targeted therapy in CLL. Against this background, we tested the efficacy of the highly specific Syk inhibitor TAK-659 in suppressing the favorable signaling derived from the microenvironment. To ex vivo mimic the microenvironment found in the proliferation centers, we co-cultured primary CLL cells with BM stromal cells (BMSC), CD40L and CpG ODN along with BCR stimulation. In this setting, TAK-659 inhibited the microenvironment-induced activation of Syk and downstream signaling molecules, without inhibiting the protein homologue ZAP-70 in T cells. Importantly, the pro-survival, proliferative, chemoresistant and activation effects promoted by the microenvironment were abrogated by TAK-659, which furthermore blocked CLL cell migration toward BMSC, CXCL12, and CXCL13. Combination of TAK-659 with other BCR inhibitors showed synergistic effect in inducing apoptosis, and the sequential addition of TAK-659 in ibrutinib-treated CLL cells induced significantly higher cytotoxicity. These findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of TAK-659 in CLL.",,"['Purroy, Noelia', 'Carabia, Julia', 'Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Egia, Leire', 'Aguilo, Meritxell', 'Carpio, Cecilia', 'Palacio, Carles', 'Crespo, Marta', 'Bosch, Francesc']","['Purroy N', 'Carabia J', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Egia L', 'Aguilo M', 'Carpio C', 'Palacio C', 'Crespo M', 'Bosch F']","[""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",,,,PMC5352193,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR inhibitor', 'CLL', 'Syk', 'TAK-659', 'microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that PML/RARalpha directly bound to the CDKN2C promoter in the APL patient-derived cell line NB4. Luciferase assays indicated that PML/RARalpha inhibited the CDKN2C promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, all-trans retinoic acid treatment induced CDKN2C expression by releasing the PML/RARalpha binding on chromatin in NB4 cells. Functional studies showed that ectopic expression of CDKN2C induced a cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and a partial differentiation in NB4 cells. Finally, the transcriptional regulation of CDKN2C was validated in primary APL patient samples.

We report data for pediatric/young adult patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies (n = 40) treated with nonmyeloablative haploidentical BMT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide from 2003 to 2015. Patients received a preparative regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation. Post-transplantation immunosuppression consisted of cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. Donor engraftment occurred in 29 of 32 (91%), with median time to engraftment of neutrophils >500/microL of 16 days (range, 13 to 22) and for platelets >20,000/microL without transfusion of 18 days (range, 12 to 62). Cumulative incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV and grades III and IV at day 100 were 33% and 5%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 23%, with 7% moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD, according to National Institutes of Health consensus criteria. Transplantation-related mortality (TRM) at 1 year was 13%. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 52%. With a median follow-up of 20 months (range, 3 to 148), 1-year actuarial overall and event-free survival were 56% and 43%, respectively. Thus, we demonstrate excellent rates of engraftment, GVHD, and TRM in pediatric/young adult patients treated with this regimen. This approach is a widely available, safe, and feasible option for pediatric and young adult patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies, including those with a prior history of myeloablative BMT and/or those with comorbidities or organ dysfunction that preclude eligibility for myeloablative BMT.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In addition to donor-derived primary NK cells, continuously expanding cytotoxic cell lines such as NK-92 are being developed for clinical applications. METHODS: To enhance their therapeutic utility for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, we engineered NK-92 cells by lentiviral gene transfer to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that target CD19 and contain human CD3zeta (CAR 63.z), composite CD28-CD3zeta or CD137-CD3zeta signaling domains (CARs 63.28.z and 63.137.z). RESULTS: Exposure of CD19-positive targets to CAR NK-92 cells resulted in formation of conjugates between NK and cancer cells, NK-cell degranulation and selective cytotoxicity toward established B-cell leukemia and lymphoma cells. Likewise, the CAR NK cells displayed targeted cell killing of primary pre-B-ALL blasts that were resistant to parental NK-92. Although all three CAR NK-92 cell variants were functionally active, NK-92/63.137.z cells were less effective than NK-92/63.z and NK-92/63.28.z in cell killing and cytokine production, pointing to differential effects of the costimulatory CD28 and CD137 domains. In a Raji B-cell lymphoma model in NOD-SCID IL2R gamma(null) mice, treatment with NK-92/63.z cells, but not parental NK-92 cells, inhibited disease progression, indicating that selective cytotoxicity was retained in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that it is feasible to generate CAR-engineered NK-92 cells with potent and selective antitumor activity. These cells may become clinically useful as a continuously expandable off-the-shelf cell therapeutic agent.","['Copyright (c) 2017 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

Autologous CD19 chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cells have potentials to cure patients with B cell ALL; however, safety and efficacy of allogeneic CD19 CAR-T cells are still undetermined. CASE PRESENTATION: We treated a 71-year-old female with relapsed and refractory ALL who received co-infusion of haplo-identical donor-derived CD19-directed CAR-T cells and mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) following induction chemotherapy. Undetectable minimal residual disease by flow cytometry was achieved, and full donor cell engraftment was established. The transient release of cytokines and mild fever were detected. Significantly elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin and glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase were observed from days 14 to 18, all of which were reversible after immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that co-infusion of haplo-identical donor-derived CAR-T cells and mobilized PBSCs may induce full donor engraftment in relapsed and refractory ALL including elderly patients, but complications related to donor cell infusions should still be cautioned.

Stable expression of Nanog is essential to maintain the stemness of ESCs. However, Nanog is a short-lived protein and quickly degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome system. Here we report that the deubiquitinase USP21 interacts with, deubiquitinates and stabilizes Nanog, and therefore maintains the protein level of Nanog in mouse ESCs (mESCs). Loss of USP21 results in Nanog degradation, mESCs differentiation and reduces somatic cell reprogramming efficiency. USP21 is a transcriptional target of the LIF/STAT3 pathway and is downregulated upon differentiation. Moreover, differentiation cues promote ERK-mediated phosphorylation and dissociation of USP21 from Nanog, thus leading to Nanog degradation. In addition, USP21 is recruited to gene promoters by Nanog to deubiquitinate histone H2A at K119 and thus facilitates Nanog-mediated gene expression. Together, our findings provide a regulatory mechanism by which extrinsic signals regulate mESC fate via deubiquitinating Nanog.",,"['Jin, Jiali', 'Liu, Jian', 'Chen, Cong', 'Liu, Zhenping', 'Jiang, Cong', 'Chu, Hongshang', 'Pan, Weijuan', 'Wang, Xinbo', 'Zhang, Lingqiang', 'Li, Bin', 'Jiang, Cizhong', 'Ge, Xin', 'Xie, Xin', 'Wang, Ping']","['Jin J', 'Liu J', 'Chen C', 'Liu Z', 'Jiang C', 'Chu H', 'Pan W', 'Wang X', 'Zhang L', 'Li B', 'Jiang C', 'Ge X', 'Xie X', 'Wang P']","['Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', ""Department of Central Laboratory, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital of Tongji University, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, China."", 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Beijing 100850, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Immunology, Unit of Molecular Immunology, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.', ""Department of Central Laboratory, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital of Tongji University, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, China."", ""Department of Clinical Medicine, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital of Tongji University, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, China."", 'Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, National Center for Drug Screening, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', ""Department of Central Laboratory, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital of Tongji University, School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, China.""]",,20161125,,PMC5133637,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5406-2360'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 24.,10.1007/s11136-016-1462-8 [doi],"PURPOSE: Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the commonest form of cancer in this age group, suffer considerable morbidity during treatment, with the majority returning to good health soon after therapy has been completed, as reflected in health-related quality of life (HRQL). However, survivors are at risk of many adverse health outcomes later, including obesity, measured by body mass index (BMI), that is compounded by limited physical activity. This study examined the HRQL of long-term survivors of ALL and its relationship to BMI and physical activity. METHODS: A cohort of 75 subjects who were more than 10 years from diagnosis was assessed for BMI (weight in kg/height in m(2)) and completed two questionnaires. HRQL was measured by the multi-attribute, preference-based Health Utilities Index (HUI) instrument HUI23S4.15Q designed for self-report, and physical activity was quantified by the Habitual Activity Estimation Scale. RESULTS: The mean utility scores for overall HRQL (HUI2 = 0.88, HUI3 = 0.83) were similar to those in the Canadian and US general population segments of equivalent age (HUI2 = 0.86, HUI3 = 0.85). However, the minimum scores (HUI2 = 0.23, HUI3 = -0.09) revealed a group of survivors with notable disabilities in the attributes of hearing, emotion, cognition, and pain. There were no statistically significant correlations between HRQL and BMI or between HRQL and physical activity, except for deafness and inactivity on weekdays. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, long-term survivors of ALL in childhood enjoy good HRQL but some experience appreciable disability, though this is not associated with BMI or, in the main, with physical activity.",,"['Nayiager, T', 'Anderson, L', 'Cranston, A', 'Athale, U', 'Barr, R D']","['Nayiager T', 'Anderson L', 'Cranston A', 'Athale U', 'Barr RD']","[""Service of Hematology-Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", ""Service of Hematology-Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", ""Service of Hematology-Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", ""Service of Hematology-Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON, Canada."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', ""Service of Hematology-Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, ON, Canada. rbarr@mcmaster.ca."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada. rbarr@mcmaster.ca.', 'Health Sciences Centre, Room 3N27, 1200 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4J9, Canada. rbarr@mcmaster.ca.']",,20161124,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Children', '*Leukemia', '*Quality of life', '*Survivors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common acute leukemia in adults, remains a frequently fatal disease. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which obesity favors AML growth and uncovered the fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) regulatory axis that mediates aggressive AML in obesity. We showed that leukemia burden was much higher in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, which had higher levels of FABP4 and interleukin (IL)-6 in the sera. Upregulation of environmental and cellular FABP4 accelerated AML cell growth in both a cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous manner. Genetic disruption of FABP4 in AML cells or in mice blocked cell proliferation in vitro and induced leukemia regression in vivo. Mechanistic investigations showed that FABP4 upregulation increased IL-6 expression and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 phosphorylation leading to DNMT1 overexpression and further silencing of the p15(INK4B) tumor-suppressor gene in AML cells. Conversely, FABP4 ablation reduced DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation and restored p15(INK4B) expression, thus conferring substantial protection against AML growth. Our findings reveal the FABP4/DNMT1 axis in the control of AML cell fate in obesity and suggest that interference with the FABP4/DNMT1 axis might be a new strategy to treat leukemia.",,"['Yan, F', 'Shen, N', 'Pang, J X', 'Zhang, Y W', 'Rao, E Y', 'Bode, A M', 'Al-Kali, A', 'Zhang, D E', 'Litzow, M R', 'Li, B', 'Liu, S J']","['Yan F', 'Shen N', 'Pang JX', 'Zhang YW', 'Rao EY', 'Bode AM', 'Al-Kali A', 'Zhang DE', 'Litzow MR', 'Li B', 'Liu SJ']","['The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, USA.', 'Hematology Division, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Division of Biological Sciences, Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Hematology Division, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, USA.']","['R01 CA149623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA186176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA177679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA180986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA155915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20161125,,PMC5457366,,,,,,['NIHMS827562'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in DNM2 are common in early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, DNM2 expression in other types of ALL are not reported. We studied DNM2 mRNA level in adults with B- and T-cell ALL. We found DNM2 is more highly expressed compared with normals in both forms of ALL. High DNM2 expression is associated with some clinical and laboratory features, inferior outcomes and with leukaemia cell proliferation. We also found Ikaros directly binds the DNM2 promoter and suppresses DNM2 expression. Consequently IKZF1 deletion is associated with high DNM2 expression. Conversely, casein kinase-2 (CK2)-inhibitor increases Ikaros function thereby inhibiting DNM2 expression. Inhibiting DNM2 suppresses proliferation of leukemia cells and synergizes with CK2 inhibition.

The MWC, which includes ~26 000 men and women who began working at Mayak between 1948 and 1982, is the primary source for estimates of the effects of plutonium on cancer risks and also provides information on the effects of low-dose rate external gamma exposures. The TRC consists of ~30 000 men and women of all ages who received low-dose-rate, low-dose exposures as a consequence of Mayak's release of radioactive material into the Techa River. The TRC data are of interest because the exposures are broadly similar to those experienced by populations exposed as a consequence of nuclear accidents such as Chernobyl. In this presentation, it is described the strengths and limitations of these three cohorts, outline and compare recent solid cancer and leukemia risk estimates and discussed why information from the Mayak and Techa River studies might play a role in the development and refinement of the radiation risk estimates that form the basis for radiation protection standards.","['(c) The Author 2016.

It is the most common chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm. In virtually all cases, it is characterized by a V617F point mutation in JAK2 exon 14 or less common mutations in exon 12. The landmark discovery of the autonomously activated JAK/STAT signaling pathway paved the way for the clinical development of the first target drug, the JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. This is now approved for patients with resistance or intolerance to hydroxyurea. Phlebotomies and hydroxyurea are still the cornerstone of treatment, and aim to prevent the first appearance or recurrence of cardiovascular events that, together with progression to post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis and leukemia, represent the main causes of death. Interferon-alpha is an alternative drug and has been shown to induce molecular remissions. It is currently undergoing phase III trials that might eventually lead to its approval for clinical use. The last few years have witnessed important advances towards an accurate early diagnosis of polycythemia vera, greater understanding of its pathogenesis, and improved patient management. This review will focus on the most recent achievements and will aim to unify the different concepts involved in a personalized approach to the patient with polycythemia vera. In spite of many recent advances in the understanding of its pathogenesis and improved disease management, polycythemia vera remains a life-threatening myeloproliferative neoplasm for which there is no cure.

The mechanisms underlying disease progression other than the well-established finding of small TP53-mutated subclones at diagnosis remain unclear. We studied a longitudinal cohort of 35 low- and intermediate-1-risk del(5q) patients treated with lenalidomide (n=22) or not (n=13) by flow cytometric surveillance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell subsets, targeted sequencing of mutational patterns, and changes in the bone marrow microenvironment. All 13 patients with disease progression were identified by a limited number of mutations in TP53, RUNX1, and TET2, respectively, with PTPN11 and SF3B1 occurring in one patient each. TP53 mutations were found in seven of nine patients who developed acute leukemia, and were documented to be present in the earliest sample (n=1) and acquired during lenalidomide treatment (n=6). By contrast, analysis of the microenvironment, and of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by flow cytometry was of limited prognostic value.

The underlying mechanism involves inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis. Besides, celecoxib has also been found to induce autophagy in some solid tumor cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of celecoxib on cell proliferation in HL-60 human acute leukemia cells and to explore the potential mechanism. HL-60 cells were exposed to various concentrations of celecoxib and cell viability was evaluated by the MTT assay. Apoptosis was analyzed with flow cytometry and the amount of autophagosome was evaluated by LysoTracker probe labelling. The expression of apoptosis- and autophagy-related proteins was assayed by Western blot and LysoSensor probe labelling was used to detect the effect of celecoxib on the lysosomal functions. The results of this study indicated that celecoxib inhibited cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. The flow cytometry analysis showed that celecoxib induced apoptosis at low concentrations and mainly cell necrosis at high concentrations. The Western blot test confirmed the induction of apoptosis by the upregulation of apoptosis-related proteins cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that celecoxib prevented the autophagic flux by inhibiting lysosome function; the fluorescence intensity of the LysoTracker probe and the level of autophagy-related proteins LC3-II and p62 were increased, but the fluorescence intensity of the LysoSensor probe was weakened. These findings show that celecoxib is an autophagy suppresser and has antitumor effects in HL-60 cells by inducing cell apoptosis and necrosis.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Bcr-Abl-T315I mutation is the predominant mechanism of the acquired resistance to IM. Therefore, it is urgent to search for additional approaches and targeting strategies to overcome IM resistance. We recently reported that nickel pyrithione (NiPT) potently inhibits the ubiquitin proteasome system via targeting the 19S proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (UCHL5 and USP14), without effecting on the 20S proteasome. In this present study, we investigated the effect of NiPT, a novel proteasomal deubiquitinase inhibitor, on cell survival or apoptosis in CML cells bearing Bcr-Abl-T315I or wild-type Bcr-Abl. METHODS: Cell viability was examined by MTS assay and trypan blue exclusion staining assay in KBM5, KBM5R, K562, BaF3-p210-WT, BaF3-p210-T315I cells, and CML patients' bone marrow samples treated with NiPT. Cell apoptosis in CML cells was detected with Annexin V-FITC/PI and rhodamine-123 staining followed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry and with western blot analyses for apoptosis-associated proteins. Expression levels of Bcr-Abl in CML cells were analyzed by using western blotting and real-time PCR. The 20S proteasome peptidase activity was measured using specific fluorogenic substrate. Active-site-directed labeling of proteasomal DUBs, as well as the phosphorylation of USP14 was used for evaluating the inhibition of the DUBs activity by NiPT. Mouse xenograft models of KBM5 and KBM5R cells were analyzed, and Bcr-Abl-related proteins and protein biomarkers related to proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion in tumor tissues were detected by western blots and/or immunohistological analyses. RESULTS: NiPT induced apoptosis in CML cells and inhibited the growth of IM-resistant Bcr-Abl-T315I xenografts in nude mice. Mechanistically, NiPT induced decreases in Bcr-Abl proteins, which were associated with downregulation of Bcr-Abl transcription and with the cleavage of Bcr-Abl protein by activated caspases. NiPT-induced ubiquitin proteasome system inhibition induced caspase activation in both IM-resistant and IM-sensitive CML cells, and the caspase activation was required for NiPT-induced Bcr-Abl downregulation and apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that NiPT can overcome IM resistance through both Bcr-Abl-dependent and Bcr-Abl-independent mechanisms, providing potentially a new option for CML treatment.",,"['Lan, Xiaoying', 'Zhao, Chong', 'Chen, Xin', 'Zhang, Peiquan', 'Zang, Dan', 'Wu, Jinjie', 'Chen, Jinghong', 'Long, Huidan', 'Yang, Li', 'Huang, Hongbiao', 'Carter, Bing Z', 'Wang, Xuejun', 'Shi, Xianping', 'Liu, Jinbao']","['Lan X', 'Zhao C', 'Chen X', 'Zhang P', 'Zang D', 'Wu J', 'Chen J', 'Long H', 'Yang L', 'Huang H', 'Carter BZ', 'Wang X', 'Shi X', 'Liu J']","['Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China.', 'Division of Basic Biomedical Sciences, Sanford School of Medicine of the University of South Dakota, Vermillion, SD, 57069, USA.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China. shixp612@163.com.', ""Department of Pathophysiology, Protein modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510182, People's Republic of China. shixp612@163.com."", 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Protein Modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 511436, China. jliu@gzhmu.edu.cn.', ""Department of Pathophysiology, Protein modification and Degradation Laboratory, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510182, People's Republic of China. jliu@gzhmu.edu.cn.""]","['R01 HL072166/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL085629/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",20161125,,PMC5123219,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Bcr-Abl', '*Chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*Imatinib resistance', '*Nickel pyrithione']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) inhibits aerobic glycolysis and protects tumor cells from intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated apoptosis. However, the function of TIGAR in glycolysis and survival of acute myeloid leukemia cells remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed TIGAR expression in cytogenetically normal (CN-) AML patients and the correlations with clinical and biological parameters. In vivo and in vitro, we tested whether glycolysis may induce TIGAR expression and evaluated the combination effect of glycolysis inhibitor and TIGAR knockdown on human leukemia cell proliferation. RESULTS: High TIGAR expression was an independent predictor of poor survival and high incidence of relapse in adult patients with CN-AML. TIGAR also showed high expression in multiple human leukemia cell lines and knockdown of TIGAR activated glycolysis through PFKFB3 upregulation in human leukemia cells. Knockdown of TIGAR inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia cells and sensitized leukemia cells to glycolysis inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, TIGAR knockdown in combination with glycolysis inhibitor 2-DG led leukemia cells to apoptosis. In addition, the p53 activator Nutlin-3alpha showed a significant combinational effect with TIGAR knockdown in leukemia cells. However, TIGAR expression and its anti-apoptotic effects were uncoupled from overexpression of exogenous p53 in leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: TIGAR might be a predictor of poor survival and high incidence of relapse in AML patients, and the combination of TIGAR inhibitors with anti-glycolytic agents may be novel therapies for the future clinical use in AML patients.",,"['Qian, Sixuan', 'Li, Jianyong', 'Hong, Ming', 'Zhu, Yu', 'Zhao, Huihui', 'Xie, Yue', 'Huang, Jiayu', 'Lian, Yun', 'Li, Yanru', 'Wang, Shuai', 'Mao, Jianping', 'Chen, Yaoyu']","['Qian S', 'Li J', 'Hong M', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhao H', 'Xie Y', 'Huang J', 'Lian Y', 'Li Y', 'Wang S', 'Mao J', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 210029, China.

Severe thrombocytopenia, although less common in lower-risk MDS, is associated with increased risk of bleeding. For anemic patients, the principal aim of treatment is to improve anemia and decrease red blood cell transfusions. For transfusion-dependent patients with lower-risk MDS without chromosome 5q deletion [non-del(5q) MDS], there are limited effective treatments. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are generally first-line therapy, yielding frequent responses with a median duration of 18-24 months. Immunosuppressive therapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation are restricted to select patients. New strategies for ESA-refractory or relapsed patients include lenalidomide, alone or in combination with ESAs; oral azacitidine; and new molecules such as the activin receptor type II ligand traps luspatercept and sotatercept. In thrombocytopenic patients, thrombopoietin receptor agonists are under evaluation. While trials to evaluate these treatment strategies are underway, efforts are needed to optimize therapies through better patient selection and response prediction as well as integrating molecular and genetic data into clinical practice. We provide an overview of current treatment approaches for lower-risk non-del(5q) MDS and explore promising directions for future research.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

Epub 2016 Oct 3.,,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a blood cell cancer with increased proliferation of granulocytes. Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an important regulator of CML. To investigate the possible downstream factors of STAT3 and gain more insight into CML-related pathways, this study focused on the superior cervical ganglia protein 10-like protein (SCLIP, or SCG 10-like protein) and analyzed the functions of the STAT3-SCLIP pathway. The effects of STAT3 phosphorylation on SCLIP expression were examined by western blotting. Specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) was then used to knockdown SCLIP in the CML cell line K562 and the expression changes of STAT3 and factors further downstream, namely Bcl-2 and cyclin E1, were detected by RT-qPCR. Cell viability and apoptosis were also analyzed following the knockdown of SCLIP. Results showed a positive association between the phosphorylation of STAT3 and the expression of SCLIP. Knockdown of SCLIP inhibited the viability and induced the apoptosis of K562 cells. Knockdown of SCLIP did not affect the expression of STAT3 mRNA but downregulated the mRNA levels of Bcl-2 and cyclin E1. In conclusion, the results indicate that SCLIP is a direct downstream factor of STAT3, regulates Bcl-2 and cyclin E1 and mediates the viability and apoptosis of CML cells. Consisting of at least these four factors, the STAT3-SCLIP pathway might play critical roles in the regulation of CML. These data provided a more profound understanding of CML-related pathways.",,"['Li, Li', 'Zhou, De', 'Zheng, Yanlong', 'Xie, Wanzhuo']","['Li L', 'Zhou', 'Zheng Y', 'Xie W']","['The Senior Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, P.R.

However, the association between promoter methylation with chemotherapeutic outcomes remains unknown. In the present study, bone marrow samples were collected prior to and following chemotherapy in 30 AML patients. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction technology was used to examine the promoter methylation status of adenomatous polyposis col 2 (APC2) and cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1). The results revealed no change in the methylation status of the APC2 promoter in patients following various chemotherapy regimens. However, the methylation status of the CYP1B1 promoter changed in response to 6 different chemotherapy regimens. AML patients of the M3 subtype displayed an induction of the CYP1B1 promoter methylation levels more frequently (57.1%) than patients affected by the other subtypes (M1: 33.3%; M2: 12.5%; M4: 16.7%; M5: 0% and M6: 0%). In addition, a higher frequency of male patients (4/13) exhibited modulation of the CYP1B1 promoter methylation status compared with female patients (3/17). Furthermore, of five AML patients with a poor prognosis, two exhibited changes leading to CYP1B1 hypomethylation and two leading to CYP1B1 hypermethylation. By contrast, three other patients exhibited hypermethylation changes along with remission. This may be explained by the different chemotherapy regimens used to treat these patients or by other unknown factors. The present study revealed that CYP1B1 promoter methylation was induced during chemotherapy, whereas the APC2 promoter remained hemimethylated. Furthermore, the changes in CYP1B1 methylation were dependent on the AML subtypes and the gender of the patients.",,"['Xia, Yongming', 'Hong, Qingxiao', 'Chen, Xiaoying', 'Ye, Huadan', 'Fang, Lili', 'Zhou, Annan', 'Gao, Yuting', 'Jiang, Danjie', 'Duan, Shiwei']","['Xia Y', 'Hong Q', 'Chen X', 'Ye H', 'Fang L', 'Zhou A', 'Gao Y', 'Jiang D', 'Duan S']","[""Department of Hematology, Yuyao People's Hospital, Ningbo University Yangming Affiliated Hospital, Yuyao, Zhejiang 315400, P.R.

Many chemo and immunotherapeutic agents are available to treat this indolent disease. Aim of this study was to determine the outcomes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with different available chemotherapeutic regimens. METHODS: All patients with diagnosis of CLL from 2008 to 2013 were included. Data were collected from hospital information system. Objective response rate (ORR) in terms of complete or partial response (CR, PR), stable or progressive disease (SD, PD), overall survival (OS), and progression free survival (PFS) were calculated. RESULTS: Fifty seven patients were included; 42 (74%) male and 15 (26%) were female. Patients with Binet stage A 10 (18%); B 20 (35%) and C were 27(47%). Median age was 50.9 years. Forty six (80%) were treated and 11(20%) remained on watch and wait. Treatment indications were B symptoms 14 (30%), symptomatic nodal disease 18(39%), thrombocytopenia 4(9%), anemia 7(15%) and doubling of lymphocyte count 3 (7%). Chemotherapy regimens used were FC in 38 (83%), FCR 5(11%), chlorambucil 2(4%) and CVP in 1(2%) patient. Twenty two (56%) patients had CR, 13(33%) PR, 3(7.6 %) SD, and 1(2.5%) had PD. ORR was 89%. Median PFS was 23.1 months and median 3 years OS was 55%. CONCLUSION: Majority of patients was in a relatively younger age group and presented with advanced stage disease requiring treatment. Small number of patients received rituximab due to cost.

This has become possible due to worldwide efforts of preclinical and clinical research focusing on issues of transplant immunology, reduction of transplant-associated morbidity, and mortality and efficient malignant disease eradication. The latter has been accomplished by potent graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effector cells contained in the stem cell graft. Exciting insights into the genetics of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system allowed improved donor selection, including HLA-identical related and unrelated donors. Besides bone marrow, other stem cell sources like granulocyte-colony stimulating-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells and cord blood stem cells have been established in clinical routine. Use of reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative conditioning regimens has been associated with a marked reduction of non-hematological toxicities and eventually, non-relapse mortality allowing older patients and individuals with comorbidities to undergo allogeneic HSCT and to benefit from GvL or antitumor effects. Whereas in the early years, malignant disease eradication by high-dose chemotherapy or radiotherapy was the ultimate goal; nowadays, allogeneic HSCT has been recognized as cellular immunotherapy relying prominently on immune mechanisms and to a lesser extent on non-specific direct cellular toxicity.

Furthermore, loss of p300, but not CBP, promoted cytokine signaling, including enhanced activation of the MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways in the HSPC compartment.

Given the inherent radiosensitivity of hematopoietic cells and short latency period of leukemias, space radiation-induced hematopoietic damage poses a particular threat to astronauts on extended missions. We show that exposing human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC) to extended mission-relevant doses of accelerated high-energy protons and iron ions leads to the following: (1) introduces mutations that are frequently located within genes involved in hematopoiesis and are distinct from those induced by gamma-radiation; (2) markedly reduces in vitro colony formation; (3) markedly alters engraftment and lineage commitment in vivo; and (4) leads to the development, in vivo, of what appears to be T-ALL. Sequential exposure to protons and iron ions (as typically occurs in deep space) proved far more deleterious to HSC genome integrity and function than either particle species alone. Our results represent a critical step for more accurately estimating risks to the human hematopoietic system from space radiation, identifying and better defining molecular mechanisms by which space radiation impairs hematopoiesis and induces leukemogenesis, as well as for developing appropriately targeted countermeasures.",,"['Rodman, C', 'Almeida-Porada, G', 'George, S K', 'Moon, J', 'Soker, S', 'Pardee, T', 'Beaty, M', 'Guida, P', 'Sajuthi, S P', 'Langefeld, C D', 'Walker, S J', 'Wilson, P F', 'Porada, C D']","['Rodman C', 'Almeida-Porada G', 'George SK', 'Moon J', 'Soker S', 'Pardee T', 'Beaty M', 'Guida P', 'Sajuthi SP', 'Langefeld CD', 'Walker SJ', 'Wilson PF', 'Porada CD']","['Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Biological, Environmental, and Climate Sciences Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA.', 'Center for Public Health Genomics, Department of Biostatistical Sciences, Division of Public Health Sciences, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Center for Public Health Genomics, Department of Biostatistical Sciences, Division of Public Health Sciences, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Biological, Environmental, and Climate Sciences Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.']","['R01 CA197991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL097623/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",20161124,,PMC5870806,,,,,,['NIHMS859677'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient with acute myeloid leukemia who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a homozygous CCR5 Delta32 donor has had no detectable viremia for 9 years after HAART cessation. This case has inspired a field of HIV-1 cure research focusing on engineering HIV-1 resistance in permissive cells. Here, we employed a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-scFv X5 approach to confer resistance of human primary CD4 T cells to HIV-1. We showed that primary CD4 T cells expressing GPI-scFv X5 were resistant to CCR5 (R5)-, CXCR4 (X4)-, and dual-tropic HIV-1 and had a survival advantage compared to control cells ex vivo In a hu-PBL mouse study, GPI-scFv X5-transduced CD4 T cells were selected in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues upon HIV-1 infection. Finally, GPI-scFv X5-transduced CD4 T cells, after being cotransfused with HIV-infected cells, showed significantly reduced viral loads and viral RNA copy numbers relative to CD4 cells in hu-PBL mice compared to mice with GPI-scFv AB65-transduced CD4 T cells. We conclude that GPI-scFv X5-modified CD4 T cells could potentially be used as a genetic intervention against both R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1 infections. IMPORTANCE: Blocking of HIV-1 entry is one of most promising approaches for therapy. Genetic disruption of the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5 by nucleases in T cells is under 2 clinical trials and leads to reduced viremia in patients. However, the emergence of viruses using the CXCR4 coreceptor is a concern for therapies applying single-coreceptor disruption. Here, we report that HIV-1-permissive CD4 T cells engineered with GPI-scFv X5 are resistant to R5-, X4-, or dual-tropic virus infection ex vivo In a preclinical study using hu-PBL mice, we show that CD4 T cells were protected and that GPI-scFv X5-transduced cells were selected in HIV-1-infected animals. Moreover, we show that GPI-scFv X5-transduced CD4 T cells exerted a negative effect on virus replication in vivo We conclude that GPI-scFv X5-modified CD4 T cells could potentially be used as a genetic intervention against both R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1 infections.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Ye, Chaobaihui', 'Wang, Weiming', 'Cheng, Liang', 'Li, Guangming', 'Wen, Michael', 'Wang, Qi', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Li, Dan', 'Zhou, Paul', 'Su, Lishan']","['Ye C', 'Wang W', 'Cheng L', 'Li G', 'Wen M', 'Wang Q', 'Zhang Q', 'Li D', 'Zhou P', 'Su L']","['Unit of Anti-Viral Immunity and Genetic Therapy, Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Immunology, Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Unit of Anti-Viral Immunity and Genetic Therapy, Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Immunology, Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Unit of Anti-Viral Immunity and Genetic Therapy, Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Immunology, Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Unit of Anti-Viral Immunity and Genetic Therapy, Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Immunology, Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China blzhou@sibs.ac.cn lsu@med.unc.edu.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA blzhou@sibs.ac.cn lsu@med.unc.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']","['R01 AI080432/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI095097/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",20170118,,PMC5244347,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD4 protection', '*GPI-anchored scFv', '*HIV-1', '*gene therapy', '*humanized mice']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This virus enters the host cell through a receptor encoded by the tvj locus and identified as Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1. The resistance to avian leukosis virus subgroup J in a great majority of galliform species has been explained by deletions or substitutions of the critical tryptophan 38 in the first extracellular loop of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1. Because there are concerns of transspecies virus transmission, we studied natural polymorphisms and susceptibility/resistance in wild galliforms and found the presence of tryptophan 38 in four species of New World quails. The embryo fibroblasts of New World quails are susceptible to infection with avian leukosis virus subgroup J, and the cloned Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 confers susceptibility on the otherwise resistant host. New World quails are also susceptible to new avian leukosis virus subgroup J variants but resistant to subgroups A and B and weakly susceptible to subgroups C and D of avian sarcoma/leukosis virus due to obvious defects of the respective receptors. Our results suggest that the avian leukosis virus subgroup J could be transmitted to New World quails and establish a natural reservoir of circulating virus with a potential for further evolution. IMPORTANCE: Since its spread in broiler chickens in China and Southeast Asia in 2000, ALV-J remains a major enzootic challenge for the poultry industry. Although the virus diversifies rapidly in the poultry, its spillover and circulation in wild bird species has been prevented by the resistance of most species to ALV-J. It is, nevertheless, important to understand the evolution of the virus and its potential host range in wild birds.

Epub 2016 Nov 23.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-2071 [doi],"BCL6 was initially discovered as an oncogene in B-cell lymphomas, where it drives the malignant phenotype by repressing proliferation and DNA damage checkpoints and blocking B-cell terminal differentiation. BCL6 mediates its effects by binding to hundreds of target genes and then repressing these genes by recruiting several different chromatin-modifying corepressor complexes. Structural characterization of BCL6-corepressor complexes suggested that BCL6 might be a druggable target. Accordingly, a number of compounds have been designed to bind to BCL6 and block corepressor recruitment. These compounds, based on peptide or small-molecule scaffolds, can potently block BCL6 repression of target genes and kill lymphoma cells. In the case of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), BCL6 inhibitors are equally effective in suppressing both the germinal center B-cell (GCB)- and the more aggressive activated B-cell (ABC)-DLBCL subtypes, both of which require BCL6 to maintain their survival. In addition, BCL6 is implicated in an expanding scope of hematologic and solid tumors. These include, but are not limited to, B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. BCL6 inhibitors have been shown to exert potent effects against these tumor types. Moreover, mechanism-based combinations of BCL6 inhibitors with other agents have yielded synergistic and often quite dramatic activity. Hence, there is a compelling case to accelerate the development of BCL6-targeted therapies for translation to the clinical setting. Clin Cancer Res; 23(4); 885-93.

We investigated the role of differentially expressed miRNAs on DNMT1 expression and azacitidine resistance in vitro We next evaluated anti-DNMT1 miRNA expression in pretreatment bone marrow samples derived from 75 patients treated with azacitidine for HRMDS or AML.Results: Seven miRNAs, including 5 that in silico targeted the DNMT1 3' UTR, were repressed in azacitidine-resistant cells in which DNMT1 protein levels were significantly higher. Ectopic anti-DNMT1 miRNA expression decreased DNMT1 expression and increased azacitidine sensitivity, whereas specific inhibition of endogenous anti-DNMT1 miRNAs increased DNMT1 expression and triggered azacitidine resistance. In patients treated with azacitidine, decreased expression of anti-DNMT1 miRNAs was associated with poor outcome. miR-126* had the strongest prognostic impact. Patients with miR-126*(low) myelodysplastic syndrome had significantly lower response rates (P = 0.04) and higher relapse rates (P = 0.03), as well as shorter progression-free (PFS; P = 0.004) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis showed that age, miR-126* expression, and revised International Prognostic Scoring System risk independently predicted PFS and OS. In 15 patient samples collected over time, decreased miRNA expression levels were associated with secondary resistance.Conclusions: A decreased expression of anti-DNMT1 miRNAs might account for azacitidine resistance in HRMDS and AML, and measuring miRNA expression before and during treatment might help predict primary or secondary azacitidine resistance.

In GPCR-mediated chemotaxis, GPCRs transduce the gradient of an extracellular chemotactic ligand into intracellular responses via the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. However, ligand-induced G-protein activation has not been directly imaged as yet in mammalian chemotaxing cells. We developed a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe, R10-Gi, by linking the Gi-protein alpha subunit to the regulator of G-protein signaling domain. The R10-Gi probe was coupled with a chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor 1 (BLT1) that induced the receptor to display a high-affinity ligand binding activity (Kd = 0.91 nM) in HEK293 cells. The R10-Gi probe exhibited an increased FRET signal in accord with the LTB4-dependent activation of Gi Furthermore, neutrophil-like differentiated human leukemia cell line 60 that expressed the intrinsic BLT1 displayed temporal Gi-protein activation in an area localized to the leading edge during chemotaxis in a shallow gradient of LTB4 These findings afford an opportunity to clarify the mechanisms underlying the subcellular regulation of Gi-protein activity, as well as GPCR-mediated ligand sensing, during chemotaxis in mammalian cells.-Masuda, K., Kitakami, J., Kozasa, T., Kodama, T., Ihara, S., Hamakubo, T.

However, recent progress in HCT strategies may affect the clinical significance of TBI on neutrophil engraftment. With the use of a Japanese transplant registry database, we analyzed 3933 adult recipients (>15 y.o.) who underwent HCT between 2006 and 2013 from an 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated bone marrow donor (MUD, n = 1367), an HLA-mismatched unrelated bone marrow donor (MMUD, n = 1102), or unrelated cord blood (CBT, n = 1464). Conditioning regimens were divided into five groups: High-TBI-(>8Gy), Low-TBI- (</=8Gy), and no-TBI-myeloablative conditioning (MAC), and Low-TBI- and no-TBI-reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). In both MUD and MMUD, neutrophil engraftment rate was >90% in each of the five conditioning groups, and TBI was not associated with prompt neutrophil engraftment in multivariate analyses. Conversely, in CBT, TBI regimens had a higher rate of day-30 neutrophil engraftment than no-TBI-regimens: 78% in High-TBI-MAC, 83% in Low-TBI-MAC, and 76% in Low-TBI-RIC versus 65% in No-TBI-MAC, and 68% in No-TBI-RIC (P < .001). Multivariate analyses in CBT demonstrated that TBI-regimens were significantly associated with a higher rate of neutrophil engraftment. Subsequently focusing on CBT patients alone, TBI-regimens were significantly associated with a higher rate of neutrophil engraftment in patients who received CBT with a 4/6 or less HLA allele-match, or who had anti-HLA antibodies. In summary, TBI-regimens had no impact on neutrophil engraftment in the current practice of unrelated bone marrow transplantation. However, in CBT, TBI is still necessary to enhance engraftment.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Nakasone, Hideki', 'Fuji, Shigeo', 'Yakushijin, Kimikazu', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Shinohara, Akihito', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Takanashi, Minoko', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Ogata, Masao']","['Nakasone H', 'Fuji S', 'Yakushijin K', 'Onizuka M', 'Shinohara A', 'Ohashi K', 'Miyamura K', 'Uchida N', 'Takanashi M', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Fukuda T', 'Ogata M']","['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Blood Service Headquarters, Japanese Red Cross Society, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine, Oita, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,"['Complication Working Group of Japanese Society for Hematopoietic Cell', 'Transplantation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relapse is the major cause of treatment failure in both diseases. Post-allo-SCT administration of TKIs could potentially reduce relapse rates, but concerns regarding their effect on immune reconstitution have been raised. We aimed to assess immune functions of 12 advanced CML and Ph+ ALL patients who received post-allo-SCT nilotinib. Lymphocyte subpopulations and their functional activities including T-cell response to mitogens, NK cytotoxic activity and thymic function, determined by quantification of the T cell receptor (TCR) excision circles (TREC) and TCR repertoire, were evaluated at several time points, including pre-nilotib-post-allo-SCT, and up to 365 days on nilotinib treatment. NK cells were the first to recover post allo-SCT. Concomitant to nilotinib administration, total lymphocyte counts and subpopulations gradually increased. CD8 T cells were rapidly reconstituted and continued to increase until day 180 post SCT, while CD4 T cells counts were low until 180-270 days post nilotinib treatment. T-cell response to mitogenic stimulation was not inhibited by nilotinib administration. Thymic activity, measured by TREC copies and surface membrane expression of 24 different TCR Vbeta families, was evident in all patients at the end of follow-up after allo-SCT and nilotinib treatment. Finally, nilotinib did not inhibit NK cytotoxic activity. In conclusion, administration of nilotinib post allo-SCT, in attempt to reduce relapse rates or progression of Ph+ ALL and CML, did not jeopardize immune reconstitution or function following transplantation.",,"['Varda-Bloom, Nira', 'Danylesko, Ivetta', 'Shouval, Roni', 'Eldror, Shiran', 'Lev, Atar', 'Davidson, Jacqueline', 'Rosenthal, Esther', 'Volchek, Yulia', 'Shem-Tov, Noga', 'Yerushalmi, Ronit', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Somech, Raz', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Varda-Bloom N', 'Danylesko I', 'Shouval R', 'Eldror S', 'Lev A', 'Davidson J', 'Rosenthal E', 'Volchek Y', 'Shem-Tov N', 'Yerushalmi R', 'Shimoni A', 'Somech R', 'Nagler A']","['Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Dr. Pinchas Bornstein Talpiot Medical Leadership Program, Sheba Medical Center, Israel.', 'Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Pediatric Immunology Service, Jeffrey Modell Foundation, USA.', ""Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Israel."", 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Pediatric Immunology Service, Jeffrey Modell Foundation, USA.', ""Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Israel."", 'Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.']",,,,PMC5352130,['NOTNLM'],"['immune reconstitution', 'mitogens', 'nilotinib', 'stem cell transplantation', 'thymic activity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In turn, TLR ligation and IFNgamma cause B cells to express the transcription factor, T-bet, and to switch immunoglobulin production to IgG2a/c. Absence of TLR7 in T cells leads to the impaired T-bet expression in B cells and subsequent inefficient IgG2a isotype switching both in vitro and during the infection with Friend virus in vivo.

However, recently studies revealed complicated expression features and dual functions of LMO2 on tumor behaviors in a variety of cancer types, including breast cancers. Basal-type breast cancer is one of the breast cancer subtypes and a prognostically unfavorable subtype among all breast cancers. Herein we found that in basal-type breast cancer specifically, high LMO2 expression was positively correlated with lymph node metastases in patients, promoted tumor cell migration and invasion and increased distant metastasis in SCID mice.

Areas covered: This article reviews the similarities and differences in the structure, mechanism of action, efficacy and safety profile of commercially-available MoAbs and prevents new agents potentially useful for CLL treatment. Publications in English before June 2016 were surveyed on the MEDLINE database for articles. Proceedings of the American Society of Hematology held during the last five years were also included. Expert opinion: MoAbs, especially those targeting CD20, are highly effective biological options for first-line and salvage treatment of CLL, particularly in chemoimmunotherapy, and possibly also as maintenance therapy. Treatment with MoAbs is associated with reduced risk of such adverse events as cytopenias, infections and secondary neoplasias and is generally well tolerated. Depending on antibody type, the most common adverse events are usually transient and limited to grade 1 and 2 infusion-related reactions. In addition to commercially available MoAbs, several other antibodies exist which are targeted against different antigens studied in the clinical trials.",,"['Korycka-Wolowiec, Anna', 'Wolowiec, Dariusz', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Korycka-Wolowiec A', 'Wolowiec D', 'Robak T']","['a Department of Hematology Medical , University of Lodz , Lodz , Poland.', 'b Department of Hematology , Medical University of Wroclaw , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'a Department of Hematology Medical , University of Lodz , Lodz , Poland.']",,20161204,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*biological treatment', '*monoclonal antibodies', '*safety profile']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 23.,10.1080/01635581.2017.1247884 [doi],"In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), resistance to chemotherapy is associated with inactivation of p53 and upregulation of survivin. Thus, targeting the p53 and survivin expression may provide an attractive strategy for ALL treatment. It has been shown that fish-oil-derived docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) activates several antitumorigenic mechanisms in tumor cells, but little is known regarding the role of DHA on modulating p53 and survivin expression in ALL cells. In this study, we investigated the alterations of the p53 and survivin expression and induction of apoptosis in DHA-treated Molt-4 cells that serve as a model for ALL cells. Molt-4 cells were treated with 50, 100, 150, and 200 muM DHA after which cell proliferation, survivin mRNA and protein levels, p53 protein level, caspase-3 activation, and apoptotic rates were evaluated by different cellular and molecular techniques. After 48- and 72-h treatments with DHA at concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 muM, cell proliferation rates were measured to be 80.5-44.4%, and 73.4-14.4%, respectively, compared to untreated cells. We also found that treatment for 48 h with 200 muM DHA resulted in 10.8- and 3.6-fold increase in p53 protein level and caspase-3 activation followed by 4.7-and 1.6-fold decrease in survivin mRNA and protein levels, respectively, compared to untreated cells. Treatment of cells with different concentrations of DHA dramatically increased the p53/survivin and caspase-3/survivin ratios by 2.8- to 16.9-fold and 3.3 to 5.6-fold increases, respectively, compared to untreated cells. A decrease in the number of cells ranging from 16% to 70% and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells ranging from 9.3% to 93% was also observed with increasing DHA concentrations. In conclusion, p53 and survivin may provide promising targets of DHA in ALL cells and this compound with high proapoptotic capacity represents the possibility of its therapeutic application for ALL treatment.",,"['Sam, Mohammad Reza', 'Esmaeillou, Mohammad', 'Shokrgozar, Mohammad Ali']","['Sam MR', 'Esmaeillou M', 'Shokrgozar MA']","['a Department of Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology , Institute of Biotechnology, Urmia University , Urmia , Iran.', 'a Department of Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology , Institute of Biotechnology, Urmia University , Urmia , Iran.', 'b National Cell Bank of Iran , Pasteur Institute of Iran , Tehran , Iran.']",,20161123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transplants in 77 patients were from matched sibling donors (MSDs) and those in 190 patients were from matched unrelated donors. Most patients (94.3%) were given anti-T-cell antibodies. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of grades II-IV was 32.1% and that of chronic GVHD was 30.2%. The 3-year probability of non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 25.9%, that of relapse was 48.5%, that of GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 17.8% and that of leukaemia-free survival (LFS) was 25.6%. In multivariate analysis, unrelated donor recipients more frequently had acute GVHD of grades II-IV [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.98, P = 0.017] and suffered less relapses (HR = 0.62, P = 0.01) than MSD recipients. Treatment with anti-T-cell antibodies reduced NRM (HR = 0.35, P = 0.01) and improved survival (HR = 0.49, P = 0.01), GRFS (HR = 0.37, P = 0.0004) and LFS (HR = 0.46, P = 0.005).

Exudative retinal detachment was diagnosed at initial evaluation. Hematological and ocular studies were performed. Although there was no evidence of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or bone marrow disease relapse, transvitreal retinochoroidal cytology identified the infiltration of lymphoblastic leukemic B cells with t(12:21) translocation as the only sign of relapsing ALL-B.

Typically, it has been described in elderly patients with age-related immunosenescence and patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy.

MLV glycogag contains the entire Gag sequence plus an 88-residue N-terminal extension. It has recently been reported that glycogag, like the Nef protein of HIV-1, counteracts the antiviral effects of the cellular protein Serinc5. We have found, in agreement with prior work, that glycogag strongly enhances the infectivity of MLVs with some Env proteins but not those with others. In contrast, however, glycogag was detrimental to MLVs carrying Ebolavirus glycoprotein. Glycogag could be replaced, with respect to viral infectivity, by the unrelated S2 protein of equine infectious anemia virus. We devised an assay for viral entry in which virus particles deliver the Cre recombinase into cells, leading to the expression of a reporter. Data from this assay showed that both the positive and the negative effects of glycogag and S2 upon MLV infectivity are exerted at the level of virus entry. Moreover, transfection of the virus-producing cells with a Serinc5 expression plasmid reduced the infectivity and entry capability of MLV carrying xenotropic MLV Env, particularly in the absence of glycogag. Conversely, Serinc5 expression abrogated the negative effects of glycogag upon the infectivity and entry capability of MLV carrying Ebolavirus glycoprotein. As Serinc5 may influence cellular phospholipid metabolism, it seems possible that all of these effects on virus entry derive from changes in the lipid composition of viral membranes. IMPORTANCE: Many murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) encode a protein called ""glycogag."" The function of glycogag is not fully understood, but it can assist HIV-1 replication in the absence of the HIV-1 protein Nef under some circumstances. In turn, Nef counteracts the cellular protein Serinc5. Glycogag enhances the infectivity of MLVs with some but not all MLV Env proteins (which mediate viral entry into the host cell upon binding to cell surface receptors). We now report that glycogag acts by enhancing viral entry and that, like Nef, glycogag antagonizes Serinc5. Surprisingly, the effects of glycogag and Serinc5 upon the entry and infectivity of MLV particles carrying an Ebolavirus glycoprotein are the opposite of those observed with the MLV Env proteins. The unrelated S2 protein of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is functionally analogous to glycogag in our experiments. Thus, three retroviruses (HIV-1, MLV, and EIAV) have independently evolved accessory proteins that counteract Serinc5.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Ahi et al.'],"['Ahi, Yadvinder S', 'Zhang, Shu', 'Thappeta, Yashna', 'Denman, Audrey', 'Feizpour, Amin', 'Gummuluru, Suryaram', 'Reinhard, Bjoern', 'Muriaux, Delphine', 'Fivash, Matthew J', 'Rein, Alan']","['Ahi YS', 'Zhang S', 'Thappeta Y', 'Denman A', 'Feizpour A', 'Gummuluru S', 'Reinhard B', 'Muriaux D', 'Fivash MJ', 'Rein A']","['HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and The Photonics Center, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and The Photonics Center, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', ""Centre d'Etudes d'Agents Pathogenes et Biotechnologies pour la Santes, CNRS UMR 5236, Montpellier, France."", 'Data Management Services, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'HIV Dynamics and Replication Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA reina@mail.nih.gov.']",['R01 AI064099/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],20161122,,PMC5120145,,,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8606-8481'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this issue, we characterized by RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and ChIP-seq analyses the epigenetic response of a set of colon, breast, and leukemia cancer cell lines to small-molecule inhibitors against DNA methyltransferases (DAC), histone deacetylases (Depsi), histone demethylases (KDM1A inhibitor S2101), and histone methylases (EHMT2 inhibitor UNC0638 and EZH2 inhibitor GSK343). We also characterized the effects of DAC as combined with the other compounds. Averaged over the cancer cell models used, we found that DAC affected 8.6% of the transcriptome and that 95.4% of the genes affected were upregulated. DAC preferentially regulated genes that were silenced in cancer and that were methylated at their promoters. In contrast, Depsi affected the expression of 30.4% of the transcriptome but showed little selectivity for gene upregulation or silenced genes. S2101, UNC0638, and GSK343 affected only 2% of the transcriptome, with UNC0638 and GSK343 preferentially targeting genes marked with H3K9me2 or H3K27me3, respectively. When combined with histone methylase inhibitors, the extent of gene upregulation by DAC was extended while still maintaining selectivity for DNA-methylated genes and silenced genes. However, the genes upregulated by combination treatment exhibited limited overlap, indicating the possibility of targeting distinct sets of genes based on different epigenetic therapy combinations. Overall, our results demonstrated that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors preferentially target cancer-relevant genes and can be combined with inhibitors targeting histone methylation for synergistic effects while still maintaining selectivity.

It is not clear why this difference occurs. Here we show that Flt3(ITD) and cooperating Flt3(ITD)/Runx1 mutations cause hematopoietic stem cell depletion and myeloid progenitor expansion during adult but not fetal stages of murine development. In adult progenitors, FLT3(ITD) simultaneously induces self-renewal and myeloid commitment programs via STAT5-dependent and STAT5-independent mechanisms, respectively. While FLT3(ITD) can activate STAT5 signal transduction prior to birth, this signaling does not alter gene expression until hematopoietic progenitors transition from fetal to adult transcriptional states. Cooperative interactions between Flt3(ITD) and Runx1 mutations are also blunted in fetal/neonatal progenitors. Fetal/neonatal progenitors may therefore be protected from leukemic transformation because they are not competent to express FLT3(ITD) target genes.

However, the elderly are underrepresented in clinical studies of CLL. We performed a retrospective study of CLL patients aged 80 years or older at the initiation of first-line therapy in hospitals affiliated with the French intergroup on CLL (French Innovative Leukemia Organization) between 2003 and 2013. Here, we describe the clinical and biological characteristics, treatment, and outcomes for 201 patients. The median age of the cohort was 83.2 years (80-92 years). The median Cumulative Index Rating Scale comorbidity score was 5 and the median creatinine clearance was 48 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula). At treatment initiation, Binet stage was A (26.4%), B (27.9%), or C (40.3%). Therapy consisted mainly of chlorambucil (65.7%), bendamustine (10.5%), and rituximab (44.3%) as follows: chlorambucil alone (45.3%) or immunochemotherapy (48.3%) with rituximab + chlorambucil (22.7%), rituximab + bendamustine (10.4%), or rituximab + cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone (5.5%).

Thus, prospective trials should target this population and oncogeriatric evaluation and new targeted therapies should be part of such future trials.","['Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Meunier, Godelieve', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Nguyen-Thi, Phi Linh', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Quinquenel, Anne', 'Dupuis, Jehan', 'Lemal, Richard', 'Aurran, Therese', 'Tomowiak, Cecile', 'Cymbalista, Florence', 'Dilhuydy, Marie Sarah', 'Brion, Annie', 'Morel, Pierre', 'Cazin, Bruno', 'Leblond, Veronique', 'Cartron, Guillaume', 'Re, Daniel', 'Bene, Marie Christine', 'Michallet, Anne Sophie', 'Feugier, Pierre']","['Meunier G', 'Ysebaert L', 'Nguyen-Thi PL', 'Lepretre S', 'Quinquenel A', 'Dupuis J', 'Lemal R', 'Aurran T', 'Tomowiak C', 'Cymbalista F', 'Dilhuydy MS', 'Brion A', 'Morel P', 'Cazin B', 'Leblond V', 'Cartron G', 'Re D', 'Bene MC', 'Michallet AS', 'Feugier P']","['Nancy University Hospital, France.', 'Toulouse University Cancer Hospital, France.', 'Nancy University Hospital, France.', 'Rouen Henri Becquerel Cancer Center, France.', 'Reims University Hospital, France.', 'Creteil Henri Mondor University Hospital, France.', 'Clermont-Ferrand Estaing University Hospital, France.', 'Marseille Paoli Calmettes Cancer Center, France.', 'Poitiers University Hospital, France.', 'Bobigny Avicenne University Hospital, France.', 'Bordeaux University Hospital, France.', 'Besancon Jean-Minjoz University Hospital, France.', 'Lens General Hospital, France.', 'Lille University Hospital, France.', 'Paris la Pitie Salpetriere University Hospital, France.', 'Montpellier University Hospital, France.', 'Antibes General Hospital, France.', 'Nantes Hotel-Dieu University Hospital, France.', 'Lyon Leon Berard Cancer Center, France.', 'Nancy University Hospital, France.']",,20161122,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'elderly', 'first-line treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However high-quality trial evidence and clinical outcome data to support specific transfusion goals for blood products for patients with AL remain limited leading to diverse transfusion practices. The primary objective of this study was to determine the spectrum of transfusion patterns in a variety of care settings among providers who treat AL patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A 31-question survey queried providers caring for AL patients about the existence of institutional guidelines for transfusion of blood products, transfusion triggers for hemoglobin (Hb), platelets (PLTs), and fibrinogen in various settings including inpatient and outpatient and before procedures. RESULTS: We analyzed 130 responses and identified divergent transfusion Hb goals in hospitalized and ambulatory patients, fibrinogen goals for cryoprecipitate transfusions, and variation in practice for use of certain PLTs and red blood cell products. The least variable transfusion patterns were reported for PLT goals in thrombocytopenia and in the setting of invasive procedures such as bone marrow biopsy and lumbar punctures. CONCLUSIONS: This survey confirmed wide variations in blood product transfusion practices across several clinical scenarios in patients with AL. The findings emphasized the need for large prospective randomized trials to develop standardized evidence-based guidelines for blood product transfusions in patients with AL with the goal of limiting unnecessary transfusions without compromising outcomes.",['(c) 2016 AABB.'],"['Pine, Alexander B', 'Lee, Eun-Ju', 'Sekeres, Mikkael', 'Steensma, David P', 'Zelterman, Daniel', 'Prebet, Thomas', 'DeZern, Amy', 'Komrokji, Rami', 'Litzow, Mark', 'Luger, Selina', 'Stone, Richard', 'Erba, Harry P', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Lee, Alfred I', 'Podoltsev, Nikolai A', 'Barbarotta, Lisa', 'Kasberg, Stephanie', 'Hendrickson, Jeanne E', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Pine AB', 'Lee EJ', 'Sekeres M', 'Steensma DP', 'Zelterman D', 'Prebet T', 'DeZern A', 'Komrokji R', 'Litzow M', 'Luger S', 'Stone R', 'Erba HP', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Lee AI', 'Podoltsev NA', 'Barbarotta L', 'Kasberg S', 'Hendrickson JE', 'Gore SD', 'Zeidan AM']","['Yale New Haven Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Leukemia Program, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Yale University School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

Previous studies indicate that ZOL has marked antileukemia activity, however, the underlying mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to explore the mechanism of the antileukemia effect of ZOL in leukemia cells. It was observed that ZOL inhibited the proliferation of HL60 and adriamycinresistant HL60 (HL60/A) cells using a WST8 assay. An Annexin Vpropidium iodide indicated that ZOL induced apoptosis of the two cell types in a dose and timedependent manner. Hoechst 33342 staining was also used to verify the levels of apoptosis. The colony formation assay demonstrated that ZOL significantly inhibited colony formation capacity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. This was achieved by the induction of Sphase cell cycle arrest, downregulation of Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and upregulation of Bcl2 associated X protein and cleaved poly (ADPribose) polymerase. The results indicate that ZOL inhibited cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and this antileukemic activity appeared notably enhanced in HL60/A cells.

There are studies that show that knockdown of Bmi-1 could induce E-cadherin expression in melanoma cells. However, the role of Bmi-1 in mediating EMT-like changes in melanoma has not yet been fully studied. In the present study, knockdown of Bmi-1 by shRNA transduction decreased the invasion properties of the cultured human melanoma cells A375 by a Matrigel invasion assay, along with alterations in EMT-related markers E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, vimentin and N-cadherin. The aforementioned altered expression of EMT markers was verified in BALB/c-nude mouse xenografts. Furthermore, to explore the underlying regulatory mechanism of EMT, we detected the significant downregulation of p-Akt/pNF-kappaB/MMP-2 and the upregulation of PTEN in Bmi-1-silenced A375 cells.

Here we wished to investigate the potential role of these proteins in resistance of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) blasts to apoptosis. We found that the levels of both mRNA and proteins of APRIL, BAFF and their receptors were expressed in leukaemic cells of 24 newly diagnosed, untreated AML patients. We also demonstrated that patients who did not further respond to induction therapy (NR) presented with significantly higher baseline APRIL and BAFF expression on AML blasts as compared to these subjects who, after induction, achieved complete remission (CR) following induction therapy. Moreover, we observed striking differences in baseline levels of BCMA between CR and NR patients as we did not find detectable expression of this receptor in the latter group of patients. Interestingly, we found that AML blasts collected at baseline from NR patients cultured in presence of exogenous BAFF and APRIL were significantly more resistant to spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis as compared with cells derived from CR patients.

Beside avoidance, there is currently no allergen-specific therapy available. Hypoallergenic variants of the major fish allergen, parvalbumin, for specific immunotherapy based on mutation of the 2 calcium-binding sites have been developed. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to establish a mouse model of fish allergy resembling human disease and to investigate whether mouse and rabbit IgG antibodies induced by immunization with a hypoallergenic mutant of the major carp allergen protect against allergic symptoms in sensitized mice. METHODS: C3H/HeJ mice were sensitized with recombinant wildtype Cyp c 1 or carp extract by intragastric gavage. Antibody, cellular immune responses, and epitope specificity in sensitized mice were investigated by ELISA, rat basophil leukemia assay, T-cell proliferation experiments using recombinant wildtype Cyp c 1, and overlapping peptides spanning the Cyp c 1 sequence. Anti-hypoallergenic Cyp c 1 mutant mouse and rabbit sera were tested for their ability to inhibit IgE recognition of Cyp c 1, Cyp c 1-specific basophil degranulation, and Cyp c 1-induced allergic symptoms in the mouse model. RESULTS: A mouse model of fish allergy mimicking human disease regarding IgE epitope recognition and symptoms as close as possible was established. Administration of antisera generated in mice and rabbits by immunization with a hypoallergenic Cyp c 1 mutant inhibited IgE binding to Cyp c 1, Cyp c 1-induced basophil degranulation, and allergic symptoms caused by allergen challenge in sensitized mice. CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies induced by immunization with a hypoallergenic Cyp c 1 mutant protect against allergic reactions in a murine model of fish allergy.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

Avian hepatitis E virus (HEV) and avian leucosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) both cause decreasing in egg production, hepatomegaly and hepatic hemorrhage in broiler breeder and layer hens. In the study, the seroprevalence of avian HEV and ALV-J in these flocks emerging the disease from Shandong and Shaanxi provinces were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 1995 serum samples were collected from 14 flocks with hepatitis syndrome in Shandong and Shaanxi provinces, China. Antibodies against avian HEV and ALV-J in these serum samples were detected using iELISAs. The seroprevalence of anti-avian HEV antibodies (35.09%) was significantly higher than that of anti-ALV-J antibodies (2.16%) (p = 0.00). Moreover, the 43 serum samples positive for anti-ALV-J antibodies were all also positive for anti-avian HEV antibodies. In a comparison of both provinces, Shandong chickens exhibited a significantly higher seroprevalence of anti-avian HEV antibodies (42.16%) than Shaanxi chickens (26%) (p = 0.00). In addition, the detection of avian HEV RNA and ALV-J cDNA in the liver samples from the flocks of two provinces also showed the same results of the seroprevalence. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the results showed that avian HEV infection is widely prevalent and ALV-J infection is endemic in the flocks with hepatitis syndrome from Shandong and Shaanxi provinces of China. These results suggested that avian HEV infection may be the major cause of increased egg drop and hepatitis syndrome observed during the last 2 years in China.

These rates are despite the current multimodal therapeutic approaches involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and myeloablation with hematopoietic stem cell rescue. Hence, efforts have intensified to identify new targets and novel therapeutic approaches to improve cure rates in these children. Numerous new agents for adult malignancies are developed and evaluated for cancer each year, providing an invaluable resource, with the added advantage of available pharmacologic and toxicity data for consideration. METHODS: To identify potential therapeutic targets, we screened a small molecule library of 151 small kinase inhibitors against NB cell lines. Based on our initial screening data, we further examined the potential of Bcr-Abl targeting small molecule inhibitors to affect the growth and survival of NB cells. RESULTS: There is diverse activity among the currently available Bcr-Abl inhibitors, possibly reflecting the molecular heterogeneity and off-target activity in each combination. In depth analyses of ponatinib, an oral multi-target kinase inhibitor and effective agent in the treatment of refractory Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive leukemia, show growth inhibition at sub-micromolar concentrations.

However, the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) limits the clinical application of imatinib. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIR in CML resistance to imatinib. METHODS: Thirty-four CML patients were divided into multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1)-low and MRP1-high groups according to the median expression. Real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the expression of lncRNA HOTAIR in CML patients, and MTT assay and flow cytometry assay were employed to detect the biological function of silencing lncRNA HOTAIR on the cell survival rate and apoptotic rate. An imatinib-resistant human CML cell line K562 (K562-R) was established, and western blot was used to detect the impact of lncRNA HOTAIR on the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. RESULTS: Our results showed that lncRNA HOTAIR was greatly upregulated in the MRP1-high patients as well as in the K562-imatinib-resistant cells compared with control. Knockdown of HOTAIR expression downregulated the MRP1 expression levels in the K562-imatinib cells and resulted in higher sensitivity to the imatinib treatment. In addition, the activation of PI3K/Akt was greatly attenuated when HOTAIR was knocked down in K562-imatinib cells. DISCUSSIONS: These data suggest that the knockdown of HOTAIR may play a crucial role in improving acquired resistance to imatinib in CML K562-R cells via PI3K/Akt pathway.

RESULTS: Of the 110 subjects studied, 62 carried the JAK2 V617F mutation, 21 had CALR mutations, one carried an MPL (W515) mutation, and 28 had non-mutated JAK2, CALR, and MPL (so-called triple-negative ET). Mutations in JAK2 exon 12 were not detected in any patient. Two ET patients had both CALR and JAK2 V617F mutations. Comparing the hematological parameters of the patients with JAK2 mutations with those of the patients with CALR mutations showed that the ET patients with CALR mutations were younger (p = 0.045) and had higher platelet counts (p = 0.043). CONCLUSION: Genotyping for CALR could be a useful diagnostic tool for JAK2/MPL-negative ET, since the data suggest that CALR is much more prevalent than MPL, therefore testing for CALR should be considered in patients who are JAK2 negative as its frequency is almost 20 times that of MPL mutation.",,"['Wang, Jing', 'Zhang, Biao', 'Chen, Bing', 'Zhou, Rong-Fu', 'Zhang, Qi-Guo', 'Li, Juan', 'Yang, Yong-Gong', 'Zhou, Min', 'Shao, Xiao-Yan', 'Xu, Yong', 'Xu, Xi-Hui', 'Ouyang, Jian', 'Xu, Jingyan', 'Ye, Qing']","['Wang J', 'Zhang B', 'Chen B', 'Zhou RF', 'Zhang QG', 'Li J', 'Yang YG', 'Zhou M', 'Shao XY', 'Xu Y', 'Xu XH', 'Ouyang J', 'Xu J', 'Ye Q']","['a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'b Department of Pathology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'a Department of Hematology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.', 'b Department of Pathology , The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China.']",,20161122,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Janus kinase 2', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'calreticulin', 'essential thrombocythemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous research showed that the HDAC inhibitor chidamide is a promising anti-cancer agent in pancreatic cancer cell lines. In this study, we elucidate a probable underlying anti-cancer mechanism of chidamide involving the degradation of Mcl-1. Mcl-1 is frequently upregulated in human cancers, which has been demonstrated to participate in oxidative phosphorylation, in addition to its anti-apoptotic actions as a Bcl-2 family member. The pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3 and PANC-1 were treated with chidamide, resulting in Mcl-1 degradation accompanied by induction of Mcl-1 ubiquitination. Treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor reduced Mcl-1 degradation stimulated by chidamide. Chidamide decreased O2 consumption and ATP production to inhibit aerobic metabolism in both pancreatic cancer cell lines and primary cells, similar to knockdown of Mcl-1, while overexpression of Mcl-1 in pancreatic cancer cells could restore the aerobic metabolism inhibited by chidamide. Furthermore, chidamide treatment or Mcl-1 knockdown significantly induced cell growth arrest in pancreatic cancer cell lines and primary cells, and Mcl-1 overexpression could reduce this cell growth inhibition. In conclusion, our results suggest that chidamide promotes Mcl-1 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suppressing the maintenance of mitochondrial aerobic respiration by Mcl-1, and resulting in inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation.

The current strategy for its management includes cytoreductive therapy and antithrombotic prophylaxis, but many issues remain uncertain. In this review, the risk factors and prevention of recurrences will be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Around one-third of patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia experience a major thrombosis at diagnosis or during follow-up. According to the European Leukemia Net guidelines, these patients must be included in the high-risk group for thrombotic recurrence and should be treated with cytoreduction and antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs in the presence of arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Despite this treatment, the annual incidence of recurrence after the first venous thrombosis varies from 4.2 to 6.5% on vitamin K-antagonists and is doubled after discontinuation. The highest incidence of recurrence occurs after cerebral and hepatic vein thrombosis (8.8 and 8 per 100 pt-years, respectively). The occurrence of major bleeding on vitamin K-antagonists is similar to a non-MPN population and accounts for a rate of 1.8-2.4 per 100 pt-years. SUMMARY: After venous thrombosis, the incidence of recurrence in MPN remains elevated, which suggested there was a need to review the current recommendations of primary and secondary prophylaxis.",,"['Barbui, Tiziano', 'De Stefano, Valerio']","['Barbui T', 'De Stefano V']","['aFROM Research Foundation, Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo bInstitute of Hematology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, genetic information is increasingly available to physicians. This review will examine several implications of genetic diversity in MDS. RECENT FINDINGS: Somatic mutations can serve as clinically relevant biomarkers in MDS. Molecular subtypes may exist that share clinical features including risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia, response to treatment, and overall survival. Several mutated genes are known to have prognostic value that is independent of common risk stratification tools. Mutations of several genes identify low-blast percentage patients with greater than predicted disease risk while only SF3B1 mutations predict lower disease risk than expected. Mutations of TP53 are associated with adverse features, yet demonstrate inferior outcomes than predicted by these risk factors. SF3B1 and TP53 mutations may identify clinically relevant subtypes of MDS and allow for better refinement of risk within these groups. Using somatic mutations to diagnose MDS is more challenging because they can occur in healthy individuals. Yet, patients with unexplained cytopenias have a high rate of clonal hematopoiesis that may be an important risk factor to identify clinically.

Only pure erythroid leukemia remains in the WHO classification. This review will summarize the literature that contributed to that classification change as well as recent literature on the significance of the change. RECENT FINDINGS: There is now a large body of literature on the negative prognostic impact of erythroid predominance, defined as 50% or more bone marrow erythroid cells, in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Recent studies have found similarities between erythroleukemia, especially the erythroid/myeloid type, and the erythroid-rich MDS cases. On the basis of these data, the WHO now reclassifies cases of the prior erythroid/myeloid acute erythroleukemia group based on the total blast cell count. This change moves such cases into an MDS category, usually MDS with excess blasts. This approach, however, may cloud the significance of erythroid predominance in this group of patients.

An oversimplified view in the literature is that cancer cells become more deformable as they become more invasive. beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) signaling drives invasion and metastasis, but the effects on cell deformability are not known. Here, we show that activation of beta-adrenergic signaling by betaAR agonists reduces the deformability of highly metastatic human breast cancer cells, and that these stiffer cells are more invasive in vitro We find that betaAR activation also reduces the deformability of ovarian, prostate, melanoma and leukemia cells. Mechanistically, we show that betaAR-mediated cell stiffening depends on the actin cytoskeleton and myosin II activity. These changes in cell deformability can be prevented by pharmacological beta-blockade or genetic knockout of the beta2-adrenergic receptor. Our results identify a beta2-adrenergic-Ca(2+)-actin axis as a new regulator of cell deformability, and suggest that the relationship between cell mechanical properties and invasion might be dependent on context.",['(c) 2016.

The mechanisms underlying methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity are unclear but may be related to increased homocysteine levels. Intrathecal methotrexate-induced myelopathy mimicking subacute combined degeneration, with normal B12 levels, has been documented. We examined treatment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of 13 patients with leukemia who received intrathecal methotrexate and developed urinary and bowel incontinence, ascending motor weakness, and sensory loss with dorsal column hyperintensity on MRI between 2000 and 2016. Cerebrospinal fluid evaluation was negative for leukemia in all patients and positive for elevated protein in 12 patients. Seven of eight patients with available data had reduced serum folate, increased serum homocysteine, or both, implicating methotrexate as the cause of neurotoxicity. Autopsy of one patient revealed loss of myelinated axons in the posterior columns. These findings suggest that methotrexate neurotoxicity may be mediated by folate antagonism. Awareness and a high index of suspicion of these characteristic clinical and radiographic features in patients who develop myelopathy after intrathecal methotrexate may help to avoid additional neurotoxic therapy in such patients.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Pinnix, Chelsea C', 'Chi, Linda', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Milgrom, Sarah A', 'Smith, Grace L', 'Daver, Naval', 'Garg, Naveen', 'Cykowski, Matthew D', 'Fuller, Greg', 'Cachia, David', 'Kamiya-Matsuoka, Carlos', 'Woodman, Karin', 'Dinardo, Courtney', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Ohanian, Maro', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Dabaja, Bouthaina S']","['Pinnix CC', 'Chi L', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Milgrom SA', 'Smith GL', 'Daver N', 'Garg N', 'Cykowski MD', 'Fuller G', 'Cachia D', 'Kamiya-Matsuoka C', 'Woodman K', 'Dinardo C', 'Jain N', 'Kadia TM', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Ohanian M', 'Konopleva M', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Dabaja BS']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']","['K07 CA211804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC5338569,,,,,,['NIHMS831369'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the role of decitabine as a first-line treatment for older adults with AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with AML who received at least one course of decitabine (20 mg/m(2)/d intravenously for 5 days every 4 weeks) as a first-line therapy at Severance Hospital were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 73.5 years. The longest follow-up duration was 502 days. A total of 113 cycles of treatment were given to 24 patients, and the median number of cycles was four (range, 1-14). Thirteen patients dropped out because of death, no or loss of response, patient refusal, or transfer to another hospital. Twenty-one (87.5%) and 12 (50%) patients completed the second and fourth cycles, respectively, and responses to treatment were evaluated in 17. A complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete blood-count recovery was achieved in six (35.3%) patients, and the estimated median overall survival was 502 days. Ten patients developed grade >2 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicities. In univariate analysis, bone marrow blasts, lactate dehydrogenase, serum ferritin level, and bone marrow iron were significantly associated with response to decitabine. CONCLUSION: Five-day decitabine treatment showed acceptable efficacy in older patients with AML who are unfit for conventional chemotherapy, with a CR rate 35.3% and about a median overall survival of 18 months.",,"['Park, Hyunsung', 'Chung, Haerim', 'Lee, Jungyeon', 'Jang, Jieun', 'Kim, Yundeok', 'Kim, Soo Jeong', 'Kim, Jin Seok', 'Min, Yoo Hong', 'Cheong, June Won']","['Park H', 'Chung H', 'Lee J', 'Jang J', 'Kim Y', 'Kim SJ', 'Kim JS', 'Min YH', 'Cheong JW']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. jwcheong70@yuhs.ac.']",,,,PMC5122650,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Decitabine', 'elderly', 'treatment']",['The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 21.,10.1007/s12325-016-0447-x [doi],"INTRODUCTION: Blinatumomab is a bispecific T cell-engaging antibody construct indicated for adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) Ph(-) B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), an aggressive disease with poor prognosis. A phase 2 single-arm clinical study showed that 43% of patients achieved CR/CRh within two cycles and approximately 20% of patients receiving blinatumomab were still alive after 2 years. METHODS: The objective of the current analysis was to estimate long-term survival of patients receiving blinatumomab beyond the observed time period in the clinical study using a large historical observational dataset. Conditional survival probabilities of blinatumomab-treated patients beyond month 60 were assumed to be the same as the US general population. RESULTS: At month 60, the estimated proportion of blinatumomab-treated patients alive was more than double that of historical patients (12.6% vs 5.4%). The mean overall survival was 76.1 months for blinatumomab patients and 39.8 months for historical patients. Sensitivity analyses including additional follow-up data from the clinical study showed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that blinatumomab provides substantial overall survival benefit to patients with (R/R) Ph(-) B-precursor ALL compared with salvage chemotherapy. FUNDING: Amgen.

In this study, we aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying DMFC anti-cancer activity and determining whether DMFC is effective in suppression of drug-resistant human hepatocellular carcinoma. We show here that DMFC effectively suppresses both the parent and the multidrug-resistant hepatoma cell growth in vitro and DMFC suppresses hepatoma cell growth at least in part through inducing tumor cell apoptosis. In the molecular level, we observed that DMFC treatment decreases Bcl-2 level by a post-transcriptional mechanism and activates Bim transcription to increase Bim mRNA and protein level in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that DMFC-induced Bim interrupts interactions between Bcl-2 and Bax and between Mcl-1 and Bak, resulting in dissociation of Bax from Bcl-2 and Bak from Mcl-1 and subsequent activation of both Bax and Bak. Activation of Bax and Bak leads to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release. Consistent with its potent apoptosis-inducing activity, DMFC exhibited potent activity against the multidrug-resistant hepatoma xenograft growth in vivo. Therefore, we determine that DMFC suppresses hepatoma growth through decreasing Bcl-2 and increasing Bim to induce tumor cell apoptosis and hold great promise for further development as a therapeutic agent to treat chemoresistant hepatoma.",,"['Xiang, Jun', 'Wang, Zhe', 'Liu, Qianqian', 'Li, Xia', 'Sun, Jianguo', 'Fung, Kwok-Pui', 'Liu, Feiyan']","['Xiang J', 'Wang Z', 'Liu Q', 'Li X', 'Sun J', 'Fung KP', 'Liu F']","[""Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."", ""Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."", ""Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang University Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."", ""Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."", ""Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Biomedical Sciences (SBS), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR, People's Republic of China."", ""Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China. liuf64@zju.edu.cn."", ""Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China. liuf64@zju.edu.cn.""]",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['3,5-Dimethyl-7H-furo[3,2-g]chromen-7-one, DMFC', 'Apoptosis', 'Bim', 'Drug-resistance', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this view, there is now evidence that the submicroscopic amounts of leukemic cells (called minimal residual disease, MRD), measured during the course of treatment, indicate the quality of response to therapy. Therefore, MRD might serve as an independent, additional biomarker to help to identify patients at higher risk of relapse.

Accurate prognostication and prediction of response to treatment are important in an era of effective first-line regimens and novel molecules for high risk patients. Because a plethora of prognostic biomarkers were identified, but few of them were validated by multivariable analysis in comprehensive prospective studies, we applied in this survey stringent criteria to select papers from the literature in order to identify the most reproducible prognostic/predictive markers. Each biomarker was analysed in terms of reproducibility across the different studies with respect to its impact on time to first treatment (TTFT), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and response to treatment. We were able to identify the following biomarkers as the most reliable in guiding risk stratification in the daily clinical practice: 17p-/TP53 mutations, IGHV unmutated configuration, short telomeres and 11q-.

Although most T-ALL patients exhibit activating mutations in NOTCH1, the cooperating genetic events required to accelerate the onset of leukemia and worsen disease progression are largely unknown. Here, we show that the gene encoding the transcription factor KLF4 is inactivated by DNA methylation in children with T-ALL. In mice, loss of KLF4 accelerated the development of NOTCH1-induced T-ALL by enhancing the G1-to-S transition in leukemic cells and promoting the expansion of leukemia-initiating cells. Mechanistically, KLF4 represses the gene encoding the kinase MAP2K7. Our results showed that in murine and pediatric T-ALL, loss of KLF4 leads to aberrant activation of MAP2K7 and of the downstream effectors JNK and ATF2. As a proof-of-concept for the development of a targeted therapy, administration of JNK inhibitors reduced the expansion of leukemia cells in cell-based and patient-derived xenograft models. Collectively, these data uncover a novel function for KLF4 in regulating the MAP2K7 pathway in T-ALL cells, which can be targeted to eradicate leukemia-initiating cells in T-ALL patients.",,"['Shen, Y', 'Park, C S', 'Suppipat, K', 'Mistretta, T-A', 'Puppi, M', 'Horton, T M', 'Rabin, K', 'Gray, N S', 'Meijerink, J P P', 'Lacorazza, H D']","['Shen Y', 'Park CS', 'Suppipat K', 'Mistretta TA', 'Puppi M', 'Horton TM', 'Rabin K', 'Gray NS', 'Meijerink JPP', 'Lacorazza HD']","['Department of Pathology &Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology &Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Center, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Pathology &Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology &Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Center, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Center, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam and the Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pathology &Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.""]",,20161122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro studies have shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) protect AML blasts from spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Here, we report a novel interaction between AML blasts and BM-MSCs, which benefits AML proliferation and survival. We initially examined the cytokine profile in cultured human AML compared with AML cultured with BM-MSCs and found that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was highly expressed by primary AML, and that IL8 was increased in AML/BM-MSC cocultures. Recombinant MIF increased IL8 expression in BM-MSCs via its receptor CD74. Moreover, the MIF inhibitor ISO-1 inhibited AML-induced IL8 expression by BM-MSCs as well as BM-MSC-induced AML survival. Protein kinase C beta (PKCbeta) regulated MIF-induced IL8 in BM-MSCs. Finally, targeted IL8 shRNA inhibited BM-MSC-induced AML survival. These results describe a novel, bidirectional, prosurvival mechanism between AML blasts and BM-MSCs. Furthermore, they provide biologic rationale for therapeutic strategies in AML targeting the microenvironment, specifically MIF and IL8. Cancer Res; 77(2); 303-11.

However, the genetic perturbations that give rise to this disease remain largely undefined, limiting the ability to address resistant tumors or develop less toxic targeted therapies. Here, we report the use of next-generation sequencing to interrogate the genetic and pathogenic mechanisms of 240 pediatric ALL cases with their matched remission samples. Commonly mutated genes fell into several categories, including RAS/receptor tyrosine kinases, epigenetic regulators, transcription factors involved in lineage commitment, and the p53/cell-cycle pathway. Unique recurrent mutational hotspots were observed in epigenetic regulators CREBBP (R1446C/H), WHSC1 (E1099K), and the tyrosine kinase FLT3 (K663R, N676K). The mutant WHSC1 was established as a gain-of-function oncogene, while the epigenetic regulator ARID1A and transcription factor CTCF were functionally identified as potential tumor suppressors. Analysis of 28 diagnosis/relapse trio patients plus 10 relapse cases revealed four evolutionary paths and uncovered the ordering of acquisition of mutations in these patients. This study provides a detailed mutational portrait of pediatric ALL and gives insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. Cancer Res; 77(2); 390-400.

As part of the UK AML15 and AML17 trials, patients with previously untreated AML and confirmed FLT3-activating mutations, mostly younger than 60 years, were randomly assigned either to receive oral lestaurtinib (CEP701) or not after each of 4 cycles of induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Lestaurtinib was commenced 2 days after completing chemotherapy and administered in cycles of up to 28 days. The trials ran consecutively. Primary endpoints were overall survival in AML15 and relapse-free survival in AML17; outcome data were meta-analyzed. Five hundred patients were randomly assigned between lestaurtinib and control: 74% had FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutations, 23% FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain point mutations, and 2% both types. No significant differences were seen in either 5-year overall survival (lestaurtinib 46% vs control 45%; hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI 0.70-1.15; P = .3) or 5-year relapse-free survival (40% vs 36%; hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI 0.69-1.12; P = .3). Exploratory subgroup analysis suggested survival benefit with lestaurtinib in patients receiving concomitant azole antifungal prophylaxis and gemtuzumab ozogamicin with the first course of chemotherapy. Correlative studies included analysis of in vivo FLT3 inhibition by plasma inhibitory activity assay and indicated improved overall survival and significantly reduced rates of relapse in lestaurtinib-treated patients who achieved sustained greater than 85% FLT3 inhibition. In conclusion, combining lestaurtinib with intensive chemotherapy proved feasible in younger patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML, but yielded no overall clinical benefit. The improved clinical outcomes seen in patients achieving sustained FLT3 inhibition encourage continued evaluation of FLT3-directed therapy alongside front-line AML treatment.

Simultaneously, researchers have elucidated the roles that this pathway plays in the regulation of cell proliferation, tumor development, and progression. As a result, our knowledge of PDE5i and cancer biology has expanded and provides an integration that holds great promise for some, but concern for others. AIM: This review evaluates the role of PDE5i and the NO/cGMP signaling pathway in the pathogenesis and prevention of various malignancies. METHODS: A literature review was performed with regard to the role of NO/cGMP pathway in tumor formation and prevention in preclinical and clinical studies. Studies that utilized PDE5i to further explore the involvement of this pathway also were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To evaluate whether PDE5i provide a potential benefit for treating and/or preventing malignancies; or if they create potential harm leading to the development of these malignancies. RESULTS: The best available data suggest that the interactions between PDE5i and cancer are tumor- and tissue-specific. Currently, the effect of PDE5i use on melanoma development is being debated. Further clinical controversy lies in PDE5i use for penile rehabilitation after nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery. Preclinical studies suggest that PDE5 inhibition could lead to a decreased risk of developing colorectal and breast cancer, leukemia, and myeloma. PDE5i also may provide an additional antitumor immune response. Finally, researchers have demonstrated a synergistic effect from combining PDE5i with current chemotherapeutic regimens. CONCLUSION: Currently, there are inadequate data to make any conclusive statements regarding the role of PDE5i in cancer pathogenesis and how to alter clinical management. In order to create appropriate clinical guidelines, further experimental and clinical evidence is required.","['Copyright (c) 2016 International Society for Sexual Medicine.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the main regulator of the Krebs cycle and is located upstream of the electron transport chain. However, the role of PDH in mast cell function has not been described. Microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) regulates the development, number, and function of mast cells. Localization of MITF to the mitochondria and its interaction with mitochondrial proteins has not been explored. OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore the role played by PDH in mast cell exocytosis and to determine whether MITF is localized in the mitochondria and involved in regulation of PDH activity. METHODS: Experiments were performed in vitro by using human and mouse mast cells, as well as rat basophil leukemia cells, and in vivo in mice. The effect of PDH inhibition on mast cell function was examined. PDH interaction with MITF was measured before and after immunologic activation. Furthermore, mitochondrial localization of MITF and its effect on PDH activity were determined. RESULTS: PDH is essential for immunologically mediated degranulation of mast cells. After activation, PDH is serine dephosphorylated. In addition, for the first time, we show that MITF is partially located in the mitochondria and interacts with PDH. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation state of PDH. Furthermore, mitochondrial MITF regulates PDH activity. CONCLUSION: The association of mitochondrial MITF with PDH emerges as an important regulator of mast cell function.

Although this condition has become more common as a result of the increasing rate of cesarean sections, the underlying causative mechanism(s) remain elusive. Because microRNA-29a/b/c (miR-29a/b/c) have been shown to play important roles in placental development, this study evaluated the roles of these microRNAs in placenta accreta. METHODS: Expression of miR-29a/b/c and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) were quantified in patient tissues and HTR8/SVneo trophoblast cells using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Western blotting was used to analyze expression of the MCL1 protein in HTR8/SVneo trophoblast cells with altered expression of miR-29a/b/c. To determine their role in apoptosis, miR-29a/b/c were overexpressed in HTR-8/SVneo cells, and levels of apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Luciferase activity assays were used to determine whether MCL1 is a target gene of miR-29a/b/c. RESULTS: Expression of miR-29a/b/c was significantly lower in creta sites compared to noncreta sites (p = 0.018, 0.041, and 0.022, respectively), but expression of MCL1 was upregulated in creta sites (p = 0.039). MCL1 expression was significantly downregulated in HTR-8/SVneo cells overexpressing miR-29a/b/c (p = 0.002, 0.008, and 0.013, respectively). Luciferase activity assays revealed that miR-29a/b/c directly target the 3' untranslated region of MCL1 in 293T cells. Over-expression of miR-29a/b/c induced apoptosis in the HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cell line. Moreover, histopathological evaluation revealed that the number of implantation site intermediate trophoblast (ISIT) cells was increased in creta sites and that these cells were positive for MCL1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that in placenta accreta, miR-29a/b/c inhibits apoptosis of ISIT cells by targeting MCL1. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of placenta accreta.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We have previously postulated that the extreme sensitivity to chemotherapy for these malignancies is linked to the on-going high levels of apoptotic sensitivity that is naturally linked with the unique genetic events of nuclear fusion, meiosis, VDJ recombination, somatic hypermutation, and gastrulation that have occurred within the cells of origin of these malignancies. In this review we will examine the cancer stem cell/cancer cell relationship of each of the chemotherapy curable malignancies and how this relationship impacts on the resultant biology and pro-apoptotic sensitivity of the varying cancer cell types. DISCUSSION: In contrast to the common epithelial cancers, in each of the chemotherapy curable malignancies there are no conventional hierarchical cancer stem cells. However cells with cancer stem like qualities can arise stochastically from within the general tumour cell population. These stochastic stem cells acquire a degree of resistance to DNA damaging agents but also retain much of the key characteristics of the cancer cells from which they develop. We would argue that the balance between the acquired resistance of the stochastic cancer stem cell and the inherent chemotherapy sensitivity of parent tumour cell determines the overall chemotherapy curability of each diagnosis. The cancer stem cells in the chemotherapy curable malignancies appear to have two key biological differences from those of the more common chemotherapy incurable malignancies. The first difference is that the conventional hierarchical pattern of cancer stem cells is absent in each of the chemotherapy curable malignancies. The other key difference, we suggest, is that the stochastic stem cells in the chemotherapy curable malignancies take on a significant aspect of the biological characteristics of their parent cancer cells. This action includes for the chemotherapy curable malignancies the heightened pro-apoptotic sensitivity linked to their respective associated unique genetic events. For the chemotherapy curable malignancies the combination of the relationship of their cancer stem cells combined with the extreme inherent sensitivity to induction of apoptosis from DNA damaging agents plays a key role in determining their overall curability with chemotherapy.",,"['Savage, Philip']",['Savage P'],"['BCCA, Vancouver Island, Victoria, BC, Canada. savage13561@msn.com.']",,20161121,,PMC5117562,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Cancer stem cells', '*Chemotherapy', '*Hierarchy', '*Resistance', '*Stochastic']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4792-6869'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the impact of selective p38alpha MAPK/MAPK14 inhibition on enzymatically modified LDL (eLDL) stimulated human monocytes with its implications for atherosclerosis. Among the different p38 MAPK isoforms, p38alpha/MAPK14 was the predominantly expressed and activated isoform in isolated human peripheral blood monocytes. Moreover, eLDL colocalized with macrophages positive for p38alpha MAPK/MAPK14 in human carotid endarterectomy specimens. Using the human leukemia cell line THP-1 and/or primary monocyte-derived macrophages, skepinone-L inhibited eLDL-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, inhibited eLDL induced expression of both cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1), without a net effect on foam cell formation, had a cell- and time-dependent effect on eLDL-triggered apoptosis, and inhibited eLDL-stimulated secretion of IL-8 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta/chemokine, CC motif, ligand 4).

FLT3-ITD mutation results in ligand-independent constitutive activation of the receptor at the plasma membrane and 'impaired trafficking' of the receptor in compartments of the endomembrane system, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). FLT3-ITD expressing cells have been shown to generate increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular NADPH oxidase (NOX)-generated ROS which act as pro-survival signals. The purpose of this study is to investigate FLT3-ITD production of ROS at the plasma membrane and ER in the FLT3-ITD expressing AML cell line MV4-11. Receptor trafficking inhibitors; Tunicamycin and Brefeldin A induce ER retention of FLT3-ITD, resulting in a decrease in protein expression of NOX4 and its partner protein p22(phox), thus demonstrating the critical importance of FLT3-ITD localization for the generation of pro-survival ROS. NOX-generated ROS contribute to total endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in AML as quantified by flow cytometry using the cell-permeable H2O2-probe Peroxy Orange 1 (PO1). We found that PI3K/AKT signaling only occurs when FLT3-ITD is expressed at the plasma membrane and is required for the production of NOX-generated ROS.

PROCEDURE: Untreated bone marrow samples of 214 B-pALL patients were previously classified according to the modal numbers (iMN8) based on the gains of the chromosomes 4, 6, 10, 14, 17, 18, 21, and X as revealed by consecutive and correlated 2x4 color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, and at least five years of follow up data were analyzed. RESULTS: Data from 48 of the 53 HeH (iMN8>50) B-pALL patients indicated that among the age, gender, WBC, and iMN8 parameters, only the last was significantly associated with overall survival (pOS), which allowed the cases to be classified as iMN8 51-54 (75%) and iMN8 >/= 55 (95%). Among the specific chromosomal gains of +4, +4/+6, +4/+17 and +4/+18, the first exhibited the most significance in terms of beneficial outcomes. The better prognostic group according to the iMN8 was associated with a significantly reduced complexity of the subclonal landscape. However, iMN8 did not prove to be an independent variable but was instead overridden by isolated trisomy of chromosome 4. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the better outcomes in the HeH B-pALL group arose from the gain of a specific chromosome that always ranks at the same position in the sequential acquisition of the affected chromosomes.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ALL is most common in the childhood and has high (>80%) cure rate. In contrast, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has far greater mortality rate than the ALL and is most commonly affecting older adults. However, AML is a leading cause of childhood cancer mortality. In this study, we compare gene expression and molecular pathway activation patterns in three normal blood, seven pediatric ALL and seven pediatric AML bone marrow samples. We identified 172/94 and 148/31 characteristic gene expression/pathway activation signatures, clearly distinguishing pediatric ALL and AML cells, respectively, from the normal blood. The pediatric AML and ALL cells differed by 139/34 gene expression/pathway activation biomarkers. For the adult 30 AML and 17 normal blood samples, we found 132/33 gene expression/pathway AML-specific features, of which only 7/2 were common for the adult and pediatric AML and, therefore, age-independent. At the pathway level, we found more differences than similarities between the adult and pediatric forms.

Epub 2016 Nov 21.,10.1200/JCO.2016.69.0073 [doi],"Purpose Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a high-risk subtype of childhood ALL characterized by kinase-activating alterations that are amenable to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We sought to define the prevalence and genomic landscape of Ph-like ALL in adults and assess response to conventional chemotherapy. Patients and Methods The frequency of Ph-like ALL was assessed by gene expression profiling of 798 patients with B-cell ALL age 21 to 86 years. Event-free survival and overall survival were determined for Ph-like ALL versus non-Ph-like ALL patients. Detailed genomic analysis was performed on 180 of 194 patients with Ph-like ALL. Results Patients with Ph-like ALL accounted for more than 20% of adults with ALL, including 27.9% of young adults (age 21 to 39 years), 20.4% of adults (age 40 to 59 years), and 24.0% of older adults (age 60 to 86 years). Overall, patients with Ph-like ALL had an inferior 5-year event-free survival compared with patients with non-Ph-like ALL (22.5% [95% CI, 14.9% to 29.3%; n = 155] v 49.3% [95% CI, 42.8% to 56.2%; n = 247], respectively; P < .001). We identified kinase-activating alterations in 88% of patients with Ph-like ALL, including CRLF2 rearrangements (51%), ABL class fusions (9.8%), JAK2 or EPOR rearrangements (12.4%), other JAK-STAT sequence mutations (7.2%), other kinase alterations (4.1%), and Ras pathway mutations (3.6%). Eleven new kinase rearrangements were identified, including four involving new kinase or cytokine receptor genes and seven involving new partners for previously identified genes. Conclusion Ph-like ALL is a highly prevalent subtype of ALL in adults and is associated with poor outcome. The diverse range of kinase-activating alterations in Ph-like ALL has important therapeutic implications. Trials comparing the addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors to conventional therapy are required to evaluate the clinical utility of these agents in the treatment of Ph-like ALL.",,"['Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Gu, Zhaohui', 'Payne-Turner, Debbie', 'McCastlain, Kelly', 'Harvey, Richard C', 'Chen, I-Ming', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Valentine, Marcus', 'Pounds, Stanley B', 'Shi, Lei', 'Li, Yongjin', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Tosi, Manuela', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Luger, Selina', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Kornblau, Stephen', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Roberts KG', 'Gu Z', 'Payne-Turner D', 'McCastlain K', 'Harvey RC', 'Chen IM', 'Pei D', 'Iacobucci I', 'Valentine M', 'Pounds SB', 'Shi L', 'Li Y', 'Zhang J', 'Cheng C', 'Rambaldi A', 'Tosi M', 'Spinelli O', 'Radich JP', 'Minden MD', 'Rowe JM', 'Luger S', 'Litzow MR', 'Tallman MS', 'Wiernik PH', 'Bhatia R', 'Aldoss I', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Mrozek K', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Stock W', 'Kornblau S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Konopleva M', 'Paietta E', 'Willman CL', 'Mullighan CG']","[""Kathryn G.

Epub 2016 Nov 21.,,"Purpose Oral targeted therapies represent a significant advance for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); however, their high cost has raised concerns about affordability and the economic impact on society. Our objective was to project the future prevalence and cost burden of CLL in the era of oral targeted therapies in the United States. Methods We developed a simulation model that evaluated the evolving management of CLL from 2011 to 2025: chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) as the standard of care before 2014, oral targeted therapies for patients with del(17p) and relapsed CLL from 2014, and for first-line treatment from 2016 onward. A comparator scenario also was simulated where CIT remained the standard of care throughout. Disease progression and survival parameters for each therapy were based on published clinical trials. Results The number of people living with CLL in the United States is projected to increase from 128,000 in 2011 to 199,000 by 2025 (55% increase) due to improved survival; meanwhile, the annual cost of CLL management will increase from $0.74 billion to $5.13 billion (590% increase). The per-patient lifetime cost of CLL treatment will increase from $147,000 to $604,000 (310% increase) as oral targeted therapies become the first-line treatment. For patients enrolled in Medicare, the corresponding total out-of-pocket cost will increase from $9,200 to $57,000 (520% increase). Compared with the CIT scenario, oral targeted therapies resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $189,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Conclusion The increased benefit and cost of oral targeted therapies is projected to enhance CLL survivorship but can impose a substantial financial burden on both patients and payers. More sustainable pricing strategies for targeted therapies are needed to avoid financial toxicity to patients.",,"['Chen, Qiushi', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Ayer, Turgay', 'Wierda, William G', 'Flowers, Christopher R', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Keating, Michael J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Chhatwal, Jagpreet']","['Chen Q', 'Jain N', 'Ayer T', 'Wierda WG', 'Flowers CR', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Keating MJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Chhatwal J']","[""Qiushi Chen and Turgay Ayer, Georgia Institute of Technology; Christopher R.

Epub 2016 Nov 21.,10.1200/JCO.2016.69.5395 [doi],"Purpose Patients with relapsed metastatic germ cell tumor (GCT) can be cured with second-line and even third-line regimens. We report survival outcomes of patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) at Indiana University between 2004 and 2014. Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 364 consecutive patients with GCT who progressed after cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy and were subsequently treated with HDCT and PBSCT. Three hundred forty-one patients received two consecutive courses of HDCT consisting of 700 mg/m(2) carboplatin and 750 mg/m(2) etoposide, each for 3 consecutive days, and each followed by PBSCT. Twenty-three patients received only a single course of HDCT because of progressive disease or toxicity. Cox proportional hazards models were used to test predictors of disease progression. Results The median age was 32 years (range, 17 to 70 years). With a median follow-up of 3.3 years, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 60% (95% CI, 55% to 65%) and the 2-year overall survival was 66% (95% CI, 60% to 70%). Three hundred three patients received HDCT as second-line therapy with a 2-year PFS of 63% (95% CI, 57% to 68%), and 61 patients received HDCT as third-line or later therapy with a 2-year PFS of 49% (95% CI, 36% to 61%). In a multivariable analysis, factors associated with disease progression included use of HDCT as third-line or later therapy, platinum-refractory disease, mediastinal primary tumor site, nonseminoma histology, intermediate- or poor-risk disease at the time of GCT diagnosis, and human chorionic gonadotropin >/= 1,000 mIU/mL at initiation of HDCT. There were nine treatment-related deaths. Secondary leukemia developed in five patients. Conclusion This large single-institution study demonstrates that patients with relapsed metastatic GCT are curable by HDCT plus PBSCT even when used in third-line or later therapy.",,"['Adra, Nabil', 'Abonour, Rafat', 'Althouse, Sandra K', 'Albany, Costantine', 'Hanna, Nasser H', 'Einhorn, Lawrence H']","['Adra N', 'Abonour R', 'Althouse SK', 'Albany C', 'Hanna NH', 'Einhorn LH']","['All authors: Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'All authors: Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'All authors: Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'All authors: Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'All authors: Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'All authors: Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.']",['R01 CA157823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20161121,['Nat Rev Urol. 2017 Feb;14(2):66.

Epub 2016 Nov 9.,10.1111/iji.12295 [doi],"The EBMT risk score is an established tool successfully used in the prognosis of survival post-HSCT and is applicable for a range of haematological disorders. One of its main advantages is that score generation involves summation of clinical parameters that are available pretransplant. However, the EBMT risk score is recognized as not being optimal. Previous analyses, involving patients with various diagnoses, have shown that non-HLA gene polymorphisms influence outcome after allogeneic HSCT. This study is novel as it focuses only on patients having acute leukaemia (N = 458) and attempts to demonstrate how non-HLA gene polymorphisms can be added to the EBMT risk score in a Cox regression model to improve prognostic ability for overall survival. The results of the study found that three genetic factors improved EBMT risk score. The presence of MAL (rs8177374) allele T in the patient, absence of glucocorticoid receptor haplotype (consisting of rs6198, rs33389 and rs33388) ACT in the patient and absence of heat-shock protein 70-hom (+2437) (rs2227956) allele C in the patient were associated with decreased survival time. When compared to the EBMT risk score, the scores combining EBMT risk score with the genetic factors had an improved correlation with clinical outcome and better separation of risk groups. A bootstrapping technique, involving repeated testing of a model using multiple validation sets, also revealed that the newly proposed model had improved predictive value when compared to the EBMT risk score alone. Results support the view that non-HLA polymorphisms could be useful for pretransplant clinical assessment and provide evidence that polymorphisms in the recipient genotype may influence incoming donor cells, suppressing the initiation of the graft versus leukaemia effect and reducing survival.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Pearce, K F', 'Balavarca, Y', 'Norden, J', 'Jackson, G', 'Holler, E', 'Dressel, R', 'Greinix, H', 'Toubert, A', 'Gluckman, E', 'Hromadnikova, I', 'Sedlacek, P', 'Wolff, D', 'Holtick, U', 'Bickeboller, H', 'Dickinson, A M']","['Pearce KF', 'Balavarca Y', 'Norden J', 'Jackson G', 'Holler E', 'Dressel R', 'Greinix H', 'Toubert A', 'Gluckman E', 'Hromadnikova I', 'Sedlacek P', 'Wolff D', 'Holtick U', 'Bickeboller H', 'Dickinson AM']","['Haematological Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Genetic Epidemiology, University Medical Center, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Haematological Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Northern Centre for Cancer Care, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, University Medical Center, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Haematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', ""Departement d'Immunologie, Universite Paris Diderot, INSERM UMRS-940, AP-HP, Paris, France."", 'EUROCORD, University Research Institute, St Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Cell Pathology, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Genetic Epidemiology, University Medical Center, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Haematological Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",,20161109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a novel fusion of the genes PAX5 and ""kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa"" (KIDINS220, also known as ARMS) in a Ph-like ALL. As PAX5 is a master regulator of B-lymphocyte differentiation, PAX5 rearrangements induce a differentiation block in B lymphocytes. KIDINS220 is a mediator of multiple receptor signaling pathways, interacts with both T- and B-cell receptors, and is necessary for sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Although functional studies are needed, the PAX5-KIDINS220 fusion protein might not only inhibit wild-type PAX5 function, but also promote sustained activation of the ERK signaling pathway through upregulation of KIDINS220.

The CBC revealed marked thrombocytosis, leukopenia and macrocytic, normochromic anemia. The cat tested negative for FeLV and feline immunodeficiency virus, but was positive for Mycoplasma haemominutum by PCR. Hematologic abnormalities were not responsive to therapy, so a repeat CBC and a bone marrow aspiration for cytology were performed. Additional blood smear findings included anisocytosis with megaloblastic erythroid precursors, large platelets, eosinophilic myelocytes and metamyelocytes, and rare unidentified blasts. The bone marrow smear was highly cellular, and the cytologic pattern was consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome with an erythroid predominance. At that time, 15% blasts were present. The cat was treated with a vitamin K2 analog, doxycycline, and prednisolone, but without a clinical response. Within 3 months, euthanasia was elected due to declining quality of life, and a necropsy was performed. Postmortem bone marrow smears were highly cellular and dominated by monomorphic blasts of unknown line of origin (52%), persistent marked erythroid and megakaryocytic dysplasia, and ineffective erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis. Immunohistochemical, immunocytochemical, and cytochemical stains resulted in a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia of unclassified type. Additional histologic findings included mixed hepatitis with trematode infestation and lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis with fibrosis. The marked thrombocytosis with myelodysplastic syndrome and the FeLV-negative status of this cat were unusual.

To represent adequate model systems it is of utmost importance that cell lines faithfully model the primary tumor material and are not cross-contaminated with unrelated cell material (or contaminated with mycoplasma). As it has been previously reported that cross-contaminated cell lines represent a significant problem, it is of interest to know whether any improvement in the prevalence of such ""false cell lines"" had occurred since we called the alert in 1999. A retrospective review of our data archives covered 848 cell lines received from 1990 to 2014 from 290 laboratories in 23 countries spanning the spectrum of leukemia-lymphoma entities. Two variables were considered: authenticity and freedom from mycoplasma infection. Regarding provenance, we separately considered primary sources (original investigators having established the cell lines or reference repositories) and secondary sources. The percentages of mycoplasma-contaminated cell lines decreased significantly over the 25-year timespan. Among primary sourced material: mycoplasma-contamination fell from 23% to 0%; among secondary sourced: from 48% to 21%. The corresponding figures for cross-contamination declined from 15% to 6%, while among material obtained from secondary sources prevalence remained remarkably high, throughout the time periods at 14-18%. Taken together, our data indicate that using non-authenticated cell lines from secondary sources carries a risk of about 1:6 for obtaining a false cell line. The use of authentic leukemia-lymphoma cell lines holds important translational value for their model character and the reproducibility of the laboratory data in the clinical arena.",['(c) 2016 UICC.'],"['Drexler, Hans G', 'Dirks, Wilhelm G', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F', 'Uphoff, Cord C']","['Drexler HG', 'Dirks WG', 'MacLeod RA', 'Uphoff CC']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*authentification', '*cell lines', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*mycoplasma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under conditions of elevated ROS, endogenous L-cysteine (L-Cys) production is insufficient for GSH synthesis. This necessitates uptake of L-Cys that is predominantly in its disulfide form, L-cystine (CSSC), via the xCT(-) transporter. We show that administration of an engineered and pharmacologically optimized human cyst(e)inase enzyme mediates sustained depletion of the extracellular L-Cys and CSSC pool in mice and non-human primates. Treatment with this enzyme selectively causes cell cycle arrest and death in cancer cells due to depletion of intracellular GSH and ensuing elevated ROS; yet this treatment results in no apparent toxicities in mice even after months of continuous treatment. Cyst(e)inase suppressed the growth of prostate carcinoma allografts, reduced tumor growth in both prostate and breast cancer xenografts and doubled the median survival time of TCL1-Tg:p53(-/-) mice, which develop disease resembling human chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It was observed that enzyme-mediated depletion of the serum L-Cys and CSSC pool suppresses the growth of multiple tumors, yet is very well tolerated for prolonged periods, suggesting that cyst(e)inase represents a safe and effective therapeutic modality for inactivating antioxidant cellular responses in a wide range of malignancies.",,"['Cramer, Shira L', 'Saha, Achinto', 'Liu, Jinyun', 'Tadi, Surendar', 'Tiziani, Stefano', 'Yan, Wupeng', 'Triplett, Kendra', 'Lamb, Candice', 'Alters, Susan E', 'Rowlinson, Scott', 'Zhang, Yan Jessie', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Huang, Peng', 'DiGiovanni, John', 'Georgiou, George', 'Stone, Everett']","['Cramer SL', 'Saha A', 'Liu J', 'Tadi S', 'Tiziani S', 'Yan W', 'Triplett K', 'Lamb C', 'Alters SE', 'Rowlinson S', 'Zhang YJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Huang P', 'DiGiovanni J', 'Georgiou G', 'Stone E']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Dell Pediatric Research Institute, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Aeglea Biotherapeutics, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Aeglea Biotherapeutics, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Dell Pediatric Research Institute, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA.']","['R01 CA172724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA189623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA154754/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA054174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM104896/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",20161121,,PMC5218918,,,,,,['NIHMS823457'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of GD on normal cells and the molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we identified for the first time the anti-melanogenic activity of GD and its precise underlying mechanisms in mouse melan-a cells. GD significantly inhibited melanin synthesis in the melan-a cells and a reconstructed human skin model. Further analysis revealed that GD suppressed the expression of tyrosinase and increased the rate of tyrosinase degradation. GD also inhibited tyrosinase enzymatic activity. In addition, GD effectively suppressed the expression of proteins associated with melanosome transfer.

The genetic basis for susceptibility to radiation-induced AML is not well characterized. We previously identified a candidate murine gene for susceptibility to radiation-induced AML (rAML): C-terminal binding protein (CTBP)-interacting protein (CTIP)/retinoblastoma binding protein 8 (RBBP8). This gene is essential for embryonic development, double-strand break (DSB) resection in homologous recombination (HR) and tumor suppression. In the 129S2/SvHsd mouse strain, a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP) in Ctip, Q418P, has been identified. We investigated the role of Q418P in radiation-induced carcinogenesis and its effect on CTIP function in HR. After whole-body exposure to 3 Gy of X rays, 11 out of 113 (9.7%) 129S2/SvHsd mice developed rAML. Furthermore, 129S2/SvHsd mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed lower levels of recruitment of HR factors, Rad51 and replication protein A (RPA) to radiation-induced foci, compared to CBA/H and C57BL/6 MEFs, isolated from rAML-sensitive and resistant strains, respectively. Mitomycin C and alpha particles induced lower levels of sister chromatid exchanges in 129S2/SvHsd cells compared to CBA/H and C57BL/6.

Based on observations in patients with purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency, a guanosine nucleoside analogue, arabinosylguanine (ara-G) was developed that provided T-cell specificity. Nelarabine was developed as the water-soluble, clinically useful-prodrug of ara-G and based on its activity was approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory T-ALL/LBL. Areas covered: In this narrative review, we will summarize the preclinical studies, early dose-finding studies, and efficacy studies that led to approval of nelarabine. The review will succinctly cover response rates and safety signals reported during clinical development. We will also cover more recent work with nelarabine, including combination studies, modified dosing schedules, and frontline treatment approaches.

Here, we identify that Smac mimetics such as BV6, which antagonizes IAP proteins, elicit necroptosis in AML cells, in which apoptosis is inhibited pharmacologically by caspase inhibitors or genetically by caspase-8 knockdown. Importantly, BV6 triggers necroptosis also in apoptosis-resistant patient-derived AML blasts, underlining the clinical relevance of our findings. Mechanistically, we show that BV6-induced cell death depends on key components of necroptosis signaling such as RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL, since pharmacological or genetic inhibition of these proteins significantly protects AML cells from BV6-mediated cell death, whereas PGAM5 is dispensable. Interestingly, we identify constitutive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) secretion and an autocrine/paracrine TNFalpha loop as critical mediators of BV6-induced necroptosis in AML cell lines and patient-derived blasts, as the TNFalpha-blocking antibody Enbrel or tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor 1 (TNFR1) knockdown significantly rescue cell death. Notably, AML cells exhibit high basal levels of TNFalpha compared to non-malignant CD34+ cells, which is further increased by BV6. In conclusion, this is the first report showing that Smac mimetics circumvent apoptosis resistance in AML cells by inducing necroptosis in a TNFalpha-dependent manner, which has important implications for the development of new strategies to overcome treatment resistance in AML.",,"['Safferthal, C', 'Rohde, K', 'Fulda, S']","['Safferthal C', 'Rohde K', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",,20161121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 21.,10.1002/pros.23281 [doi],"BACKGROUND: To understand the impact of radiotherapy on the development of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) among elderly prostate cancer patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of elderly prostate cancer patients diagnosed during 1999-2011 by using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database. Competing risk analyses adjusting for patient characteristics were conducted to assess the impact of radiotherapy on the development of subsequent MDS/AML, compared with surgery. RESULTS: Of 32,112 prostate cancer patients, 14,672 underwent radiotherapy, and 17,440 received surgery only. The median follow-up was 4.68 years. A total of 157 (0.47%) prostate cancer patients developed subsequent MDS or AML, and the median time to develop MDS/AML was 3.30 (range: 0.16-9.48) years. Compared with prostate cancer patients who received surgery only, patients who underwent radiotherapy had a significantly increased risk of developing MDS/AML (hazard ratio [HR] =1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.13). When radiotherapy was further categorized by modalities (brachytherapy, conventional conformal radiotherapy, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]), increased risk of second MDS/AML was only observed in the IMRT group (HR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.09-2.54). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases the risk of MDS/AML, and the impact may differ by modality.

Chemotherapy is the preferred therapeutic strategy; however, recurrence of cancer and non-selective cytotoxicity are the major concerns. Unlike synthetic chemotherapeutic agents, mistletoe ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) displays anti-tumor function in various types of cancers. However, its effect on leukemia cells is little explored. In this study, we assessed the impact of Viscum articulatum RIP (Articulatin-D) on the survival of acute T-cell leukemia cells and the involved molecular and cellular mechanisms. Cell proliferation assay showed that Articulatin-D suppressed the viability of leukemia cells selectively. We further confirmed that the elevation of mitochondrial membrane potential and exposure of phosphatidylserine are the early events of apoptosis induction in Articulatin-D-treated Jurkat cells. Subsequently, we found that Articulatin-D treatment induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, we provided evidence that Articulatin-D efficiently activates caspase-8 involved in extrinsic pathway of apoptosis induction, which ultimately results in caspase-3-dependent DNA fragmentation of Jurkat cells. Further evaluation of Articulatin-D in cell culture and animal models may provide novel information on selective cytotoxicity to acute T-cell leukemia and its involvement in targeting tumor cell survival pathways.",,"['Mishra, Ruchi', 'Das, Mrinal K', 'Singh, Savita', 'Sharma, Radhey Shyam', 'Sharma, Sadhna', 'Mishra, Vandana']","['Mishra R', 'Das MK', 'Singh S', 'Sharma RS', 'Sharma S', 'Mishra V']","['Bioresources and Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Environmental Studies, University of Delhi, Delhi, 110 007, India.', 'Bioresources and Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Environmental Studies, University of Delhi, Delhi, 110 007, India.', 'Bioresources and Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Environmental Studies, University of Delhi, Delhi, 110 007, India.', 'Bioresources and Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Environmental Studies, University of Delhi, Delhi, 110 007, India.', 'Department of Zoology, Miranda House College, University of Delhi, Delhi, 110 007, India.', 'Bioresources and Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Environmental Studies, University of Delhi, Delhi, 110 007, India. mistletoe_h@hotmail.com.']",,20161121,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anticancer', 'Apoptosis mechanism', 'Articulatin-D', 'Leukemia cell line', 'Ribosome-inactivating protein', 'Viscum articulatum (mistletoe)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even the currently most intensive chemotherapy regimen modified LSG15 (mLSG15, VCAP-AMP-VECP) results in a dismal clinical outcome, with a median overall survival of only around 1 year. Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) may lead to long-term remission in a proportion of patients with aggressive ATL, the clinical outcome in patients with refractory or relapsed ATL is unsatisfactory. The anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab (moga) has been recently approved for ATL in Japan, and it is effective in a significant proportion of patients with refractory or relapsed ATL. However, there are major concerns about the harmful influences of pretransplant moga on the immune reconstitution after allo-HSCT. Specifically, moga depletes regulatory T cells (Tregs) for at least a few months, which may increase the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allo-HSCT. A recent retrospective study from Japan clearly showed that pretransplant moga increased the risk of severe and steroid-refractory GVHD, which led to increases in non-relapse mortality and overall mortality. To improve the overall clinical outcome in patients with relapsed or refractory ATL, more studies are needed to incorporate moga without increasing adverse effects on the clinical outcome after allo-HSCT.

The subject of our interest was a possible relationship between a configuration of chiral centers of the studied lactones and their anticancer potency against a panel of canine cell lines representing hematopoietic (CLBL-1, GL-1, CL-1, CLB70) and mammary gland cancers (P114, CMT-U27, CMT-U309). To determine the anticancer activity of the tested compounds, cell viability and cell metabolic activity were checked using propidium iodide staining and the MTT test. To determine whether the studied compounds cause necrotic or apoptotic cell death, two assays for apoptosis evaluation were performed, annexin V staining and detection of caspase 3/7 activation. Simultaneously, the effects of the compounds on the cell cycle were also examined. The conducted research confirmed the anticancer potential of the tested lactones against canine cancers. The investigated isomers exerted higher activity against canine lymphoma/leukemia cell lines than against mammary tumors, whereas the configuration of stereogenic centers of the examined compounds affected their activity. It has been shown that stereoisomers with 4S configuration (2,4) were more active, and the most potent one was the cis-(4S,5S,6R)-2 isomer. The investigated lactones seemed to initiate the process of apoptosis rather than acting as typical cytostatic agents, as cell death via apoptosis, and no increase in G2-M population in the cell cycle analysis were observed.

This enzyme is presented in different organisms, such as microorganisms, vegetal, and some animals, including certain rodent's serum, but not unveiled in humans. It can be used as important chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of a variety of lymphoproliferative disorders and lymphomas (particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma), and has been a pivotal agent in chemotherapy protocols from around 30 years. Also, other important application is in food industry, by using the properties of this enzyme to reduce acrylamide levels in commercial fried foods, maintaining their characteristics (color, flavor, texture, security, etc.) Actually, l-asparaginase catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-asparagine, not allowing the reaction of reducing sugars with this aminoacid for the generation of acrylamide. Currently, production of l-asparaginase is mainly based in biotechnological production by using some bacteria. However, industrial production also needs research work aiming to obtain better production yields, as well as novel process by applying different microorganisms to increase the range of applications of the produced enzyme. Within this context, this mini-review presents l-asparaginase applications, production by different microorganisms and some limitations, current investigations, as well as some challenges to be achieved for profitable industrial production.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

But during retrovirus infection, a histone-free DNA copy of the viral genome is synthesized that must be loaded with nucleosomes de novo. Here, we show that core histones are rapidly loaded onto unintegrated Moloney murine leukemia virus DNAs. Loading of nucleosomes requires nuclear entry, but does not require viral DNA integration. The histones associated with unintegrated DNAs become marked by covalent modifications, with a delay relative to the time of core histone loading. Expression from unintegrated DNA can be enhanced by modulation of the histone-modifying machinery. The data show that histone loading onto unintegrated DNAs occurs very rapidly after nuclear entry and does not require prior establishment of an integrated provirus.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Genes associated with naive pluripotency are repressed in the transition from inner cell mass to epiblast cells, followed by upregulation after PGC specification. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the reactivation of pluripotency genes are poorly characterized. Here, we exploited the in vitro differentiation of epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to elucidate the molecular and epigenetic functions of PR domain-containing 14 (PRDM14). We found that Prdm14 overexpression in EpiLCs induced their conversion to ESC-like cells even in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor in adherent culture. This was impaired by the loss of Kruppel-like factor 2 and ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins. Furthermore, PRDM14 recruited OCT3/4 to the enhancer regions of naive pluripotency genes via TET-base excision repair-mediated demethylation. Our results provide evidence that PRDM14 establishes a transcriptional network for naive pluripotency via active DNA demethylation.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

The tumor-suppressor ARLTS1 gene was previously described in sporadic hematological malignancies and familial cancer context. METHODS: In this study, we sequence the ARLTS1 gene in 100 patients belonging to 88 independent Tunisian and French families. RESULTS: After gene sequencing, we report 8 genetic variations, most of which were previously reported in several cancer forms. The most common variants were W149X and C148R and were previously associated to B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and to high-risk of familial breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the fact that ARLTS1 gene mutations can be considered as a potential predisposing factor in familial hematological malignancies and other several cancer forms.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Societe Francaise du Cancer.

This led to the issuance of new recommendations in Germany concerning CT in children. METHODS: We analyzed data from the German pediatric CT cohort study together with data on children from a large general statutory health insurance provider (AOK) in order to characterize the secular trend in the use of CT in Germany. We used information from the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) to estimate individual organ doses per scan and their development over time. RESULTS: The number of CT scans performed on children in Germany each year declined by 29% from 2006 to 2012. Over the same period, younger children were exposed to lower organ doses during CT scanning, although some organ doses were higher in neonates than in older children. The highest organ doses were in the 7.6 to 12.5-year-old age group and affected the brain (37.12 mGy +/- 19.68 mGy) and the lenses (41.24 mGy +/- 20.08 mGy). In every age group, the organ doses declined from year to year. With approximately 21 000 children aged 0-13 undergoing CT each year (extrapolated from insurance data of 2008), one can expect 2.3 [-1.7; 6.3] additional new cases of leukemia and 1 [-2.3; 4.0] additional new tumor of the central nervous system to arise each year. CONCLUSION: In view of the risks, children should undergo CT only for the indications listed by the German Commission on Radiological Protection (Strahlenschutzkommission). Further epidemiological studies are needed for estimation of the risk associated with the use of newer CT technology.",,"['Pokora, Roman', 'Krille, Lucian', 'Dreger, Steffen', 'Lee, Choonsik', 'Gunster, Christian', 'Zeeb, Hajo', 'Blettner, Maria']","['Pokora R', 'Krille L', 'Dreger S', 'Lee C', 'Gunster C', 'Zeeb H', 'Blettner M']","['Roman Pokora and Lucian Krille are joint first authors; Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), Faculty of Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyon, France; Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS GmbH, Bremen; National Cancer Institute (NCI), Rockville, Maryland, USA; Scientific Institute of the AOK (WIdO); University of Bremen, Research Focus Health Sciences Bremen.']",,,,PMC5150210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of germinal mutations enables the initiation of a preventive program that can include early detection or preventive treatment and may also have a major impact on cancer therapy. Several recurrent mutations were identified in the BRCA1/2 genes in Jewish populations however, in other ethnic groups in Israel, no recurrent mutations were identified to date. Our group established panel sequencing in cancer patients to identify recurrent, founder, and new mutations in the heterogeneous and diverse populations in Israel, We evaluated five breast cancer patients of Arab descent diagnosed with cancer before the age of 50 years and identified the previously described TP53 mutation, c.541C>T, R181C (rs587782596), in two women from unrelated Arab families. The two probands were diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age (27 and 34 years) and had significant family history spanning a wide range of tumors (breast cancer (BC), papillary thyroid cancer, glioblastoma multiform (GBM), colon cancer and leukemia). The R181C variant is expected to disrupt p53 at the ASPP2 binding domain but not the DNA binding domain and is defined by Clinvar as likely pathogenic and in HGMD as disease mutation. We further tested 85 unrelated Arab cancer patients and father of a BC carrier patient for TP53 c.541C>T using a real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach and identified four additional carriers, two with BC one with lung cancer, and the father of a BC carrier patient, diagnosed with GBM. Another carrier suffering from BC was identified using a Myriad panel, suggesting a recurrent mutation in this population with a frequency of 5/42 (11.9%) of our selected BC patients. We suggest testing Arab women with a breast cancer at a young age, Arab patients with multiple malignancies, or with suggestive family history for TP53 c.541C>T.",,"['Zick, Aviad', 'Kadouri, Luna', 'Cohen, Sherri', 'Frohlinger, Michael', 'Hamburger, Tamar', 'Zvi, Naama', 'Plaser, Morasha', 'Avital, Eilat', 'Breuier, Shani', 'Elian, Firase', 'Salah, Azzam', 'Goldberg, Yael', 'Peretz, Tamar']","['Zick A', 'Kadouri L', 'Cohen S', 'Frohlinger M', 'Hamburger T', 'Zvi N', 'Plaser M', 'Avital E', 'Breuier S', 'Elian F', 'Salah A', 'Goldberg Y', 'Peretz T']","['Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Human Genetics and Metabolic Diseases, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Human Genetics and Metabolic Diseases, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Human Genetics and Metabolic Diseases, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.

Epub 2016 Nov 19.,10.1007/s00520-016-3486-6 [doi],"PURPOSE: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease, accounting for 15 to 20% of leukemias, with an incidence of one to two cases/100,000 inhabitants. In Brazil, the estimated incidence of leukemia is six cases/100,000 men and 4.28 cases/100,000 women. CML is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. At present, three types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are administered to treat CML patients in the Brazilian public national health system (NHS), called the Unified Health System (in Portuguese, ""Sistema Unico de Saude"", SUS). Such treatments are only effective if patients adhere to strict dosage regimens; protocol improvements that increase patient adherence to treatment would have economic and health benefits for overburdened health care systems. Here, pharmacist-monitored treatment is assessed. METHODS: In our study, we applied two questionnaires, one to assess the adherence to pharmacological treatment and another to assess the quality of life. All patients studied (n = 23) were diagnosed with CML at a local hospital in ""Espirito Santo"" State, the ""Hospital Evangelico Vila Velha"" (HEVV). RESULTS: Treatment adherence was significantly higher in pharmacist-monitored patients than in nonmonitored patients (p = 0.0135). The quality of life of CML patients was also analyzed, indicating that monitored patients had a lower number of symptoms/complaints during treatment periods than nonmonitored patients. Finally, improved treatment adherence also translated into better clinical conditions, particularly during the early stage of treatment (e.g., the first 4 months). CONCLUSIONS: The intervention of a clinical pharmacist is significant to obtain positive clinical results. Therefore, it is recommended that this protocol be included in the standard NHS treatment protocol CML patient outcomes to reduce the indirect and recurring costs to the health care system caused by nonadherence.",,"['Moulin, Silmara Mendes Martins', 'Eutropio, Frederico Jacob', 'Souza, Jessica de Oliveira', 'Busato, Fernanda de Oliveira', 'Olivieri, David N', 'Tadokoro, Carlos Eduardo']","['Moulin SM', 'Eutropio FJ', 'Souza JO', 'Busato FO', 'Olivieri DN', 'Tadokoro CE']","['Programa de Pos-graduacao em Ciencias Farmaceuticas (PPGCF), Universidade Vila Velha, R.

METHODS: We used multivariable Cox regression to examine factors associated with AML/MDS, adjusting for age (>/=65 vs. <65 years; separately for >/=70 vs. <70 years), race/ethnicity, insurance, performance status, and anthracycline receipt. We also examined the effect of cyclophosphamide, the interaction of anthracycline and age, and outcomes for those developing AML/MDS. RESULTS: On Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 40101, 49907, 9344, and 9741, 7290 received anthracyclines; 15% were in the age >/=65 and 7% were >/=70. Overall, 47 patients developed AML/MDS (30 AML [0.3%], 17 MDS [0.2%]); 83% of events occurred within 5 years of study registration. Among those age >/=65 and >/=70, 0.8 and 1.0% developed AML/MDS (vs. 0.4% for age <65), respectively. In adjusted analyses, older age and anthracycline receipt were significantly associated with AML/MDS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for age >/=65 [vs. <65] = 3.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-8.33; HR for anthracycline receipt [vs. no anthracycline] = 5.16, 95% CI 1.47-18.19). There was no interaction between age and anthracycline use. Deaths occurred in 70% of those developing AML/MDS.

Although there are many reports suggesting that acute myeloid leukemia patients with high expression levels of WT1 mRNA have a relatively poor long-term survival, there are few reports addressing the relationship between WT1 levels and prognosis in MDS. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 42 elderly patients with MDS whose WT1 levels at diagnosis were available, and we assessed the relationships between WT1 levels in peripheral blood and preexisting prognostic factors such as World Health Organization prognostic scores and Revised International Prognostic Scoring System risk categories, bone marrow blast percentages, and chromosomal abnormalities linked to a poor prognosis. We also evaluated the relationship between WT1 levels and prognosis. RESULTS: WT1 levels were significantly different between high- and low-risk MDS patients (p < 0.05). There was a trend towards a significant difference between those with and those without poor prognostic chromosomal rearrangements (p = 0.051). Moreover, the overall survival and progression-free survival were significantly worse in elderly patients with higher levels of WT1 (p = 0.00039 and p = 0.00077, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The WT1 mRNA expression level at diagnosis may be a significant independent prognostic marker for elderly patients with MDS.","['(c) 2016 S.

To deepen the role of protein regions in its biological activities, lately we reported on the structural behavior of dissected C-terminal domain (CTD) helical fragments. Unexpectedly the H2 (residues 264-277) and H3 AML-mutated regions showed a remarkable tendency to form amyloid-like assemblies with fibrillar morphology and beta-sheet structure that resulted as toxic when exposed to human neuroblastoma cells. More recently NPM1 was found to be highly expressed and toxic in neurons of mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD). Here we investigate the role of each residue in the beta-strand aggregation process of H2 region of NPM1 by performing a systematic alanine scan of its sequence and structural and kinetic analyses of aggregation of derived peptides by means of Circular Dichorism (CD) and Thioflavin T (Th-T) assay. These solution state investigations pointed out the crucial role exerted by the basic amyloidogenic stretch of H2 (264-271) and to shed light on the initial and main interactions involved in fibril formation we performed studies on fibrils deriving from the related Ala peptides through the analysis of fibrils with birefringence of polarized optical microscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). This analysis suggested that the presence of branched Ile(269) conferred preferential packing patterns that, instead, appeared geometrically hampered by the aromatic side-chain of Phe(268).

Emerging evidence has revealed that altered expression and function of the molecular determinants of SOCE play a critical role in the development or maintenance of several cancer hallmarks, including enhanced proliferation and migration. Here we show that, in the acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL60, Orai2 is highly expressed at the transcript level, followed by the expression of Orai1. Using fluorescence Ca(2+) imaging we found that Orai2 silencing significantly attenuated thapsigargin-induced SOCE, as well as knockdown of Orai1, while silencing the expression of both channels almost completely reduced SOCE, thus suggesting that SOCE in these cells is strongly dependent on Orai1 and Orai2. On the other hand, the expression of TRPC1, TRPC3 and TRPC6 is almost absent at the transcript and protein level. Bromodeoxyuridine cell proliferation assay revealed that Orai1 and Orai2 expression silencing significantly reduced HL60 cell proliferation. Furthermore, knockdown of Orai1 and Orai2 significantly attenuated the ability of HL60 to migrate in vitro as determined by transwell migration assay, probably due to the impairment of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. These findings provide evidence for a role for Orai1 and Orai2, in SOCE and migration in the human HL60 promyeloblastic cell line.

Recent experimental mouse modeling of B-progenitor ALL has shown that IKZF1 alterations have multiple effects, including arresting differentiation, skewing lineage of leukemia from myeloid to lymphoid, and, in Ph+ leukemia, conferring resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy without abrogating ABL1 inhibition. These effects are in part mediated by acquisition of an aberrant hematopoietic stem cell-like program accompanied by induction of cell surface expression of stem cell and adhesion molecules that mediate extravascular invasion and residence in the niche and activation of integrin signaling pathways. These effects can be exploited therapeutically using several approaches. IKZF1 alterations also result in upregulation of RXRA that encodes part of the heterodimeric retinoic acid X receptor. Rexinoids, a synthetic class of retinoids that bind specifically to retinoid ""X"" receptors such as bexarotene potently reverse aberrant adhesion and niche mislocalization in vivo and induce differentiation and cell cycle arrest. Focal adhesion kinase inhibitors block the downstream integrin-mediated signaling, reverse adhesion, and niche mislocalization. Both agents act synergistically with TKIs to prolong survival of Ph+ ALL in mouse and human xenograft model, with long-term remission induced by focal adhesion kinase inhibitors. Therefore, these findings provide important new conceptual insights into the mechanisms by which IKZF1 alterations result in drug resistance and indicate that therapeutic strategies directed against the pathways deregulated by mutation, rather than attempting to restore IKZF1 expression directly, represent promising therapeutic approaches in this disease.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Fusion proteins of MLL and a component of the AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex (AEP) are responsible for two-thirds of MLL-associated leukemia cases. MLL-AEP fusion proteins trigger aberrant self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors by constitutively activating self-renewal-related genes. MLL-AEP fusion proteins activate transcription initiation by loading the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the TATA element via selectivity factor 1. Although AEP retains transcription elongation and mediator recruiting activities, the rate-limiting step activated by MLL-AEP fusion proteins appears to be the TBP-loading step. This is contrary to prevailing views, in which the recruitment of transcription elongation activities are emphasized. Here, I review recent advances towards elucidating the mechanisms underlying gene activation by MLL-AEP fusion proteins in leukemogenesis.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study we hypothesized that inadequate detoxification due to CYP2B6 polymorphisms may contribute to AML. To evaluate the potential impact of CYP2B6 polymorphisms on AML development and induction of its specific chromosomal abnormalities we studied C(777)A and A(785)G polymorphisms for the first time in AML. Furthermore, we investigated the co-existence of the above polymorphisms with G(516)T polymorphism to determine the CYP2B6 high-risk haplotypes in AML susceptibility. Our study included 619 AML patients and 430 healthy donors. Concerning C(777)A CYP2B6 polymorphism, no significant difference was found between patients and controls. However, A(785)G CYP2B6 polymorphism showed a statistically higher frequency of the variant genotypes in patients (48.2%), mainly in secondary AML patients (49.1%) than in controls (26.1%). Moreover, an increased frequency of the variant genotypes was found in those with abnormal karyotypes, especially with -7/del(7q), -5/del(5q), +8, inv(16) and t(8;21). The combination of the three CYP2B6 polymorphisms (G(516)T, C(777)A & A(785)G) revealed seven haplotypes. Four out of six haplotypes with at least one mutant allele were significantly associated with an increased risk for AML. Interestingly, T516A777G785 haplotype, where the three mutant alleles co-existed, had ~3-fold increased risk to be found in patients than controls. The association between haplotypes and cytogenetic aberrations revealed a positive correlation between specific CYP2B6 haplotypes and AML cytogenetic abnormalities. Our data suggest that A(785)G CYP2B6 gene polymorphism and specific CYP2B6 haplotypes may contribute to AML and its specific chromosomal aberrations.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 28 hips of 21 patients who had undergone free vascularized fibular grafting for the treatment of osteonecrosis of femoral head. There were 16 male and 5 female patients. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 30.7 years (between 15 and 53 years). The mean follow-up time was 7.6 years (between 5 years and 9.2 years). RESULTS: During follow-up, one patient died because of leukemia, and one patient was lost. The remaining 26 hips of 19 patients were evaluated. According to the Ficat classification, at the time of surgery, 17 hips were in grade 2 and 9 hips were in grade 3. The post-operative Harris hip scores in grade II disease were excellent in 12 patients, good in 3 patients, and fair in 1 patient. In grade III disease, 1 patient was excellent, 5 patients were good, and 1 patient was fair. There was a significant increase in HHS scores (61 +/- 9.7 vs 84 +/- 17.8, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Free vascularized fibular grafting yields extremely good results, particularly in pre-collapse stages of disease in young patients. The operation time does not mark increased if the surgical team is ""familiar"" with the procedure, and the residual fibular defect of the donor site does not impair the functions of daily living.

For example, classic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are hematopoietic stem cell disorders that affect cells of the myeloid lineage, including erythrocytes, platelets, and granulocytes. An activating mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase is prevalent in these diseases. In MPN patients that lack such a mutation, other genetic changes that lead to activation of the JAK2 signaling pathway are present, indicating deregulation of JAK2 signaling plays an etiological driving role in MPNs, a concept supported by significant evidence from in vivo experimental MPN systems. Thus, small molecules that inhibit JAK2 activity are ideal drugs to impede the progression of disease in MPN patients. However, even though JAK inhibitors provide significant symptomatic relief, they have failed as a remission-inducing therapy. Nonetheless, the progress made understanding the molecular etiology of MPNs since 2005 is significant and has provided insight for the development and testing of novel molecular targeted therapeutic approaches. The current understanding of driver mutations in MPNs and an overview of current and potential therapeutic strategies for MPN patients will be discussed.",['(c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Due to high relapse rates, overall survival for this rapidly progressing disease is poor. The significant challenge in AML treatment is disease heterogeneity stemming from variability in maturation state of leukemic cells of origin, genetic aberrations among patients, and existence of multiple disease clones within a single patient. Disease heterogeneity and the lack of biomarkers for drug sensitivity lie at the root of treatment failure as well as selective efficacy of AML chemotherapies and the emergence of drug resistance. Furthermore, standard-of-care treatment is aggressive, presenting significant tolerability concerns to the commonly advanced-age AML patient.

Such tumor cells elude the host immune system because several T cells targeted against self-antigens are removed during thymic development, and those that persist are eliminated by a regulatory population of T cells. Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR-Ts) have emerged as a novel modality for tumor immunotherapy due to their powerful efficacy against tumor cells. These cells are created by transducing genes-coding fusion proteins of tumor antigen-recognition single-chain Fv connected to the intracellular signaling domains of T cell receptors, and are classed as first-, second- and third-generation, differing on the intracellular signaling domain number of T cell receptors. CAR-T treatment has emerged as a promising approach for patients with hematological malignancies, and there are several works reporting clinical trials of the use of CAR-modified T-cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and in acute myeloid leukemia by targeting different antigens.

In this report, the synthesis and the biological evaluation of halogen-containing NHC-Au(I) -Cl complexes are described. The complexes 1 and 5 a-5 f displayed good cytotoxic activity against tumor cells, and cellular uptake studies suggested that an intact Au-NHC fragment is essential for the accumulation of high amounts of both the metal and the NHC ligand. However, the bioavailability was negatively affected by serum components of the cell culture media and was influenced by likely transformations of the complex. One example (5 d) efficiently induced apoptosis in vincristine- and daunorubicin-resistant P-glycoprotein overexpressing Nalm-6 leukemia cells. Cellular uptake studies with this compound showed that both the wild-type and resistant Nalm-6 cells accumulated comparable amounts of gold, indicating that the gold drug was not excreted by P-glycoprotein or other efflux transporters. The effective inhibition of mammalian and bacterial thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) was confirmed for all of the gold complexes. Antibacterial screening of the gold complexes showed a particularly high activity against Gram-positive strains, reflecting their high dependence on an intact Trx/TrxR system. This result is of particular interest as the inhibition of bacterial TrxR represents a relatively little explored mechanism of new anti-infectives.","['(c) 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We previously reported the fusion protein NUP98-IQ motif containing G (IQCG) in a myeloid/T lymphoid bi-phenoleukemia patient with t(3;11) and confirmed its leukemogenic ability. Herein, we demonstrated the association of NUP98-IQCG with CRM1, and found that NUP98-IQCG expression inhibits the CRM1-mediated nuclear export of p65 and enhances the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappaB. Moreover, IQCG could be entrapped in the nucleus by NUP98-IQCG, and the fusion protein interacts with calmodulin via the IQ motif in a calcium-independent manner.

In our study we investigated the expression levels of microRNAs and histone deacetylase enzymes via RT-qPCR in bone marrow specimens of adult patients suffering from hematological malignancies (total cohort n = 40), especially acute myeloid leukemia (n = 27). The levels of the three examined Warburg-effect related microRNAs (miR-378*, miR-23b, miR-26a) positively correlated with each other and the oncogenic miR-155 and miR-125b, while negatively with the level of the tumorsuppressor miR-124. Significant relationships have been confirmed between the levels of SIRT6, HDAC4 and the microRNAs listed above. In NPM1-mutated AML (n = 6), the level of miR-125b was significantly lower than in the group of AML patients not carrying this mutation (n = 13) (p < 0.05). In M5 FAB type of AML (n = 5), the level of miR-124 was significantly higher compared to the M2 group (n = 7) (p < 0.05). In two cases of FAB M5 AML, the levels of SIRT6 and miR-26a increased during the first 4 weeks of treatment. In the total cohort, white blood cell count at the time of the diagnosis significantly correlated with the levels of HDAC4, SIRT6, miR-124 and miR-26a. Our results suggest that Warburg-effect related microRNAs may have important role in the pathogenesis of leukemia, and the potential oncogenic property of HDAC4 and SIRT6 cannot be excluded in hematological malignancies. Elevated level of miR-125b can contribute to adverse prognosis of AML without NPM1 mutation. The prevailment of the tumorsuppressor property of miR-124 may depend on the accompanying genetic alterations.",,"['Gaal, Zsuzsanna', 'Olah, Eva', 'Rejto, Laszlo', 'Balint, Balint Laszlo', 'Csernoch, Laszlo']","['Gaal Z', 'Olah E', 'Rejto L', 'Balint BL', 'Csernoch L']","['Department of Physiology, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt. 98.

Epub 2016 Nov 18.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-1903 [doi],"Purpose: Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors are promising epigenetic agents for the treatment of various subsets of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the resistance of leukemia stem cells (LSC) to BET inhibitors remains a major challenge. In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms underlying LSC resistance to the BET inhibitor JQ1.Experimental Design: We evaluated the levels of apoptosis and autophagy induced by JQ1 in LSC-like leukemia cell lines and primary CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemic blasts obtained from AML cases with normal karyotype without recurrent mutations.Results: JQ1 effectively induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in JQ1-sensitive AML cells. However, in JQ1-resistant AML LSCs, JQ1 induced little apoptosis and led to upregulation of beclin-1, increased LC3-II lipidation, formation of autophagosomes, and downregulation of p62/SQSTM1. Inhibition of autophagy by pharmacologic inhibitors or knockdown of beclin-1 using specific siRNA enhanced JQ1-induced apoptosis in resistant cells, indicating that prosurvival autophagy occurred in these cells. Independent of mTOR signaling, activation of the AMPK (pThr172)/ULK1 (pSer555) pathway was found to be associated with JQ1-induced autophagy in resistant cells. AMPK inhibition using the pharmacologic inhibitor compound C or by knockdown of AMPKalpha suppressed autophagy and promoted JQ1-induced apoptosis in AML LSCs.Conclusions: These findings revealed that prosurvival autophagy was one of the mechanisms involved in the resistance AML LSCs to JQ1. Targeting the AMPK/ULK1 pathway or inhibition of autophagy could be an effective therapeutic strategy for combating resistance to BET inhibitors in AML and other types of cancer.

However, these childhood cancer survivors are at a higher risk for obesity and cardiovascular diseases and for developing these conditions at an earlier age. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe the rationale, conceptual framework, development process, novel components, and delivery plan of a behavioral intervention program for preventing unhealthy weight gain in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: A Web-based program, the Healthy Eating and Active Living (HEAL) program, was designed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers who first identified behaviors that are appropriate targets for weight management in childhood ALL survivors and subsequently developed the intervention components, following core behavioral change strategies grounded in social cognitive and self-determination theories. RESULTS: The Web-based HEAL curriculum has 12 weekly self-guided sessions to increase parents' awareness of the potential impact of cancer treatment on weight and lifestyle habits and the importance of weight management in survivors' long-term health. It empowers parents with knowledge and skills on parenting, nutrition, and physical activity to help them facilitate healthy eating and active living soon after the child completes intensive cancer treatment. Based on social cognitive theory, the program is designed to increase behavioral skills (goal-setting, self-monitoring, and problem-solving) and self-efficacy and to provide positive reinforcement to sustain behavioral change. CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle interventions are a priority for preventing the early onset of obesity and cardiovascular risk factors in childhood cancer survivors. Intervention programs need to meet survivors' targeted behavioral needs, address specific barriers, and capture a sensitive window for behavioral change. In addition, they should be convenient, cost-effective and scalable. Future studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility of introducing weight management early in cancer care and the efficacy of early weight management on survivors' health outcomes.","['(c)Fang Fang Zhang, Susan Meagher, Michael Scheurer, Sara Folta, Emily Finnan,', 'Kerry Criss, Christina Economos, ZoAnn Dreyer, Michael Kelly.

The lymphocytes usually infiltrate the bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and spleen. The diagnosis is established by immunophenotyping circulating B-lymphocytes, and prognosis is defined by two staging systems (Rai and Binet) established by physical examination and blood counts, as well as by several biological and genetic markers. In this update, we present the recommendations from the Brazilian Group of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The following recommendations are based on an extensive literature review with the aim of contributing to more uniform patient care in Brazil and possibly in other countries with a similar social-economic profile.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

Acquired mutations in the gene encoding RNA splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) are highly associated with the MDS subtypes presenting ring sideroblasts, and represent a specific nosological entity. The effects of these mutations on clinical outcomes are diverse and contrasting. METHODS: A cohort of 91 Brazilian MDS patients, including patients with ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow, were screened for mutations in the SF3B1 hotspots (exons 12-15) by direct Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: SF3B1 heterozygous mutations were identified in six patients (7%), all of them with ring sideroblasts, thus confirming the association between SF3B1 mutations and myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes bearing this morphologic feature (frequency of 6/13, p-value<0.0001). CONCLUSION: This is the first screening of SF3B1 mutations in a cohort of Brazilian myelodysplastic syndrome patients. Our findings confirm that mutations in this splicing gene correlate with bone marrow ringed sideroblasts.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

The aim of this study was to define the relevant molecular cytogenetic characteristics of a unique series of early infancy acute myeloid leukemia cases (</=24months old), based on the presence of hemophagocytosis by blast cells at diagnosis. METHODS: A series of 266 infant cases of acute myeloid leukemia was the reference cohort for the present analysis. Acute myeloid leukemia cases with hemophagocytosis by blast cells were reviewed to investigate the presence of the MYST3-CREBBP fusion gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Eleven cases with hemophagocytosis were identified with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis being ruled out. Six cases were classified as myelomonocytic leukemia, three as AML-M7 and two as AML-M2. In five cases, the presence of the MYST3-CREBBP fusion gene identified by molecular cytogenetics was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. All patients received treatment according to the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster acute myeloid leukemia protocols and only one out of the five patients with the MYST3-CREBBP fusion gene is still alive. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the presence of hemophagocytosis in acute myeloid leukemia was not exclusively associated to the MYST3-CREBBP fusion gene. Improvements in molecular cytogenetics may help to elucidate more complex chromosomal rearrangements in infants with acute myeloid leukemia and hemophagocytosis.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

However, there is a significant risk of death during induction due to hemorrhage secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation. This has contributed to a gap in the prognosis of patients between developed and developing countries. The International Consortium on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia was created in 2005 and proposed a treatment protocol based on daunorubicin and all-trans retinoic acid stratified by risk geared toward developing countries. Herein are presented the results from the first patient cohort treated in a single developing country hospital employing a slightly modified version of the International Consortium protocol in a real life setting. Twenty patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were enrolled: 27.8% had low-risk, 55.6% intermediate risk and 16.7% high-risk. The complete remission rate was 94.4% after a median of 42 days. Both relapse rates and death rates were one patient (5.5%) each. No deaths were observed during consolidation. After a median follow-up of 29 months, the overall survival rate was 89.1%. Efficacy and safety of the International Consortium on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia protocol has been reproduced in acute promyelocytic leukemia patients from a developing country.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

BLV infection reduces both animal longevity and milk production and can interfere with normal immune health. With such a high prevalence of BLV infection in dairy herds, it is essential to understand the circumstances by which BLV negatively affects the immune system of infected cattle. To address this question, BLV- and BLV+ adult, lactating Holstein dairy cows were vaccinated with Bovi-Shield GOLD((R)) FP((R)) 5 L5 HB and their immune response to vaccination was measured over the course of 28days. On day 0 prior to vaccination and days 7, 14 and 28 post-vaccination, fresh PBMCs were characterized for T and B cell ratios in the periphery. Plasma was collected to measure titers of IgM, IgG1 and IgG2 produced against bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1), Leptospira hardjo and L. pomona, as well as to characterize neutralizing antibody titers produced against BHV1 and bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2. On day 18 post-vaccination, PBMCs were cultured in the presence of BHV1 and flow cytometry was used to determine IFNgamma production by CD4+, CD8+ and gammadelta T cells and to investigate CD25 and MHCII expression on B cells. BLV+ cows produced significantly lower titers of IgM against BHV1, L. hardjo and L. pomona and produced lower titers of IgG2 against BHV1. gammadelta T cells from BLV+ cows displayed a hyper reactive response to stimulation in vitro, although no differences were observed in CD4+ or CD8+ T cell activation. Finally, B cells from BLV+ cows exhibited higher CD25 expression and reduced MHCII expression in response to stimulation in vitro. All together, data from this study support the hypothesis that BLV+ cows fail to respond to vaccination as strongly as BLV- cows and, consequently, may have reduced protective immunity when compared to healthy BLV- cows.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our previous study has demonstrated that persisting clonally expanded TRDV4 T cells might be relatively beneficial for the outcome of patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, little is known about the distribution and clonality of the TRDV repertoire in T cell receptor (TCR) of gammadelta T cells and their effects on the clinical outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aim of this study was to assess whether the oligoclonal expansion of TCR Vdelta T cells could be used as an immune biomarker for AML outcome. FINDINGS: gammadelta T cells were sorted from the peripheral blood of 30 patients with untreated AML and 12 healthy donors. The complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sizes of eight TCR Vdelta subfamily genes (TRDV1 to TRDV8) were analyzed in sorted gammadelta T cells using RT-PCR and GeneScan. The most frequently expressed TRDV subfamilies in the AML patients were TRDV8 (86.67 %) and TRDV2 (83.33 %), and the frequencies for TRDV1, TRDV3, TRDV4, and TRDV6 were significantly lower than those in healthy individuals. The most frequent clonally expanded TRDV subfamilies in the AML patients included TRDV8 (56.67 %) and TRDV4 (40 %). The clonal expansion frequencies of the TRDV2 and TRDV4 T cells were significantly higher than those in healthy individuals, whereas a significantly lower TRDV1 clonal expansion frequency was observed in those with AML. Moreover, the oligoclones of TRDV4 and TRDV8 were independent protective factors for complete remission. Furthermore, the oligoclonal expansion frequencies of TRDV5 and TRDV6 in patients with relapse were significantly higher than those in non-recurrent cases. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, we characterized for the first time a significant alteration in the distribution and clonality of the TRDV subfamily members in gammadelta T cells sorted from AML patients. Clonally expanded TRDV4 and TRDV8 T cells might contribute to the immune response directed against AML, while oligoclonal TRDV5 and TRDV6 might occur in patients who undergo relapse. While the function of such gammadelta T cell clones requires further investigation, TRDV gammadelta T cell clones might be potential immune biomarkers for AML outcome.",,"['Jin, Zhenyi', 'Luo, Qiang', 'Lu, Shuai', 'Wang, Xinyu', 'He, Zifan', 'Lai, Jing', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Jin Z', 'Luo Q', 'Lu S', 'Wang X', 'He Z', 'Lai J', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Wu X', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China. siulier@163.com.', 'Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com.']",,20161118,,PMC5116135,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Clonality', '*T cell receptor', '*gammadelta T cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that expression of Setbp1 mutants carrying two such mutations in mouse bone marrow progenitors efficiently induced development of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) in irradiated recipient mice with significantly shorter latencies and greater penetrance than expression of wild-type Setbp1, suggesting that these mutations are highly oncogenic. The increased oncogenicity of Setbp1 missense mutants could be due in part to their capability to drive significantly higher target gene transcription. We further identify Myb as a critical mediator of Setbp1-induced self-renewal as its knockdown caused efficient differentiation of myeloid progenitors immortalized by wild-type Setbp1 and Setbp1 missense mutants. Interestingly, Myb is also a direct transcriptional target of Setbp1 and Setbp1 missense mutants as they directly bind to the Myb locus in immortalized cells and dramatically activate a critical enhancer/promoter region of Myb in luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, Myb knockdown in Setbp1 and Setbp1 missense mutations-induced AML cells also efficiently induced their differentiation in culture and significantly prolonged the survival of their secondary recipient mice, suggesting that targeting MYB pathway could be a promising strategy for treating human myeloid neoplasms with SETBP1 activation.",,"['Nguyen, Nhu', 'Vishwakarma, Bandana A', 'Oakley, Kevin', 'Han, Yufen', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Du, Yang']","['Nguyen N', 'Vishwakarma BA', 'Oakley K', 'Han Y', 'Przychodzen B', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Du Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.']","['R01 CA143193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL118281/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC5349915,['NOTNLM'],"['Myb', 'Setbp1', 'myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we reported the isolation of a fully human anti-CD47 blocking antibody, ZF1, from a phage display library. ZF1 displayed high specificity and affinity for CD47 protein, which were comparable to those for humanized anti-CD47 blocking antibody B6H12.

Despite high initial remission rates, prognosis remains poor for most AML patients, especially for those harboring internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the fms-related tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3). Here, we report that a novel epidithiodiketopiperazine, NT1721, potently decreased the cell viability of FLT3-ITD+ AML cell lines, displaying IC50 values in the low nanomolar range, while leaving normal CD34+ bone marrow cells largely unaffected. The IC50 values for NT1721 were significantly lower than those for clinically used AML drugs (i.e. cytarabine, sorafenib) in all tested AML cell lines regardless of their FLT3 mutation status. Moreover, combinations of NT1721 with sorafenib or cytarabine showed better antileukemic effects than the single agents in vitro. Combining cytarabine with NT1721 also attenuated the cytarabine-induced FLT3 ligand surge that has been linked to resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Mechanistically, NT1721 depleted DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein levels, leading to the re-expression of silenced tumor suppressor genes and apoptosis induction. NT1721 concomitantly decreased the expression of EZH2 and BMI1, two genes that are associated with the maintenance of leukemic stem/progenitor cells. In a systemic FLT3-ITD+ AML mouse model, treatment with NT1721 reduced tumor burdens by > 95% compared to the control and significantly increased survival times.

Oncologic vs nononcologic, trauma/injuries vs nontraumatic, infectious (gram-positive, gram-negative, fungal bloodstream infections, common respiratory viruses) vs noninfectious diagnoses were evaluated for survival and LOS. RESULTS: Pediatric intensive care unit admissions (n = 2211) were associated with a mortality of 5.3%. Backward binary logistic regression showed that nonsurvival was associated with leukemia (odds ratio [OR], 4.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-10.10; P < .0005), lymphoma (OR, 21.34; 95% CI, 3.89-117.16; P < .0005), carditis/myocarditis (OR, 7.91; 95% CI, 1.98-31.54; P = .003), encephalitis (OR, 6.93; 95% CI, 3.27-14.67; P < .0005), bloodstream infections with gram-positive organisms (OR, 5.32; 95% CI, 2.67-10.60; P < .0005), gram-negative organisms (OR, 8.23; 95% CI, 4.10-16.53; P < .0005), fungi (OR, 3.93; 95% CI, 1.07-14.42; P = .039), and pneumococcal disease (OR, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.21-8.75; P = .019). Stepwise linear regression revealed that LOS of survivors was associated with bloodstream gram-positive infection (B = 98.2; 95% CI, 75.7-120.7; P < .0005). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diagnoses of leukemia, lymphoma, cardiomyopathy/myocarditits, encephalitis, and comorbidity of bloodstream infections and pneumococcal disease were significantly at risk of PICU mortality. Length of stay of survivors was associated with bloodstream gram-positive infection. The highest odds for death were among patients with leukemia/lymphoma and bloodstream coinfection. As early diagnosis of these childhood malignancies is desirable but not always possible, adequate and early antimicrobial coverage for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria might be the only feasible option to reduce PICU mortality in these patients. In Hong Kong, a subtropical Asian city, none of the common respiratory viruses were associated with increased mortality or LOS in PICU.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

Epub 2016 Nov 29.,10.1002/btpr.2410 [doi],"l-asparaginase (ASNase) is a biopharmaceutical widely used to treat child leukemia. However, it presents some side effects, and in order to provide an alternative biopharmaceutical, in this work, the genes encoding ASNase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc_ASNaseI and Sc_ASNaseII) were cloned in the prokaryotic expression system Escherichia coli. In the 93 different expression conditions tested, the Sc_ASNaseII protein was always obtained as an insoluble and inactive form. However, the Sc_ASNaseI (His)6 -tagged recombinant protein was produced in large amounts in the soluble fraction of the protein extract. Affinity chromatography was performed on a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system using Ni(2+) -charged, HiTrap Immobilized Metal ion Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) FF in order to purify active Sc_ASNaseI recombinant protein. The results suggest that the strategy for the expression and purification of this potential new biopharmaceutical protein with lower side effects was efficient since high amounts of soluble Sc_ASNaseI with high specific activity (110.1 +/- 0.3 IU mg(-1) ) were obtained. In addition, the use of FPLC-IMAC proved to be an efficient tool in the purification of this enzyme, since a good recovery (40.50 +/- 0.01%) was achieved with a purification factor of 17-fold.

Inspired by this and similar findings, we evaluated a set of quinacrine analogues against gastric (MKN-28), colon (Caco-2), and breast (MFC-7) cancer cell lines and one normal human fibroblast cell line (HFF-1). All the compounds, previously developed by us as dual-stage antimalarial leads, displayed antiproliferative activity, and one of the set stood out as selective toward the gastric cancer cell line, MKN-28. Interestingly, this compound was transported across an in vitro MKN-28 model cell line in low amounts, and approximately 80 % was trapped inside those cells. Nuclear targeting of the same compound and its interactions with calf thymus DNA were assessed through combined fluorescence microscopy, spectroscopy, and calorimetry studies, which provided evidence for the compound's ability to reach the nucleus and to interact with DNA.","['(c) 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

As ubiquitous, motile and highly phagocytic immune cells, macrophages are principal players in the phagocytic removal of host cells throughout the body. In recent years, great strides have been made in identifying the molecular mechanisms that control the recognition and phagocytosis of cells by macrophages. However, much less is known about the physical and metabolic constraints that govern the amount of cellular material macrophages can ingest and how these limitations affect the overall efficiency of host cell clearance in health and disease. In this review we will discuss, in the contexts of apoptotic cells and antibody-targeted malignant cells, how physical and metabolic factors associated with the internalization of host cells are relayed to the phagocytic machinery and how these signals can impact the overall efficiency of cell clearance. We also discuss how this information can be leveraged to increase cell clearance for beneficial therapeutic outcomes.",['(c) 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],"['Zent, Clive S', 'Elliott, Michael R']","['Zent CS', 'Elliott MR']","['Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, NY, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, NY, USA.', 'David H.

Epub 2016 Nov 10.,10.1002/pbc.26344 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Cranial radiation and glucocorticoids are associated with an increase in body mass index (BMI) z-score in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We aimed to investigate the impact of a contemporary treatment protocol that omitted prophylactic cranial radiation and glucocorticoids from the maintenance phase on longitudinal BMI, height, and weight z-scores in children with ALL. METHOD: We retrospectively studied 184 children with standard- and medium-risk ALL treated without cranial radiation or glucocorticoids. Height, weight, and BMI z-scores were collected from diagnosis to 7 years after diagnosis. Longitudinal changes in anthropometric data were compared to diagnosis using separate linear mixed models, adjusting for age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES). RESULTS: Relative to diagnosis, there was a significant increase in estimated marginal mean BMI z-score during dexamethasone-containing re-induction (1.08, P < 0.001) that persisted throughout intensification (0.85, P < 0.001) and maintenance phases (0.81, P < 0.001), and up to 7 years after diagnosis (0.76, P = 0.002). Height z-scores decreased over the same time (P < 0.001), whereas weight z-scores fluctuated during treatment and declined thereafter (P = 0.007). A higher BMI z-score at diagnosis was associated with a younger age (P < 0.001), male sex (P < 0.001), and lower SES (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Children who did not receive cranial radiation or glucocorticoids during maintenance remain at increased risk of treatment-related increases in BMI z-score, which is associated with a loss of height z-score. Interventions designed to mediate this risk should begin early, even while children are on treatment because of the association with cardiovascular risk. Monitoring of survivors of ALL should include anthropometric measures.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Touyz, Lauren M', 'Cohen, Jennifer', 'Neville, Kristen A', 'Wakefield, Claire E', 'Garnett, Sarah P', 'Mallitt, Kylie-Ann', 'Grech, Allison M', 'Cohn, Richard J']","['Touyz LM', 'Cohen J', 'Neville KA', 'Wakefield CE', 'Garnett SP', 'Mallitt KA', 'Grech AM', 'Cohn RJ']","[""Discipline of Paediatrics, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Center, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""Discipline of Paediatrics, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Center, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""Department of Nutrition & Dietetics, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""Discipline of Paediatrics, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Center, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""Discipline of Paediatrics, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Center, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""Institute of Endocrinology and Diabetes, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, Australia."", ""The Children's Hospital at Westmead Clinical School, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia."", ""Discipline of Paediatrics, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Discipline of Paediatrics, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Center, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia."", ""Discipline of Paediatrics, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Center, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Australia.""]",,20161110,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*body mass index', '*glucocorticoids', '*overweight', '*pediatric', '*precursor cell lymphoblastic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, little is known about patients' experiences with AML. We used qualitative methods to learn about their experiences with diagnosis and treatment decision-making to identify areas for improvement. METHODS: We recruited hospitalized patients with AML to participate in semi-structured qualitative interviews about their experiences being diagnosed with AML, receiving information, and making a treatment decision. Interviews were conducted during their hospitalization for induction chemotherapy. We analyzed data by using a constant comparison approach. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients completed an interview. Four main themes emerged: (a) shock and suddenness, (b) difficulty processing information, (c) poor communication, and (d) uncertainty. Patients frequently described their diagnosis as shocking. They also felt that the amount of information was too great and too difficult to process, which negatively impacted their understanding. Patients frequently described a lack of emotional support from clinicians and described uncertainty about their prognosis, the number and nature of available treatments, and what to expect from treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Acute myeloid leukemia poses a sudden, emotionally challenging, information-laden situation, where little time is available to make important decisions. This results in difficulty processing information and is sometimes complicated by a lack of emotive communication from clinicians. Results indicate a need for targeted interventions to improve AML patients' understanding of illness and treatment options and to address their traumatic experiences around diagnosis.","['Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['LeBlanc, Thomas W', 'Fish, Laura J', 'Bloom, Catherine T', 'El-Jawahri, Areej', 'Davis, Debra M', 'Locke, Susan C', 'Steinhauser, Karen E', 'Pollak, Kathryn I']","['LeBlanc TW', 'Fish LJ', 'Bloom CT', 'El-Jawahri A', 'Davis DM', 'Locke SC', 'Steinhauser KE', 'Pollak KI']","['Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.']",,20161219,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cancer', 'oncology', 'palliative care', 'qualitative research', 'supportive care']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 15.,10.1002/biof.1340 [doi],"The modulation of H2 O2 production by NADPH oxidase (Nox), on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulation, affects the redox signaling linked to cancer cell proliferation. H2 O2 signal transduction involves reversible oxidation of thiol proteins, leading to the formation of cysteine sulfenic acids, responsible for the temporary inactivation of many phosphatases. These events imply that H2 O2 reaches its intracellular targets. As Aquaporin-8 (AQP8) has been demonstrated to funnel Nox-produced H2 O2 across the plasma membrane, this study aims to elucidate the role of AQP8 in the redox signaling occurring in human leukaemia B1647 cells that constitutively produce VEGF. AQP8 overexpression or silencing resulted in the modulation of VEGF ability of increasing or decreasing, respectively, H2 O2 intracellular level. Moreover, data obtained by a dimedone-based immunochemical method for sulfenic acid detection demonstrate that the expression of AQP8 can modulate the amplitude of downstream events, altering the activity of redox-sensitive targets. In particular, AQP8 affected VEGF-induced redox signaling by increasing the sulfenation of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which resulted in its inactivation and, in turn, caused Akt activation. Therefore, the dimedone-based method for easily monitoring cellular protein sulfenation allowed to demonstrate, for the first time, the role of AQP8 on the fine tune of cysteine oxidation in target proteins involved in leukaemia cell proliferation pathways.

Epub 2016 Dec 1.,10.1111/ejh.12826 [doi],"INTRODUCTION: Outcome of patients with standard-risk (SR) multiple myeloma (MM) has improved; however, subsets of patients do worse than expected. We sought to identify the factors associated with inferior outcome. METHODS: We evaluated 51 patients with SR MM that received upfront autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) after induction and had a progression-free survival (PFS) of </=18 months. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 61 yr. Forty-one (80%) patients received induction with immunomodulatory drugs, proteosome inhibitors, or combination of both. The overall response rate (ORR) after auto-HCT was 96% (stringent complete response 23%, complete response 10%, very good partial response 22%, and partial response 39%). The median PFS was 7.8, and median overall survival (OS) was 56.3 months. On univariate analysis, concurrent light-chain amyloidosis (AL) was associated with inferior PFS [hematological response (HR); 2.51, 95% CI; 0.64-10.58, P = 0.03] and occurrence of soft tissue plasmacytoma was associated with a significantly shorter OS (HR: 3.05, 95% CI: 0.57-16.29, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that concurrent AL and soft tissue plasmacytoma were associated with shorter PFS and OS, respectively. Heterogeneity in clinical outcome of SR MM merits better tools for prognostication, such as gene expression profiling and minimal residual disease assessment to identify high-risk patients.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

One strategy to extend progression-free survival and long-term survival might be the establishment of consolidation therapies. METHODS: In this trial, patients with complete or partial second remission after fludarabine-based treatment received consolidation therapy with alemtuzumab. The aim of this phase I/II trial was to determine the maximal tolerable dose (MTD) of alemtuzumab consolidation and to evaluate safety and efficacy in patients who responded to second-line fludarabine-based treatment. Thirteen patients in complete (CR) or partial remission (PR) received alemtuzumab dose escalation starting with 10 mg intravenously (iv) once weekly for 8 wk and increasing in 10-mg intervals per dose level. RESULTS: The main dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were infectious complications, and the MTD was determined at 10 mg. After alemtuzumab consolidation, seven of 13 patients (53%) were in CR, and four of these patients (30.7%) achieved minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity (<1 x 10E-4). At a median follow-up of 71.5 months, four patients were progression-free, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 28.5 months after the end of second-line treatment. CONCLUSION: The results provide a safe and efficient schedule with weekly intravenous application of 10 mg of alemtuzumab as a consolidation regime in patients with CLL.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We compared induction mortality, acuity of illness prior to chemotherapy, and insurance type between Black and White patients to assess whether acuity of presentation mediates the disparity. Within a retrospective cohort of 1,122 children with AML treated with two courses of standard induction chemotherapy between 2004 and 2014 in the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database, the association between race (Black versus White) and inpatient mortality during induction was examined. Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-level resource utilization during the first 72 hours following admission for initial AML chemotherapy was evaluated as a potential mediator. The total effect of race on mortality during Induction I revealed a strong association (unadjusted HR 2.75, CI: 1.18, 6.41). Black patients had a significantly higher unadjusted risk of requiring ICU-level resources within the first 72 hours after initial presentation (17% versus 11%; RR 1.52, CI: 1.04, 2.24). Mediation analyses revealed the indirect effect of race through acuity accounted for 61% of the relative excess mortality during Induction I. Publicly insured patients experienced greater induction mortality than privately insured patients regardless of race. Black patients with AML have significantly greater risk of induction mortality and are at increased risk for requiring ICU-level resources soon after presentation. Higher acuity amongst Black patients accounts for a substantial portion of the relative excess mortality during Induction I. Targeting factors affecting acuity of illness at presentation may lessen racial disparities in AML induction mortality.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Winestone, Lena E', 'Getz, Kelly D', 'Miller, Tamara P', 'Wilkes, Jennifer J', 'Sack, Leah', 'Li, Yimei', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Epstein, Andrew J', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Winestone LE', 'Getz KD', 'Miller TP', 'Wilkes JJ', 'Sack L', 'Li Y', 'Huang YS', 'Seif AE', 'Bagatell R', 'Fisher BT', 'Epstein AJ', 'Aplenc R']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.', ""Healthcare Analytics Unit, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.', ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Infectious Diseases, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.', 'Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of General Internal Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.', ""Department of Veterans Affairs' Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion, Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.']","['L40 CA220923/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD060550/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",20161207,,PMC5733783,,,,,,['NIHMS924633'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most T-cell responses to HHV-6 have been characterized using peripheral blood from healthy adults; however, the role of HHV-6 infection in immune modulation has not been elucidated for some diseases. Therefore, in this study the immune response to HHV-6 infection in patients with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) was analyzed. HHV-6 load was quantified in blood samples taken at the time of diagnosis of leukemia and on remission. The same concentrations of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, IL-17a, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) were detected in plasma samples from 20 patients with and 20 without detectable HHV-6 virus loads in blood. Characterization of T-cell responses to HHV-6 showed low specific T-cells frequencies of 2.08% and 1.46% in patients with and without detectable viral loads, respectively. IFN-gamma-producing T cells were detected in 0.03%-0.23% and in 0%-0.2% of CD4+T cells, respectively. Strong production of IL-6 was detected in medium supernatants of challenged T-cells whatever the HHV-6 status of the patients (973.51 +/- 210.06 versus 825.70 +/- 210.81 pg/mL). However, concentrations of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma were low. Thus, no association between plasma concentrations of cytokines and detection of HHV-6 in blood was identified, suggesting that HHV-6 is not strongly associated with development of B-ALL. The low viral loads detected may correspond with latently infected cells. Alternatively, HHV-6B specific immune responses may be below the detection threshold of the assays used.","['(c) 2016 The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Nefzi, Faten', 'Lambert, Claude', 'Gautheret-Dejean, Agnes', 'Fisson, Sylvain', 'Khebizi, Quentin', 'Khelif, Abderrahim', 'Agut, Henri', 'Aouni, Mahjoub']","['Nefzi F', 'Lambert C', 'Gautheret-Dejean A', 'Fisson S', 'Khebizi Q', 'Khelif A', 'Agut H', 'Aouni M']","['Laboratory of Transmissible Diseases and Biological Active Substances, LR99ES27, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Monastir, Street Avicenne 5000, Monastir, Tunisia.', 'Immunology Laboratory, Georges Friedel Laboratory (CNRS UMR5307); University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, 44 Rue Pointe Cadet, 42100 Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Sorbonne University, Pierre and Marie Curie University, Center for Immunology and Infectious Diseases of Paris (UMRS CR7), Persistent Viral Infections Team, 4 Jussieu Place, 75005, Paris, France.', 'Public Assistance-Hospitals of Paris, University Hospitals Pitie Salpetriere-Charles Foix, Virology Service, 3 Avenue Victoria, 75004 Paris, France.', ""INSERM U951, University of Evry Val d'Essonne, UMR_S951, Genethon, F-91002 Evry, France."", ""INSERM U951, University of Evry Val d'Essonne, UMR_S951, Genethon, F-91002 Evry, France."", 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Farhat Hached Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Sorbonne University, Pierre and Marie Curie University, Center for Immunology and Infectious Diseases of Paris (UMRS CR7), Persistent Viral Infections Team, 4 Jussieu Place, 75005, Paris, France.', 'Public Assistance-Hospitals of Paris, University Hospitals Pitie Salpetriere-Charles Foix, Virology Service, 3 Avenue Victoria, 75004 Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Transmissible Diseases and Biological Active Substances, LR99ES27, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Monastir, Street Avicenne 5000, Monastir, Tunisia.']",,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*T cell responses', '*cytokines', '*human herpesvirus-6']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an earlier prospective cohort analysis within the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS), we observed a 31% higher risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) among participants with severe periodontal disease at baseline. Here, we extend the study with an additional 8 years of follow-up, and conduct analyses with updated periodontal disease status and NHL subtypes. The HPFS is an ongoing prospective cohort study of 51,529 men in the USA Between baseline in 1986 and 2012, 875 cases of NHL were diagnosed, including 290 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas (CLL/SLL), 85 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 91 follicular lymphomas. We performed multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations of interest. History of periodontal disease at baseline was positively associated with risk of NHL overall (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.49) and CLL/SLL (HR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.04-1.90). With updated periodontal status, HRs were 1.30 (95% CI: 1.11-1.51) for NHL overall and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.08-1.84) for CLL/SLL. In contrast, after adjusting for periodontal disease, tooth loss was inversely associated with NHL, suggesting that other causes or consequences of tooth loss may have different implications for NHL etiology. Our findings suggest that periodontal disease is a risk factor for NHL. Whether periodontal disease is a direct or indirect cause of NHL, or is a marker of underlying systemic inflammation and/or immune dysregulation, warrants further investigation.",['(c) 2016 UICC.'],"['Bertrand, Kimberly A', 'Shingala, Janki', 'Evens, Andrew', 'Birmann, Brenda M', 'Giovannucci, Edward', 'Michaud, Dominique S']","['Bertrand KA', 'Shingala J', 'Evens A', 'Birmann BM', 'Giovannucci E', 'Michaud DS']","['Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University, Boston, MA.', 'Tufts University, Medford, MA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA.', ""Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Departments of Nutrition and Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

Patients were grouped by line of therapy at enrolment (LOT). We describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of, and practice patterns for, patients with CLL enrolled in this treatment registry, providing patient-level observational data that represent real-world experiences in the USA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed on 49.3% of patients at enrolment. The most common genetic abnormalities detected by FISH were del(13q) and trisomy 12 (45.7% and 20.8%, respectively). Differences in disease characteristics and comorbidities were observed between patients enrolled in LOT1 and combined LOT2/>/=3 cohorts. Important trends observed include the infrequent use of genetic prognostic testing, and differences in patient characteristics for patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy combinations.

The assay targeted Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, Blastocystis hominis, Dientamoeba fragilis, Clonorchis sinensis, Metagonimus yokogawai, and Gymnophalloides seoi. Performance characteristics were evaluated based on recovery after DNA extraction, analytical sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, cross-reactivity, and interference characteristics. Clinical performance was validated against microscopy on 123 diarrheal samples. The assay demonstrated strong correlations between DNA concentrations and Ct values (R2, 0.9924-0.9998), and had a high PCR efficiency (83.3%-109.5%). Polymerase chain reactions detected as few as 10-30 copies of genomic DNA, and coefficient of variance was 0-7%. There was no cross-reactivity to the other 54 microorganisms tested. Interference occurred only in presence of high concentrations of erythrocytes or leukocytes. This assay had a higher correct identification rate (100.0% vs. 90.2%) and lower incorrect ID rate (0.0% vs. 9.8%) when compared to microscopy.

However, there have been limited data to evaluate the trend of TNBC research. This study aims to investigate the trend of TNBC research and compare the contribution of research from different regions, organizations, and authors. METHODS: TNBC-related publications from 2007 to 2015 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. Excel 2013 (Redmond, Washington, USA), GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA), and VOSviewer (Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands) software were used to analyze the trend of TNBC research. This article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors. RESULTS: A total of 1695 papers were identified and were cited 34,078 times with a time limit of May 27, 2016. The United States accounted for 43.10% of the articles, 57.59% of the citations, and the highest H-index (64). China ranked second in total number of articles, but seventh in citation frequency (1998) and ninth in H-index (21). The journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment had the highest number of publications. The author, Narod SA, has published the most papers in this field (30). The keyword ""receptor"" was mentioned the most, 1489 times, and the word ""myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1)"" was the latest hot spot by 2015. CONCLUSION: Literature growth related to TNBC is expanding rapidly in recent years. The quality of the articles from China still requires improvement. Newest progress of the TNBC research may be released by the journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment first.

Reasons behind sex differences in childhood ALL risk are unknown. In the present genome-wide association study (GWAS), we explored the genetic basis of sex differences by comparing genotype frequencies between male and female cases in a case-only study to assess effect-modification by sex.The case-only design included 236 incident cases of childhood ALL consecutively recruited at the Texas Children's Cancer Center in Houston, Texas from 2007 to 2012. All cases were non-Hispanic whites, aged 1 to 10 years, and diagnosed with confirmed B-cell precursor ALL. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina HumanCoreExome BeadChip on the Illumina Infinium platform. Besides the top 100 statistically most significant results, results were also analyzed by the top 100 highest effect size with a nominal statistical significance (P <0.05).The statistically most significant sex-specific association (P = 4 x 10) was with the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4813720 (RASSF2), an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for RASSF2 in peripheral blood. rs4813720 is also a strong methylation QTL (meQTL) for a CpG site (cg22485289) within RASSF2 in pregnancy, at birth, childhood, and adolescence. cg22485289 is one of the hypomethylated CpG sites in ALL compared with pre-B cells. Two missense SNPs, rs12722042 and 12722039, in the HLA-DQA1 gene yielded the highest effect sizes (odds ratio [OR] approximately 14; P <0.01) for sex-specific results. The HLA-DQA1 SNPs belong to DQA1*01 and confirmed the previously reported male-specific association with DQA1*01. This finding supports the proposed infection-related etiology in childhood ALL risk for males. Further analyses revealed that most SNPs (either direct effect or through linkage disequilibrium) were within active enhancers or active promoter regions and had regulatory effects on gene expression levels.Cumulative data suggested that RASSF2 rs4813720, which correlates with increased RASSF2 expression, may counteract the suppressor effect of estrogen-regulated miR-17-92 on RASSF2 resulting in protection in males. Given the amount of sex hormone-related mechanisms suggested by our findings, future studies should examine prenatal or early postnatal programming by sex hormones when hormone levels show a large variation.",,"['Singh, Sandeep K', 'Lupo, Philip J', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Saxena, Anshul', 'Kennedy, Amy E', 'Ibrahimou, Boubakari', 'Barbieri, Manuel Alejandro', 'Mills, Ken I', 'McCauley, Jacob L', 'Okcu, Mehmet Fatih', 'Dorak, Mehmet Tevfik']","['Singh SK', 'Lupo PJ', 'Scheurer ME', 'Saxena A', 'Kennedy AE', 'Ibrahimou B', 'Barbieri MA', 'Mills KI', 'McCauley JL', 'Okcu MF', 'Dorak MT']","[""Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work, Florida International University, Miami, FL Department of Biological Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Texas Children's Cancer Center Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX Department of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work, Florida International University, Miami, FL Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD Department of Biostatistics, Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work, Florida International University, Miami, FL Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (CCRCB), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK Dr. John T.

However, an increased risk of secondary primary malignancies (SPMs), including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has been described in patients receiving lenalidomide. In order to assess the incidence and features of this complication, we reviewed 195 patients with RRMM treated with Len-dex at our institution. The median follow-up time from diagnosis of MM was 73 months (10-234 months) and from initiation of Len-dex was 19 months (1-104 months). The median duration of Len-dex for all patients was 7.8 months (range 1-90 months). The incidence rate (IR) for all SPMs from start of Len-dex was 2.37 per 100 patient-years, which reflected an IR of 1.29 for MDS/AML and 1.08 for nonhematologic malignancies (NHM). MDS was the most common SPM noted. The cumulative IR of SPM at 5 years was 1.54% from the time of MM diagnosis and 5.24% from starting Len-dex. Multivariable cumulative incidence of SPM analysis identified older age (P = 0.005) and prior number of regimens (P = 0.026) as adverse risk factors. We found more concomitant G-CSF use (P = 0.029) in patients with MDS/AML, however, causal association is not clear. The progression-free survival after Len-dex was the longest for patients in MDS/AML group, and the 5-year overall survival did not differ among groups. Although the rate of SPM was relatively low with Len-dex, concomitant G-CSF should be used judiciously and patients receiving this regimen should be observed for the development of this complication.",['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Epub 2017 Jan 23.,10.1111/cmi.12708 [doi],"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) target promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) during infectious entry and PML protein is important for efficient transcription of incoming viral genome. However, the transcriptional down regulation was shown to be promoter-independent in that heterologous promoters delivered by papillomavirus particles were also affected. To further investigate the role of PML protein in HPV entry, we used small hairpin RNA to knockdown PML protein in HaCaT keratinocytes. Confirming previous findings, PML knockdown in HaCaT cells reduced HPV16 transcript levels significantly following infectious entry without impairing binding and trafficking. However, when we quantified steady-state levels of pseudogenomes in interphase cells, we found strongly reduced genome levels compared with parental HaCaT cells. Because nuclear delivery was comparable in both cell lines, we conclude that viral pseudogenome must be removed after successful nuclear delivery. Transcriptome analysis by gene array revealed that PML knockdown in clonal HaCaT cells was associated with a constitutive interferon response. Abrogation of JAK1/2 signaling prevented genome loss, however, did not restore viral transcription. In contrast, knockdown of PML protein in HeLa cells did not affect HPV genome delivery and transcription. HeLa cells are transformed by HPV18 oncogenes E6 and E7, which have been shown to interfere with the JAK/Stat signaling pathway. Our data imply that PML NBs protect incoming HPV genomes. Furthermore, they provide evidence that PML NBs are key regulators of the innate immune response in keratinocytes. IMPORTANCE: Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) are important for antiviral defense. Many DNA viruses target these subnuclear structures and reorganize them. Reorganization of PML NBs by viral proteins is important for establishment of infection. In contrast, HPVs require the presence of PML protein for efficient transcription of incoming viral genome. Our finding that PML protein prevents the loss of HPV genome following infection implies that the host cell may be able to recognize chromatinized HPV genome or the associated capsid proteins. A constitutively active interferon response in absence of PML protein suggests that PML NBs are key regulators of the innate immune response in keratinocytes.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Bienkowska-Haba, Malgorzata', 'Luszczek, Wioleta', 'Keiffer, Timothy R', 'Guion, Lucile G M', 'DiGiuseppe, Stephen', 'Scott, Rona S', 'Sapp, Martin']","['Bienkowska-Haba M', 'Luszczek W', 'Keiffer TR', 'Guion LGM', 'DiGiuseppe S', 'Scott RS', 'Sapp M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular Tumor Virology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, LSU Health Shreveport, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular Tumor Virology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, LSU Health Shreveport, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular Tumor Virology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, LSU Health Shreveport, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular Tumor Virology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, LSU Health Shreveport, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular Tumor Virology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, LSU Health Shreveport, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular Tumor Virology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, LSU Health Shreveport, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular Tumor Virology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, LSU Health Shreveport, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA.']","['P30 GM110703/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI081809/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE025565/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",20170123,,PMC5382090,,,,,,['NIHMS830573'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 11.,10.1002/stem.2529 [doi],"Molecular mechanisms governing maintenance, commitment, and differentiation of stem cells are largely unexploited. Molecules involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes are of particular importance for stem cell physiology, as they integrate different signals and coordinate cellular decisions related with self-renewal and fate determination. Geminin has emerged as a critical factor in DNA replication and stem cell differentiation in different stem cell populations. Its inhibitory interaction with Cdt1, a member of the prereplicative complex, ensures the controlled timing of DNA replication and, consequently, genomic stability in actively proliferating cells. In embryonic as well as somatic stem cells, Geminin has been shown to interact with transcription factors and epigenetic regulators to drive gene expression programs and ultimately guide cell fate decisions. An ever-growing number of studies suggests that these interactions of Geminin and proteins regulating transcription are conserved among metazoans. Interactions between Geminin and proteins modifying the epigenome, such as members of the repressive Polycomb group and the SWI/SNF proteins of the permissive Trithorax, have long been established. The complexity of these interactions, however, is only just beginning to unravel, revealing key roles on maintaining stem cell self-renewal and fate specification. In this review, we summarize current knowledge and give new perspectives for the role of Geminin on transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, alongside with its regulatory activity in DNA replication and their implication in the regulation of stem and progenitor cell biology.

Epub 2016 Nov 18.,10.1002/ajhb.22936 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: Low birthweight is associated with a decreased risk of childhood leukemia and an increased risk of both cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in adult life. Possible biological mediators include systemic innate immunity and inflammation. We tested the hypothesis that birthweight was inversely associated with serum high sensitivity C reactive protein assay (hsCRP), a measure of both innate immunity and systemic inflammation. METHODS: Data on birthweight and current anthropometric measures along with a range of exposures were collected at 1 and 3 years of age in a population-based cohort study of young children living in Havana, Cuba. A total of 986 children aged 3-years-old provided blood samples that were analyzed for serum hsCRP levels. RESULTS: Nearly 49% of children had detectable hsCRP levels in their serum. Lower birthweight was linearly associated with the natural log of hsCRP levels (beta coefficient -0.70 mg L(-1) per kg increase in birthweight, 95% CI: -1.34 to -0.06). This was attenuated but still present after adjustment for the child's sex and municipality (-0.65 mg L(-1) per kg birthweight; 95% CI: -1.38 to +0.08). There were no associations between growth from birth or anthropometric measures at 3 years and systemic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Birthweight was inversely associated with serum hsCRP levels in children aged 3 years living in Cuba. These observations provide a potential mechanism that is present at the age of 3 years to explain the association between low birthweight and both decreased childhood leukemia and increased cardiovascular disease in adults.","['(c) 2016 The Authors American Journal of Human Biology Published by Wiley', 'Periodicals, Inc.']","['Josefina Venero-Fernandez, Silvia', 'Fundora-Hernandez, Hermes', 'Batista-Gutierrez, Lourdes', 'Suarez-Medina, Ramon', 'de la C Mora-Faife, Esperanza', 'Garcia-Garcia, Gladys', 'Del Valle-Infante, Ileana', 'Gomez-Marrero, Liem', 'Britton, John', 'Fogarty, Andrew W']","['Josefina Venero-Fernandez S', 'Fundora-Hernandez H', 'Batista-Gutierrez L', 'Suarez-Medina R', 'de la C Mora-Faife E', 'Garcia-Garcia G', 'Del Valle-Infante I', 'Gomez-Marrero L', 'Britton J', 'Fogarty AW']","['Instituto Nacional de Higiene, Epidemiologia y Microbiologia, Infanta No 1158 e/ Llinas y Clavel, Codigo Postal 10300, La Habana, Cuba.', 'Instituto Nacional de Higiene, Epidemiologia y Microbiologia, Infanta No 1158 e/ Llinas y Clavel, Codigo Postal 10300, La Habana, Cuba.', 'Instituto Nacional de Higiene, Epidemiologia y Microbiologia, Infanta No 1158 e/ Llinas y Clavel, Codigo Postal 10300, La Habana, Cuba.', 'Instituto Nacional de Higiene, Epidemiologia y Microbiologia, Infanta No 1158 e/ Llinas y Clavel, Codigo Postal 10300, La Habana, Cuba.', 'Instituto Nacional de Higiene, Epidemiologia y Microbiologia, Infanta No 1158 e/ Llinas y Clavel, Codigo Postal 10300, La Habana, Cuba.', 'Instituto Nacional de Higiene, Epidemiologia y Microbiologia, Infanta No 1158 e/ Llinas y Clavel, Codigo Postal 10300, La Habana, Cuba.', 'Instituto Nacional de Higiene, Epidemiologia y Microbiologia, Infanta No 1158 e/ Llinas y Clavel, Codigo Postal 10300, La Habana, Cuba.', 'Instituto Nacional de Higiene, Epidemiologia y Microbiologia, Infanta No 1158 e/ Llinas y Clavel, Codigo Postal 10300, La Habana, Cuba.', 'Nottingham Biomedical Research Unit, Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, Clinical Sciences Building, City Hospital, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, United Kingdom.', 'Nottingham Biomedical Research Unit, Division of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham, Clinical Sciences Building, City Hospital, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, United Kingdom.']","['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '090375/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",20161118,,PMC5484324,['NOTNLM'],"['Cuba', 'birthweight', 'children', 'inflammation']",,,"['HINASIC (Historia Natural de la Sibilancia en Cuba/Natural History of Wheezing in', 'Cuba) Study Group']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twelve patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were enrolled in this Phase 1, open-label, fixed-sequence study. Patients received a single 50 mg dose of venetoclax orally on Day 1 and Day 8, and a 400 mg once daily dose of ketoconazole on Days 5-11. Blood samples were collected predose and up to 96 h after each venetoclax dose on Day 1 and Day 8. RESULTS: Eleven patients had evaluable pharmacokinetic data and were therefore included in the statistical analyses. Compared to administration of a single 50 mg dose of venetoclax alone, ketoconazole increased the venetoclax mean maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUCinfinity ) by 2.3-fold (90% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0-2.7) and 6.4-fold (90% CI: 4.5-9.2; range: 2- to 12-fold), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Coadministration of venetoclax with multiple doses of ketoconazole resulted in a significant increase of venetoclax exposures, strongly suggesting that CYP3A plays a major role in elimination of venetoclax in patients. These results suggest the need to avoid concomitant use with strong and moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A during the venetoclax ramp-up phase in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients. For patients who have completed the ramp-up phase, a modification in venetoclax dose for use with strong and moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A is recommended.",['(c) 2016 The British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Agarwal, Suresh K', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Danilov, Alexey V', 'Hu, Beibei', 'Puvvada, Soham', 'Gutierrez, Martin', 'Chien, David', 'Lewis, Lionel D', 'Wong, Shekman L']","['Agarwal SK', 'Salem AH', 'Danilov AV', 'Hu B', 'Puvvada S', 'Gutierrez M', 'Chien D', 'Lewis LD', 'Wong SL']","['Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Medicine, The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth and The Norris Cotton Cancer Center at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, Arizona, USA.', 'The Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth and The Norris Cotton Cancer Center at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20170118,,PMC5346863,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCL-2', '*drug-drug interaction', '*ketoconazole', '*pharmacokinetics', '*venetoclax']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9261-1583'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is associated with increased risk of several cancer types, including colon, breast, endometrium, liver, kidney, esophagus, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, and leukemia, and can also lead to poorer treatment. We review here the epidemiological and experimental evidences for the association between obesity and cancer. Specifically, we discuss potential mechanisms focusing how dysfunctional angiogenesis, chronic inflammation, interaction of proinflammatory cytokines, endocrine hormones, and adipokines including leptin, adiponectin insulin, growth factors, estrogen, and progesterone and strikingly, cell metabolism alteration in obesity participate in tumor development and progression, resistance to chemotherapy, and targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic and immune therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Tahergorabi, Zoya', 'Khazaei, Majid', 'Moodi, Mitra', 'Chamani, Elham']","['Tahergorabi Z', 'Khazaei M', 'Moodi M', 'Chamani E']","['Department of Physiology, Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.', 'Department of Physiology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.']",,20161109,,,['NOTNLM'],"['adipose tissue', 'cancer', 'mechanism', 'obesity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A girl with MLL/AF10 AML was found to carry PTPN11(G503A) . To study the impact of PTPN11(G503A) cooperating with MLL/AF10 on leukemogenesis, we established a retroviral transduction/transplantation mouse model. Compared to the MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) leukemia cells harboring PTPN11(wt) , the cells harboring PTPN11(G503A) were hypersensitive to GM-CSF and IL3, and more resistant to death upon treatment with daunorubicin but sensitive to cytarabine. The cells harboring PTPN11(G503A) autonomously differentiated into macrophages (1.8%) in the medium containing IL3. Further studies showed that the cells had an elevated ( approximately 2.9-fold) Csf1 transcription level and secreted more ( approximately 4.5-fold) M-CSF to the medium which can stimulate monocyte/macrophage differentiation of BM cells. Mice transplanted with the cells harboring PTPN11(G503A) had a higher concentration of M-CSF in plasma. When mixed with the MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) leukemia cells harboring PTPN11(wt) , the cells harboring PTPN11(G503A) had an increased competitive engraftment and clonal expansion in the BM and spleen of recipient mice, although no competitive growth advantage was observed in the in vitro co-culturing assays. The mice transplanted with the MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) cells harboring PTPN11(wt) developed myelomonocytic leukemia, while those transplanted with the cells harboring PTPN11(G503A) -induced monocytic leukemia in a shorter latency.

Epub 2016 Nov 2.,10.1002/cncr.30427 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen-E (HLA-E) is a nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I molecule that recently came into sharper focus as a putative marker of advanced tumor stages and disease progression. In solid tumors, increased HLA-E expression as well as elevated soluble HLA-E (sHLA-E) plasma levels are associated with a poor prognosis; however, a role for HLA-E in hematologic malignancies remains to be established. METHODS: The authors analyzed HLA-E alleles and sHLA-E levels in a cohort of 110 individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). RESULTS: In patients with CLL, levels of sHLA-E increased with advanced disease stage (P = .01) and decreased after therapy (P = .01). Longitudinal follow-up revealed that both HLA-E*01:03 alleles and high levels of sHLA-E were significantly associated with a requirement for early treatment in patients with CLL (P = .027 and P = .023, respectively). In vitro, sHLA-E inhibited degranulation and interferon-gamma production by natural killer (NK) cells when cocultivated with tumor cells. Moreover, sHLA-E loaded onto microspheres induced transforming growth factor-beta release by NK cells. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of at least 1 HLA-E*01:03 allele was an independent predictor of a requirement for early treatment. CONCLUSIONS: HLA-E alleles and sHLA-E levels may represent novel biomarkers for early disease progression in patients with CLL. Cancer 2017;123:814-23.

This study aimed to examine the expression and function of SOX12 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) using human myeloid leukaemia samples and the acute myeloid cell line THP1. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the bone marrow of AML patients and healthy donors. SOX12 expression in haematopoietic cells was evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SOX12 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were transduced into THP1 cells, and gene knockdown was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. SOX12 was preferentially expressed in CD34(+) cells in AML patients. The THP1 cells transduced with SOX12 shRNAs exhibited significantly reduced SOX12 expression and cell proliferation. SOX12 knockdown had no effect on apoptosis, but it induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and reduced the number of colonies. The transduced THP1 and primary AML cells were reconstituted in non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice, and their numbers were significantly reduced 6-12 weeks after transplantation. The mRNA and protein levels of beta-catenin were significantly diminished following SOX12 knockdown, accompanied by a decrease in TCF/Wnt activity. SOX12 may be involved in leukaemia progression by regulating the expression of beta-catenin and then interfering with TCF/Wnt pathway, which may be a target for AML.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Wan, Haixia', 'Cai, Jiayi', 'Chen, Fangyuan', 'Zhu, Jianyi', 'Zhong, Jihua', 'Zhong, Hua']","['Wan H', 'Cai J', 'Chen F', 'Zhu J', 'Zhong J', 'Zhong H']","['Department of Haematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.']",,20161118,,,['NOTNLM'],"['SRY-related high-mobility group box 12', 'TCF/Wnt', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'leukaemia progression', 'leukaemia-initiating cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analysed a retrospective cohort of 30 CLL patients with CNSi, documented by lymphocytic infiltration either by flow cytometry of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 29) or CNS biopsy (n = 1). Neurological symptoms were heterogeneous. At the time of CNSi, less than half of the patients had a progressive CLL and 20 had never been treated for CLL. Initial treatment with fludarabine-based immuno-chemotherapy, with or without intra-CSF therapy, led to durable response in eight out of nine untreated patients. In contrast, 50% patients receiving various prior treatments needed additional therapy within a median of 4 months (1-16). Ibrutinib led to complete response in 4/4 heavily pre-treated patients. From CNSi, 5-year overall survival was 72% and 48% for treatment-naive and previously treated patients respectively (P = 0.06); 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 43% and 0% (P = 0.125). 17p deletion was significantly associated with poor PFS (P = 0.006).

Majority of patients present clinical characteristics of primary amenorrhea, absent secondary sex characters, and abnormal hormone level. A female appearance patient with primary amenorrhea and 46 XY karyotype seems to be solid evidences to diagnose Y-chromosome-related DSD diseases, while it is not necessarily the accurate diagnosis. We report the case of an 18-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea and 46 XY karyotype misdiagnosed as Y-chromosome-related DSD. CLINICAL FINDINGS: The patient has normal female reproductive organs and a disrupted pubertal development after the treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We consider that her gonads were probably functional and later impaired after AML. The clinical manifestations were not consistent with DSD. With doubts, we found that she received bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from her brother and adjuvant chemotherapy 6 years ago. Her karyotype changed from normal female to a karyotype of donor (her brother) origin after BMT.Adjuvant chemotherapy for AML may impair her ovarian function and finally bring about disrupted puberty or primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). INTERVENTIONS: We provided close follow-up. OUTCOMES: During the second visit, the patient had her menarche lasting 4 days without any medication. CONCLUSION: The present case serves as a reminder that a correct diagnosis depends on the comprehensive collection of present and past medical history, complete physical examination, and careful evaluation of related adjuvant tests.

A 58-year-old inpatient on the hematology care unit of an academic medical center was discharged to his community after initial treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, without a clear plan for either discharge or follow-up. This case highlights the challenges faced by the primary oncology care team, the patient's community health-care team, the patient, and his caregiver, because a formal plan for follow-up care after discharge was not in place. The lack of communication within the oncology care team and between the medical center and community care teams that leads to the gap in continuity of care between inpatient and outpatient oncology settings could be addressed at least in part by establishing a shared mental model. This model would require all individuals involved in patient care to recognize they are part of a team. Furthermore, all members of the interdisciplinary discharge team need to understand their own roles and responsibilities as well as those of the other team members, including the need for communication and how their roles and activities affect those of other team members. Tools such as huddles, checklists, and patient education could be used to help the team recognize and achieve its goals. Ideally, this shared mental model could be extended to include the community health-care team, leading to a more fluid transition between inpatient and outpatient care, improving patient satisfaction, and likely improving patient outcomes.",,"['Page, Jenna S', 'Lederman, Lynne', 'Kelly, Jamie', 'Barry, Maura M', 'James, Ted A']","['Page JS', 'Lederman L', 'Kelly J', 'Barry MM', 'James TA']","['University of Vermont Medical Center; University of Vermont Cancer Center, Burlington, VT.', 'University of Vermont Medical Center; University of Vermont Cancer Center, Burlington, VT.', 'University of Vermont Medical Center; University of Vermont Cancer Center, Burlington, VT.', 'University of Vermont Medical Center; University of Vermont Cancer Center, Burlington, VT.', 'University of Vermont Medical Center; University of Vermont Cancer Center, Burlington, VT.']",,20161031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic low-grade toxicities can reduce patient's QoL and negatively impact on adherence. Areas covered: This review will focus on the role of QoL questionnaires in patients with CML, receiving imatinib or newer TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib). Physicians tend to underestimate the impact of TKI-related symptoms, in particular fatigue, that negatively affect QoL and can be a reason of poor adherence to therapy, with detrimental effect on long-term response. Few studies pointed out the role of PRO in CML, and there is paucity of questionnaires specifically designed for CML patients.

Epub 2016 Nov 17.,10.1007/s10147-016-1062-1 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Anthracyclines are used to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Even when administered at low doses, these agents are reported to cause progressive cardiac dysfunction. We conducted a clinical trial comparing the toxicities of two anthracyclines, pirarubicin (THP) and daunorubicin (DNR), in the treatment of childhood ALL. The results from our study that relate to acute and late toxicities are reported here. METHODS: 276 children with B-ALL were enrolled in the trial from April 1997 to March 2002 and were randomly assigned to receive a regimen including either THP (25 mg/m(2) x 11) or DNR (30 mg/m(2) x 11). Acute toxicity was prospectively assessed based on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. Acute hematological toxicity was also examined via some parameters. Patients with event-free survival of >5 years were retrospectively surveyed for cardiac function at 5 and 10 years and at the most recent assessment more than 10 years from the onset of ALL. RESULTS: Acute hematological toxicity in the early phase was more significant in the THP arm. Based on ultrasound cardiography, cardiac function was impaired in both groups during the follow-up period, but there was no significant difference between the groups except for a greater decline in fractional shortening on ultrasound cardiography in the DNR arm. CONCLUSIONS: While acute hematological toxicity was more significant in the THP arm, THP also appeared to be less cardiotoxic. However, the evaluation of late cardiotoxicity was limited because only a few subjects were followed beyond 10 years after ALL onset. Considering that the THP regimen produced an EFS rate comparable with that of the DNR regimen, the efficacy and toxicity of THP at reduced doses should be studied in order to identify potentially safer regimens.",,"['Hori, Hiroki', 'Kudoh, Tooru', 'Nishimura, Shinichiro', 'Oda, Megumi', 'Yoshida, Makoto', 'Hara, Junichi', 'Tawa, Akio', 'Usami, Ikuya', 'Tanizawa, Akihiko', 'Yumura-Yagi, Keiko', 'Kato, Koji', 'Kobayashi, Ryoji', 'Komada, Yoshihiro', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Horibe, Keizo']","['Hori H', 'Kudoh T', 'Nishimura S', 'Oda M', 'Yoshida M', 'Hara J', 'Tawa A', 'Usami I', 'Tanizawa A', 'Yumura-Yagi K', 'Kato K', 'Kobayashi R', 'Komada Y', 'Matsuo K', 'Horibe K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan. hhori@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan. hhori@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Medical Education, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie, 514-8507, Japan. hhori@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido Medical Center for Child Health and Rehabilitation, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima University Graduate School of Biomedical Science, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical Center, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Fukui Faculty of Medical Science, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka General Medical Center, Osaka, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",,20161117,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cardiotoxicity', '*Childhood leukemia', '*Clinical trial', '*Long-term follow-up', '*Myelotoxicity', '*Pirarubicin']",,,['Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CML diagnosis is based on detection of Philadelphia chromosome and ""Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog"" (ABL)-""breakpoint cluster region protein"" fusions (ABL-BCR fusions). AIMS: In this study, patients with CML morphology were studied according to ABL-BCR fusions and the relationship between the fusions and peripheral blood cell changes was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients suspected to chronic myeloproliferative disorders in Lorestan Province visiting subspecialist hematology clinics who were confirmed by oncologist were studied over a period of 5 years. After completing basic data questionnaire, blood samples were obtained with informed consent from the patients. Blood cell count and morphology were investigated and RNA was extracted from blood samples. cDNA was synthesized from RNA and ABL-BCR fusions including b3a2 and b2a2 (protein 210 kd or p210), e1a2 (protein 190 kdor p190), and e19a2 (protein 230 kdor p230) were studied by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method. Coexistence of e1a2 and b2a2 (p210/p190) fusions was also studied. The prevalence of mutations and their correlation with the blood parameters were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Of 58 patients positive for ABL-BCR fusion, 18 (30.5%) had b2a2 fusion, 37 (62.71%) had b3a2 fusion and three (3.08%) had e1a2 fusion. Coexistence of e1a2 and b2a2 (p210/p190) was not observed. There was no significant correlation between ABL-BCR fusions and white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin concentration.

OBJECTIVE: To identify novel selective cytotoxic compounds that induce apoptosis. METHODS: The Differential Nuclear Staining (DNS) screening protocol was utilized to measure the cytotoxicity of all experimental dienones on several cancerous cells. Additionally, the selective cytotoxicity index was calculated by comparing the dienone's cytotoxicity between leukemia/lymphoma cells vs. non-cancerous cells. Furthermore, to discern whether a selected dienone induced cell death via apoptosis or necrosis on T-lymphocyte leukemia cells, diverse approaches were utilized to detect individual biochemical facets of apoptosis. RESULTS: The dienones were tested for their anti-neoplastic efficiency on human leukemia/lymphoma-derived cell lines. Special emphasis was applied on dienone 1, on the basis of its sub-micromolar cytotoxicity (CC50=0.43+0.02 muM) and high selective cytotoxicity index (11.1) exerted on T-leukemia cells. In general, dienone 1 showed the most potent cytotoxic properties as compared to other dienones and a related reference cytotoxin curcumin as well as the EF-24 curcumin analogue. Dienone 1 caused cell death by apoptosis in Jurkat cells as evidenced by inducing phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3/7. These effects were mainly attributed to the induction of apoptotic pathways. CONCLUSION: The novel dienone 1 was found to exhibit potent anti-leukemia activity by inducing programmed cell death/apoptosis.

Epub 2016 Nov 18.,10.1038/leu.2016.325 [doi],"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most prevalent hematologic malignancy. Aberrant microRNAs (miRNAs) expression has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of MM. In this study, we further demonstrated that miR-137 was significantly downregulated in MM and negatively correlated with clinical prognosis. Moreover, we described the epigenetic regulation of miR-137 and its association with progression-free survival in MM patients. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-137 in MM cell line (miR-137 OE) increased its sensitivity to bortezomib and eprirubicin in vitro. Also, some high-risk genetic abnormalities in MM, including deletion of chromosome 1p22.2, 14q or 17p13, and gain of chromosome 1p22.2 were detected in NCI-H929 empty vector (NCI-H929 EV) treated cells but not in the NCI-H929 miR-137 overexpression (NCI-H929 miR-137 OE) cells. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-137 targeted AURKA. Ectopic expression of miR-137 strongly reduced the expression of AURKA and p-ATM/Chk2 in MM cells, and increased the expression of p53, and p21. Importantly, miR-137 overexpression together with bortezomib treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth in MM xenograft model. Taken together, this study demonstrates that miR-137 is epigenetically silenced in MM, and overexpression of miR-137 could reduce drug resistance and overcome chromosomal instability of the MM cells via affecting the apoptosis and DNA damage pathways.",,"['Qin, Y', 'Zhang, S', 'Deng, S', 'An, G', 'Qin, X', 'Li, F', 'Xu, Y', 'Hao, M', 'Yang, Y', 'Zhou, W', 'Chang, H', 'Qiu, L']","['Qin Y', 'Zhang S', 'Deng S', 'An G', 'Qin X', 'Li F', 'Xu Y', 'Hao M', 'Yang Y', 'Zhou W', 'Chang H', 'Qiu L']","['Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Diagnostics, College of Basic Medical Science, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Department of Laboratory Hematology, Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis, Ministry of Health, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, Ministry of Education, Xiangya Hospital; Cancer Research Institute, School of Basic Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Department of Laboratory Hematology, Toronto General Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",,20161118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 17.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-1930 [doi],"Purpose: BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors are employed successfully for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treatment. However, resistant disease and persistence of BCR-ABL1-independent leukemia stem and progenitor cells (LSPC) remain clinical challenges. The receptor tyrosine kinase Axl can mediate survival and therapy resistance of different cancer cells. We investigated the therapeutic potential of Axl inhibition in CML.Experimental Design: We used primary cells from patients with CML and TKI-sensitive and -resistant BCR-ABL1(+) CML cell lines and a novel ponatinib-resistant cell line KCL-22 PonR. We analyzed the effects of genetic and pharmacologic Axl blockade by the small-molecule Axl inhibitor BGB324 in vitro and in vivo In BCR-ABL1-unmutated cells, we also investigated BGB324 in combination with imatinib.Results: We demonstrate overexpression of Axl receptor tyrosine kinase in primary cells of patients with CML compared with healthy individuals and a further increase of Axl expression in BCR-ABL TKI-resistant patients. We show that Axl blockage decreased growth of BCR-ABL TKI-sensitive CML cells including CD34(+) cells and exerts additive effects with imatinib via inhibition of Stat5 activation. BGB324 also inhibits BCR-ABL TKI-resistant cells, including T315I-mutated and ponatinib-resistant primary cells. BGB324 exerted therapeutic effects in BCR-ABL1 T315I-mutated and ponatinib-resistant preclinical mouse models. Notably, BGB324 does not inhibit BCR-ABL1 and consequently inhibits CML independent of BCR-ABL1 mutational status.Conclusions: Our data show that Axl inhibition has therapeutic potential in BCR-ABL TKI-sensitive as well as -resistant CML and support the need for clinical trials.

Epub 2016 Nov 16.,10.1182/blood-2016-03-707745 [doi],"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are hematopoietic stem cell disorders in which recurrent mutations define clonal hematopoiesis. The origin of the phenotypic diversity of non-del(5q) MDS remains unclear. Here, we investigated the clonal architecture of the CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment and interrogated dominant clones for MDS-initiating cells. We found that clones mainly accumulate mutations in a linear succession with retention of a dominant subclone. The clone detected in the long-term culture-initiating cell compartment that reconstitutes short-term human hematopoiesis in xenotransplantation models is usually the dominant clone, which gives rise to the myeloid and to a lesser extent to the lymphoid lineage. The pattern of mutations may differ between common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulomonocytic progenitors (GMPs), and megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitors (MEPs). Rare STAG2 mutations can amplify at the level of GMPs, from which it may drive the transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. We report that major truncating BCOR gene mutation affecting HSPC and CMP was beneath the threshold of detection in GMP or MEP. Consistently, BCOR knock-down (KD) in normal CD34(+) progenitors modifies their granulocytic and erythroid differentiation. Clonal architecture of the HSPC compartment and mutations selected during differentiation contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity of MDS. Defining the hierarchy of driver mutations provides insights into the process of transformation and may guide the search for novel therapeutic strategies.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Chesnais, Virginie', 'Arcangeli, Marie-Laure', 'Delette, Caroline', 'Rousseau, Alice', 'Guermouche, Helene', 'Lefevre, Carine', 'Bondu, Sabrina', ""Diop, M'boyba"", 'Cheok, Meyling', 'Chapuis, Nicolas', 'Legros, Laurence', 'Raynaud, Sophie', 'Willems, Lise', 'Bouscary, Didier', 'Lauret, Evelyne', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Fontenay, Michaela']","['Chesnais V', 'Arcangeli ML', 'Delette C', 'Rousseau A', 'Guermouche H', 'Lefevre C', 'Bondu S', 'Diop M', 'Cheok M', 'Chapuis N', 'Legros L', 'Raynaud S', 'Willems L', 'Bouscary D', 'Lauret E', 'Bernard OA', 'Kosmider O', 'Pflumio F', 'Fontenay M']","['Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', ""INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 967, Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique/Departement des Sciences de la Vie/Institut de Recherche en Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Leukemic Cells, Equipe Labellisee par la Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Universite Paris Diderot, Universite Paris-Saclay, Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, Paris, France."", 'Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, Paris, France."", 'Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1170, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Universite Paris-Saclay, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Lille, Unite de Mixte de Recherche-Scientifique 1172, Jean-Pierre Aubert Research Center, Lille, France.', 'Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1016, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, Paris, France."", 'Service de Medecine Interne, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Nice, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Nice, France;

However, it remains unclear if such approach is effective for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We analyzed outcomes of 109 consecutively treated ALL patients 18 years of age and older at 5 institutions. The median age was 32 years and the median follow-up for survivors was 13 months. Thirty-two patients were in first complete remission (CR1), while the rest were beyond CR1. Neutrophil engraftment occurred in 95% of the patients. The cumulative incidences of grades II to IV and III and IV acute GVHD at day 100 after transplantation were 32% and 11%, respectively, whereas chronic GVHD, nonrelapse mortality, relapse rate, and disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year after transplantation were 32%, 21%, 27%, and 51%, respectively.

The most common MLL mutation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the t(4;11)(q21;q23) chromosome translocation that fuses MLL in-frame with the AF4 gene producing MLL-AF4 and AF4-MLL fusion proteins. Previously, we found that MLL-AF4 binds to the BCL-2 gene and directly activates it through DOT1L recruitment and increased H3K79me2/3 levels. In the study described here, we performed a detailed analysis of MLL-AF4 regulation of the entire BCL-2 family. By measuring nascent RNA production in MLL-AF4 knockdowns, we found that of all the BCL-2 family genes, MLL-AF4 directly controls the active transcription of both BCL-2 and MCL-1 and also represses BIM via binding of the polycomb group repressor 1 (PRC1) complex component CBX8. We further analyzed MLL-AF4 activation of the BCL-2 gene using Capture-C and identified a BCL-2-specific enhancer, consisting of two clusters of H3K27Ac at the 3' end of the gene. Loss of MLL-AF4 activity results in a reduction of H3K79me3 levels in the gene body and H3K27Ac levels at the 3' BCL-2 enhancer, revealing a novel regulatory link between these two histone marks and MLL-AF4-mediated activation of BCL-2.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we conducted a systematical analysis for AML prognostic gene expressions. METHODS: We performed a microarray-based analysis for correlations between gene expression and adult AML overall survival (OS) using datasets GSE12417 and GSE8970. Positive findings were validated in an independent cohort of 50 newly diagnosed, non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) AML patients by quantitative RT-PCR and survival analysis. RESULTS: Microarray-based analysis suggested that expression of eight genes was each associated with 1-year and 3-year AML OS in both GSE12417 and GSE8970 datasets (p < 0.05). Next, we validated our findings in an independent cohort of AML samples collected in our hospital. We found that ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2E1 (UBE2E1) expression was adversely correlated with AML survival (p = 0.04). Multivariable analysis showed that UBE2E1 (high) patients had a significant shorter OS and shorter progression-free survival after adjusting other known prognostic factors (p = 0.03). At last, we found that UBE2E1 expression was negatively correlated with patients' response to induction chemotherapy (p < 0.05).

Increasing evidence indicates that functional monoclonal antibodies of CD274 may potently enhance the antitumor effect in many cancers. However, the role of CD274 in leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) remains largely unknown. METHODS: We established an MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model with wild-type (WT) and CD274-null mice to elucidate the role of CD274 in the cell fates of LICs, including self-renewal, differentiation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. RNA sequencing was performed to reveal the potential downstream targets, the results of which were further validated both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In silico analysis indicated that CD274 level was inversely correlated with the overall survival of AML patients. In Mac-1(+)/c-Kit(+) mouse LICs, CD274 was expressed at a much higher level than in the normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The survival of the mice with CD274-null leukemia cells was dramatically extended during the serial transplantation compared with that of their WT counterparts. CD274 deletion led to a significant decrease in LIC frequency and arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, CD274 is not required for the maintenance of HSC pool as shown in our previous study. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the levels of both phospho-JNK and Cyclin D2 were strikingly downregulated in CD274-null LICs. The overexpression of Cyclin D2 fully rescued the loss of function of CD274. Moreover, CD274 was directly associated with JNK and enhanced the downstream signaling to increase the Cyclin D2 level, promoting leukemia development. CONCLUSIONS: The surface immune molecule CD274 plays a critical role in the proliferation of LICs. The CD274/JNK/Cyclin D2 pathway promotes the cell cycle entry of LICs, which may serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemia.",,"['Fang, Xia', 'Chen, Chiqi', 'Xia, Fangzhen', 'Yu, Zhuo', 'Zhang, Yaping', 'Zhang, Feifei', 'Gu, Hao', 'Wan, Jiangbo', 'Zhang, Xiaocui', 'Weng, Wei', 'Zhang, Cheng Cheng', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang', 'Liang, Aibing', 'Xie, Li', 'Zheng, Junke']","['Fang X', 'Chen C', 'Xia F', 'Yu Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang F', 'Gu H', 'Wan J', 'Zhang X', 'Weng W', 'Zhang CC', 'Chen GQ', 'Liang A', 'Xie L', 'Zheng J']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Shanghai Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;

Because of the diversity of associated genetic changes, the detection of Ph-like ALL cases currently requires multiple cytogenetic and molecular assays; thus, our goal was to develop a consolidated workflow for detecting genetic abnormalities in Ph-like ALL. We found that total and targeted RNA sequencing (RNAseq)-based approach allowed the detection of abnormal fusion transcripts (EBF1-PDGFRB, P2RY8-CRLF2, RCSD1-ABL1, and RCSD1-ABL2).

Histone H3K4 methylation (H3K4me) is a chromatin signature associated with active gene-regulatory elements. We review a body of literature that supports a model in which the RAI1-containing H3K4me writer complex counterbalances the LSD1-containing H3K4me eraser complex to ensure normal brain development.

METHODS: We pooled two cohorts from the Southern Urals comprising offspring of female workers of a large nuclear facility (the Mayak Production Association) and of women living in areas along the Techa River contaminated by nuclear accidents/waste from the same facility, with detailed dosimetry. RESULTS: The combined cohort totalled 19 536 subjects with 700 504 person-years at risk over the period of incidence follow-up, and slightly more over the period of mortality follow-up, yielding 58 incident cases and 36 deaths up to age 61 years. Risk was increased in subjects who received in utero doses of 80 mGy (excess relative risk (ERR): 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.20 to 4.71), and the risk increased consistently per 100 mGy of continuous exposure in utero (ERR: 0.77; CI: 0.02 to 2.56). No association was apparent in mortality-based analyses. Results for leukaemia and lymphoma were similar. A very weak positive association was observed between incidence and postnatal exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the results suggest a positive association between in utero exposure to ionising radiation and risk of haematological malignancies, but the small number of outcomes and inconsistent incidence and mortality findings preclude firm conclusions.",,"['Schuz, Joachim', 'Deltour, Isabelle', 'Krestinina, Lyudmila Y', 'Tsareva, Yulia V', 'Tolstykh, Evgenia I', 'Sokolnikov, Mikhail E', 'Akleyev, Alexander V']","['Schuz J', 'Deltour I', 'Krestinina LY', 'Tsareva YV', 'Tolstykh EI', 'Sokolnikov ME', 'Akleyev AV']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Section of Environment and Radiation, Lyon, France.', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Section of Environment and Radiation, Lyon, France.', 'Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation.', 'Southern Urals Biophysics Institute, Ozyorsk, Russian Federation.', 'Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation.', 'Southern Urals Biophysics Institute, Ozyorsk, Russian Federation.', 'Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation.', 'Chelyabinsk State University, Chelyabinsk, Russian Federation.']",['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20161117,,PMC5220143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 18.,,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is still a major public health issue worldwide, and new therapeutics with anti-tumor activity are still urgently needed. METHODS: The anti-tumor activity of TH-39, which shows potent anti-proliferative activity against K562 cells with an IC50 of 0.78 microM, was investigated using immunoblot, co-immunoprecipitation, the MTT assay, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Mechanistically, TH-39 may disrupt the interaction between Hec1 and Nek2 in K562 cells. Moreover, TH-39 inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner by influencing the morphology of K562 cells and inducing G0/G1 phase arrest. G0/G1 phase arrest was associated with down-regulation of CDK2-cyclin E complex and CDK4/6-cyclin D complex activities. Furthermore, TH-39 also induced cell apoptosis, which was associated with activation of caspase-3, down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression and up-regulation of Bax. TH-39 could also decrease mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in K562 cells. The results indicated that TH-39 might induce apoptosis via the ROS-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential therapeutic efficacy of the anti-cancer compound TH-39 in treatment-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia.","['(c) 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

The ability to study CLL B-cells in vitro has always been a challenge and hampered by the low viability of the CLL B-cells in cell culture systems. In this study, we present a multicellular cell culture system to maintain CLL B-cells viable in culture for 60h in the presence of a stromal cell feeder layer in combination with a whole white blood cell preparation. Using this optimized system, we tested and showed that the addition of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) at concentrations ranging from 25 to 100mug/ml induced apoptosis in CLL B-cells whilst not affecting healthy control B-cells. Moreover, the results showed that in contrast to healthy controls, T-cells from CLL patients underwent apoptosis in the presence of EGCG. This study demonstrated that the combination of a cell feeder layer with a whole white blood cell preparation maintained B-cell viability in vitro over an extended period of time. In addition, the study showed that EGCG differentially induces apoptosis in CLL B-and T-Cells but not in healthy B-and T-Cells in a dose dependent manner.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Bone marrow cells obtained from normal individuals - both total mononuclear cells as well as CD34(+) Lin(-) cells- were used as controls. IC50 corresponded to 0.5muM for K562 cells, 0.63muM for MEG01 cells, 0.38muM for CML CD34(+) lin(-) cells, and 1.0muM for normal CD34(+) lin(-) cells. Proliferation and expansion were also inhibited to significantly higher extents in cultures of CML cells as compared to their normal counterparts. All these effects seemed to occur via a bcr-abl transcription-independent mechanism that involved a delay in cell division, an increase in cell death, generation of Reactive Oxygen Species and changes in cell cycle.

Predicting patient response prior to therapy would improve treatment effectiveness, avoid treatment-related adverse events and reduce healthcare costs. Three separate cohorts of MDS patients were used to simulate drug response to lenalidomide alone, hypomethylating agent (HMA) alone, or HMA plus lenalidomide. Utilizing a computational biology program, genomic abnormalities in each patient were used to create an intracellular pathway map that was then used to screen for drug response. In the lenalidomide treated cohort, computer modeling correctly matched clinical responses in 37/46 patients (80%). In the second cohort, 15 HMA patients were modeled and correctly matched to responses in 12 (80%). In the third cohort, computer modeling correctly matched responses in 10/10 patients (100%). This computational biology network approach identified GGH overexpression as a potential resistance factor to HMA treatment and paradoxical activation of beta-catenin (through Csnk1a1 inhibition) as a resistance factor to lenalidomide treatment. We demonstrate that a computational technology is able to map the complexity of the MDS mutanome to simulate and predict drug response.

Recent strategies, including manipulating intracellular activating domains and transducing viral vectors, have resulted in better designed and optimized CAR-T cells. This is further facilitated by the rapid identification of an accumulating number of potential leukemic antigens that may serve as therapeutic targets for CAR-T cells.

Satellite cells are stem cells in skeletal muscle that provide an important cell source for transplantation therapy. However, culture of satellite cells in vitro causes them to lose their undifferentiated state, associated with reduced transplantation efficiency. It is therefore necessary to develop optimal culture conditions for maintaining the undifferentiated state of satellite cells. METHODS: Primary satellite cells were cultured with or without leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The expression of undifferentiation and differentiation markers, and the transplantation efficiency were analyzed. RESULTS: LIF-treated satellite cells showed increased expression of Pax7, and enhanced transplantation efficiency in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the treatment with LIF effectively maintained the undifferentiated state of satellite cells, and enhanced their transplantation efficiency.

Inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (with ibrutinib being the first-in-class US Food and Drug Administration-approved agent) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (with idelalisib as the first-in-class approved agent) are promising because they are generally well tolerated and highly effective against this malignancy. These agents may be particularly important in the treatment of older patients who are less able to tolerate the myelosuppression (and subsequent infections) associated with chemoimmunotherapy. As a class of medications, B-cell receptor inhibitors have some unique side effects, including redistribution lymphocytosis. Toxicities associated specifically with ibrutinib include increased risk for bleeding and atrial fibrillation. Idelalisib also has some unique toxicities: transaminitis, colitis, and pneumonitis. Targeted therapies recently approved for use in CLL include the novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies obinutuzumab and ofatumumab, and the B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor venetoclax.

As a traditional Chinese medicine, realgar has been widely used for the treatment of various diseases for >1,500 years. Inspired by nano-drug, realgar nanoparticles (NPs) have been prepared with an average particle size of <100 nm in a previous work. Compared with coarse realgar, the realgar NPs have higher bioavailability. As a principal constituent protein of caveolae, caveolin-1 (Cav-1) participates in regulating various cellular physiological and pathological processes including tumorigenesis and tumor development. In previous studies, it was found that realgar NPs can inhibit several types of tumor cell proliferation. However, the therapeutic effect of realgar NPs on CML has not been fully elucidated. In the present paper, it was demonstrated that realgar NPs can inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and degrade Bcr-Abl fusion protein effectively. Both apoptosis and autophagy were activated in a dose-dependent manner in realgar NPs treated cells, and the induction of autophagy was associated with class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Morphological analysis indicated that realgar NPs induced differentiation effectively in CML cells. Furthermore, it was identified that Cav-1 might play a crucial role in realgar NP therapy. In order to study the effects of Cav-1 on K562 cells during realgar NP treatment, a Cav-1 overexpression cell model was established by using transient transfection. The results indicated that Cav-1 overexpression inhibited K562 cell proliferation, promoted endogenic autophagy, and increased the sensitivity of K562 cells to realgar NPs. Therefore, the results demonstrated that realgar NPs degraded Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, while the underlying mechanism might be related to apoptosis and autophagy, and Cav-1 might be considered as a potential target for clinical comprehensive therapy of CML.",,"['Shi, Dan', 'Liu, Yan', 'Xi, Ronggang', 'Zou, Wei', 'Wu, Lijun', 'Zhang, Zhiran', 'Liu, Zhongyang', 'Qu, Chao', 'Xu, Baoli', 'Wang, Xiaobo']","['Shi D', 'Liu Y', 'Xi R', 'Zou W', 'Wu L', 'Zhang Z', 'Liu Z', 'Qu C', 'Xu B', 'Wang X']","[""Department of Pharmacy, The 210th Hospital of People's Liberation Army."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The 210th Hospital of People's Liberation Army."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The 210th Hospital of People's Liberation Army."", 'College of Life Science, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, Liaoning.', ""Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The 210th Hospital of People's Liberation Army."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The 210th Hospital of People's Liberation Army."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The 210th Hospital of People's Liberation Army."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The 210th Hospital of People's Liberation Army."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The 210th Hospital of People's Liberation Army.""]",,20161107,,PMC5106223,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcr-Abl fusion protein', '*apoptosis', '*autophagy', '*caveolin-1', '*realgar nanoparticles']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New cytotoxic drugs have created considerable progress in the treatment, but side effects are still the important cause of mortality. Plant derivatives have been recently considered as important sources for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. Gallic acid (GA) is a polyhydroxyphenolic compound with a wide range of biological functions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of GA on proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction of a lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Jurkat cell (C121) line was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) with different concentrations of GA (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 muM) for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The effect of GA on cell viability was measured using MTS assay. Induction of apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V-FITC/PI kit and flow cytometry. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 20 using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's multiple comparison tests. Decline of cell viability to less than 50% was observed at 60.3+/-1.6, 50.9+/-1.5, and 30.9+/-2.8 muM concentration after 24, 48, and 72 hours incubation, respectively. All concentrations of GA (10, 30, 50 and 80 muM) enhanced apoptosis compared to the control (P<0.05). The results demonstrate that the polyphenolic compound, GA, is effective in inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in Jurkat cell line.

We have obtained evidences for a recurrent rearrangement, which involved the WNT10B locus (WNT10B(R)) within intron 1 (IVS1) and flanked at the 5' by non-human sequences whose origin remains to be elucidated; it also expressed a transcript variant (WNT10B(IVS1)) which was mainly detected in a cohort of patients with intermediate/unfavorable risk AML. We also identified in two separate cases, affected by AML and breast cancer respectively, a genomic transposable short form of human WNT10B (ht-WNT10B). The intronless ht-WNT10B resembles a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), which suggests its involvement in a non-random microhomology-mediated recombination generating the rearranged WNT10B(R). Furthermore, our studies supports an autocrine activation primed by the formation of WNT10B-FZD4/5 complexes in the breast cancer MCF7 cells that express the WNT10B(IVS1). Chemical interference of WNT-ligands production by the porcupine inhibitor IWP-2 achieved a dose-dependent suppression of the WNT10B-FZD4/5 interactions.

Thus, strategies eradicating CML LSCs are required for cure. In this study, we discovered that AXL tyrosine kinase was selectively overexpressed in primary CML CD34(+) cells. However, the role of AXL and its ligand Gas6 secreted by stromal cells in the regulation of self-renewal capacity of LSCs has not been well investigated.Experimental Design: The function of CML CD34(+) cells was evaluated by flow cytometer, CFC/replating, long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC), CML mouse model driven by human BCR-ABL gene and NOD-scid-IL2Rg(-/-) (NSI) mice.Results: AXL was selectively overexpressed in primary CML CD34(+) cells. AXL knockdown reduced the survival and self-renewal capacity of human CML CD34(+) cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of AXL reduced the survival and self-renewal capacity of human CML LSCs in vitro and in long-term grafts in NSI mice. Human CML CD34(+) cells conscripted bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMDSC) and primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to secrete Gas6 to form a paracrine loop that promoted self-renewal of LSCs. Suppression of AXL by shRNA and inhibitor prolonged survival of CML mice and reduced the growth of LSCs in mice. Gas6/AXL ligation stabilizes beta-catenin in an AKT-dependent fashion in human CML CD34(+) cells.Conclusions: Our findings improve the understanding of LSC regulation and validate Gas6/AXL as a pair of therapeutic targets to eliminate CML LSCs.

This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aims at assessing these risks separately. METHODS: The literature search was performed by two independent reviewers following the previous protocol (PROSPERO 2014:CRD42014014147). A random-effects model and a fixed-effect model were used according to the characteristics of the included studies. Peto odds ratios with 95%CI were computed. RESULTS: Overall, 4.78% of patients developed arterial occlusive events with new generation TKIs compared with 0.96% with imatinib. Ponatinib (ORPETO:3.26; 95%CI:1.12 to 9.50), nilotinib (ORPETO: 3.69; 95%CI:2.29 to 5.95) and dasatinib (ORPETO:3.32; 95%CI:1.37 to 8.01) are all associated with a higher risk of arterial occlusive events than imatinib. Venous occlusive events occur in 0.72% of patients treated with new generation TKIs and in 0.27% of imatinib-treated patients. Overall, a trend toward an increase of the rate of venous occlusive events with new-generation TKIs (ORPETO:2.17; 95%CI:0.90 to 5.25) was highlighted but stratifications by treatment gave nonsignificant results. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular occlusive events associated with new-generation BCR-ABL TKIs are driven by arterial occlusive events.",,"['Haguet, Helene', 'Douxfils, Jonathan', 'Mullier, Francois', 'Chatelain, Christian', 'Graux, Carlos', 'Dogne, Jean-Michel']","['Haguet H', 'Douxfils J', 'Mullier F', 'Chatelain C', 'Graux C', 'Dogne JM']","['a Department of Pharmacy , University of Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS) , Namur , Belgium.', 'b Haematology Laboratory , Universite catholique de Louvain, CHU UCL Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS) , Yvoir , Belgium.', 'a Department of Pharmacy , University of Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS) , Namur , Belgium.', 'b Haematology Laboratory , Universite catholique de Louvain, CHU UCL Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS) , Yvoir , Belgium.', 'a Department of Pharmacy , University of Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS) , Namur , Belgium.', 'c Department of Haematology , Universite catholique de Louvain, CHU UCL Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS) , Yvoir , Belgium.', 'a Department of Pharmacy , University of Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS) , Namur , Belgium.']",,20161128,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Arterial occlusive disease', '*BCR-ABL positive', '*chronic', '*leukemia', '*meta-analysis', '*myelogenous', '*protein kinase inhibitors', '*venous thrombosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional pro-inflammatory interleukin involved in many types of cancer. We previously demonstrated that IL-6 expression was induced following ALV-J infection in chickens. The aim of this study is to characterize the mechanism by which ALV-J induces IL-6 expression, and the role of IL-6 in tumor development. Our results demonstrate that ALV-J infection increases IL-6 expression in chicken splenocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and vascular endothelial cells. IL-6 production is induced by the ALV-J envelope protein gp85 and capsid protein p27 via PI3K- and NF-kappaB-mediated signaling.

Time to t-AML diagnosis was influenced by patient age, type of LD, and treatment. Among the 48 t-AML patients treated with intensive chemotherapy, median overall survival (OS) was 7.7 months compared to 26.1 months in de novo, 4.2 months in post-myeloproliferative neoplasm, 9.4 months in post-myelodysplastic syndrome, 8.6 months in post-chronic myelomonocytic leukemia AML, 13.4 months in t-AML secondary to the treatment of solid cancer, and 14.7 months in breast cancer only. OS of post-LD t-AML patients was significantly influenced by age, performance status, myelodysplastic syndrome prior to LD/t-AML, and treatment regimen for LD.

We previously showed that BCR/Abl protein is suppressed in low oxygen, where viable cells retain stem cell potential. This study addressed the regulation of BCR/Abl protein expression under oxygen or glucose shortage, characteristic of the in vivo environment where cells resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi) persist. We investigated, at transcriptional, translational and post-translational level, the mechanisms involved in BCR/Abl suppression in K562 and KCL22 CML cells. BCR/abl mRNA steady-state analysis and ChIP-qPCR on BCR promoter revealed that BCR/abl transcriptional activity is reduced in K562 cells under oxygen shortage. The SUnSET assay showed an overall reduction of protein synthesis under oxygen/glucose shortage in both cell lines. However, only low oxygen decreased polysome-associated BCR/abl mRNA significantly in KCL22 cells, suggesting a decreased BCR/Abl translation. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 or the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk extended BCR/Abl expression under oxygen/glucose shortage in K562 cells. Glucose shortage induced autophagy-dependent BCR/Abl protein degradation in KCL22 cells. Overall, our results showed that energy restriction induces different cell-specific BCR/Abl protein suppression patterns, which represent a converging route to TKi-resistance of CML cells.

Here, we have investigated its effects on the transcriptome and epigenome in t(8,21) patient cells. AML1-ETO binding was found at promoter regions of active genes with high levels of histone acetylation but also at distal elements characterized by low acetylation levels and binding of the hematopoietic transcription factors LYL1 and LMO2. In contrast, ERG, FLI1, TAL1, and RUNX1 bind at all AML1-ETO-occupied regulatory regions, including those of the AML1-ETO gene itself, suggesting their involvement in regulating AML1-ETO expression levels. While expression of AML1-ETO in myeloid differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) induces leukemic characteristics, overexpression increases cell death. We find that expression of wild-type transcription factors RUNX1 and ERG in AML is required to prevent this oncogene overexpression.

Impairments in memory, attention and executive function affect 15-50% of childhood leukemia survivors related to methotrexate exposure. Systemic cisplatin is used to treat a variety of childhood and adult cancers, yet the risk and extent of cognitive impairment due to platinum-based chemotherapy in pediatric patients is unknown. Systemic cisplatin penetrates the CNS, induces hippocampal synaptic damage, and leads to neuronal and neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) loss. Survivors of non-leukemic cancers may be at risk for significant cognitive impairment related to cisplatin-driven neurotoxicity. We sought to examine the long-term effects of systemic cisplatin administration on cognitive function when administered during infancy and adolescence in a rat model. We performed cognitive testing in adult rats exposed to systemic cisplatin during either infancy or adolescence. Rats treated as adolescents showed significantly poor retrieval of a novel object as compared to controls. Further, cisplatin-treated infants and adolescents showed poor contextual discrimination as compared to controls, and an impaired response to cued fear conditioning. Ultimately, systemic cisplatin exposure resulted in more profound impairments in cognitive function in rats treated during adolescence than in those treated during infancy. Further, exposure to cisplatin during adolescence affected both hippocampus and amygdala dependent cognitive function, suggesting a more global cognitive dysfunction at this age.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The yeast-filament transition is required for virulent infection by Candida. Several studies have explored the genome-wide transcription profile of Candida, however, no report on the transcriptional profile of C. tropicalis under yeast-filament transition has been published. In this study, the transcriptomes of three C. tropicalis isolates with different adhesion and biofilm formation abilities, identified in our previous studies, were analyzed in both the yeast and filament states using RNA-Seq. Differentially expressed genes were found for each isolate during the transition. A total of 115 genes were up- or down- regulated in the two hyphal-producing isolates (ZRCT 4 and ZRCT 45). Among these differentially expressed genes, only two were down-regulated during the yeast-filament transition. Furthermore, six filament-associated genes were up-regulated in the hyphae-producing isolates.

RECENT FINDINGS: CMML is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis and myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative alterations in the bone marrow. Clinical behavior of the disease can be heterogeneous, with some patients having an indolent form of the disease, whereas others experience an aggressive course with decreased survival and eventual transformation to leukemia. Multiple studies have helped define the clinical, cytogenetic and mutational prognostic features of the disease. In addition, several prognostic scoring systems have been developed for patients with CMML. Incorporation of mutation data, particularly presence of frameshift and nonsense ASXL1 mutations, into these models seems to be allowing to further improve our ability to predict patient outcomes. SUMMARY: Prognosis of patients with CMML is heterogeneous. Incorporation of mutational data into current clinical prognostic models has allowed to improve our ability to predict patient outcomes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative treatment for patients with CMML but is only an option for a subset of patients. For this reason, hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine have become the backbone of current therapy for patients with CMML, but new therapeutic strategies are required to improve their outcomes.",,"['Alfonso, Ana', 'Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Alfonso A', 'Montalban-Bravo G', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-memory stem cells (TSCM) retain superior potential for long-lived persistence, but challenges exist in manufacturing this T-cell subset because they are rare among circulating lymphocytes. We report a clinically relevant approach to generating CAR(+) T cells with preserved TSCM potential using the Sleeping Beauty platform. Because IL-15 is fundamental to T-cell memory, we incorporated its costimulatory properties by coexpressing CAR with a membrane-bound chimeric IL-15 (mbIL15). The mbIL15-CAR T cells signaled through signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 to yield improved T-cell persistence independent of CAR signaling, without apparent autonomous growth or transformation, and achieved potent rejection of CD19(+) leukemia. Long-lived T cells were CD45RO(neg)CCR7(+)CD95(+), phenotypically most similar to TSCM, and possessed a memory-like transcriptional profile. Overall, these results demonstrate that CAR(+) T cells can develop long-term persistence with a memory stem-cell phenotype sustained by signaling through mbIL15.

We aimed to determine safety and efficacy of lenalidomide, an oral immunomodulator, in these patients. METHODS: This phase 1/2 trial (EUDRACT # 2009-009372-13) included 10 patients who received 28-day cycles of oral lenalidomide 25 mg/day, days 1 through 21, in combination with oral dexamethasone 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, 22. Primary endpoints were tolerance and the overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and quality of life. RESULTS: The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were myelosuppression. The ORR among the participants who could be evaluated was 28.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0-62.2%). The median OS was 92 days (range, 43-133 days). All patients have died because of progressive disease. Quality of life remains stable during treatment cycles.

Among the genes encoding these enzymes, ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) is frequently mutated somatically in both myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. Because these TET2 mutations result in the impairment of the dioxygenase activity of TET2, it is thought that these mutations interfere with 5-mC to 5-hmC conversion. There is ample evidence indicating that TET2 mutations are a driver of tumorigenesis in blood cells and that TET2 mutations are often acquired at the hematopoietic stem/early progenitor cell stage. In addition, TET2 is the second-most frequently mutated gene in clonal hematopoiesis in individuals with no apparent blood cancers, suggesting that while TET2 mutations alone are insufficient to cause hematologic malignancy, they represent an early event during tumorigenesis. A number of questions, including the precise target genome regions of TET2, and the importance of the balance of 5-mC and 5-hmC in the regulatory regions in transcriptional control, remain.",,"['Chiba, Shigeru']",['Chiba S'],"['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan. schiba-tky@umin.net.']",,20161115,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Epigenetics', '*Pre-leukemia/pre-lymphoma', '*TET2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 1995, the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in Taiwan has been offering insurance coverage for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), along with conventional Western medicine (WM). This study analyzes the status of TCM utilization in Taiwan, in both pediatric and adult patients with leukemia. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using population-based National Health Insurance Research Database of Registry of Catastrophic Illness, involving patient data from 2001 to 2010 and follow-up data through 2011. The effectiveness of TCM use was evaluated. Relevant sociodemographic data showed that both pediatric and adult patients who were TCM users one year prior to leukemia diagnosis were more likely to utilize TCM services for cancer therapy. A greater part of medical expenditure of TCM users was lower than that of TCM nonusers, except little discrepancy in drug fee of adult patients. The survival rate is also higher in TCM users. Altogether, these data show that TCM has the potential to serve as an adjuvant therapy when combined with conventional WM in the treatment of patients with leukemia.",,"['Wang, Yu-Jun', 'Liao, Chung-Chih', 'Chen, Hsuan-Ju', 'Hsieh, Ching-Liang', 'Li, Tsai-Chung']","['Wang YJ', 'Liao CC', 'Chen HJ', 'Hsieh CL', 'Li TC']","['Graduate Institute of Integrated Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Chinese Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Management Office for Health Data, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Integrated Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Research Center for Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Healthcare Administration, College of Health Science, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan; Department of Public Health, College of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",,20161025,,PMC5099467,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8187-4716', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3346-7462']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclin-dependent kinase 9/cyclin T (CDK9) promotes excessive production of multiple pro-survival proteins including Mcl-1, leading to impaired apoptosis of cancer cells. As such, CDK9 is an emerging therapeutic target in cancer therapy. We herein report the first study of targeting CDK9 as a treatment strategy for hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC), an aggressive malignancy associated with one of the worst prognoses within HNSCC. We showed that mRNA levels of Mcl-1 were significantly higher in HSCC tumor tissues than in the adjacent non-tumor mucosae. In addition, the levels of Mcl-1 mRNA correlated with the tumor size and clinical stage of HSCC patients. CDKI-73, a potent CDK9 inhibitor, was capable of downregulating the expression of Mcl-1 in the HSCC cells by suppression of the CDK9 mediated phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. CDKI-73 effectively induced apoptosis as a single agent and synergized anti-tumor activity of cisplatin in HSCC cells. Taken together, our study presents compelling evidence for developing CDK9 inhibitors, such as CDKI-73, as new therapeutic strategy for HSCC.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A majority of patients with BRAFV600E melanomas respond well to inhibitors such as vemurafenib, but all ultimately relapse. Moreover, there are no viable treatment options available for other non-BRAF melanoma subtypes in the clinic. A key to improving treatment options lies in a better understanding of mechanisms underlying melanoma progression, which are complex and heterogeneous. METHODS: In this study we integrated gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression data from genetically engineered mouse models of highly and poorly malignant melanocytic tumors, as well as available human melanoma databases, and discovered an important role for a pathway centered on a tumor suppressor miRNA, miR-32. RESULTS: Malignant tumors frequently exhibited poor expression of miR-32, whose targets include NRAS, PI3K and notably, MCL-1. Accordingly, MCL-1 was often highly expressed in melanomas, and when knocked down diminished oncogenic potential. Forced MCL-1 overexpression transformed immortalized primary mouse melanocytes, but only when also expressing activating mutations in BRAF, CRAF or PI3K. Importantly, both miR-32 replacement therapy and the MCL-1-specific antagonist sabutoclax demonstrated single-agent efficacy, and acted synergistically in combination with vemurafenib in preclinical melanoma models. CONCLUSIONS: We here identify miR-32/MCL-1 pathway members as key early genetic events driving melanoma progression, and suggest that their inhibition may be an effective anti-melanoma strategy irrespective of NRAS, BRAF, and PTEN status.",,"['Mishra, Prasun J', 'Mishra, Pravin J', 'Merlino, Glenn']","['Mishra PJ', 'Mishra PJ', 'Merlino G']","['Department of Biochemical and Cellular Pharmacology, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Precision Genomics, Intermountain Healthcare, Dixie Regional Medical Center, St. George, Utah, United States of America.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",,20161115,,PMC5113037,,,"['PJM is employed by Genentech, GM is employed by NCI and PM is employed by', 'Intermountain healthcare.

Determination of niche size and niche numbers during organogenesis involves precise control of gene expression. How this is achieved in the context of a complex chromatin landscape is largely unknown. Here we show that the nuclear protein Combgap (Cg) supports correct ovarian niche formation in Drosophila by controlling ecdysone-Receptor (EcR)- mediated transcription and long-range chromatin contacts in the broad locus (BR-C). Both cg and BR-C promote ovarian growth and the development of niches for germ line stem cells. BR-C levels were lower when Combgap was either reduced or over-expressed, indicating an intricate regulation of the BR-C locus by Combgap. Polytene chromosome stains showed that Cg co-localizes with EcR, the major regulator of BR-C, at the BR-C locus and that EcR binding to chromatin was sensitive to changes in Cg levels. Proximity ligation assay indicated that the two proteins could reside in the same complex.

Therefore, this study compares health care use and costs among patients with cancer receiving intravenous (IV) chemotherapy in physician offices (PO) versus in hospital outpatient settings (HOP). METHODS: This retrospective study, which was based on medical and pharmacy claims data, included patients (age, 18 to 64 years) initiating IV chemotherapy/biologic treatment between January 1, 2006, and August 31, 2012, who were diagnosed with early or metastatic breast cancer, metastatic lung cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients were assigned to PO or HOP groups on the basis of where they received > 95% of their IV cancer therapy. RESULTS: The study sample included 18,740 patients (12,899 PO; 5,841 HOP) who had a mean age of 51.6 years and a Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 5.37. Overall office visits (21.8 +/- 13.8 PO v 21.2 +/- 12.9, P < .005) and outpatient services (50.8 +/- 35.5 PO v 48.5 +/- 33.6, P < .001) were higher in the PO group than in the HOP group. Cancer-related inpatient hospitalizations (0.6 +/- 1.2 PO v 0.7 +/- 1.4 HOP, P = .002) were lower in the PO group than in the HOP group. Although quality-of-care metrics were similar between the HOP and PO groups, follow-up all-cause costs ($82,773 PO v $122,473 HOP) and cancer-related health care costs ($69,037 PO v $108,177 HOP) were higher in the HOP group than in the PO group. CONCLUSION: Despite similar resource use, all-cause and cancer-related health care costs in HOP were significantly higher compared with those in PO settings.",,"['Fisher, Maxine D', 'Punekar, Rajeshwari', 'Yim, Yeun Mi', 'Small, Arthur', 'Singer, Joseph R', 'Schukman, Jay', 'McAneny, Barbara L', 'Luthra, Rakesh', 'Malin, Jennifer']","['Fisher MD', 'Punekar R', 'Yim YM', 'Small A', 'Singer JR', 'Schukman J', 'McAneny BL', 'Luthra R', 'Malin J']","['HealthCore, Wilmington, DE; Genentech, San Francisco, CA; Anthem, Indianapolis, IN; and New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'HealthCore, Wilmington, DE; Genentech, San Francisco, CA; Anthem, Indianapolis, IN; and New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'HealthCore, Wilmington, DE; Genentech, San Francisco, CA; Anthem, Indianapolis, IN; and New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'HealthCore, Wilmington, DE; Genentech, San Francisco, CA; Anthem, Indianapolis, IN; and New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'HealthCore, Wilmington, DE; Genentech, San Francisco, CA; Anthem, Indianapolis, IN; and New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'HealthCore, Wilmington, DE; Genentech, San Francisco, CA; Anthem, Indianapolis, IN; and New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'HealthCore, Wilmington, DE; Genentech, San Francisco, CA; Anthem, Indianapolis, IN; and New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'HealthCore, Wilmington, DE; Genentech, San Francisco, CA; Anthem, Indianapolis, IN; and New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.', 'HealthCore, Wilmington, DE; Genentech, San Francisco, CA; Anthem, Indianapolis, IN; and New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM.']",,20161115,['J Oncol Pract. 2017 Jan;13(1):4-5.

However, AML is a heterogeneous disease and these effects caused by direct pathway inhibition in the leukemic cells are observed only for a subset of patients. Furthermore, the final effect of PI3K-Akt-mTOR inhibition is modulated by indirect effects, i.e., treatment effects on AML-supporting non-leukemic bone marrow cells. In this article we focus on the effects of this treatment on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and monocytes/macrophages; both these cell types are parts of the haematopoietic stem cell niches in the bone marrow. MSCs have unique membrane molecule and constitutive cytokine release profiles, and mediate their support through bidirectional crosstalk involving both cell-cell contact and the local cytokine network. It is not known how various forms of PI3K-Akt-mTOR targeting alter the molecular mechanisms of this crosstalk. The effect on monocytes/macrophages is also difficult to predict and depends on the targeted molecule. Thus, further development of PI3K-Akt-mTOR targeting into a clinical strategy requires detailed molecular studies in well-characterized experimental models combined with careful clinical studies, to identify patient subsets that are likely to respond to this treatment.",,"['Brenner, Annette K', 'Andersson Tvedt, Tor Henrik', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Brenner AK', 'Andersson Tvedt TH', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Haematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway. annette.brenner@uib.no.', 'Section for Haematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway. tor.henrik.anderson.tvedt@helse-bergen.no.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway. tor.henrik.anderson.tvedt@helse-bergen.no.', 'Section for Haematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@helse-bergen.no.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@helse-bergen.no.']",,20161111,,PMC6273124,['NOTNLM'],"['*PI3K-Akt-mTOR', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*cytokine release', '*membrane molecules', '*mesenchymal stem cells', '*monocytes', '*stem cell niche', '*therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, HTLV-1 and host interactions in the manifestation of HAM/TSP were evaluated. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 33 HAM/TSP patients and 38 HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (ACs). HTLV-1-Tax, HBZ gene expression, and proviral load (PVL) were assessed using the quantitative real-time PCR (TaqMan), host plasma neopterin level, and HLA-I, and the clinical manifestation were evaluated. RESULTS: The HTLV-1 PVLs in HAM/TSP and ACs were 306+/-360.741 copies/10(4) PBMCs and 250.98+/-629.94 copies/10(4) PBMCs, respectively; the PVL was higher in HAM/TSP than that in ACs (p=0.004). HTLV-1 Tax and HBZ expression in HAM/TSP was higher than that in ACs, wherein only the Tax expression was statistically significant (p=0.039). In contrast to Japanese HTLV-1-infected subjects, HLA-A*02, HLA-A*24, HLA-Cw*08, and HLA-B*5401 did not exhibit preventive effects for HAM/TSP manifestation. The plasma neopterin level was significantly higher in HAM/TSPs than that in ACs; furthermore, there was a strong significant correlation between plasma neopterin and PVL (R=0.76, p=0.001). Moreover, there were significant correlation between urinary disturbances and haematological indices, including the RBC count (R=-0.61, p=0.01) and Hematocrit (Ht) index (R=-0.75, p=0.002), and between mobility disturbances with Tax expression (R=-0.58, p=0.02) and WBC counts (R=-0.54, p=0.04), and finally, a significant association was found between the sensory disturbances and PVL (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: Overall, HTLV-1 PVL and Tax may be the valid predictors of disease development, and the neopterin level may be a valid predictor of disease progression. In addition, Tax and neopterin are more helpful than PVL for the monitoring of HTLV-1-infected patients.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: We retrospectively identified adult (>/=18 years old) leukemia patients with Enterococcus spp. bacteremia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) from 6/1/2013 to 7/22/2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility and previous antibiotic exposure within the 90 days prior to bacteremia were collected. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to identify the most significant breakpoint between daptomycin exposure and DNSEf. RESULTS: Any amount of daptomycin received within the 90 days preceding BSI was significantly associated with isolation of DNSEf compared to daptomycin susceptible E. faecium (DSEf) (88% vs. 44%, respectively, p < 0.01). CART analysis identified receiving >/=13 days of daptomycin in the preceding 90 days as most significantly correlated with DNSEf (60% vs. 11%, relative risk [RR] 5.31, 95% Confidence interval [CI] 2.36-11.96, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Prior daptomycin exposure for >/=13 days within 90 days preceding BSI was significantly associated with isolation of DNSEf BSI in adult leukemia patients at our institution.

It is necessary to rationalize a meta analysis of all available data to clarify the prognostic role of miR-9. Eligible studies were selected through multiple search strategies and the quality was assessed by MOOSE. Data was extracted from studies according to the key statistics index. All analyses were performed using STATA software. Twenty studies were selected in the meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic role of miR-9 in multiple tumors. MiR-9 expression level was an independent prognostic biomarker for OS in tumor patients using multivariate and univariate analyses. High expression levels of miR-9 was demonstrated to associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.23, 95 % CI: 1.56-3.17, P < 0.05) and recurrence free survival/progress free survival (RFS/PFS) (HR = 2.08, 95 % CI: 1.33-3.27, P < 0.05).

HTLV-1 protease, a member of aspartic acid protease family, plays important roles in maturation during virus replication cycle. The impairment of these proteases results in uninfectious HTLV-1virions.Similar to HIV-1protease deliberate mutations that confer drug resistance on HTLV-1 are frequently seen in this protease. Therefore, inhibition of HTLV-1 protease activity is expected to disrupt HTLV-1's ability to replicate and infect additional cells. In this study, we initially designed fifteen inhibitory compounds based on the conformations of a class of HIV-1 aspartyl protease inhibitors, sulfonamid-peptoid. Five compounds were chosen based on the goodness of their Drug-Likeness scoreusing ""Lipinsk's rule of five"". Here, using protein-ligand docking approach we compared the inhibitory constants of these compounds to those available in literatures and observed significantly higher inhibition for two compounds, SP-4 and SP-5. Our data suggest that the addition of two cyclic hydrocarbons to both ends of sulfonamide peptoids leads to the formation of new hydrophobic interactions due to the semi-circular form of these compounds, connecting the first chain of protease to the two ends of tested ligands via Hydrophobic interactions. We conclude that hydrophobic force plays an important role in suppressing protease activity especially for HTLV-1 protease, which in turn prevents the virus maturity. Therefore, designing and development of new ligands based on aromatic hydrocarbons in both ends of inhibitors is very promising for efficient treatment.",,"['Kheirabadi, Mitra', 'Maleki, Javad', 'Soufian, Safieh', 'Hosseini, Samaneh']","['Kheirabadi M', 'Maleki J', 'Soufian S', 'Hosseini S']","['Basic Science Department, Faculty of Biology, Hakim Sabzevary University, Sabzevar, Iran.', 'Basic Science Department, Faculty of Biology, Hakim Sabzevary University, Sabzevar, Iran.', 'Biology Department, Payame Noor University, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.']",,,,PMC5019330,['NOTNLM'],"['Docking', 'Drug design', 'HIV protease', 'HTLV-1 protease', 'Molecular dynamics simulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But there were few studies about association of immune related genes such as killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). Thus we intend to perform a meta-analysis to find the association of different genes of KIR and susceptibility to be affected by colorectal cancer. The overall population of the four studies investigated in our meta-analysis was 953 individuals (470 individuals with colorectal cancer and 483 individuals in control groups). After the analyses, we concluded that colorectal cancer is affected by KIR2DS5 and also there were no protecting gene. This result shows the inflammatory basis of this cancer. In other words, in contrast to leukemia and blood cancers, colorectal cancers seem to be affected by hyper activity of natural killer-cells (NKs).

Although not curative, PI3Kdelta inhibitors (PI3Kdeltai) demonstrate impressive clinical efficacy and, alongside other signaling inhibitors, are revolutionizing the treatment of hematological malignancies. However, only limited in vivo data are available regarding their mechanism of action. With the rising number of novel treatments, the challenge is to identify combinations that deliver curative regimes. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism is required to guide these selections. Currently, immunomodulation, inhibition of B-cell receptor signaling, chemokine/cytokine signaling and apoptosis represent potential therapeutic mechanisms for PI3Kdeltai. Here we characterize the molecular mechanisms responsible for PI3Kdeltai-induced apoptosis in an in vivo model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In vitro, PI3Kdeltai-induced substantive apoptosis and disrupted microenvironment-derived signaling in murine (Emu-Tcl1) and human (CLL) leukemia cells. Furthermore, PI3Kdeltai imparted significant therapeutic responses in Emu-Tcl1-bearing animals and enhanced anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy. Responses correlated with upregulation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim. Accordingly, Bim(-/-) Emu-Tcl1 Tg leukemias demonstrated resistance to PI3Kdeltai-induced apoptosis were refractory to PI3Kdeltai in vivo and failed to display combination efficacy with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy. Therefore, Bim-dependent apoptosis represents a key in vivo therapeutic mechanism for PI3Kdeltai, both alone and in combination therapy regimes.",,"['Carter, M J', 'Cox, K L', 'Blakemore, S J', 'Turaj, A H', 'Oldham, R J', 'Dahal, L N', 'Tannheimer, S', 'Forconi, F', 'Packham, G', 'Cragg, M S']","['Carter MJ', 'Cox KL', 'Blakemore SJ', 'Turaj AH', 'Oldham RJ', 'Dahal LN', 'Tannheimer S', 'Forconi F', 'Packham G', 'Cragg MS']","['Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK.', 'Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK.', 'Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK.', 'Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK.', 'Gilead Sciences Inc., Foster City, CA, USA.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK.']","['C34999/A18087/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C24563/A15581/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",20161115,,PMC5467045,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such improvements have been particularly observed after administration of T-replete HSCT graft associated to an in vivo T cell depletion by the administration of high-doses of cyclophosphamide (HD-Cy) after transplantation. Here, we have analyzed the results of haplo-identical T replete HSC transplants, in particular, when performed with post-transplant HD-Cy in order to provide recommendations for the clinical practice. Criteria of choice for a haploidentical donor by priority order are absence of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) and to prioritize: CMV seronegative recipient/donor couples, ABO matching in case of deserythrocytation, male donor for a male recipient, the youngest donor. There is no clear argument in favor of the use of bone marrow versus peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) after non myeloablative conditioning regimen, while after ablative conditioning PBSC seem to be associated with higher risks of GVHD without obvious impact on survival. Results of haploidentical HSCT, confirmed by several groups, are interesting in lymphomas (in particular Hodgkin disease) and for acute leukemia. Outcomes of patients rely on age, disease status at transplant and conditioning intensity. At equivalent disease risk, results of haploidentical HSCT seem comparable to those of HLA matched HSCT, raising the question of the classification of such transplants as alternatives. In all cases, we recommend to include patients in prospective clinical trials.","['Copyright A(c) 2016 Societe Francaise du Cancer. Published by Elsevier Masson', 'SAS.

The urokinase (urokinase-type plasminogen activator, uPA) and its receptor uPAR have been identified as preferential target candidates since they play a key role in the evolution of neoplasms and are associated with neoplasm aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome in several different tumor types. RESULTS: To selectively target uPAR over-expressing cancer cells, we prepared a set of chimeric proteins (ATF-SAP) formed by the human amino terminal fragments (ATF) of uPA and the plant ribosome inactivating protein saporin (SAP). Codon-usage optimization was used to increase the expression levels of the chimera in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. We then moved the bioprocess to bioreactors and demonstrated that the fed-batch production of the recombinant protein can be successfully achieved, obtaining homogeneous discrete batches of the desired constructs. We also determined the cytotoxic activity of the obtained batch of ATF-SAP which was specifically cytotoxic for U937 leukemia cells, while another construct containing a catalytically inactive mutant form of SAP showed no activity.

However, few validation studies of cancer registry data have been conducted, particularly among children. We therefore aimed to determine the validity of pediatric diagnostic data in the Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR). METHODS: All children diagnosed with any malignancy between 2000-2011 in Ontario, Canada were identified through the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario Networked Information System (POGONIS), a pediatric cancer registry actively maintained by trained data managers, and linked to the OCR. International Classification of Diseases for Oncology codes for each patient were taken from the OCR and converted to International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC-3) diagnostic groups and subgroups using published algorithms. OCR-based ICCC-3 groupings were then validated by comparing them to gold standard diagnostic information from POGONIS. RESULTS: A total of 4448 patients met inclusion criteria; 4073 (91.6 %) were successfully linked to the OCR. Diagnostic accuracy was excellent for many childhood solid tumors. For example, the OCR correctly identified all cases of retinoblastoma [kappa = 1.00, 95(th) confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.00] and nearly all cases of neuroblastoma (kappa = 0.97, 95(th) CI 0.96-0.99). Hematologic and central nervous system (CNS) cancers, the most common childhood malignancies, were however often misclassified with inferior kappas (acute lymphoblastic leukemia - 0.77, 95(th) CI 0.75-0.80; Burkitt lymphoma - 0.02, 95(th) CI 0.02-0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Misclassification of common pediatric hematologic and CNS cancers was significant and may lead to inaccurate incidence and survival estimates using cancer registry data.

Many somatic variant callers have been developed yet accurate ascertainment of somatic variants remains a considerable challenge as evidenced by the varying mutation call rates and low concordance among callers. Statistical model-based algorithms that are currently available perform well under ideal scenarios, such as high sequencing depth, homogeneous tumor samples, high somatic variant allele frequency (VAF), but show limited performance with sub-optimal data such as low-pass whole-exome/genome sequencing data. While the goal of any cancer sequencing project is to identify a relevant, and limited, set of somatic variants for further sequence/functional validation, the inherently complex nature of cancer genomes combined with technical issues directly related to sequencing and alignment can affect either the specificity and/or sensitivity of most callers. RESULTS: For these reasons, we developed SNooPer, a versatile machine learning approach that uses Random Forest classification models to accurately call somatic variants in low-depth sequencing data. SNooPer uses a subset of variant positions from the sequencing output for which the class, true variation or sequencing error, is known to train the data-specific model. Here, using a real dataset of 40 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, we show how the SNooPer algorithm is not affected by low coverage or low VAFs, and can be used to reduce overall sequencing costs while maintaining high specificity and sensitivity to somatic variant calling. When compared to three benchmarked somatic callers, SNooPer demonstrated the best overall performance. CONCLUSIONS: While the goal of any cancer sequencing project is to identify a relevant, and limited, set of somatic variants for further sequence/functional validation, the inherently complex nature of cancer genomes combined with technical issues directly related to sequencing and alignment can affect either the specificity and/or sensitivity of most callers. The flexibility of SNooPer's random forest protects against technical bias and systematic errors, and is appealing in that it does not rely on user-defined parameters.

Epub 2016 Dec 16.,10.1089/scd.2016.0108 [doi],"The development of a mammalian brain is a complex and long-lasting process. Not surprisingly, preterm birth is the leading cause of death in newborns and children. Advances in perinatal care reduced mortality, but morbidity still represents a major burden. New therapeutic approaches are thus desperately needed. Given that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) emerged as a promising candidate for cell therapy, we transplanted MSCs derived from the Wharton's Jelly (WJ-MSCs) to reduce the burden of immature brain injury in a murine animal model. WJ-MSCs transplantation resulted in protective activity characterized by reduced myelin loss and astroglial activation. WJ-MSCs improved locomotor behavior as well. To address the underlying mechanisms, we tested the key regulators of responses to DNA-damaging agents, such as cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase/calcium-dependent protein kinase (PKA/PKC), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated/ATM- and Rad3-related (ATM/ATR) substrates, protein kinase B (Akt), and 14-3-3 binding protein partners.

Epub 2016 Nov 14.,10.1038/nm.4210 [doi],"Although the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) initially respond to chemotherapy, many of them subsequently relapse, and the mechanistic basis for AML persistence following chemotherapy has not been determined. Recurrent somatic mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), most frequently at arginine 882 (DNMT3A(R882)), have been observed in AML and in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis in the absence of leukemic transformation. Patients with DNMT3A(R882) AML have an inferior outcome when treated with standard-dose daunorubicin-based induction chemotherapy, suggesting that DNMT3A(R882) cells persist and drive relapse. We found that Dnmt3a mutations induced hematopoietic stem cell expansion, cooperated with mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (Flt3(ITD)) and the nucleophosmin gene (Npm1(c)) to induce AML in vivo, and promoted resistance to anthracycline chemotherapy. In patients with AML, the presence of DNMT3A(R882) mutations predicts minimal residual disease, underscoring their role in AML chemoresistance. DNMT3A(R882) cells showed impaired nucleosome eviction and chromatin remodeling in response to anthracycline treatment, which resulted from attenuated recruitment of histone chaperone SPT-16 following anthracycline exposure. This defect led to an inability to sense and repair DNA torsional stress, which resulted in increased mutagenesis. Our findings identify a crucial role for DNMT3A(R882) mutations in driving AML chemoresistance and highlight the importance of chromatin remodeling in response to cytotoxic chemotherapy.",,"['Guryanova, Olga A', 'Shank, Kaitlyn', 'Spitzer, Barbara', 'Luciani, Luisa', 'Koche, Richard P', 'Garrett-Bakelman, Francine E', 'Ganzel, Chezi', 'Durham, Benjamin H', 'Mohanty, Abhinita', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Rivera, Sharon A', 'Chramiec, Alan G', 'Pronier, Elodie', 'Bastian, Lennart', 'Keller, Matthew D', 'Tovbin, Daniel', 'Loizou, Evangelia', 'Weinstein, Abby R', 'Gonzalez, Adriana Rodriguez', 'Lieu, Yen K', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Pastore, Friederike', 'McKenney, Anna Sophia', 'Krivtsov, Andrei V', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Cross, Justin R', 'Mason, Christopher E', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Arcila, Maria E', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Kubicek, Stefan', 'Staber, Philipp B', 'Gonen, Mithat', 'Paietta, Elisabeth M', 'Melnick, Ari M', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Mukherjee, Siddhartha', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Guryanova OA', 'Shank K', 'Spitzer B', 'Luciani L', 'Koche RP', 'Garrett-Bakelman FE', 'Ganzel C', 'Durham BH', 'Mohanty A', 'Hoermann G', 'Rivera SA', 'Chramiec AG', 'Pronier E', 'Bastian L', 'Keller MD', 'Tovbin D', 'Loizou E', 'Weinstein AR', 'Gonzalez AR', 'Lieu YK', 'Rowe JM', 'Pastore F', 'McKenney AS', 'Krivtsov AV', 'Sperr WR', 'Cross JR', 'Mason CE', 'Tallman MS', 'Arcila ME', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Armstrong SA', 'Kubicek S', 'Staber PB', 'Gonen M', 'Paietta EM', 'Melnick AM', 'Nimer SD', 'Mukherjee S', 'Levine RL']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Diagnostic Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Irving Cancer Research Center, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Comprehensive Cancer Center Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Donald B. and Catherine C.

Palindromic consensus nucleotide sequences are also found at the genomic integration sites of retroviruses(2-6) and other transposable elements(7-9), and it has been suggested that this palindromic consensus arises as a consequence of the structural symmetry in the integrase complex(2,3). However, we show here that the palindromic consensus sequence is not present in individual integration sites of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but arises in the population average as a consequence of the existence of a non-palindromic nucleotide motif that occurs in approximately equal proportions on the plus strand and the minus strand of the host genome. We develop a generally applicable algorithm to sort the individual integration site sequences into plus-strand and minus-strand subpopulations, and use this to identify the integration site nucleotide motifs of five retroviruses of different genera: HTLV-1, HIV-1, murine leukaemia virus (MLV), avian sarcoma leucosis virus (ASLV) and prototype foamy virus (PFV).

In this review, we highlight the recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of infant ALL and discuss opportunities for translating these findings into clinical trials. RECENT FINDINGS: Infant ALL can be divided into two major disease types, defined by the presence or absence of KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement (KMT2A-R). Recent molecular profiling studies have found that infant ALL with KMT2A-R is an epigenomic disease that lacks other somatic driver mutations. Strategies to intensify therapy have not improved survival for infants with KMT2A-R ALL. In contrast, infant ALL without KMT2A-R is more similar to ALL of older children and survival has improved modestly with intensification of chemotherapy. Discovery of clonal molecular markers that predict chemoresistance will allow further risk classification and development of novel treatment strategies. Modern clinical trials are integrating molecularly targeted therapies into the treatment of infant ALL. SUMMARY: Advances in molecular profiling and integration of targeted therapy have the potential to reduce toxicity and improve survival for infants with ALL.",,"['Guest, Erin M', 'Stam, Ronald W']","['Guest EM', 'Stam RW']","[""aDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri, USA bPrincess Maxima Center for Paediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Principle illustrations are encouraging results with engineered T cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). This experimental therapy is developing simultaneously in pediatric and adult clinical trials, making this field particularly relevant and exciting for pediatric oncologists. RECENT FINDINGS: CAR-modified T cells targeting CD19 have produced dramatic antitumor responses in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Clinical trials from several institutions, in both children and adults, using distinct CAR T cell products have demonstrated similar high complete remission rates of 61-93%, with durable remissions observed. Although the development of CARs for other malignancies has lagged behind, research into novel approaches to overcome inherent challenges is promising. SUMMARY: Clinical trials of CAR-modified T cells have produced unprecedented results and are anticipated to have a broader impact as this approach expands into other indications, including other cancers and frontline therapy.

METHODS: A lifetime partitioned survival model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nilotinib vs dasatinib, which included four health states: CP on treatment, CP post-discontinuation, progressive disease (accelerated phase [AP] or blast crisis [BC]), and death. Time on treatment, progression-free survival, and overall survival of nilotinib and dasatinib were estimated using real-world comparative effectiveness data. Parametric survival models were used to extrapolate outcomes beyond the study period. Drug treatment costs, medical costs, and adverse event costs were obtained from the literature and publicly available databases. Utilities of health states were derived from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, including incremental cost per life-year (LY) gained and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, were estimated comparing nilotinib and dasatinib. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed by varying patient characteristics, cost, and utility inputs. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, nilotinib-treated patients were associated with 11.7 LYs, 9.1 QALYs, and a total cost of $1,409,466, while dasatinib-treated patients were associated with 9.5 LYs, 7.3 QALYs, and a total cost of $1,422,122. In comparison with dasatinib, nilotinib was associated with better health outcomes (by 2.2 LYs and 1.9 QALYs) and lower total costs (by $12,655). Deterministic sensitivity analysis results showed consistent findings in most scenarios. LIMITATIONS: In the absence of long-term real-world data, the lifetime projection could not be validated. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with dasatinib, second-line nilotinib was associated with better life expectancy, better quality-of-life, and lower costs among patients with Ph+ CML-CP who were resistant or intolerant to imatinib.",,"['Li, Nanxin', 'Yang, Xi', 'Fan, Liangyi', 'Totev, Todor', 'Guerin, Annie', 'Chen, Lei', 'Bhattacharyya, Subrata', 'Joseph, George']","['Li N', 'Yang X', 'Fan L', 'Totev T', 'Guerin A', 'Chen L', 'Bhattacharyya S', 'Joseph G']","['a Analysis Group , Boston , MA , USA.', 'a Analysis Group , Boston , MA , USA.', 'a Analysis Group , Boston , MA , USA.', 'a Analysis Group , Boston , MA , USA.', 'b Analysis Group , Montreal , QC , Canada.', 'c Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation , East Hanover , NJ , USA.', 'd Novartis Healthcare Pvt.

Characteristics of ALT cells include C-circles and ALT-associated PML bodies, referred to as APBs. The function of TRF1 is tightly regulated by post-translational modification including phosphorylation, however TRF1 phosphorylation sites have yet to be fully characterized. Here we report a novel TRF1 phosphorylation site threonine 271. We show that a nonphosphorylatable mutation of T271A impairs TRF1 binding to telomeric DNA in vivo and renders TRF1 defective in inhibiting telomerase-dependent telomere elongation. On the other hand, TRF1 carrying a phosphomimic mutation of T271D is competent in not only binding to telomeric DNA but also inhibiting telomerase-mediated telomere lengthening. These results suggest that TRF1 phosphorylation on T271 negatively regulates telomerase-mediated telomere maintenance. We find that in telomerase-negative ALT cells, TRF1 carrying either a T271A or T271D mutation is able to promote C-circle production but fails to support APB formation. These results suggest that TRF1 phosphorylation on T271 is necessary for APB formation but dispensable for C-circle production.

We further showed that the reduction in Ras protein expression resulted in attenuated MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt signalling activities, leading to the activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Notably, complex 1 increased the sensitivity of MOLT-4 cells to cisplatin and vice versa.

Previous studies have shown that, in primary leukemia cells of patients with APL, the cleavage of PMLRARalpha by neutrophil elastase is important for its ability to initiate APL. This cleavage separates the nuclear localization signal (NLS) from PML, leading to the formation of a novel protein, NLSRARalpha, although its underlying mechanism in APL remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the role of NLSRARalpha on the proliferation and differentiation of APL NB4 cells was investigated. Lentiviral vectors were constructed and transfected NLSRARalpha in NB4 cells, puromycin was used to select the stable transfected cell lines. Cell Counting Kit8 and flow cytometry analysis revealed that the efficient overexpression of NLSRARalpha significantly promoted NB4 cell proliferation and inhibited alltrans retinoic acidinduced cell differentiation. Furthermore, the NLSRARalpha protein promoted a significant increase in AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) phosphorylation. The protein levels of phosphorylated (p) AKT and pGSK3beta were decreased following pretreatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002.

In the present study, we showed that in comparison with healthy controls, the expression of four centrosomal genes (AURKA, HMMR, PLK1 and ESPL1) in the peripheral blood of CML patients was significantly enhanced at diagnosis and decreased to the basal level in most patients treated with imatinib mesylate for three months. In the remaining patients (17%), this decrease was delayed and was associated with worse overall survival. The detection of antibodies in sera showed that patients with higher overall antibody production had superior outcomes in terms of achieving major molecular response and failure-free survival.

In addition to the synergistic effect of ATRA plus VPA on HL-60 cells, the optimal concentration of 1 mM VPA plus 0.5 microM ATRA increased the cytotoxic sensitivity of HL-60 cells to NK cells. The expression of the activated receptors NKp30 and NKG2D on NK-92 cells was higher compared with the levels noted for the other receptors, and the expression of NKG2D ligands MICA/B on HL-60 cells was not significantly upregulated in the ATRA plus VPA goup compared with the control. Moreover, it was observed that the ligands of NKp30 on HL-60 cells presented the same variation trend. As to the co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules on NK-92 and their ligands on HL-60 cells post exposure to ATRA and VPA alone or their combination, there was no obvious change in the expression of CD112, CD48 and CD70 on the HL-60 cells. However, the expression of CD54 on HL-60 cells was significantly upregulated. In contrast, the expression of NKG2A ligands HLA-ABC on HL-60 cells was obviously downregulated. In addition, the expression of HLA-E on the HL-60 cells in the group treated with ATRA plus VPA was not significantly increased. In conclusion, the combination of VPA and ATRA not only induced the differentiation of HL-60 cells, but also induced enhancement of the sensitivity of HL-60 cells to NK cells by downregulating the expression of HLA-ABC and upregulating the expression of CD54, but not MICA/MICB.

Although identification of new uses of existing drugs has been recognized as a more efficient approach for drug discovery than development of novel drugs, little screening of drugs that might be used for a rare malignant tumor such as osteosarcoma (OS) has been performed. In this study, we attempted to identify new molecular targeted agents for OS by employing Screening Committee of Anticancer Drugs (SCADS) kits. To screen compounds for OS treatment, their effect on cell viability of the OS cell lines 143B, MG63, HOS, SAOS-2, and HUO9 were evaluated. Candidate drugs were narrowed down based on a global anti-proliferative effect against these five OS cell lines. After excluding cytotoxic compounds and compounds unsuitable for in vivo administration, cucurbitacin I was extracted. Cucurbitacin I has been found to have cytotoxic and anti-proliferative properties against several tumors through inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation. Cucurbitacin I dose- and time-dependently inhibited the proliferation of all five OS cell lines. Following cucurbitacin I treatment, STAT3 was inactivated and analysis of Mcl-1, cleaved PARP and caspase-3 indicated apoptosis induction. Expression of cell cycle regulator proteins, such as phospho-cyclin D1, c-Myc and survivin, were suppressed. Finally, cucurbitacin I potently inhibited the tumor growth of human OS 143B cells in nude mice. Our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that STAT3 inhibition by cucurbitacin I will be an effective and new approach for the treatment of OS.",,"['Oi, Toru', 'Asanuma, Kunihiro', 'Matsumine, Akihiko', 'Matsubara, Takao', 'Nakamura, Tomoki', 'Iino, Takahiro', 'Asanuma, Yumiko', 'Goto, Mikinobu', 'Okuno, Kazuma', 'Kakimoto, Takuya', 'Yada, Yuki', 'Sudo, Akihiro']","['Oi T', 'Asanuma K', 'Matsumine A', 'Matsubara T', 'Nakamura T', 'Iino T', 'Asanuma Y', 'Goto M', 'Okuno K', 'Kakimoto T', 'Yada Y', 'Sudo A']","['Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",,20161103,,PMC5117998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two transmission routes (from mother to child and via sexual intercourse) favor familial clustering of HTLV-1. It is yet unknown why most HTLV-1 carriers remain asymptomatic while about 10% of them develop complications. HTLV-1 associated diseases were originally described as sporadic entities, but familial presentations have been reported. To explore what is known about family aggregation of HTLV-1-associated diseases we undertook a systematic review. We aimed at answering whether, when, and where family aggregation of HTLV-1-associated diseases was reported, which relatives were affected and which hypotheses were proposed to explain aggregation. We searched MEDLINE, abstract books of HTLV conferences and reference lists of selected papers. Search terms used referred to HTLV-1 infection, and HTLV-1-associated diseases, and family studies. HTLV-1-associated diseases considered are adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), HTLV-1-associated uveitis, and infective dermatitis. Seventy-four records reported HTLV-1-associated diseases in more than one member of the same family and were included. Most reports came from HTLV-1-endemic countries, mainly Japan (n = 30) and Brazil (n = 10). These reports described a total of 270 families in which more than one relative had HTLV-1-associated diseases. In most families, different family members suffered from the same disease (n = 223). The diseases most frequently reported were ATLL (115 families) and HAM/TSP (102 families). Most families (n = 144) included two to four affected individuals. The proportion of ATLL patients with family history of ATLL ranged from 2 to 26%. The proportion of HAM/TSP patients with family history of HAM/TSP ranged from 1 to 48%. The predominant cluster types for ATLL were clusters of siblings and parent-child pairs and for HAM/TSP, an affected parent with one or more affected children. The evidence in the literature, although weak, does suggest that HTLV-1-associated diseases sometimes cluster in families. Whether familial transmission of HTLV-1 is the only determining factor, or whether other factors are also involved, needs further research.",,"['Alvarez, Carolina', 'Gotuzzo, Eduardo', 'Vandamme, Anne-Mieke', 'Verdonck, Kristien']","['Alvarez C', 'Gotuzzo E', 'Vandamme AM', 'Verdonck K']","['Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt, Universidad Peruana Cayetano HerediaLima, Peru; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven-University of LeuvenLeuven, Belgium.', 'Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt, Universidad Peruana Cayetano HerediaLima, Peru; Departamento de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Tropicales y Dermatologicas, Hospital Cayetano HerediaLima, Peru.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven-University of LeuvenLeuven, Belgium; Center for Global Health and Tropical Medicine, Unidade de Microbiologia, Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical, Universidade Nova de LisboaLisbon, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt, Universidad Peruana Cayetano HerediaLima, Peru; Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine AntwerpAntwerp, Belgium.']",,20161028,,PMC5083714,['NOTNLM'],"['adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma', 'family research', 'human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'systematic review', 'tropical spastic paraparesis', 'uveitis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified the L265P hotspot mutation in 86% (n=67/78) of our LPL and 2% (n=12/767) of our CLL cohort. Importantly, in CLL (n=5), but also in LPL (n=4) other MYD88 mutations were identified. MYD88-mutated LPL was characterized by CXCR4 mutations (25%) and del(6q) (19%), whereas both aberrations were absent in the MYD88-unmutated LPL cases. MYD88-mutated CLL formed a prognostically favorable subset with a high frequency of del(13q), mutated IGHV status and no adverse aberrations (del(11q), del(17p), TP53 mutations). MYD88-mutated CLL differed from LPL with respect to cytogenetic aberrations and the absence of CXCR4 mutations. In both entities, based on mutation load evaluation, MYD88 mutations were found to be present in the stem clone in each case, whereas CXCR4 (LPL) and SF3B1 (CLL) mutations also occurred in subclones only.",,"['Baer, C', 'Dicker, F', 'Kern, W', 'Haferlach, T', 'Haferlach, C']","['Baer C', 'Dicker F', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",,20161114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of JUN decreases AML cell survival and propagation in vivo. By performing RNA sequencing analysis, we discovered that JUN inhibition reduces the transcriptional output of the unfolded protein response (UPR), an intracellular signaling transduction network activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Specifically, we found that JUN is activated by MEK signaling in response to ER stress, and that JUN binds to the promoters of several key UPR effectors, such as XBP1 and ATF4, to activate their transcription and allow AML cells to properly negotiate ER stress. In addition, we observed that shRNA-mediated inhibition of XBP1 or ATF4 induces AML cell apoptosis and significantly extends disease latency in vivo tying the reduced survival mediated by JUN inhibition to the loss of pro-survival UPR signaling. These data uncover a previously unrecognized role of JUN as a regulator of the UPR as well as provide key new insights into the how ER stress responses contribute to AML and identify JUN and the UPR as promising therapeutic targets in this disease.",,"['Zhou, C', 'Martinez, E', 'Di Marcantonio, D', 'Solanki-Patel, N', 'Aghayev, T', 'Peri, S', 'Ferraro, F', 'Skorski, T', 'Scholl, C', 'Frohling, S', 'Balachandran, S', 'Wiest, D L', 'Sykes, S M']","['Zhou C', 'Martinez E', 'Di Marcantonio D', 'Solanki-Patel N', 'Aghayev T', 'Peri S', 'Ferraro F', 'Skorski T', 'Scholl C', 'Frohling S', 'Balachandran S', 'Wiest DL', 'Sykes SM']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, NCT Heidelberg, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, NCT Heidelberg, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Blood Cell Development and Function Program, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']","['P30 CA006927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA158461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20161114,,PMC5473421,,,,,,['NIHMS864310'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of the DOT1-like histone H3K79 methyltransferase (DOT1L) is a specific therapeutic approach for such leukemias that is currently being tested in clinical trials. However, in most MLL-rearranged leukemia models responses to DOT1L inhibitors are limited. Here, we performed deep-coverage short hairpin RNA sensitizer screens in DOT1L inhibitor-treated MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines and discovered that targeting additional nodes of MLL complexes concomitantly with DOT1L inhibition bears great potential for superior therapeutic results. Most notably, combination of a DOT1L inhibitor with an inhibitor of the MLL-Menin interaction markedly enhanced induction of differentiation and cell killing in various MLL disease models including primary leukemia cells, while sparing normal hematopoiesis and leukemias without MLL rearrangements. Gene expression analysis on human and murine leukemic cells revealed that target genes of MLL-fusion proteins and MYC were suppressed more profoundly upon combination treatment.

Here we show that the interaction between leukemia-associated mutant Shp2 and Gab2, a scaffolding protein important for cytokine-induced PI3K/Akt signaling, was enhanced, and that the mTOR pathway was elevated in Ptpn11(E76K/+) leukemic cells. Importantly, MPN induced by the Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation was markedly attenuated in Ptpn11(E76K/+)/Gab2(-/-) double mutant mice-overproduction of myeloid cells was alleviated, splenomegaly was diminished and myeloid cell infiltration in nonhematopoietic organs was decreased in these double mutants. Excessive myeloid differentiation of stem cells was also normalized by depletion of Gab2. Acute leukemia progression of MPN was reduced in the double mutant mice and, as such, their survival was much prolonged. Furthermore, treatment of Ptpn11(E76K/+) mice with Rapamycin, a specific and potent mTOR inhibitor, mitigated MPN phenotypes.

In response to this situation, the Global Virus Network launched a taskforce in 2014 to develop new methods of prevention and treatment of HTLV-1 infection and promote basic research. HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of two life-threatening diseases, adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, for which no effective therapy is currently available. Although the modes of transmission of HTLV-1 resemble those of the more familiar HIV-1, routine diagnostic methods are generally unavailable to support the prevention of new infections. In the present article, the Taskforce proposes a series of actions to expand epidemiological studies; increase research on mechanisms of HTLV-1 persistence, replication and pathogenesis; discover effective treatments; and develop prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

HTT interacts with large number of proteins, although the preference for such interactions with wild type or mutated HTT protein remains largely unknown. HYPK, an intrinsically unstructured protein chaperone and interactor of mutant HTT was found to interact with myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1) and 2 (MLF2). To identify the role of these two proteins in mutant HTT mediated aggregate formation and toxicity in a cell model, both the proteins were found to preferentially interact with the mutated N-terminal HTT. They significantly reduced the number of cells containing mutant HTT aggregates and subsequent apoptosis in Neuro2A cells. Additionally, in FRAP assay, mobile fraction of mutant HTT aggregates was increased in the presence of MLF1 or MLF2. Further, MLF1 could release transcription factors like p53, CBP and CREB from mutant HTT aggregates. Moreover, in HeLa cell co-expressing mutant HTT exon1 and full length MLF1, p53 was released from the aggregates, leading to the recovery of the expression of the GADD45A transcript, a p53 regulated gene. Taking together, these results showed that MLF1 and MLF2 modulated the formation of aggregates and induction of apoptosis as well as the expressions of genes indirectly.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we show that mechanically vibrating a cell in a specific oscillation condition can significantly promote necrosis. Specifically, oscillating the cell by a low-power laser trap at specific frequencies of a few Hz was found to result in increased death rate of 50% or above in different types of myelogenous leukemia cells, while normal leukocytes showed very little response to similar laser manipulations. The alteration of cell membrane permeability and cell volume, detected from ethidium bromide staining and measurement of intracellular sodium ion concentration, together with the observed membrane blebbing within 10min, suggest cell necrosis. Mechanics modelling reveals severe distortion of the cytoskeleton cortex at frequencies in the same range for peaked cell death. The disruption of cell membrane leading to cell death is therefore due to the cortex distortion, and the frequency at which this becomes significant is cell-type specific. Our findings lay down a new concept for treating leukemia based on vibration induced disruption of membrane in targeted malignant cells.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Replicative stress and cytokines promote signaling cascades that lead to the co-regulation of p53 and NF-kappaB. Consequently, nuclear p53/NF-kappaB signaling complexes activate NF-kappaB-dependent survival genes. The 18 histone deacetylases (HDACs) are epigenetic modulators that fall into four classes (I-IV). Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACi) become increasingly appreciated as anti-cancer agents. Based on their effects on p53 and NF-kappaB, we addressed whether clinically relevant HDACi affect the NF-kappaB/p53 crosstalk. The chemotherapeutics hydroxyurea, etoposide, and fludarabine halt cell cycle progression, induce DNA damage, and lead to DNA fragmentation. These agents co-induce p53 and NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression in cell lines from breast and colon cancer and in primary chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) cells. Using specific HDACi, we find that the class I subgroup of HDACs, but not the class IIb deacetylase HDAC6, are required for the hydroxyurea-induced crosstalk between p53 and NF-kappaB. HDACi decrease the basal and stress-induced expression of p53 and block NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression. We further show that class I HDACi induce senescence in pancreatic cancer cells with mutant p53.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Several genetic lesions can lead to the disease. One of these corresponds to the NUP98-HOXA9 (NA9) translocation that fuses sequences encoding the N-terminal part of NUP98 to those encoding the DNA-binding domain of HOXA9. Despite several studies, the mechanism underlying NA9 ability to induce leukemia is still unclear. To bridge this gap, we sought to functionally dissect NA9 activity using Drosophila. For this, we generated transgenic NA9 fly lines and expressed the oncoprotein during larval hematopoiesis. This markedly enhanced cell proliferation and tissue growth, but did not alter cell fate specification. Moreover, reminiscent to NA9 activity in mammals, strong cooperation was observed between NA9 and the MEIS homolog HTH. Genetic characterization of NA9-induced phenotypes suggested interference with PVR (Flt1-4 RTK homolog) signaling, which is similar to functional interactions observed in mammals between Flt3 and HOXA9 in leukemia. Finally, NA9 expression was also found to induce non-cell autonomous effects, raising the possibility that its leukemia-inducing activity also relies on this property. Together, our work suggests that NA9 ability to induce blood cell expansion is evolutionarily conserved. The amenability of NA9 activity to a genetically-tractable system should facilitate unraveling its molecular underpinnings.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report the case of a 64-year-old patient who was followed up on oncology because of an oropharyngeal cancer treated by a combined procedure of both surgery and radio-chemotherapy procedure. This patient developed an osteoradionecrosis of the jaw. In the vicinity of this necrotic area appeared an ulceration which could evoke a new necrotic area. Given the persistence of this ulceration, a biopsy was performed which highlighted a plasmablastic lymphoma oral localization. DISCUSSION: The plasmablastic lymphoma, belonging to the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma family, is a very aggressive and unusual form of cancer with poor prognosis. If it is found mainly in patients with positive HIV, in whom it was first described, it is also found in immunosuppressed patients such as transplanted patients or patients suffering from leukaemia.

Epub 2016 Nov 11.,10.1136/jclinpath-2016-204023 [doi],"AIMS: The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal haematopoietic stem cell disorders characterised by inefficient haematopoiesis and risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia. Metaphase cytogenetics is an extremely valuable clinical tool in the management of haematological malignancies. However, metaphase cytogenetics requires cellular proliferation, its sensitivity and resolution depends on the proportion of clonal cells in the sample and size of the lesion, respectively. Single-nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) does not depend on the presence of dividing cells, is able to detect copy number variations with a high resolution and to detect copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity or uniparental disomy (UPD). The aim of this study was to illustrate that the use of SNP-A can cover cryptic chromosomal lesions not identified by metaphase cytogenetics in patients with MDS. METHODS: Metaphase cytogenetics was performed on bone marrow aspirate using standard methods. Genomic DNA from total bone marrow cells were submitted to SNP-A using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP CytoScan HD. RESULTS: In our cohort of 15 patients with a diagnosis of MDS and related diseases, chromosomal abnormalities were found in 47% of the cases by SNP-A and in 33% by metaphase cytogenetics. SNP-A detected all lesions identified by metaphase cytogenetics, except a balanced translocation and a marker chromosome. Notably, SNP-A detected a total of 30 new lesions: 1 (3%) gain, 17 (57%) losses and 12 (40%) UPDs in 5 patients with MDS.

Epub 2016 Nov 10.,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-0131 [doi],"Splicing of precursor messenger RNA is a critical step in regulating gene expression, and major advances are being made in understanding the composition and structure of the enzymatic complex that performs splicing, which is termed the ""spliceosome."" In parallel, there has been increased appreciation for diverse mechanisms by which alterations in splicing contribute to cancer pathogenesis. Key among these include change-of-function mutations in genes encoding spliceosomal proteins. Such mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, making efforts to therapeutically target cells bearing these mutations critical. To this end, recent studies have clarified that pharmacologic modulation of splicing may be preferentially lethal for cells bearing spliceosomal mutations and may also have a role in the therapy of MYC-driven cancers. This has culminated in the initiation of a clinical trial of a novel oral spliceosome modulatory compound targeting the SF3B complex, and several novel alternative approaches to target splicing are in development as reviewed here. There is now, therefore, a great need to understand the mechanistic basis of altered spliceosomal function in cancers and to study the effects of spliceosomal modulatory compounds in preclinical settings and in well-designed clinical trials.

METHODS: We compared the outcome of AYA (19-30 years) patients with AML and PML and pediatric (0-18 years) patients with AML (pAMLs) and APL (pAPLs) utilizing the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-18 registry. Early mortality rate (EMR), defined as mortality within 1 month of diagnosis, was used as a surrogate for treatment-related mortality. Survival statistics were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression and the Cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS: A total of 6343 patients with AML were identified; 44.7% were AYAs. pAMLs had lower EMR (6.2% vs. 9.2%; P < .01) and higher overall survival (OS) (1-year, 70.3% vs. 62.1%; 5-year, 48.2% vs. 36.4%; P < .01). Nine hundred twenty patients with APL were also identified; 59.5% were AYAs. No statistically significant difference was found between AYAs with APL and pAPLs in EMR (11.4% vs. 14.1%; P = .23) and OS (1-year, 83.8% vs. 81.2%; P = .31 and 5-year, 68.2% vs. 73.1%; P = .11]. Comparing all patients with AML and APL, AYAs with APL and pAPLs had higher EMR (11.4% and 14.1% vs. 6.2% and 9.2%; P </= .01) but better OS than AYAs with AML and pAMLs (5-year OS, 68.2% and 73.1% vs. 48.2% and 36.4%; P </= .01). CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows AYAs with AML have worse EMR and OS compared with pAMLs. AYAs with APL and pAPLs have similar outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and risk factors of subsequent vitiligo after HSCT. METHODS: A nationwide, population-based cohort study was performed using the Korean National Health Insurance Claims Database from 2009 to 2013. All HSCT recipients who had undergone HSCT between 2010 and 2011 and not treatment for vitiligo in 2009 (to exclude preexisting active vitiligo) were included in the HSCT recipient group, and an age- and sex-matched control group without HSCT was also established. RESULTS: A total of 2747 HSCT recipients and 8241 controls were enrolled. Newly acquired vitiligo occurred in 1.06% of HSCT recipients between 2010 and 2013, and there was a significant increase (OR 3.130, 95% CI 1.859-5.271) in cases of vitiligo in HSCT recipients compared with controls (0.34%). Allogeneic HSCT (OR 5.593, 95% CI 1.628-19.213) and bone marrow-sourced stem cells (as compared with peripheral blood-sourced stem cells; OR 2.492, 95% CI 1.114-5.576) were independently associated with the development of vitiligo after HSCT. LIMITATIONS: Medical record review was not available. CONCLUSION: Vitiligo developed at a significantly increased rate after HSCT compared with controls.

Epub 2016 Nov 11.,,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been genetically characterized extensively and can now be subdivided into 9 to 11 pathogenetically different subtypes according to their profile of driver mutations. In clinical practice karyotyping and molecular analysis of NPM1, cEBPa and FLT3-ITD are required for treatment stratification and potentially genotype specific treatment. Some markers such as NPM1 not only offer prognostic information but can also serve as markers of minimal residual disease and thus have the potential to guide therapy in the future.The basis of curative treatment is intensive combination chemotherapy comprizing cytarabine and an anthracycline (""7 + 3"" regimen). The prolonged duration of aplasia can be reduced significantly by accelerated therapy (""S-HAM"" regimen). Following achievement of a complete remission patients with a low risk of relapse - based on genetic and clinical features - receive chemotherapy based consolidation therapy whereas high risk patients - and potentially also those with an intermediate risk - receive an allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Whereas adding the rather unspecific tyrosinekinase inhibitor sorafenib to standard treatment in unselected AML patients has not improved overall survival (OS), the addition of midostaurin to standard therapy in the selected group FLT3 mutated patients has resulted in a moderate but significant OS benefit.Real world data show that in patients below 50 years a cure rate of ca. 50 % can be achieved. However less than 10 % of patients above the age of 70 will be alive after five years even after intensive treatment. Therefore when curative and intensive treatment is deemed impossible the therapeutic standard in elderly and unfit patients used to be low-dose cytarabine with an average OS of 4 months. This has now been replaced by a new standard of care of hypomethylating agents - azacytidine and decitabine - which both achieve higher remission rates and show strong trends towards a prolonged OS of between 8 and 10 months.The paradigm for genotype-specific therapy is acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL - or AML M3 in the former FAB classification). This entity used to be a problematic AML subgroup because of its frequent coagulation disturbances and potentially fatal bleeding problems. Today patients with APL can be treated with a chemotherapy free combination of ATRA - a differentiating agent - and Arsenic Trioxide - an apoptosis inducing agent. In patients with a leukocyte count < 10 000 / microl a cure rate of > 90 % can now be achieved.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Our data revealed that with the ddPCR approach the incidence of NOTCH1mut in CLL was much higher (53.4%) than expected. However, longitudinal ddPCR analysis of CLL cases showed a statistically significant reduction of the NOTCH1mut FA detected at diagnosis after treatment (median FA 11.67 % vs 0.09 %, respectively, p = 0.01); the same difference, in terms of NOTCH1mut FA, was observed in the relapsed cases compared to the NOTCH1mut allelic fraction observed in patients in complete or partial remission (median FA 4.75% vs 0.43%, respectively, p = 0.007).

Although a high cure rate is observed in children, therapy resistance is often observed in adults and mechanisms leading to this resistance remain elusive. Utilizing public gene expression datasets, a fibrotic signature was detected in T-LBL but not T-ALL biopsies. Further, using a T-ALL cell line, CCRF-CEM (CEM) cells, we show that CEM cells induce pulmonary remodeling in immunocompromised mice, suggesting potential interaction between these cells and lung fibroblasts. Co-culture studies suggested that fibroblasts-induced phenotypic and genotypic divergence in co-cultured CEM cells leading to diminished therapeutic responses in vitro. Senescent rather than proliferating stromal cells induced these effects in CEM cells, due, in part, to the enhanced production of oxidative radicals and exosomes containing miRNAs targeting BRCA1 and components of the Mismatch Repair pathway (MMR). Collectively, our studies demonstrate that there may be bidirectional interaction between leukemic cells and stroma, where leukemic cells induce stromal development in vivo and senescent stromal cells generates genomic alterations in the leukemic cells rendering them therapeutic resistant. Thus, targeting senescent stroma might prove beneficial in T-ALL/LBL patients.",,"['Habiel, David M', 'Krepostman, Nicolas', 'Lilly, Michael', 'Cavassani, Karen', 'Coelho, Ana Lucia', 'Shibata, Takehiko', 'Elenitoba-Johnson, Kojo', 'Hogaboam, Cory M']","['Habiel DM', 'Krepostman N', 'Lilly M', 'Cavassani K', 'Coelho AL', 'Shibata T', 'Elenitoba-Johnson K', 'Hogaboam CM']","[""Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine & Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, 90048, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'SOCCI Cancer Institute, Urologic Oncology Research Program, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, 90048, USA.', ""Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine & Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, 90048, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.', ""Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine & Women's Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, 90048, USA.""]","['R01 HL123899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC2 HL101740/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007517/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC5347785,['NOTNLM'],"['T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'cancer microenvironment', 'oncogenesis', 'senescent fibroblasts']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A part of their DNA, called the V(D)J recombinations, is specific to each lymphocyte, and enables recognition of specific antigenes. Today, with new sequencing techniques, one can get billions of DNA sequences from these regions. With dedicated Repertoire Sequencing (RepSeq) methods, it is now possible to picture population of lymphocytes, and to monitor more accurately the immune response as well as pathologies such as leukemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vidjil is an open-source platform for the interactive analysis of high-throughput sequencing data from lymphocyte recombinations. It contains an algorithm gathering reads into clonotypes according to their V(D)J junctions, a web application made of a sample, experiment and patient database and a visualization for the analysis of clonotypes along the time. Vidjil is implemented in C++, Python and Javascript and licensed under the GPLv3 open-source license. Source code, binaries and a public web server are available at http://www.vidjil.org and at http://bioinfo.lille.inria.fr/vidjil. Using the Vidjil web application consists of four steps: 1. uploading a raw sequence file (typically a FASTQ); 2. running RepSeq analysis software; 3. visualizing the results; 4. annotating the results and saving them for future use. For the end-user, the Vidjil web application needs no specific installation and just requires a connection and a modern web browser. Vidjil is used by labs in hematology or immunology for research and clinical applications.",,"['Duez, Marc', 'Giraud, Mathieu', 'Herbert, Ryan', 'Rocher, Tatiana', 'Salson, Mikael', 'Thonier, Florian']","['Duez M', 'Giraud M', 'Herbert R', 'Rocher T', 'Salson M', 'Thonier F']","['School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'SIRIC ONCOLille, 59000 Lille, France.', 'Universite de Lille, CNRS, UMR 9189 - CRIStAL - Centre de Recherche en Informatique Signal et Automatique de Lille, 59000 Lille, France.', ""Inria Lille, 59650 Villeneuve d'Ascq, France."", 'Universite de Lille, CNRS, UMR 9189 - CRIStAL - Centre de Recherche en Informatique Signal et Automatique de Lille, 59000 Lille, France.', ""Inria Lille, 59650 Villeneuve d'Ascq, France."", 'Universite de Lille, CNRS, UMR 9189 - CRIStAL - Centre de Recherche en Informatique Signal et Automatique de Lille, 59000 Lille, France.', ""Inria Lille, 59650 Villeneuve d'Ascq, France."", 'Universite de Lille, CNRS, UMR 9189 - CRIStAL - Centre de Recherche en Informatique Signal et Automatique de Lille, 59000 Lille, France.', ""Inria Lille, 59650 Villeneuve d'Ascq, France."", 'Inserm UMR1151, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris Descartes University and Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital-Paris, France.']",,20161111,,PMC5106020,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],['ORCID: 0000-0003-2741-8047'],,,,,,['PLoS One. 2017 Feb 9;12 (2):e0172249.

However, the efficacy of these drugs is confined to the chronic phase of the disease and development of resistance to TKIs remains a pressing issue. The anti-inflammatory COX2 inhibitor celecoxib has been utilized as anti-tumour drug due to its anti-proliferative activity. However, its effects in hematological malignancies, in particular CML, have not been investigated yet. Thus, we tested biological effects and mechanisms of action of celecoxib in Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) CML and ALL cells.We show here that celecoxib suppresses the growth of Ph+ cell lines by increasing G1-phase and apoptotic cells and reducing S- and G2-phase cells. These effects were independent of COX2 inhibition but required the rapid activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the consequent inhibition mTORC1 and 2. Treatment with celecoxib also restored GSK3beta function and led to down-regulation of beta-catenin activity through transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms, two effects likely to contribute to Ph+ cell growth suppression by celecoxib.Celecoxib inhibited colony formation of TKI-resistant Ph+ cell lines including those with the T315I BCR-ABL mutation and acted synergistically with imatinib in suppressing colony formation of TKI-sensitive Ph+ cell lines. Finally, it suppressed colony formation of CD34+ cells from CML patients, while sparing most CD34+ progenitors from healthy donors, and induced apoptosis of primary Ph+ ALL cells.Together, these findings indicate that celecoxib may serve as a COX2-independent lead compound to simultaneously target the mTOR and beta-catenin pathways, key players in the resistance of CML stem cells to TKIs.",,"['Riva, Beatrice', 'De Dominici, Marco', 'Gnemmi, Ilaria', 'Mariani, Samanta A', 'Minassi, Alberto', 'Minieri, Valentina', 'Salomoni, Paolo', 'Canonico, Pier Luigi', 'Genazzani, Armando A', 'Calabretta, Bruno', 'Condorelli, Fabrizio']","['Riva B', 'De Dominici M', 'Gnemmi I', 'Mariani SA', 'Minassi A', 'Minieri V', 'Salomoni P', 'Canonico PL', 'Genazzani AA', 'Calabretta B', 'Condorelli F']","['Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Universita del Piemonte Orientale ""A.

Epub 2016 Nov 11.,10.1038/cdd.2016.102 [doi],"Necroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that critically depends on RIP3 and MLKL. However, the contribution of mitochondria to necroptosis is still poorly understood. In the present study, we discovered that mitochondrial perturbations play a critical role in Smac mimetic/Dexamethasone (Dexa)-induced necroptosis independently of death receptor ligands. We demonstrate that the Smac mimetic BV6 and Dexa cooperate to trigger necroptotic cell death in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells that are deficient in caspase activation due to absent caspase-8 expression or pharmacological inhibition by the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk, since genetic silencing or pharmacological inhibition of RIP3 or MLKL significantly rescue BV6/Dexa-induced necroptosis. In addition, RIP3 or MLKL knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are protected from BV6/Dexa/zVAD.fmk-induced cell death. In contrast, antagonistic antibodies against the death receptor ligands TNFalpha, TRAIL or CD95 ligand fail to rescue BV6/Dexa-triggered cell death. Kinetic studies revealed that prior to cell death BV6/Dexa treatment causes hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) followed by loss of MMP, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, Bak activation and disruption of mitochondrial respiration. Importantly, knockdown of Bak significantly reduces BV6/Dexa-induced loss of MMP and delays cell death, but not ROS production, whereas ROS scavengers attenuate Bak activation, indicating that ROS production occurs upstream of BV6/Dexa-mediated Bak activation. Consistently, BV6/Dexa treatment causes oxidative thiol modifications of Bak protein. Intriguingly, knockdown or knockout of RIP3 or MLKL protect ALL cells or MEFs from BV6/Dexa-induced ROS production, Bak activation, drop of MMP and disruption of mitochondrial respiration, demonstrating that these mitochondrial events depend on RIP3 and MLKL. Thus, mitochondria might serve as an amplification step in BV6/Dexa-induced necroptosis. These findings provide new insights into the role of mitochondrial dysfunctions during necroptosis and have important implications for the development of novel treatment approaches to overcome apoptosis resistance in ALL.",,"['Rohde, Katharina', 'Kleinesudeik, Lara', 'Roesler, Stefanie', 'Lowe, Oliver', 'Heidler, Juliana', 'Schroder, Katrin', 'Wittig, Ilka', 'Drose, Stefan', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Rohde K', 'Kleinesudeik L', 'Roesler S', 'Lowe O', 'Heidler J', 'Schroder K', 'Wittig I', 'Drose S', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstrasse 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstrasse 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstrasse 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiovascular Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe-University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Functional Proteomics, Centre of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe-University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiovascular Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe-University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Functional Proteomics, Centre of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe-University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Clinic of Anesthesiology, Intensive-Care Medicine and Pain Therapy, University Hospital, Theodor-Stern Kai 7, 60596 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Centre of Biological Chemistry, Molecular Bioenergetics Group, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe-University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstrasse 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",,20161111,,PMC5260489,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the etiology of this condition remains elusive with several possible molecular pathway disruptions identified in the post-meiotic spermatozoa. In the presented study, in order to identify all possible candidate genes associated with azoospermia and to map their relationship, we present the first protein-protein interaction network related to azoospermia and analyze the complex effects of the related genes systematically. Using Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, the Human Protein Reference Database and Cytoscape, we created a novel network consisting of 209 protein nodes and 737 interactions. Mathematical analysis identified three proteins, ar, dazap2, and esr1, as hub nodes and a bottleneck protein within the network. We also identified new candidate genes, CREBBP and BCAR1, which may play a role in azoospermia. The gene ontology analysis suggests a genetic link between azoospermia and liver disease. The KEGG analysis also showed 45 statistically important pathways with 31 proteins associated with colorectal, pancreatic, chronic myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer.

The physiologic functions of the TAM receptors in innate immune control, natural killer (NK) cell differentiation, efferocytosis, clearance of apoptotic debris, and hemostasis have previously been described and more recent data implicate TAM kinases as important regulators of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. The TAM receptors are aberrantly or ectopically expressed in many hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia, B- and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. TAM receptors contribute to leukemic phenotypes through activation of pro-survival signaling pathways and interplay with other oncogenic proteins such as FLT3, LYN, and FGFR3. The TAM receptors also contribute to resistance to both cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and targeted agents, making them attractive therapeutic targets. A number of translational strategies for TAM inhibition are in development, including small molecule inhibitors, ligand traps, and monoclonal antibodies. Emerging areas of research include modulation of TAM receptors to enhance anti-tumor immunity, potential roles for TYRO-3 in leukemogenesis, and the function of the bone marrow microenvironment in mediating resistance to TAM inhibition.",,"['Huey, Madeline G', 'Minson, Katherine A', 'Earp, H Shelton', 'DeRyckere, Deborah', 'Graham, Douglas K']","['Huey MG', 'Minson KA', 'Earp HS', 'DeRyckere D', 'Graham DK']","[""Aflac Cancer Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. madeline.huey@emory.edu."", ""Aflac Cancer Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. katherine.minson@emory.edu."", 'UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA. shelton_earp@med.unc.edu.', ""Aflac Cancer Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. deborah.deryckere@emory.edu."", ""Aflac Cancer Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. douglas.graham@choa.org.""]",,20161108,,PMC5126761,['NOTNLM'],"['AXL', 'Gas6', 'MERTK', 'TYRO3', 'hematopoiesis', 'leukemia', 'multiple myeloma', 'resistance', 'signaling pathways', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']","['H.

In a spectrum of myeloid disorders ranging from clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) to secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (sAML), MDS is distinguished by the presence of peripheral blood cytopenias, dysplastic haematopoietic differentiation and the absence of features that define acute leukaemia. More than 50 recurrently mutated genes are involved in the pathogenesis of MDS, including genes that encode proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing, epigenetic regulation and transcription.

At the same time, the influence of the cell environment on the biomechanical properties of cells is not well studied. Here we use atomic force microscopy to demonstrate that cell-cell communication can have a profound effect on both cell elasticity and its pericellular coat. A human pre-B p190(BCR/ABL) acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (ALL3) was used in this study. Assuming that cell-cell communication is inversely proportional to the distance between cells, we study ALL3 cells in vitro growing at different cell densities. ALL3 cells demonstrate a clear density dependent behavior. These cells grow very well if started at a relatively high cell density (HD, >2 x 10(5) cells ml(-1)) and are poised to grow at low cell density (LD, <1 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)). Here we observe approximately 6x increase in the elastic (Young's) modulus of the cell body and approximately 3.6x decrease in the pericellular brush length of LD cells compared to HD ALL3 cells. The difference observed in the elastic modulus is much larger than typically reported for pathologically transformed cells. Thus, cell-cell communication must be taken into account when studying biomechanics of cells, in particular, correlating cell phenotype and its biophysical properties.",,"['Guz, Nataliia V', 'Patel, Sapan J', 'Dokukin, Maxim E', 'Clarkson, Bayard', 'Sokolov, Igor']","['Guz NV', 'Patel SJ', 'Dokukin ME', 'Clarkson B', 'Sokolov I']","['Department of Chemistry, Clarkson University, 8 Clarkson Avenue, Potsdam, NY 13699-5820, USA.']",['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],20161111,,PMC5221648,,,,,,['NIHMS831131'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the most prominent of these structures are the nucleolus and the PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). PML-NBs are spherical multiprotein aggregates of varying size localized in the interchromosomal area. PML-NB formation is dependent on the presence of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) as well as on post-translational modification of core components by covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). So far, PML-NBs as well as PML have been described in mammalian cells only, whereas no orthologs are known in the plant kingdom. In order to investigate conserved mechanisms in PML targeting, we expressed human PML (hPML) fused to the GFP in Nicotiana benthamiana. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometric analysis, we found the fusion protein in association with nucleolar constituents. Importantly, mutants of hPML, which are no longer SUMOylated, showed altered localizations, implying SUMO-dependent targeting of hPML in plants as has previously been shown for mammalian cells. Interestingly, in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, hPML could also be found in the nucleolus of mammalian cells suggesting conserved targeting mechanisms of PML across kingdoms. Finally, Solanum tuberosum COP1, a proposed PML-like protein from plants, was fused to the red fluorescent protein (RFP) and coexpressed with hPML::eGFP. Microscopic analysis confirmed the localization of COP1::RFP in nuclear speckles. However, hPML::eGFP did not colocalize with COP1::RFP. Hence, we conclude that plants do not possess specialized PML-NBs, but that their functions may be covered by other subnuclear structures like the nucleolus.

Adoptive cell therapy using allogeneic HLA-mismatched Natural killer (NK) cells has emerged as an effective and safe alternative in the treatment of acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias that do not respond to traditional therapies. We have described that allogeneic activated NK cells eliminate hematological cancer cell lines with multidrug resistance acquired by mutations in the apoptotic machinery. This effect depends on the activation protocol, being B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) the most effective stimulus to activate NK cells. Here, we have further analyzed the molecular determinants involved in allogeneic NK cell recognition and elimination of B-CLL cells, including the expression of ligands of the main NK cell-activating receptors (NKG2D and NCRs) and HLA mismatch. We present preliminary data suggesting that B-CLL susceptibility significantly correlates with HLA mismatch between NK cell donor and B-CLL patient. Moreover, we show that the sensitivity of B-CLL cells to NK cells depends on the prognosis based on TP53 and IGHV mutational status. Cells from patients with worse prognosis (mutated TP53 and wt IGHV) are the most susceptible to activated NK cells. Hence, B-CLL prognosis may predict the efficacy of allogenic activated NK cells, and, thus, NK cell transfer represents a good alternative to treat poor prognosis B-CLL patients who present a very short life expectancy due to lack of effective treatments.",,"['Sanchez-Martinez, Diego', 'Lanuza, Pilar M', 'Gomez, Natalia', 'Muntasell, Aura', 'Cisneros, Elisa', 'Moraru, Manuela', 'Azaceta, Gemma', 'Anel, Alberto', 'Martinez-Lostao, Luis', 'Villalba, Martin', 'Palomera, Luis', 'Vilches, Carlos', 'Garcia Marco, Jose A', 'Pardo, Julian']","['Sanchez-Martinez D', 'Lanuza PM', 'Gomez N', 'Muntasell A', 'Cisneros E', 'Moraru M', 'Azaceta G', 'Anel A', 'Martinez-Lostao L', 'Villalba M', 'Palomera L', 'Vilches C', 'Garcia Marco JA', 'Pardo J']","['Biomedical Research Center of Aragon (CIBA), Aragon Health Research Institute (IIS Aragon), University of Zaragoza , Zaragoza , Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Center of Aragon (CIBA), Aragon Health Research Institute (IIS Aragon), University of Zaragoza , Zaragoza , Spain.', 'Immunogenetics and HLA, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Puerta de Hierro , Majadahonda , Spain.', 'Immunity and infection Lab, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute) , Barcelona , Spain.', 'Immunogenetics and HLA, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Puerta de Hierro , Majadahonda , Spain.', 'Immunogenetics and HLA, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Puerta de Hierro , Majadahonda , Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa, Instituto Aragones de Ciencias de la Salud (IACS)/Aragon Health Research Institute (IIS Aragon) , Zaragoza , Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular and Cellular Biology, Aragon Health Research Institute (IIS Aragon), University of Zaragoza , Zaragoza , Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa, Instituto Aragones de Ciencias de la Salud (IACS)/Aragon Health Research Institute (IIS Aragon), Zaragoza, Spain; Nanoscience Institute of Aragon (INA), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'INSERM U1183, Universite de Montpellier 1, UFR Medecine, Montpellier, France; Institute for Regenerative Medicine and Biotherapy (IRMB), CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa, Instituto Aragones de Ciencias de la Salud (IACS)/Aragon Health Research Institute (IIS Aragon) , Zaragoza , Spain.', 'Immunity and infection Lab, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute) , Barcelona , Spain.', 'Unidad de Citogenetica Molecular/Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda , Madrid , Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Center of Aragon (CIBA), Aragon Health Research Institute (IIS Aragon), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain; Nanoscience Institute of Aragon (INA), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain; Aragon I+D Foundation (ARAID), Government of Aragon, Zaragoza, Spain; Department of Microbiology, Preventive Medicine and Public Health, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.']",,20161027,,PMC5081347,['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic NK cells', 'bad prognosis leukemia', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'leukemia resistance', 'mismatch']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2016 Nov 10.,10.5507/bp.2016.054 [doi],"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Despite high-dose multi-agent chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the relapse rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is high. Further, the disease is highly resistent to drugs. We speculated that deeper understanding of AML-endothelial cell interactions might provide new targets for selective modulation of the AML microenvironment and form the basis for novel treatment approaches. In this study, we evaluated levels of endothelium derived soluble adhesion molecules in active disease and in complete remission (CR) and their relationship with inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: Baseline serum levels of 25 cytokines and 5 soluble adhesion molecules were measured in 84 AML patients using biochip array technology. CR samples were evaluated in 44 patients of this cohort. The control group consisted of 15 healthy blood donors. RESULTS: All analytes were independent of age or disease origin. Some correlations were restricted to active AML, some were ubiquitous and some were found in remission. In active disease, E-selectin (E-SEL) and VCAM-1 correlated with leukocyte count, E-SEL correlated with P-selectin (P-SEL). Platelet count related to IL-7, EGF and VEGF but not to P-SEL. In CR, P-SEL correlated with platelet count and EGF but not with E-SEL. There was no relationship of P-SEL and E-SEL in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemic activity is associated with a different pattern of soluble adhesion molecule levels. Both E-SEL and P-SEL may be derived from endothelial cells. Their levels correlated in active disease. E-SEL correlated with leukocyte count. In CR, P-SEL physiologically correlated with platelet count. The correlation with E-SEL was insignificant and absent in the control group.

Thus we assessed genome-wide genetic, transcriptional and epigenetic alterations in BM-MSC derived from AML patients (AML BM-MSC). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of AML BM-MSC samples from 21 patients revealed a non-specific pattern of genetic alterations in the stromal compartment. The only mutation present in AML BM-MSC at serial time points of diagnosis, complete remission and relapse was a mutation in the PLEC gene encoding for cytoskeleton key player Plectin in one AML patient. Healthy donor controls did not carry genetic alterations as determined by WES. Transcriptional profiling using RNA sequencing revealed deregulation of proteoglycans and adhesion molecules as well as cytokines in AML BM-MSC.

This review focuses on the relationship of TNF-alpha expressed by leukemia cells and adverse clinical features of leukemia. TNF-alpha is involved in all steps of leukemogenesis, including cellular transformation, proliferation, angiogenesis, and extramedullary infiltration. TNF-alpha is also an important factor in the tumor microenvironment and assists leukemia cells in immune evasion, survival, and resistance to chemotherapy.

Being exclusive to cancer cells, targeting ALT is a more promising route for the development of drugs against cancer. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) family plays significant roles in various cellular processes. In addition to the regulation of gene expression, HDACs are also known to directly interact with many proteins. We focused on this family, and found that HDAC9 was up-regulated in ALT-positive cells. In ALT-positive cells treated with HDAC9 siRNA, there was a decrease in the telomere replicative capacity, which was evident from the C-circles assay. Furthermore, the formation of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (APBs) was inhibited by HDAC9 knockdown. Based on this study, it is suggested that HDAC9 regulates the formation of APBs and could be a candidate for the target of ALT-cancer therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: The cytotoxicity of 9S-HOD in HL-60 with or without the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the culture media was tested using cell viability assays and flow cytometry. To explore the mechanism of its anti-tumor activity by 9S-HOD, we used a proteomic analysis to identify HL-60 cells protein profiles, based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) identification. RESULTS: 9S-HOD exerted cytotoxicity efficacy and induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, and the cytotoxicity was largely attenuated by the presence of FBS in culture media. The proteomic results revealed that 9S-HOD remarkably altered the abundance of 23 proteins that were involved in mRNA metabolic process, protein binding, DNA replication and apoptosis.

Epub 2016 Nov 10.,,"Acetaminophen has several pharmacologic properties that suggest it could be carcinogenic in human beings. A number of epidemiologic studies have been conducted to examine whether use of acetaminophen actually predisposes to the occurrence of one or more forms of cancer. There are inherent limitations to many of these studies, including the inaccurate identification of users and nonusers of acetaminophen, relatively short follow-up for cancer incidence, and the potential for confounding by indication. The present manuscript reviews the results of epidemiologic studies of acetaminophen use in relation to cancer incidence published through the end of 2015. The limitations of the underlying studies notwithstanding, some interim conclusions can be reached. For all but several forms of cancer, there is no suggestion that persons who have taken acetaminophen are at altered risk, even persons who have consumed a large quantity of the drug or those who have taken it for an extended duration. While in some studies the incidence of renal cell carcinoma has been observed to be increased among acetaminophen users, several other studies have failed to observe any such association; the reason for the discrepant findings is unclear. Some of the small number of studies that have presented data on the incidence of lymphoma, leukemia, and plasma cell disorders have found the risk to be modestly higher in users than nonusers of acetaminophen, but the results of other studies of these malignancies will be needed to gauge the possible role of publication bias as the basis for the positive results.",,"['Weiss, Noel S']",['Weiss NS'],"['University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. nweiss@uw.edu.']",,20161110,,PMC5108822,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acetaminophen', '*Cancer epidemiology', '*Cancer incidence']",,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8929-6204'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: To examine risk factors, mortality, length of stay, and cost associated with admission to the ICU for patients with AML. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study extracted information from the University HealthSystem Consortium database on patients 18 years or older with AML who were hospitalized for any cause between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2012. The University HealthSystem Consortium database contains demographic, clinical, and cost variables prospectively abstracted by certified coders from discharge summaries. Outcomes were analyzed using univariate and multivariable statistical techniques. Data analysis was performed from November 15, 2013, to August 15, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were admission to the ICU and inpatient mortality among patients requiring ICU care. Secondary outcomes included length of stay in the ICU, total hospitalization length of stay, and cost. Results: Of the 43249 patients with AML (mean [SD] age, 59.5 [16.6] years; 23939 men and 19310 women), 11277 (26.1%) were admitted to the ICU. On multivariable analysis (with results reported as odds ratios [95% CIs]), independent risk factors for admission to the ICU included age younger than 80 years (1.56 [1.42-1.70]), hospitalization in the South (1.81 [1.71-1.92]), hospitalization at a low- or medium-volume hospital (1.25 [1.19-1.31]), number of comorbidities (10.64 [8.89-12.62] for 5 vs none), sepsis (4.61 [4.34-4.89]), invasive fungal infection (1.24 [1.11-1.39]), and pneumonia (1.73 [1.63-1.82]). In-hospital mortality was higher for patients requiring ICU care (4857 of 11277 [43.1%] vs 2959 of 31972 [9.3%]). On multivariable analysis, independent risk factors for death in patients requiring ICU care included age 60 years or older (1.16 [1.06-1.26]), nonwhite race/ethnicity (1.18 [1.07-1.30]), hospitalization on the West coast (1.19 [1.06-1.34]), number of comorbidities (18.76 [13.7-25.67] for 5 vs none), sepsis (2.94 [2.70-3.21]), invasive fungal infection (1.20 [1.02-1.42]), and pneumonia (1.13 [1.04-1.24]). Mean costs of hospitalization were higher for patients requiring ICU care ($83354 vs $41973) and increased with each comorbidity, from $50543 for patients with no comorbidities to $124820 for those with 5 or more comorbidities. Conclusions and Relevance: Admission to the ICU is associated with high mortality and cost that increase proportionally with the comorbidity burden in adults with AML.

Human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562), were treated with 20 muM of curcumin, and we found that a subpopulation of these cells were arrested and accumulate in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Characterization of this cell subpopulation showed that the arrested cells presented nuclear morphology changes resembling those described for mitotic catastrophe. Mitotic cells displayed abnormal chromatin organization, collapse of the mitotic spindle and abnormal chromosome segregation. Then, these cells died in an apoptosis dependent manner and showed diminution in the protein levels of BCL-2 and XIAP. Moreover, our results shown that a transient activation of the nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) occurred early in these cells, but decreased after 6 h of the treatment, explaining in part the diminution of the anti-apoptotic proteins. Additionally, P73 was translocated to the cell nuclei, because the expression of the C/EBPalpha, a cognate repressor of the P73 gene, was decreased, suggesting that apoptosis is trigger by elevation of P73 protein levels acting in concert with the diminution of the two anti-apoptotic molecules.

METHODS: Data from the United States Cancer Statistics dataset for 2004-2013 were used to assess incidence and death rates and trends for cancers that can be caused by tobacco use (tobacco-related cancers: oral cavity and pharynx; esophagus; stomach; colon and rectum; liver; pancreas; larynx; lung, bronchus, and trachea; kidney and renal pelvis; urinary bladder; cervix; and acute myeloid leukemia) by sex, age, race, ethnicity, state, county-level poverty and educational attainment, and cancer site. RESULTS: Each year during 2009-2013, on average, 660,000 persons in the United States received a diagnosis of a tobacco-related cancer, and 343,000 persons died from these cancers. Tobacco-related cancer incidence and death rates were higher among men than women; highest among black men and women; higher in counties with low proportion of college graduates or high level of poverty; lowest in the West; and differed two-fold among states. During 2004-2013, incidence of tobacco-related cancer decreased 1.3% per year and mortality decreased 1.6% per year, with decreases observed across most groups, but not at the same rate. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco-related cancer declined during 2004-2013. However, the burden remains high, and disparities persist among certain groups with higher rates or slower declines in rates. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: The burden of tobacco-related cancers can be reduced through efforts to prevent and control tobacco use and other comprehensive cancer control efforts focused on reducing cancer risk, detecting cancer early, improving cancer treatments, helping more persons survive cancer, improving cancer survivors' quality of life, and better assisting communities disproportionately impacted by cancer.",,"['Henley, S Jane', 'Thomas, Cheryll C', 'Sharapova, Saida R', 'Momin, Behnoosh', 'Massetti, Greta M', 'Winn, Deborah M', 'Armour, Brian S', 'Richardson, Lisa C']","['Henley SJ', 'Thomas CC', 'Sharapova SR', 'Momin B', 'Massetti GM', 'Winn DM', 'Armour BS', 'Richardson LC']",,,20161111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no intervention exists that specifically addresses strategies to reduce targeted therapy-related fatigue. OBJECTIVE: This study adapted an evidence-based clinic-delivered intervention (EBI) ""cognitive behavior therapy for post-cancer fatigue"" for use in CML patients. The existing EBI was based on 6 established perpetuating factors of fatigue (ie, sleep, activity, helpful thinking, coping with cancer, social support, and fear of disease recurrence). Study aims were to gauge reactions to (1) existing content and (2) a new Internet-assisted intervention delivery format. METHODS: Guided by the ADAPT-ITT framework, we used a series of systematic steps and adaptation methodologies, including semistructured interviews with CML patients and providers and feedback from topical experts. RESULTS: Patients were receptive to existing content topics and an Internet-assisted delivery format was acceptable. A key theme reflected the need for a new customized psychoeducational module about CML as a disease and its treatment. Both providers and patients held positive views about the potential of the adapted EBI to improve fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Findings offered essential guidance for the adaptation and reinforced the utility of the adapted intervention. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Adapting existing EBIs for new audiences contributes to advancing findings of evidence-based research, ultimately providing nurses and other healthcare providers with important referral options to interventions that may provide useful strategies to improve quality of life and reduce targeted therapy-related fatigue.",,"['Poort, Hanneke', 'Meade, Cathy D', 'Knoop, Hans', 'Gielissen, Marieke F M', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Jacobsen, Paul B']","['Poort H', 'Meade CD', 'Knoop H', 'Gielissen MFM', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Jacobsen PB']","['Author Affiliations: Expert Center for Chronic Fatigue, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands (Ms Poort and Drs Knoop and Gielissen); Division of Population Science, Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior (Drs Meade and Jacobsen), Department of Malignant Hematology (Dr Pinilla-Ibarz), H.

In 2015, it is estimated that 14,620 patients will be diagnosed with CLL, and approximately 4,650 patients will die due to disease progression. CLL typically presents in patients about 71 years of age. Initially, the patients exhibit leukocytosis; however, as the disease progresses, they experience splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, anemia, and infections. Although about 84% of CLL patients will survive for five years or more, CLL cases that report MYC (8q24) translocations with IGH, IGK, IGL, and TCR genes have poor prognoses and low survival rates. Recent studies have shown data supporting both a positive correlation and no correlation between disease progression and MYC expression. Nonetheless, other studies have revealed new information on multiple MYC-dependent pathways responsible for leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis.

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are well known to promote cancer chemoresistance via soluble factors and cell adhesion. However, little is known about the effects of MSCs on the mitochondrial dynamics of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells, or how this may influence the chemoresistance of these cells. Here, we tested both indirect (Transwell) and direct coculture strategies, and found that MSCs protected T-ALL cells from chemotherapeutic cell death and cytotoxicity under both culture conditions. In addition, cell viability was higher in the direct contact system compared with the Transwell system. We further showed that exposure of T-ALL cells to MSCs decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and promoted a pro-glycolytic shift that was characterized by increased glucose uptake and lactate production with concomitant reductions in adenosine triphosphate production and mitochondrial membrane potential. In T-ALL cells cocultured with MSCs, the mitochondrial morphology of T-ALL cells were altered from elongation to fragmentation because of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation-mediated phosphorylation of the pro-fission factor, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), at residue S616. Consistent with this, the expression of S616-phosphorylated Drp1 recapitulated the mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial ROS levels, metabolic switching and chemoresistance seen in T-ALL cells cocultured with MSCs. These findings suggest that the ability of MSCs to trigger Drp1 activation-induced changes in mitochondrial dynamics is crucial to their ability to protect cells against chemotherapeutic agents.",,"['Cai, Jianye', 'Wang, Jiancheng', 'Huang, Yinong', 'Wu, Haoxiang', 'Xia, Ting', 'Xiao, Jiaqi', 'Chen, Xiaoyong', 'Li, Hongyu', 'Qiu, Yuan', 'Wang, Yingnan', 'Wang, Tao', 'Xia, Huimin', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Xiang, Andy Peng']","['Cai J', 'Wang J', 'Huang Y', 'Wu H', 'Xia T', 'Xiao J', 'Chen X', 'Li H', 'Qiu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Wang T', 'Xia H', 'Zhang Q', 'Xiang AP']","[""Program of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Biotherapy Center, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Program of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Biotherapy Center, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Program of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Biotherapy Center, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology, Ministry of Education, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Program of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Program of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Program of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Biotherapy Center, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Program of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."", 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Biotherapy Center, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",,20161110,,PMC5260898,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, interstitial pneumonitis (IP) and other toxicities remain major concerns after total body irradiation (TBI). We have proposed using linear accelerators with rice-bag compensators for intensity modulation (IM-TBI), as an alternative to the traditional cobalt-60 teletherapy with lung-shielding technique (Co-TBI). Patients who received a TBI-based myeloablative conditioning regimen between 1995 and 2014 were recruited consecutively. Before March 2007, TBI was delivered using Co-TBI (n = 181); afterward, TBI was administered using IM-TBI (n = 126). Forty-four patients developed IP; of these cases, 19 were idiopathic. The IP-related mortality rate was 50% in the total IP cohort and 63% in the idiopathic subgroup. The 1-year cumulative incidences of IP and idiopathic IP were 16.5% and 7.4%, respectively; both rates were significantly higher in the Co-TBI group than in the IM-TBI group. Multivariate analysis revealed that Co-TBI was an independent prognostic factor for both total and idiopathic IP. In the acute myeloid leukemia subgroup, patients with different TBI techniques had similar outcomes for both overall and relapse-free survival. In conclusion, IM-TBI is an easy and effective TBI technique that could substantially reduce the complication rate of IP without compromising treatment efficacy.",,"['Chiang, Yun', 'Tsai, Cheng-Hong',

The number of abnormal large granular lymphocytes in the bone marrow was increased and the cells were positive for CD56 and EBV-encoded small nuclear RNAs.

On day 31, complete donor chimerism was achieved and no acute graft-versus-host disease developed. The ANKL relapsed on day 80, and cyclosporine was rapidly tapered and chemotherapy was started. During hematopoietic recovery, the number of atypical lymphocytes increased, but they were donor-derived EBV-specific CTLs.

Results from a pilot study on the incidence of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) as well as the efficacy and safety of glutamine in reducing signs and symptoms of VIPN in children with cancer are presented. METHODS: Fifty-six patients between the ages of 5-21 with newly diagnosed leukemia, lymphoma, extracranial solid tumor or medulloblastoma and expected to receive a minimum cumulative dose of 6 mg/m(2) of vincristine over a 30-week period were eligible. Patients' neurological functioning was monitored every 3 weeks using clinical history, exam, and assessment of motor functioning. Upon identification of neuropathy, patients were randomized to either glutamine (6 g/m(2) per dose twice daily, maximum 10 g/dose) or placebo for a 3-week period followed by 3-week wash out period (Time 3). RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were fully evaluable and 100 % developed neuropathy per study definitions. No significant differences in demographics or side effects were noted between the randomized groups. The distribution of sensory neuropathy scores between the two groups was statistically significant after the intervention (p = 0.022). Children receiving glutamine also rated their quality of life (QoL) as 8.42 points higher on the PedsQL total score than those receiving placebo (p = 0.031).

The advantages of itraconazole over posaconazole prophylaxis include maintaining the utility of azole therapy for suspected breakthrough invasive fungal infection (bIFI). We examined the effectiveness and tolerability of itraconazole as prophylaxis in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. We sought to determine the rate of probable and proven bIFI in the context of itraconazole prophylaxis in a real-life setting. Eighty-four patients corresponded to 175 episodes of primary antifungal prophylaxis with itraconazole solution (200 mg twice daily) as prophylaxis supported by a dedicated clinical pharmacist during induction, re-induction and consolidation chemotherapy for AML between January 2010 and January 2014. Assessment of clinical course included blinded review of all radiology scans. Episodes of bIFI were categorised according to consensus criteria. A low rate of bIFI (6/175, 3.4 %) occurred with the use of itraconazole. Tolerance was excellent with adverse events consisting predominantly of deranged liver function tests reported in 7/175 (4 %). Therapeutic drug monitoring performed at clinicians' discretion demonstrated appropriate levels in 12/14 (86 %). Persisting fever and suspicion of invasive fungal infection (IFI) led to empiric antifungal therapy with voriconazole or caspofungin in 33/175 episodes (19 %), ceased after a median of 5 days following investigation in 16/175 (9 %). In this setting, itraconazole is effective and well-tolerated as prophylaxis. An additional benefit was seen in empiric therapy of suspected bIFI with amphotericin formulations kept in reserve.

Several risk factors for acute GVHD have been identified, including pretransplant factors that possibly influence the posttranspant course through their effects on host immunocompetent cells. Metabolic regulation is important for immunoregulation, and we therefore investigated whether the pretransplant metabolic status of allotransplant recipients was associated with later acute GVHD. In our population-based study we investigated the systemic (serum) metabolic profile for 86 consecutive allotransplant recipients. The samples were collected before start of the pretransplant conditioning therapy. Patients who developed later acute GVHD especially showed altered pretransplant amino acid metabolism, including (1) altered metabolism of immunoregulatory branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine); and (2) altered levels of potentially proinflammatory tyrosine metabolites (p-cresol sulphate, 3-phenylpropionate) formed by the gastrointestinal microbial flora. However, isobutyrylcarnitine and propyonylcarnitine levels were also altered; the carnitines are important for the transport of fatty acids and may also be important for the release of immunoregulatory cytokines in allotransplant recipients. These metabolic alterations were associated with an ongoing pretransplant acute phase reaction or early hematopoietic/immune reconstitution. Thus, allotransplant recipients developing acute GVHD showed altered preconditioning/pretransplant levels of several immunoregulatory metabolites. Our hypothesis is that these metabolites alter or activate recipient immunocompetent cells and thereby enhance or initiate anti-recipient immune reactivity.",,"['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Hatfield, Kimberley', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Hatfield K', 'Bruserud O']","['grid.7914.b0000000419367443Section Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway ; grid.412008.f0000000097531393Section Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'grid.7914.b0000000419367443Section Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'grid.7914.b0000000419367443Section Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway ; grid.412008.f0000000097531393Section Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.']",,20151116,,PMC5080330,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute graft versus host disease', 'Acute leukemia', 'Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'Metabolomics']","['All authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest related to this', 'manuscript.

We investigate the possible effect and particular mechanism of GINS in breast cancer cells. We showed that expression of GINS2 is enriched in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. Furthermore, GINS2 knockdown decreased the growth, invasive ability and stem-like property of TNBC cells. Mechanistically, silencing of GINS2 in TNBC cells caused dramatic decrease of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9).

Recent evidence shows that HTLV-1-transformed cells present defects in both DNA replication and DNA repair, suggesting that these cells might be particularly sensitive to treatment with a small helicase inhibitor. Because the ""Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase"" encoded by the WRN gene plays important roles in both cellular proliferation and DNA repair, we hypothesized that inhibition of WRN activity could be used as a new strategy to target ATLL cells. METHODS: Our analysis demonstrates an apoptotic effect induced by the WRN helicase inhibitor in HTLV-1-transformed cells in vitro and ATL-derived cell lines. Inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis were demonstrated with cell cycle analysis, XTT proliferation assay, clonogenic assay, annexin V staining, and measurement of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. RESULTS: Targeted inhibition of the WRN helicase induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HTLV-1-transformed leukemia cells. Treatment with NSC 19630 (WRN inhibitor) induces S-phase cell cycle arrest, disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased expression of anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2. These events were associated with activation of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in ATL cells. We identified some ATL cells, ATL-55T and LMY1, less sensitive to NSC 19630 but sensitive to another WRN inhibitor, NSC 617145. CONCLUSIONS: WRN is essential for survival of ATL cells.

Further, the lack of a systemic analysis provides little information about this entity. We present a case of isolated extramedullary relapse from acute T lymphoblastic leukemia (ATLL) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old Chinese woman diagnosed with ATLL with myeloid antigen expression received HSCT from her human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sister and presented with two lesions in her right breast 6 months later. Pathology investigation revealed breast relapse, with complete remission on the basis of bone marrow findings. Combined modality treatment including chemotherapy and local radiotherapy helped achieve complete remission with mild side effects. CONCLUSION: The findings from this case indicate that the breast is a potentially involved extramedullary site of relapse for ALL patients after HSCT. In the case of a newly developed breast lump in such patients, clinicians consider local relapse even if the bone marrow findings indicate remission.

MM generates a significant burden of disease on the community and it is predicted that it will increase in both incidence and prevalence owing to an ageing population and longer survival secondary to new therapeutic options. Robust and comprehensive clinical data are currently lacking but are required to define current diagnostic, investigational and management patterns in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) for comparison to both local and international guidelines for standards of care. A clinical registry can provide this information and subsequently support development of strategies to address any differences, including providing a platform for clinical trials. The Myeloma and Related Diseases Registry (MRDR) was developed to monitor and explore variations in practices, processes and outcomes in ANZ and provide benchmark outcomes nationally and internationally for PCD. This paper describes the MRDR aims, development and implementation and discusses challenges encountered in the process. METHODS: The MRDR was established in 2012 as an online database for a multi-centre collaboration across ANZ, collecting prospective data on patients with a diagnosis of MGUS, MM, solitary plasmacytoma or plasma cell leukaemia. Development of the MRDR required multi-disciplinary team participation, IT and biostatistical support as well as financial resources. RESULTS: More than 1250 patients have been enrolled at 23 sites to date. Here we describe how database development, data entry and securing ethics approval have been major challenges for participating sites and the coordinating centre, and our approaches to resolving them. Now established, the MRDR will provide clinically relevant and credible monitoring, therapy and 'real world' outcome data, to support the conduction of high quality studies. In addition, the Myeloma 1000 sub-study is establishing a repository of paired peripheral blood specimens from registry patients to study mechanisms underlying disease progression. CONCLUSION: Establishment of the MRDR has been challenging, but it is a valuable investment that will provide a platform for coordinated national and international collaboration for clinical research in PCD in ANZ.",,"['Bergin, Krystal', 'Moore, Elizabeth', 'McQuilten, Zoe', 'Wood, Erica', 'Augustson, Bradley', 'Blacklock, Hilary', 'Ho, Joy', 'Horvath, Noemi', 'King, Tracy', 'McNeil, John', 'Mollee, Peter', 'Quach, Hang', 'Reid, Christopher M', 'Rosengarten, Brian', 'Walker, Patricia', 'Spencer, Andrew']","['Bergin K', 'Moore E', 'McQuilten Z', 'Wood E', 'Augustson B', 'Blacklock H', 'Ho J', 'Horvath N', 'King T', 'McNeil J', 'Mollee P', 'Quach H', 'Reid CM', 'Rosengarten B', 'Walker P', 'Spencer A']","['Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'Middlemore Hospital, Middlemore, New Zealand.', 'Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', ""St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'School of Public Health, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'Myeloma Foundation Australia, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Peninsula Health, Frankston, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. aspencer@netspace.net.au.', 'The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. aspencer@netspace.net.au.', 'South Block, Alfred Health, 55 Commercial Road, Melbourne, VIC, 3004, Australia. aspencer@netspace.net.au.']",,20161109,,PMC5103513,['NOTNLM'],"['*Development', '*Implementation', '*Multiple Myeloma', '*Plasma cell dyscrasia', '*Real-world', '*Registry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, the identification and the recognition of molecular and epigenetic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of such a heterogeneous disease, are providing new tools for a more successful and 'targeted' approach. Azacitidine is a hypomethylating agent (HMA) with relevant activity in patients affected by myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML with low blast cells percentage (>30%), in terms of reduction of transfusion dependence, and improvement of quality of life. Areas covered: This review summarizes the mechanism of action, safety profile and efficacy of azacitidine in the field of elderly AML populations, providing up-to-date references on this subset of high-risk patients. Expert opinion: HMAs are the first successful treatment for elderly patients with high-risk MDS and are effective for some AML subtypes. Translational studies based on gene expression profiling and molecular sequencing, would be able to identify, in the near future, patients with a favorable profile of response to these compounds suggesting new potential treatment combinations also.",,"['Tenti, Elena', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Marconi, Giovanni', 'Parisi, Sarah', 'Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Sartor, Chiara', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Tenti E', 'Papayannidis C', 'Marconi G', 'Parisi S', 'Simonetti G', 'Paolini S', 'Sartor C', 'Ottaviani E', 'Testoni N', 'Martinelli G']","[""a Institute of Hematology L. e A.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) induces apoptosis in all CLL cell types and could constitute an efficient therapy. To further explore this, we have studied the gene expression profile induced by ATO in CLL cells. ATO modulated many genes, largely involved in oxidative stress, being HMOX1 the most upregulated gene, also induced at the protein level. ATO also increased MMP-9, as we previously observed, both at the mRNA and protein level. Using specific inhibitors, qPCR analyses, and gene silencing approaches we demonstrate that upregulation of MMP-9 by ATO involved activation of the p38 MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathway. Moreover, gene silencing HMOX1 or inhibiting HMOX1 activity enhanced p38 MAPK phosphorylation and c-jun expression/activation, resulting in transcriptional upregulation of MMP-9. Overexpression of HMOX1 or enhancement of its activity, had the opposite effect. Cell viability analyses upon modulation of HMOX1 expression or activity demonstrated that HMOX1 had a pro-apoptotic role and enhanced the cytotoxic effect of ATO in CLL cells. We have therefore identified a new mechanism in which HMOX1 plays a central role in the response of CLL cells to ATO and in the regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein MMP-9. Thus, HMOX1 arises as a new therapeutic target in CLL and the combination of HMOX1 modulators with ATO may constitute an efficient therapeutic strategy in CLL.",,"['Amigo-Jimenez, Irene', 'Bailon, Elvira', 'Aguilera-Montilla, Noemi', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Amigo-Jimenez I', 'Bailon E', 'Aguilera-Montilla N', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Unit, Hematology Department, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.']",,,,PMC5347775,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'HMOX1', 'MMP-9', 'arsenic trioxide', 'gene expression profile']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The approach of network medicine illustrating the drug-target interactions was applied to identify popular targets of multi-target drugs and combination products. As identified, the multi-target drugs tended to inhibit target pairs in the human kinome, especially the receptor tyrosine kinase family, while the combination products were able to against targets of distant homology relationship. This finding asked for choosing the combination products as a better solution for designing drugs aiming at targets of distant homology relationship.

METHODS: A 47-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia with intermediate cytogenetic risk was admitted in our hospital. The disease relapsed after two cycles of chemotherapy. He was then treated with an allogenic bone marrow transplant, with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and thymoglobulin. One week after the procedure, a sepsis of unknown origin in neutropenia occurred. Blood cultures and sputum were negative for bacteria and fungi. At the eighth week after the procedure, the patient had acute vision loss of the right eye. Funduscopy in the right eye revealed an inferior temporal yellowish white elevated lesion of approximately 10 disk areas and superficial perifoveal and perilesional hemorrhages. RESULTS: Vitrectomy was performed and samples from the vitreous and the subretinal abscess material were sent for analysis.

Analysis of cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with the rMDVs revealed that Env and Gag were successfully expressed and that there was no difference in growth kinetics in cells infected with rMDVs compared with that of cells infected with the parent MDV. Chickens vaccinated with either rMDV revealed that positive serum antibodies were induced. Both rMDVs also effectively reduced the rate of positive viremia in chicken flocks challenged with ALV-J. The protective effect provided by rMDV/ALV-env inoculation was slightly stronger than that provided by rMDV/ALV-gag+env.

Failure in these processes can ultimately lead to uncontrolled proliferation and leukemia. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the molecular pathways involved in this balance. By opposing PI3-kinases, PTEN inhibits proliferation and promotes differentiation and is thus considered a tumor suppressor. Indeed, PTEN is frequently mutated in many cancers, including leukemias. Loss of PTEN often leads to lymphoid cancers. However, little is known about the molecular events that regulate PTEN signaling during lymphopoiesis. In this study, we used zebrafish to address this. We report that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1b (ndrg1b) rescues lymphoid differentiation after PTEN inhibition. We also show that a previously uncharacterized gene, fam49ab, inhibits T-cell differentiation, a phenotype that can be rescued by ndrg1b We propose that ndrg1b and fam49ab are 2 new modulators of PTEN signaling that control lymphoid differentiation in the zebrafish thymus.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Li, Roman A', 'Traver, David', 'Matthes, Thomas', 'Bertrand, Julien Y']","['Li RA', 'Traver D', 'Matthes T', 'Bertrand JY']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva-School of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA; and.', 'Hematology Service, University Hospital Geneva, Clinical Pathology Service, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva-School of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland.']",,20161108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect PIM kinases in archived pathologic material from 43 patients with primary OS; in addition, the effects of PIM knockdown and overexpression on the proliferation, migration and invasion of OS cell lines were determined. We observed that all three PIM kinases were frequently expressed in OS, but only PIM1 positive expression was associated with poorer prognosis regarding overall survival of OS patients. In addition, knockdown of PIM kinases notably inhibited OS cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness, whereas overexpression of PIM kinases resulted in increased OS cell growth and motility. This study suggests that PIM1 could be a valuable prognostic marker in patients with OS, and the biological functions of PIM kinase family in the osteosarcoma cell lines indicate that they could serve as potential therapeutic targets for OS.",,"['Mou, Shuai', 'Wang, Guangbin', 'Ding, Ding', 'Yu, Dongdong', 'Pei, Yi', 'Teng, Songling', 'Fu, Qin']","['Mou S', 'Wang G', 'Ding D', 'Yu D', 'Pei Y', 'Teng S', 'Fu Q']","['Department of Orthopaedics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110004, P.R.

The Ikaros family of transcription factors includes five members that are required for normal T cell development and are implicated in leukemogenesis. The goal of this work was to correlate the pattern of expression of Ikaros family members with the phenotype of the T-ALL cells. METHODS: We obtained twenty-four samples from pediatric T-ALL patients and used multi-parameter flow cytometry to characterize each sample, comparing the phenotype of the leukemic cells with normal human thymocytes. Then, we defined the expression levels of each Ikaros family member to determine whether the mRNA levels or splicing or protein levels were similar to the normal patterns seen during human T cell development. RESULTS: Multi-parameter analysis of the phenotype of T-ALL cells revealed that each patient's cells were unique and could not be readily correlated with stages of T cell development. Similarly, the pattern of Ikaros expression varied among patients. In most patients, Ikaros mRNA was the dominant family member expressed, but some patients' cells contained mostly Helios, Aiolos, or Eos mRNA. Despite that most patients had elevated mRNA levels of Ikaros family members and unique patterns of mRNA splicing, most patients had significantly reduced protein levels of Ikaros and Aiolos. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the cell phenotype and Ikaros expression levels in T-ALL cells revealed the extent of heterogeneity among patients. While it is rarely possible to trace leukemic cells to their developmental origin, we found distinct patterns of Ikaros family mRNA levels in groups of patients. Further, mRNA and protein levels of Ikaros and Aiolos did not correlate, indicating that mRNA and protein levels are regulated via distinct mechanisms.",,"['Mitchell, Julie L', 'Yankee, Thomas M']","['Mitchell JL', 'Yankee TM']","['Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics, and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA;; US Military HIV Research Program, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Molecular Genetics, and Immunology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']","['P30 GM103326/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC5075847,['NOTNLM'],"['Aiolos', 'Helios', 'Ikaros', 'pediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pediatric T-ALL)']",['The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endogenous viruses integrate into host genomes and can recombine with exogenous avian leukosis virus (ALV). In this study, we analyzed the interaction of endogenous retrovirus 21 (ev21) with the ALV-J in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken. Two ALV-J strains M180 and K243 were isolated from late-feathering and fast-feathering Chinese yellow chicken flocks, respectively. The env gene of the two strains showed 94.2-94.8% nucleotide identity with reference ALV-J strains. Compared with the env gene and the LTR of ev21 and M180, the nucleotide identity of LTR was 69.7% and env gene was 58.4%, respectively, especially the amino acid identity of env gene as low as 14.2%. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the env gene and the 3'LTR showed that M180 was closely related to ALV-J, and was located in a distinct group with ev21 in the phylogenetic tree. Using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), we next demonstrate that the envelope protein of ev21 does not interact with the M180 envelope protein. We further show that the envelope protein of ev21 cannot activate ALV-J LTR promoter activity using luciferase-reporter assays. qPCR and western blot analysis revealed that envelope protein of endogenous ev21 can facilitate the expression of PKR at 6h post ALV-J infection (hpi) and facilitate the expression of ISG12 and CH25H at 24 hpi. However, the expression of the env gene of M180 strain was not significantly at 6 and 24 hpi. We conclude that there is no evidence of recombination between endogenous retrovirus ev21 and ALV-J strain M180 in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken, and envelope protein of ev21 can affect the expression of host ISGs, but appears not to influence the replication of ALV-J strain M180.

In particular, the question of effective and curative treatments for elderly patients, who are not eligible for stem cell transplantation, remains an unmet medical need. To answer this question, a wide range of immunologic therapeutic strategies, mostly T cell based, have been proposed and investigated. At present, however, the clinical results have been largely unsatisfactory. Natural killer cells have recently been used as a means of adoptive immunotherapy with promising clinical results. On the basis of recent clinical reports and moving from the basic immunobiology of natural killer cells, here we discuss some open issues in the clinical translation of natural killer-based adoptive immunotherapy for the management of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

High ALDH 1A1 activity has been reported to also characterize cells that propagate malignant populations arising in other tissues, but the regulation and basis of ALDH activity in primary human leukemic cells has not been well studied. We obtained samples from patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 21) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 8) and analyzed different phenotypically and functionally defined subsets for their ALDH activity using the ALDEFLUOR((R)) kit and expression of the ALDH1A1 gene. We detected cells with high ALDH activity (ALDH(pos)) in all samples from AML and CML patients. These were consistently enriched in the CD34(+) population of these samples, but typically not in the CD34(+)CD38(-) subset. Leukemic cells with direct clonogenic activity in vitro or those able to repopulate the bone marrow of sublethally irradiated non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were both ALDH(pos) and ALDH(neg). Interestingly, ALDH1A1 transcripts were highest in the ALDH(neg) leukemic cells and, in studies with leukemic cell lines, exposure to an inhibitor of ALDH activity variably affected sensitivity to daunorubicin. Cells with high ALDH activity are commonly found within the CD34(+) population of primary human leukemic cells but, unlike in normal hematopoietic tissues, do not selectively or consistently comprise those with proliferative potential or other distinct functional properties.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

For patients with immune deficiency or leukemia WBC should be persistently monitored. Current WBC counting method relies on bulky instrument and trained personnel and is time consuming. Rapid, low-cost and portable solution is in highly demand for point of care test. Here we demonstrate a label-free smartphone based electrochemical WBC counting device on microporous paper with patterned gold microelectrodes. WBC separated from whole blood was trapped by the paper with microelectrodes. WBC trapped on the paper leads to the ion diffusion blockage on microelectrodes, therefore cell concentration is determined by peak current on the microelectrodes measured by a differential pulse voltammeter and the quantitative results are collected by a smartphone wirelessly within 1min. We are able to rapidly quantify WBC concentrations covering the common physiological and pathological range (200-20000muL(-1)) with only 10muL sample and high repeatability as low as 10% in CoV (Coefficient of Variation).
