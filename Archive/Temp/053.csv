Between 2006 and 2009, the trial accrued 44 patients, 1 to 21 years old with first marrow-relapsed ALL. The reinduction regimen comprised prednisolone, vincristine, L-asparaginase, and idarubicin (10 mg/m(2)/week). The idarubicin dose was adjusted according to the degree of myelosuppression. The second complete remission (CR2) rate was 72.7%, obtained by 54.2% of patients with early relapse < 24 months after initial diagnosis and 95.0% of those with late relapse (P = 0.002). Five patients entered remission with extended treatment, resulting in a final CR2 rate of 84.1%. The CR2 rate was not significantly different according to the idarubicin dose. The induction death rate was 2.3% (1/44). The 5-year event-free and overall survival rates were 22.2% +/- 6.4% and 27.3% +/- 6.7% for all patients, 4.2% +/- 4.1% and 8.3% +/- 5.6% for early relapsers, and 43.8% +/- 11.4% and 50.0% +/- 11.2% for late relapsers, respectively. Early relapse and slow response to reinduction chemotherapy were predictors of poor outcomes. In conclusion, a modified dose of idarubicin was effectively incorporated into the reinduction regimen for late marrow-relapsed ALL with a low toxic death rate. However, the CR2 rate for early relapsers was suboptimal, and the second remission was not durable in most patients.",['(c) 2017 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.'],"['Koh, Kyung Nam', 'Im, Ho Joon', 'Kim, Hyery', 'Kang, Hyoung Jin', 'Park, Kyung Duk', 'Shin, Hee Young', 'Ahn, Hyo Seop', 'Lee, Ji Won', 'Yoo, Keon Hee', 'Sung, Ki Woong', 'Koo, Hong Hoe', 'Lim, Young Tak', 'Park, Jun Eun', 'Park, Byung Kiu', 'Park, Hyeon Jin', 'Seo, Jong Jin']","['Koh KN', 'Im HJ', 'Kim H', 'Kang HJ', 'Park KD', 'Shin HY', 'Ahn HS', 'Lee JW', 'Yoo KH', 'Sung KW', 'Koo HH', 'Lim YT', 'Park JE', 'Park BK', 'Park HJ', 'Seo JJ']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6376-672X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8799-4068', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2852-6832', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1009-6002', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6943-4398', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2091-1947', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5618-7033', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0084-1304', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5980-7912', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5989-4772', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8082-1412', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3300-7239', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4292-3500', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9743-0610', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9557-3412', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0191-7836']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, Seoul, Korea."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, Seoul, Korea."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Children's Hospital, Seoul, Korea."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pusan National University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University College of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.', 'Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, Seoul, Korea. jjseo@amc.seoul.kr.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC5334163,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', '*Childhood', '*Idarubicin', '*Induction', '*Relapse']",['The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.'],2017/03/01 06:00,2017/05/24 06:00,['2017/03/01 06:00'],"['2016/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [medline]']","['32.642 [pii]', '10.3346/jkms.2017.32.4.642 [doi]']",ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2017 Apr;32(4):642-649. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2017.32.4.642.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon CLL diagnosis, physicians should determine whether treatment or careful observation is indicated. Once treatment is required, choice of therapy should be based on the age and fitness of the patient and the distinct molecular profile of their disease. As multiple novel agents are in various stages of development, all patients regardless of their age, fitness, and disease risk should be evaluated for clinical trial participation before initiating any front-line therapy. If no clinical trial is available, we provide our recommendations for front-line treatment of CLL patients. Healthy, young patients with low-risk disease (mutated IgVH, del (13q)) should be offered fludarabine, chlorambucil, and rituximab (FCR), while similar patients with high-risk disease (unmutated IgVH, del (17p), del (11q), and complex karyotype) should be considered for ibrutinib therapy. For those young, fit patients with high-risk disease and a contraindication to ibrutinib, FCR, or high-dose methylprednisolone and rituximab are options. In regard to older, unfit patients, a careful assessment of their fitness and ability to tolerate treatment should be undertaken before starting therapy. Those who have poor performance and multiple medical comorbidities should be considered for palliative care alone. However, those who are fit enough for treatment can be offered ibrutinib. If there is a contraindication to ibrutinib, they can be separated into low- and high-risk molecular groups. For the low-risk patients, bendamustine and rituximab or obinutuzumab and chlorambucil can be considered. For the high-risk patients, treatment with rituximab and lenalidomide is an option. Herein, we provide an evidence-based front-line treatment algorithm for CLL patients based upon fitness and molecular risk.",,"['Voorhies, Benjamin N', 'Stephens, Deborah M']","['Voorhies BN', 'Stephens DM']",,"['Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.

RECENT FINDINGS: Less intensive non-myelosuppressive induction approaches can produce comparable anti-leukemic responses with less toxicity. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are not clearly associated with superior outcomes compared to imatinib. Ponatinib is associated with lower early relapse rates, but has additional vascular risks. Patients achieving complete molecular response (CMR) appear to have comparable survivals with chemotherapy + TKI alone as compared with allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). In contrast, those not achieving CMR have superior outcomes with alloSCT. There is no clear evidence of benefit for post-transplant TKI therapy. Patients resistant to chemotherapy + TKIs may respond to blinatumomab or inotuzumab; these agents may also convert some patients to CMR.

Great efforts have been undertaken in search of diagnostic biomarkers of leukemia. However, leukemia is highly complex and heterogeneous, involving interaction among multiple molecular components. Individual molecules are not necessarily sensitive diagnostic indicators. Network biomarkers are considered to outperform individual molecules in disease characterization. We applied an integrative approach that identifies active network modules as putative biomarkers for leukemia diagnosis. We first reconstructed the leukemia-specific PPI network using protein-protein interactions from the Protein Interaction Network Analysis (PINA) and protein annotations from GeneGo. The network was further integrated with gene expression profiles to identify active modules with leukemia relevance. Finally, the candidate network-based biomarker was evaluated for the diagnosing performance. A network of 97 genes and 400 interactions was identified for accurate diagnosis of leukemia. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the network biomarkers were enriched in pathways in cancer.

Patients with AKI of stage 3 or poor response to conventional treatment were performed on hemodialysis and assessed the treatment outcome. Results 9 patients (5%) have appeared AKI, including 7 cases of AKI of stage 3. However, there were not any significant correlation between age, gender, serum MTX concentration and AKI, respectively.

In an interim analysis at 24 months, we previously reported that chelation therapy was associated with longer median overall survival and a tendency toward longer leukemia-free survival and fewer cardiac events. In the present report, we detail findings from the final analysis at 5 years. We confirm, at the conclusion of this 5-year, prospective, non-interventional study, that overall survival was significantly longer in patients who received iron chelation therapy vs those who did not. Causes of death in the overall population were predominantly myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myeloid leukemia followed by cardiac disease. Time to progression to acute myeloid leukemia was also significantly longer in patients receiving chelation therapy, and significantly fewer patients progressed to leukemia vs those not receiving chelation therapy. Limitations of the study include a potential for clinical bias, as patients with longer predicted survival may have been chosen for chelation therapy, the differences present in concomitant conditions at baseline, and the possibility that some high-risk patients were not identified due to limited cytogenetic classification.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Cutaneous LBL is seen in less than 20% of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Herein, we report the case of a 66-year-old male patient without any previous disease history of note and who was presenting a gradually spreading tumoral lesion of the scalp, several purplish macules and nodules on the trunk, and a single spinal adenopathy. A thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan performed for acute renal failure, revealed extensive infiltration of retroperitoneal tissue. Skin biopsies and staging tests indicated LBL-T with associated cutaneous, bone and lymph node retroperitoneal lesions with no mediastinal mass. After two months of treatment with CHOP (four courses), the cutaneous lesions and abdominal tumoral mass had regressed and renal function had returned to normal. DISCUSSION: There have been 13 reported cases of LBL with cutaneous involvement; most of these patients were young (under 30 years) and presented multiple cutaneous lesions (nodules or tumors) associated with numerous peripheral adenopathies, invasion of the bone marrow, and in many cases, a mediastinal mass. The clinical presentation of LBL-T in our case is novel on account of the cutaneous sites, associated with abdominal tumoral syndrome, without mediastinal infiltration, and with a single peripheral adenopathy, in an elderly subject.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

28241849,NLM,MEDLINE,20171205,20181202,1756-8722 (Electronic) 1756-8722 (Linking),10,1,2017 Feb 28,"Metformin potentiates the effect of arsenic trioxide suppressing intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: roles of p38 MAPK, ERK3, and mTORC1.",59,10.1186/s13045-017-0424-0 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is commonly used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but does not benefit patients with solid tumors. When combined with other agents or radiation, ATO showed treatment benefits with manageable toxicity. Previously, we reported that metformin amplified the inhibitory effect of ATO on intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) cells more significantly than other agents. Here, we investigated the chemotherapeutic sensitization effect of metformin in ATO-based treatment in ICC in vitro and in vivo and explored the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: ICC cell lines (CCLP-1, RBE, and HCCC-9810) were treated with metformin and/or ATO; the anti-proliferation effect was evaluated by cell viability, cell apoptosis, cell cycle, and intracellular-reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays. The in vivo efficacy was determined in nude mice with CCLP-1 xenografts. The active status of AMPK/p38 MAPK and mTORC1 pathways was detected by western blot. In addition, an antibody array was used screening more than 200 molecules clustered in 12 cancer-related pathways in CCLP-1 cells treated with metformin and/or ATO. Methods of genetic modulation and pharmacology were further used to demonstrate the relationship of the molecule. Seventy-three tumor samples from ICC patients were used to detect the expression of ERK3 by immunohistochemistry. The correlation between ERK3 and the clinical information of ICC patients were further analyzed. RESULTS: Metformin and ATO synergistically inhibited proliferation of ICC cells by promoting cell apoptosis, inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and increasing intracellular ROS. Combined treatment with metformin and ATO efficiently reduced ICC growth in an ICC xenograft model. Mechanistically, the antibody array revealed that ERK3 exhibited the highest variation in CCLP-1 cells after treatment with metformin and ATO. Results of western blot confirm that metformin and ATO cooperated to inhibit mTORC1, activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and upregulate ERK3. Metformin abrogated the activation of p38 MAPK induced by ATO, and this activity was partially dependent on AMPK activation. Inactivation of p38 MAPK by SB203580 or specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) promoted the inactivation of mTORC1 in ICC cells treated with metformin and ATO. Activation of p38 MAPK may be responsible for resistance to ATO in ICC. The relationship between p38 MAPK and ERK3 was not defined by our findings. Finally, AMPK is a newfound positive regulator of ERK3. Overexpression of EKR3 in ICC cells inhibited cell proliferation through inactivation of mTORC1. ERK3 expression is associated with a better prognosis in ICC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin sensitizes arsenic trioxide to suppress intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma via the regulation of AMPK/p38 MAPK-ERK3/mTORC1 pathways. ERK3 is a newfound potential prognostic predictor and a tumor suppressor in ICC.",,"['Ling, Sunbin', 'Xie, Haiyang', 'Yang, Fan', 'Shan, Qiaonan', 'Dai, Haojiang', 'Zhuo, Jianyong', 'Wei, Xuyong',

CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs), TLR9 agonists, are able to induce anticancer immune responses and exert direct effects against cancer cells, serving as cancer therapeutic agents. Therefore, TLR9 might be a potential therapeutic target for drug development. However, several new evidences have revealed that direct effects of TLR9 agonists on B-cell malignancies is controversial. For example, CpG ODNs can induce apoptosis in certain type of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma cells, while induce proliferation in multiple myeloma and other types of lymphoma cells. In this review, we summarize current understanding of the heterogeneity in responses of normal and malignant B cells to TLR9 agonists, due to differences in TLR9 expression levels, genetic alterations (such as MyD88 mutation), and signaling pathway activation. Especially, the downstream molecules of NF-kappaB signaling pathway play an important role in the heterogeneous response. In order to provide possibilities for therapeutic manipulation of TLR9 agonists in the treatment of these disorders, the preclinical and clinical advances in using CpG ODNs alone and in combination therapies are also summarized in this review.",,"['Bai, Ling', 'Chen, Wei', 'Chen, Jingtao', 'Li, Wei', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Niu, Chao', 'Han, Wei', 'Cui, Jiuwei']","['Bai L', 'Chen W', 'Chen J', 'Li W', 'Zhou L', 'Niu C', 'Han W', 'Cui J']",,"['Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'ADC Biomedical Research Institute, 1919 University Avenue, Saint Paul, MN, 55104, USA.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 130021, China.', 'Cancer Center, The First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 130021, China. cuijw@jlu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/therapeutic use', '*Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*metabolism']",PMC5329966,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell malignancies', '*Cancer immunotherapy', '*CpG oligodeoxynucleotides', '*Toll-like receptor 9']",,2017/03/01 06:00,2017/10/21 06:00,['2017/03/01 06:00'],"['2016/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-017-1152-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-017-1152-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2017 Feb 27;15(1):51. doi: 10.1186/s12967-017-1152-5.,20170227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Differentiated THP-1 macrophages were exposed to different concentrations of silica for 6 h and 24 h.

Expression levels of Gas6 and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) were measured by ELISA assay kits. Results: Silica particles induced clear dose-dependent decreases of cell viability and Gas6 expression at both 6 h and 24 h. The cell viability of 24 h is lower than 6 h at the same concentration of silica (P<0.05). Furthermore, silica activated macrophages treated with Gas6 antibody induced significant decreases of Gas6 both at 6 h and 24 h (P<0.05). After pretreated with various concentrations of Gas6 antibody, silica induced higher expressions of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6) in dose-dependent manners at two time points.

Recognition of modified histones by 'reader' proteins constitutes a key mechanism underlying these processes; therefore, targeting such pathways holds clinical promise, as exemplified by the development of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors. We recently identified the YEATS domain as an acetyl-lysine-binding module, but its functional importance in human cancer remains unknown. Here we show that the YEATS domain-containing protein ENL, but not its paralogue AF9, is required for disease maintenance in acute myeloid leukaemia. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated depletion of ENL led to anti-leukaemic effects, including increased terminal myeloid differentiation and suppression of leukaemia growth in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and crystal structural studies and chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analyses revealed that ENL binds to acetylated histone H3, and co-localizes with H3K27ac and H3K9ac on the promoters of actively transcribed genes that are essential for leukaemia. Disrupting the interaction between the YEATS domain and histone acetylation via structure-based mutagenesis reduced the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to ENL-target genes, leading to the suppression of oncogenic gene expression programs. Notably, disrupting the functionality of ENL further sensitized leukaemia cells to BET inhibitors. Together, our data identify ENL as a histone acetylation reader that regulates oncogenic transcriptional programs in acute myeloid leukaemia, and suggest that displacement of ENL from chromatin may be a promising epigenetic therapy, alone or in combination with BET inhibitors, for aggressive leukaemia.",,"['Wan, Liling', 'Wen, Hong', 'Li, Yuanyuan', 'Lyu, Jie', 'Xi, Yuanxin', 'Hoshii, Takayuki', 'Joseph, Julia K', 'Wang, Xiaolu', 'Loh, Yong-Hwee E', 'Erb, Michael A', 'Souza, Amanda L', 'Bradner, James E', 'Shen, Li', 'Li, Wei', 'Li, Haitao', 'Allis, C David', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Shi, Xiaobing']","['Wan L', 'Wen H', 'Li Y', 'Lyu J', 'Xi Y', 'Hoshii T', 'Joseph JK', 'Wang X', 'Loh YE', 'Erb MA', 'Souza AL', 'Bradner JE', 'Shen L', 'Li W', 'Li H', 'Allis CD', 'Armstrong SA', 'Shi X']",,"['Laboratory of Chromatin Biology &Epigenetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Center for Cancer Epigenetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', 'Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', 'Dan L.

The preferential involvement of chromatin-associated factors as MLL fusion partners belies a dependency on transcription control. Despite recent progress made in targeting chromatin regulators in cancer, available therapies for this well-characterized disease remain inadequate, prompting the need to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, using unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 technology to perform a genome-scale loss-of-function screen in an MLL-AF4-positive acute leukaemia cell line, we identify ENL as an unrecognized gene that is specifically required for proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To explain the mechanistic role of ENL in leukaemia pathogenesis and dynamic transcription control, a chemical genetic strategy was developed to achieve targeted protein degradation. Acute loss of ENL suppressed the initiation and elongation of RNA polymerase II at active genes genome-wide, with pronounced effects at genes featuring a disproportionate ENL load. Notably, an intact YEATS chromatin-reader domain was essential for ENL-dependent leukaemic growth. Overall, these findings identify a dependency factor in acute leukaemia and suggest a mechanistic rationale for disrupting the YEATS domain in disease.",,"['Erb, Michael A', 'Scott, Thomas G', 'Li,

Glass slide preparations of a wide range of nongynecologic cases were circulated to approximately 200 cytopathology laboratories in 16 countries. METHODS: General nongynecologic cytology cases were manufactured from residual specimens after routine diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cases were made by sampling fresh tissue and making direct specimens. The majority of cases consisted of both air-dried and fixed preparations. Results returned to laboratories included illustrated case discussions highlighting diagnostic features, key differential diagnoses, and useful adjunctive tests. RESULTS: The current study reviewed >22,000 results for 123 nongynecologic cases. Cases found to cause the most diagnostic difficulties included serous effusion cases with metastatic carcinoma in a dispersed pattern, well-differentiated carcinoma, and cellular reactive cases; urine specimens with sparse malignant cells; reactive pneumocytes in a bronchoalveolar lavage; breast FNA cases with papillary lesions; gestational specimens; and fibroadenoma. FNA specimens from the lung and thyroid, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma, generally were well reported. CONCLUSIONS: The use of multiple preparations of the same specimen has allowed interlaboratory comparison, and the quality assurance program has played an educational role as well as informing the laboratory accreditation process.

Data regarding the discontinuation of second-generation TKIs used in first-line treatment or after the failure of first-line treatment with TKIs are limited. Herein, the authors report real-world experience with ""reduced frequency"" molecular monitoring in patients with CML in all phases who discontinued treatment with imatinib, dasatinib, or bosutinib. METHODS: The records of patients who discontinued TKIs were reviewed. Patients who discontinued TKIs were monitored prospectively on an intended schedule of monthly blood quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for BCR-ABL1 for 3 months, quarterly for 12 months, and every 6 months thereafter until loss of major molecular response (MMR). After loss of MMR, the TKI that previously was discontinued was reinitiated. RESULTS: Between January 2010 and September 2015, a total of 24 patients in chronic (21 patients), accelerated (2 patients), and lymphoid blast (1 patient) phase discontinued imatinib (16 patients), dasatinib (5 patients), or bosutinib (3 patients) used in the front-line treatment or beyond. Blood quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for BCR-ABL1 was performed 1.3 +/- 0.7 times within the first 3 months (24 patients) and 2.7 +/- 1.4 times in the following 12 months (18 patients). With a median follow-up of 36.5 months (range, 3.2-67.4 months), the probabilities of treatment-free remission at 1 year and 2 years were 65.7% (95% confidence interval, 55.8%-75.6%) and 59.7% (95% confidence interval, 49.1%-70.3%), respectively. Loss of MMR was observed in 9 patients at a median of 2.8 months (range, 1.8-14.2 months) after discontinuation of TKIs. CONCLUSIONS: With the limitations of a small sample size, the results of the current study demonstrate that less frequent monitoring of BCR-ABL1 does not appear to affect outcomes, and that discontinuation of TKIs used as first-line treatment or beyond after resistance or intolerance to first-line treatment appears feasible.

This may be caused in part by differential access to specialized cancer centers (SCCs), because treatment at SCCs has been associated with improved overall survival. The authors examined social and clinical factors associated with AYA use of SCCs (defined as Children's Oncology Group-designated or National Cancer Institute-designated centers). METHODS: A retrospective, population-based analysis was performed on all hospital admissions of AYA oncology patients in California during 1991 through 2014 (n = 127,250) using the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development database. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined the contribution of social and clinical factors on always receiving care from an SCC (vs sometimes or never). Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Over the past 20 years, the percentage of patients always receiving inpatient care at an SCC increased over time (from 27% in 1991 to 43% in 2014). In multivariable regression analyses, AYA patients were less likely to always receive care from an SCC if they had public insurance (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.62-0.66), were uninsured (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.46-0.56), were Hispanic (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.85-0.91), lived > 5 miles from an SCC, or had a diagnosis other than leukemia and central nervous system tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Receiving care at an SCC was influenced by insurance, race/ethnicity, geography, and tumor type. Identifying the barriers associated with decreased SCC use is an important first step toward improving outcomes in AYA oncology patients. Cancer 2017;123:2516-23.

Marie Sklodowska Curie (1867-1934) suffered from radiations effects, as did girls in the radium dial watches factories. Therapeutic effects of radium were soon discovered, its unhealthy effects were as yet unheard of. OBJECTIVES: Analysis of Marie Sklodowska Curie (Marie) and radium girls occupational exposure, taking scientific debate on radium dangerous effects into account. METHODS: analysis of occupational exposure and diseases of Marie and radium girls in major documents, including Curie archive letters. RESULTS: Marie had dermatitis, radiodermatitis, tinnitus, one abortion, cataracts, tubercolosis, aplastic anemia. She also was a victim of mobbing. Women employed in the New Jersey radium dial watches factories, often immigrants, died of jaw necrosis, sarcoma of femur, anemia, leukemia and other radium related diseases. Marie was first asked about radium adverse effects by the New Jersey Department of labour (1925), Lise Meitner (1928) and the American Society for Cancer Control (1929). In 1928 Alice Hamilton organized a radium conference in order to find a solution to the radium girls' new disease. In 1929, during her second visit to the United States of America (USA), Marie declared how only prevention could save ""radium girls"". In 1934 she died of aplastic anemia, just like many radium girls. That year International Labour Office listed the new disease as due to ""radium, radioactive substances, X-rays""; it was followed in 1937 by five USA states.

Moreover, the spleen and BM of patients harbor atypical, clustered megakaryocytes, which contribute to the disease by secreting profibrotic cytokines. Here, we have revealed that megakaryocytes in PMF show impaired maturation that is associated with reduced GATA1 protein. In investigating the cause of GATA1 downregulation, our gene-expression study revealed the presence of the RPS14-deficient gene signature, which is associated with defective ribosomal protein function and linked to the erythroid lineage in 5q deletion myelodysplastic syndrome. Surprisingly, reduced GATA1 expression and impaired differentiation were limited to megakaryocytes, consistent with a proproliferative effect of a GATA1 deficiency on this lineage. Importantly, expression of GATA1 effectively rescued maturation of PMF megakaryocytes.

This approval was accomplished through an Abbreviated New Drug Application that demonstrated equivalence to Copaxone. METHOD: This article will provide an overview of the methods used to establish the biological and immunological equivalence of the two glatiramer acetate products, including methods evaluating antigenpresenting cell (APC) biology, T-cell biology, and other immunomodulatory effects. RESULTS: In vitro and in vivo experiments from multiple redundant orthogonal assays within four biological processes (aggregate biology, APC biology, T-cell biology, and B-cell biology) modulated by glatiramer acetate in MS established the biological and immunological equivalence of Glatopa and Copaxone and are described. The following were observed when comparing Glatopa and Copaxone in these experiments: equivalent delays in symptom onset and reductions in ""disease"" intensity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; equivalent dose-dependent increases in Glatopa- and Copaxone- induced monokine-induced interferon-gamma release from THP-1 cells; a shift to a T helper 2 phenotype resulting in the secretion of interleukin (IL)-4 and downregulation of IL-17 release; no differences in immunogenicity and the presence of equivalent ""immunofingerprints"" between both versions of glatiramer acetate; and no stimulation of histamine release with either glatiramer acetate in basophilic leukemia 2H3 cell lines. CONCLUSION: In summary, this comprehensive approach across different biological and immunological pathways modulated by glatiramer acetate consistently supported the biological and immunological equivalence of Glatopa and Copaxone.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['D Alessandro, Josephine', 'Garofalo, Kevin', 'Zhao, Ganlin', 'Honan, Christopher', 'Duffner, Jay', 'Capila, Ishan', 'Fier, Ian', 'Kaundinya, Ganesh', 'Kantor, Daniel', 'Ganguly, Tanmoy']","['D Alessandro J', 'Garofalo K', 'Zhao G', 'Honan C', 'Duffner J', 'Capila I', 'Fier I', 'Kaundinya G', 'Kantor D', 'Ganguly T']",,"['Research Department, Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA.

A total of 36 patients out of treatment from at least 3 months were enrolled and followed up for a median period of 44.2 months (range: 4.4-99.2). Matrix metalloprotease 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases 1 plasma levels and production/release from lymphoid cells were measured by zymography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. Malignant and normal lymphocyte mobility and matrix-degradation capability were studied using a Boyden chamber system, with and without autologous plasma. Free matrix metalloprotease 9 plasma levels were related with blood lymphocytosis, especially in more advanced stages (p = 0.003), and higher concentrations were associated with an increased disease progression risk (hazard ratio = 9.0, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-13.8). Leukemic cells expressed and secreted very little matrix metalloprotease 9. On the contrary, normal lymphocytes derived from the same leukemic patients showed matrix metalloprotease 9 intracellular levels that were lower in subjects with higher blood lymphocytosis (p = 0.024) and more advanced stages (p = 0.03); the released quantities were inversely associated with matrix metalloprotease 9 plasma concentrations (p = 0.035). Leukemic cells had a reduced spontaneous mobility and matrix-degradation capability that were stimulated by autologous plasma (p = 0.001) and normal lymphocytes (p = 0.005), respectively.

CLL is characterized primarily by an abnormal accumulation of neoplastic B cells in the blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. Methods: Men aged >50 years participated in this study. Enzyme-based plasma lipid profile estimations, peripheral blood lymphocyte isolation, lysate preparations, SDS-PAGE, western blotting, dil-LDL uptake and ultracentrifugation were employed. Results: Our study demonstrated hypocholesterolemia in lymphocytic leukemia in addition to hyper-expression of LDLRs in leukemic lymphocytes. Breakdown of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and failure to maintain the feedback mechanism normally processed by the transcription factor SREBP-2 in the cytoplasm was apparent. The presence of cholesterol in the nucleus was noted in leukemic lymphocytes. A comparison of cholesterol homeostasis between healthy controls and CLL subjects showed that cholesterol may contribute to lymphocytic leukemia. While plasma cholesterol levels decreased (p < 0.0005), hyper-expression of LDLR (p=0.0001), SREBP-2 (transcription factor of LDLR) (p=0.0001) and PBR (nuclear cholesterol channel protein) (p=0.016) was observed in lymphocytes isolated from CLL subjects in association with a significant increase in intracellular cholesterol in the nuclear (p=0.036) and cytoplasmic (p=0.004) compartments. Conclusion: This study provided insights into cholesterol homeostasis in CLL subjects regarding LDLR, SREBP-2 and PBR. Cholesterol may enter the nucleus through highly expressed PBR and may be involved in development of leukemia by influencing cell cycle mechanisms in the lymphocytes of CLL subjects.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],"['Sankanagoudar, Shrimanjunath', 'Singh, Govind', 'Mahapatra, Manaranjan', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Chandra, Nimai Chand']","['Sankanagoudar Sh', 'Singh G', 'Mahapatra M', 'Kumar L', 'Chandra NCh']",,"[""KLE University's, J.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) encompasses a class of aggressive tumors characterized by high rates of recurrence and metastasis, as well as poor overall survival. Here, we find that the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML exerts a prometastatic function in TNBC that can be targeted by arsenic trioxide. We found that, in TNBC patients, constitutive HIF1A activity induces high expression of PML, along with a number of HIF1A target genes that promote metastasis at multiple levels. Intriguingly, PML controls the expression of these genes by binding to their regulatory regions along with HIF1A. This mechanism is specific to TNBC cells and does not occur in other subtypes of breast cancer where PML and prometastatic HIF1A target genes are underexpressed. As a consequence, PML promotes cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in TNBC cell and mouse models. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of PML with arsenic trioxide, a PML-degrading agent used to treat promyelocytic leukemia patients, delays tumor growth, impairs TNBC metastasis, and cooperates with chemotherapy by preventing metastatic dissemination.

Recently, NOD/SCID/IL2rgammanull (NSG) mice were shown to engraft primary human AML in a manner that recapitulated the natural disease and its progression. Additionally, integrated genomic profiling was used to refine risk stratification of AML. In this study, we demonstrated the engraftment of molecularly defined primary AML in NSG mice. We showed that AML that express DNMT3A mutations, which predict for adverse outcome, engrafted with exceptional efficacy. Lastly, we demonstrated that human AML-engrafted NSG mice can be effectively used to study novel ceramide-based therapeutics. Ceramide is a bioactive sphingolipid that has been implicated as an inducer of apoptosis. Elevation in cancer cell ceramide levels either via exogenous delivery or by provoking intracellular ceramide generation is the goal of ceramide-based therapeutics. In this study, we used the human AML-engrafted NSG mouse model to evaluate nanoliposomal short-chain C6-ceramide and a nanoliposomal formulation of the ceramide-inducer tamoxifen.

At the same time, there is growing concern that chemotherapy causes alterations in brain development and cognitive abilities. We performed MRI measurements of white and gray matter volume to explore how variation in brain structure may be related to cognitive abilities in ALL survivors and healthy controls. METHODS: The sample included 24 male ALL survivors who had completed contemporary treatment 3-11 years prior, and 21 age- and sex-matched controls. Participants were between 8 and 18 years old. Working memory and motor response inhibition were measured with the N-Back and Stop Signal Tasks (SST), respectively. Participants underwent 3T structural MRI to assess white and gray matter volumes overall, lobe-wise, and in cortical and atlas-identified subcortical structures. Mental health was assessed with the Child Behavioral Checklist. RESULTS: ALL survivors performed more poorly on measures of working memory and response inhibition than controls. Frontal and parietal white matter, temporal and occipital gray matter volume, and volumes of subcortical white and gray matter structures were significantly reduced in ALL survivors compared with controls. Significant structure-function correlations were observed between working memory performance and volume of the amygdala, thalamus, striatum, and corpus callosum. Response inhibition was correlated with frontal white matter volume. No differences were found in psychopathology. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, a reduction in volume across brain regions and tissue types, was detectable in ALL survivors years after completion of therapy. These structural alterations were correlated with neurocognitive performance, particularly in working memory. Confirming these observations in a larger, more representative sample of the population is necessary. Additionally, establishing the time course of these changes-and the treatment, genetic, and environmental factors that influence them-may provide opportunities to identify at-risk patients, inform the design of treatment modifications, and minimize adverse cognitive outcomes.",,"['van der Plas, Ellen', 'Schachar, Russell J', 'Hitzler, Johann', 'Crosbie, Jennifer', 'Guger, Sharon L', 'Spiegler, Brenda J', 'Ito, Shinya', 'Nieman, Brian J']","['van der Plas E', 'Schachar RJ', 'Hitzler J', 'Crosbie J', 'Guger SL', 'Spiegler BJ', 'Ito S', 'Nieman BJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1158-186X'],"['Physiology and Experimental Medicine The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute Toronto ON Canada; Psychiatry Research The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto ON Canada.', 'Psychiatry Research The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto ON Canada; Department of Psychiatry Faculty of Medicine The University of Toronto Toronto ON Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics Faculty of Medicine The University of Toronto Toronto ON Canada; Department of Haematology/Oncology The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto ON Canada.', 'Psychiatry Research The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto ON Canada.', 'Department of Psychology The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto ON Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics Faculty of Medicine The University of Toronto Toronto ON Canada; Department of Psychology The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto ON Canada.', 'Physiology and Experimental Medicine The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute Toronto ON Canada; Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto ON Canada; Pharmacology and Pharmacy Faculty of Medicine The University of Toronto Toronto ON Canada.', 'Physiology and Experimental Medicine The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute Toronto ON Canada; Mouse Imaging Centre (MICe) The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto ON Canada; Ontario Institute for Cancer Research Toronto ON Canada; Department of Medical Biophysics The University of Toronto Toronto ON Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Brain Behav,Brain and behavior,101570837,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/*physiopathology', 'Gray Matter/*diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', '*Inhibition, Psychological', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Memory, Short-Term/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', '*Survivors', 'White Matter/*diagnostic imaging']",PMC5318374,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cognitive late effects', '*magnetic resonance imaging']",,2017/02/28 06:00,2017/10/31 06:00,['2017/02/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1002/brb3.621 [doi]', 'BRB3621 [pii]']",epublish,Brain Behav. 2016 Dec 29;7(2):e00621. doi: 10.1002/brb3.621. eCollection 2017 Feb.,20161229,,['CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although NK cells are the first donor-derived lymphocytes reconstituting post-HSCT, their distribution of CD56(++)CD16(-) (CD56(bright)), CD56(++)CD16(+) (CD56(intermediate=int)), and CD56(+)CD16(++) (CD56(dim)) NK cells is explicitly divergent from healthy adults, but to some extent comparable to the NK cell development in early childhood. The proportion of CD56(bright)/CD56(int)/CD56(dim) changed from 15/8/78% in early childhood to 6/4/90% in adults, respectively. Within this study, we first compared the NK cell reconstitution post-HSCT to reference values of NK cell subpopulations of healthy children. Afterward, we investigated the reconstitution of NK cell subpopulations post-HSCT in correlation to acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) and chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) as well as to viral infections. Interestingly, after a HSCT follow-up phase of 12 months, the distribution of NK cell subpopulations largely matched the 50th percentile of the reference range for healthy individuals. Patients suffering from aGvHD and cGvHD showed a delayed reconstitution of NK cells. Remarkably, within the first 2 months post-HSCT, patients suffering from aGvHD had significantly lower levels of CD56(bright) NK cells compared to patients without viral infection or without graft versus host disease (GvHD). Therefore, the amount of CD56(bright) NK cells might serve as an early prognostic factor for GvHD development. Furthermore, a prolonged and elevated peak in CD56(int) NK cells seemed to be characteristic for the chronification of GvHD. In context of viral infection, a slightly lower CD56 and CD16 receptor expression followed by a considerable reduction in the absolute CD56(dim) NK cell numbers combined with reoccurrence of CD56(int) NK cells was observed.

In adults (ad-CML), fibrosis represents an adverse prognostic factor. So far, the pro-fibrotic changes in the bone marrow microenvironment have not been investigated in detail in ped-CML. From a total of 66 ped-CML in chronic phase, biopsies were analysable and 10 had MF1/2 (MF1, n=8/10; MF2, n=2/10). We randomly selected 16 ped-CML and 16 ad-CML cases with and without fibrosis (each n=8) as well as 18 non-neoplastic controls. Bone marrow samples were analysed with a real-time PCR-based assay (including 127 genes for paediatric cases) and by immunohistochemistry. We found increased expression of megakaryocytic genes in ped-CML. The number of megakaryocytes and pro-platelets are increased in CML patients, but the most significant increase was noted for ped-CML-MF1/2. Anti-fibrotic MMP9 expression was lower in children than in adults. Cell mobilisation-related CXCL12 was decreased in young and adult patients with CML but not the corresponding receptor CXCR4.

Although rare, several cases have been reported and multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms have been independently proposed. We present a patient case and a literature review of the clinical presentation and mechanisms of CML-associated hypercalcemia. CASE REPORT A 58-year-old male with a past medical history of CML diagnosed six years earlier, presented to the emergency department with one week of acute confusion, disorientation, polyuria, and polydipsia. On physical examination, we observed tachycardia, altered mental status, and dehydration. Blood analysis revealed leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and marked hypercalcemia (18.6 mg/dL). His chest CT scan showed diffuse lytic lesions and bone destruction concerning for diffuse bone marrow involvement. The patient was diagnosed with hypercalcemia in the context of a CML blast phase. Treatment with hydration, calcitonin, and zoledronic acid lead to control of his symptoms and normalization of his serum calcium levels. After discharged, the patient was maintained on palliative treatment and zoledronic acid management without new episodes of hypercalcemia. However, eight months later, the patient died. CONCLUSIONS Evidence from the literature demonstrates a highly variable clinical presentation of CML-associated hypercalcemia, commonly occurring during an accelerated or a blast phase, and associated with poor survival. Multiple mechanisms could be involved and are not exclusive of each other. Better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in CML-associated hypercalcemia could lead to improvement in clinical and laboratory evaluation of these patients and be the foundation for the development of better management strategies and possibly target-directed therapy to positively improve prognosis.",,"['Toro-Tobon, David', 'Agosto, Sarimar', 'Ahmadi, Sara', 'Koops, Maureen', 'Bruder, Jan M']","['Toro-Tobon D', 'Agosto S', 'Ahmadi S', 'Koops M', 'Bruder JM']",,"['Department of Medicine, CES University, Medellin, Colombia.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Department of Endocrinology, South Texas Veterans Health Care System, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/blood/*pathology', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Calcitonin/*therapeutic use', 'Diphosphonates/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Imidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Zoledronic Acid']",PMC5340222,,,,2017/02/28 06:00,2017/03/21 06:00,['2017/02/28 06:00'],"['2017/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['902467 [pii]', '10.12659/ajcr.902467 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2017 Feb 27;18:203-207. doi: 10.12659/ajcr.902467.,20170227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Germline tumor antigens, such as WT1, Wilms' tumor gene 1, are overexpressed in many human malignancies but have low expression in somatic tissues. Recent vaccination approaches to target WT1 have been hampered by poor in vivo immune potency, likely due to the conserved self-antigen nature of WT1. In this study, we use a novel synthetic micro-consensus SynCon DNA vaccine approach with the goal of breaking tolerance and increasing vaccine immune potency. This approach induced new, neo-antigen-like responses that were superior to those induced by native WT1 DNA immunogens for driving T cell immunity and breaking tolerance. Non-human primates (NHPs) vaccinated with SynCon WT1 antigens elicited immune responses against native rhesus WT1 peptides. When delivered by electroporation (EP) in mice, SynCon-based WT1 constructs elicited strong CD4 and CD8 T cell responses (including IFN-gamma, CD107a, and TNF-alpha) to both native and consensus peptides. In addition, SynCon WT1 vaccine-induced antibodies recognized native WT1 in vitro. Vaccination with the SynCon WT1 immunogens was capable of slowing tumor growth in therapeutic models in vivo. These data support the further study of synthetic consensus DNA vaccines for breaking tolerance to important germline antigens.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

HFSR can necessitate dose reductions or interruption of therapy owing to its negative effect on the quality of life. Therefore, effective use of mTKIs requires measures to prevent HFSR. We evaluated the effect of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on HFSR, because PGE1 is already used to treat bed sores and skin ulcers and has established angiogenic and antiproliferative effects in keratinocytes. We found that the pathogenesis of sorafenib-induced HFSR is characterized by a decrease in levels of a phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We investigated the effect of PGE1 on the sorafenib-mediated reduction in phosphorylated STAT3 levels in HaCaT human epidermal keratinocytes. In cells treated with sorafenib, phosphorylated STAT3 levels decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, and this effect was blocked in cells treated with sorafenib and PGE1. Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated STAT3, the antiapoptotic proteins myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and survivin decreased in cells pretreated with an inhibitor of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Cell viability increased in cells treated with sorafenib and PGE1 compared with that in cells treated with sorafenib alone, and these effects were not observed in STAT3 knockdown HaCaT cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that PGE1 blocks the inhibitory effects of sorafenib on cell growth by maintaining the activity of STAT3 and enhancing the CREB activity. Therefore, PGE1 might represent an effective treatment for the prevention of sorafenib-induced HFSR.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Results showed that a single injection of gp85 recombinant protein could only produce low-titre antibodies that were maintained over a short time in few chickens. When combined with YF01 or CpG adjuvants, the recombinant protein could induce high-titre antibodies in most of the immunized chickens. Moreover, when the immune enhancer TPPPS was used with the two adjuvants, it further elevated the antibody levels for a longer duration. The eggs from four groups with the highest levels of ALV-J antibodies were collected, hatched, and examined for maternal antibodies. The protection by the maternal antibodies against ALV-J infection in the TPPPS-immunized group was higher than that in the group without TPPPS, which was consistent with the observations in the parents.

METHODS: Column chromatography was used for isolation of compounds from plant material. The structure of the isolated compound was identified by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, including HSQC, HMBC, NOE-difference experiments. The isolated compound was tested for its anti-proliferative activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and OCI-AML cells. RESULTS: Compound 1 was isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of Dacrycarpus imbricatus barks by column chromatography. Its chemical structure was identified as 20-hydroxyecdysone (20HE), a cholestane-type ecdysteroid, by a combination of mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometric analyses. Our goal was to test the anti-proliferative activity of 20HE using the OCI-AML cell line. 20HE significantly decreased OCI cell number at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, whereas lower concentrations were ineffective. Moreover, this decrease was due to partial blockage of the G1/S phase of the cell cycle, with a reduction of cells in the G2M phase, not due to increased apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: This indicates that 20HE significantly decreases the number of cells in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle in human AML cells. This is the first time that the anti-proliferative activity of 20HE against a human tumor cell line has been reported.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Hainan Medical University.

Because cardiac tamponade is ultimately a clinical diagnosis, mindful consideration for atypical presentations is essential for the reduction of mortality in the acute setting. Our patient was a 77year-old female admitted after presenting with general malaise, weakness, somnolence, altered mental status and urinary incontinence found to have CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) on confirmatory bone marrow biopsy after suspicions arose from a leukocytosis of 34,000 cells per mcL with 85% neutrophils and elevated blasts (8%). Initial vital signs revealed mild tachycardia, mild tachypnea and blood pressure elevated to 162/84mm Hg along with a temperature of 38.7 degrees C and oxygen saturation of 96% on 2l by nasal cannula. She received the standard of care for a community acquired pneumonia and was started on treatment with decitabine as further work-up was unremarkable. An abdominal CT performed for abdominal fullness later displayed a large pericardial effusion. Repeat echocardiography exhibited right atrial diastolic collapse, inferior vena cava dilatation (IVC) without inspiratory collapse >50% and the large pericardial effusion consistent with tamponade. The blood pressure remained hypertensive until she suddenly went into cardiac arrest after being intubated for a pericardial window and expired. Our case highlights the need to keep cardiac tamponade as a differential in the hypertensive individual with abdominal complaints as atypical presentations can obscure diagnosis, delay treatment and increase mortality.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The expression of these transcription factors enables a differentiated somatic cell to reverse its phenotype to an embryonic state, generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs from canine fetal fibroblasts were produced through lentiviral polycistronic human and mouse vectors (hOSKM/mOSKM), aiming to obtain pluripotent stem cells with similar features to embryonic stem cells (ESC) in this animal model. The cell lines obtained in this study were independent of LIF or any other supplemental inhibitors, resistant to enzymatic procedure (TrypLE Express Enzyme), and dependent on bFGF. Clonal lines were obtained from slightly different protocols with maximum reprogramming efficiency of 0.001%. All colonies were positive for alkaline phosphatase, embryoid body formation, and spontaneous differentiation and expressed high levels of endogenous OCT4 and SOX2. Canine iPSCs developed tumors at 120 days post-injection in vivo. Preliminary chromosomal evaluations were performed by FISH hybridization, revealing no chromosomal abnormality. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe the ability to reprogram canine somatic cells via lentiviral vectors without supplementation and with resistance to enzymatic action, thereby demonstrating the pluripotency of these cell lines.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Saliva proteins as possible biomarker for GVHD could facilitate the management and diagnosis accuracy. For support the proposed hypotheses, in this pilot study we collected whole saliva samples from patients with undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and from healthy subjects. Samples were collected prospectively between pre-transplant, thirty days, one hundred and, two hundred days after transplant. The proteomic profile was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and LCMS-ESI-IT-TOF mass spectrometry. The relevant personal data, past medical history were also recorded.

There have been concerns that military service may be associated with increased risk as a result of occupational exposures. To date, few studies have demonstrated an increased risk, although a disability pension is payable to veterans who were present at nuclear tests and who develop leukaemia (other than chronic lymphocytic leukaemia). The aim of the study was to utilise data from the Scottish Veterans Health Study to examine the risk of lymphohaematopoietic malignancy following military service in a large national cohort of veterans. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 57,000 veterans and 173,000 non-veterans born between 1945 and 1985 matched for age, sex and area of residence, adjusted for areal deprivation and followed up for up to 30 years, using Cox proportional hazard models to compare the risk of lymphohaematopoietic malignancy overall, by diagnosis and by sex and birth cohort. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant difference in risk between veterans and non-veterans either for all leukaemias (Cox proportional hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence intervals 0.84-1.27, p=0.773), Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence intervals 0.87-1.61, p=0.272) or for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence intervals 0.71-1.04, p=0.110). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide reassurance that service in the UK Armed Forces is not associated with increased risk of lymphohaematopoietic malignancy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These considerations prompted us to elaborate the present consensus document, which constitutes an update of the previous version published in 2013, mainly focusing on novel treatment strategies that have been developed over last 5 years, namely B-cell receptor inhibitors (ibrutinib and idelalisib), anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (ofatumumab and obinutuzumab), and Bcl-2 inhibitors (venetoclax). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of experts from the Spanish Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Group reviewed all published literature from January 2010 to January 2016, in order to provide recommendations based on clinical evidence. For those areas without strong scientific evidence, the panel of experts established consensus criteria based on their clinical experience. RESULTS: The project has resulted in several practical recommendations that will facilitate the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with CLL. CONCLUSIONS: There are many controversial issues in the management of CLL with no appropriate studies for making consensus recommendations.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

In an international phase IV trial (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01347996), 84 patients with AML in first complete remission who had not undergone transplantation received immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) and low-dose IL-2 with the aim of preventing relapse. The dynamics of myeloid cell counts and expression of activation markers was assessed before and after cycles of immunotherapy and correlated with clinical outcome in terms of relapse risk and survival. During cycles, a pronounced increase in blood eosinophil counts was observed along with a reduction in monocyte and neutrophil counts. A strong reduction of blood monocyte counts during the first HDC/IL-2 treatment cycle predicted leukemia-free survival. The HDC component of the immunotherapy exerts agonist activity at histamine type 2 receptors (H2Rs) that are expressed by myeloid cells. It was observed that the density of H2 R expression in blood monocytes increased during cycles of immunotherapy and that high monocyte H2R expression implied reduced relapse risk and improved overall survival. Several other activation markers, including HLA-DR, CD86, and CD40, were induced in monocytes and dendritic cells during immunotherapy but did not predict clinical outcome. In addition, expression of HLA-ABC increased in all myeloid populations during therapy. A low expression of HLA-ABC was associated with reduced relapse risk. These results suggest that aspects of myeloid cell biology may impact clinical benefit of relapse-preventive immunotherapy in AML.",['(c) Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Rydstrom, Anna', 'Hallner, Alexander', 'Aurelius, Johan', 'Sander, Frida Ewald', 'Bernson, Elin', 'Kiffin, Roberta', 'Thoren, Fredrik Bergh', 'Hellstrand, Kristoffer', 'Martner, Anna']","['Rydstrom A', 'Hallner A', 'Aurelius J', 'Sander FE', 'Bernson E', 'Kiffin R', 'Thoren FB', 'Hellstrand K', 'Martner A']",,"['TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; anna.martner@gu.se.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase IV', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine H2)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Count', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histamine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interleukin-2/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', 'Receptors, Histamine H2/biosynthesis', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],['*'],,2017/02/27 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2017/02/26 06:00'],"['2016/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.5VMA1116-455R [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.5VMA1116-455R [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2017 Aug;102(2):467-474. doi: 10.1189/jlb.5VMA1116-455R.

Here, we report the interaction between CFTR and HDAC2, and its involvement in the development of Ph+ leukemia. We first detected the physical interaction and co-localization of CFTR and HDAC2 in Ph+ leukemia cell lines. And treatment with CFTRinh-172, a CFTR inhibitor, reduced the expression of HDAC2 protein in K562 and SUP-B15 cells, which could be partially recovered by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Additionally, high expression levels of HDAC2 protein were observed in CFTR cDNA transfected HEK-293 and Ba/F3 cells. Next, we found that HDAC2 bound in the promoter region of the PTEN gene, and treatment with HDAC2 inhibitor or CFTRinh-172 resulted in an increase in PTEN mRNA and protein levels and a decrease in PDK1 and mTOR (downstream signaling of PTEN) activity. Finally, the MTT assay revealed that CFTRinh-172 could strengthen the anti-proliferation effect of HDAC2 inhibitor on Ph+ leukemia cells. Altogether, this study provides strong evidence that high-expression CFTR plays an important role in the development of Ph+ leukemia through the HDAC2-mediated PTEN pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To help elucidate the mechanism(s) behind these two phenomena we investigated the role of cholesterol to both. Human Daudi lymphoma cells were lipid deprived using a combination of three different approaches. Following treatment, the total cellular lipid content was analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol content measured using the lipophilic fluorescent probe NR12S. Maximal lipid deprivation of cells resulted in a complete loss of sensitivity to lysis by SA. Similarly augmentation of the anti-CD19 immunotoxin (IT) BU12-SAPORIN by SA was lost but without a concomitant loss of intrinsic IT cytotoxicity. The lytic activity of SA was restored following incubation of lipid deprived Daudi cells with Synthecol or LDL. The augmentative effect of SA on IT cytotoxicity for Daudi cells was restored following repletion of PM cholesterol levels with LDL. NR12S fluorescence and ESI-MS analysis of cellular lipids demonstrated that restoration of SA lytic activity by Synthecol was entirely due to increased PM cholesterol levels. Restoration of cellular and PM cholesterol levels by LDL also restored the augmentative effect of SA for IT, an effect associated with repletion of PM cholesterol with minor changes in some phospholipid species.

It was cytotoxic against leukemia cells (HL-60, U-937, MOLT-3, K-562, NALM-6, Raji), with significant effects against P-glycoprotein-overexpressing K-562/ADR and Bcl-2-overexpressing U-937/Bcl-2 cells, but had no significant cytotoxic effects against quiescent or proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The IC50 value for the leukemia HL-60 cells was 0.8 +/- 0.1 muM. This indicates a 60-fold greater toxicity than the naturally occurring flavonol quercetin. Synthetic 3',4'-dibenzyloxyflavonol induced S phase cell cycle arrest and was a potent apoptotic inducer in human leukemia cells. Cell death was (i) mediated by the activation and the cleavage of initiator and executioner caspases; (ii) prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk; (iii) associated with the release of cytochrome c and with the phosphorylation of members of the mitogen activated protein kinases including p38(MAPK), JNK/SAPK and ERK, and (iv) independent of the generation of reactive oxygen species.

One compound, termed 3144, was found to bind to RAS proteins using microscale thermophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry and to exhibit lethality in cells partially dependent on expression of RAS proteins. This compound was metabolically stable in liver microsomes and displayed anti-tumor activity in xenograft mouse cancer models.

We reviewed and summarized incidence patterns for histologic cancer groups and the most frequently diagnosed sites of cancer among teens during 2008-2012 reported by the SEER Cancer Statistics Review. We calculated annual incidence rates for the years 1975-2012 and used linear regression analysis to evaluate trends and calculate rates of change. Incidence for all sites combined increased annually by 0.67% for males and 0.62% for females during the period 1975 through 2012 -resulting in more than a 25% increase over 38 years. The biggest annual incidence increases occurred in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (2.16% females; 1.38% males), thyroid cancer (2.12% females; 1.59% males), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (1.73% females) and testicular cancer (1.55% males). Incidence rates for most histologic groups and sites showed steady long term increases over the 38 years of data.

DESIGN: A retrospective study with a prospective follow-up. PATIENTS: Pediatric ALL patients diagnosed between May 2009 and May 2014, who are still receiving or have completed their maintenance chemotherapy. Patients who completed chemotherapy were prospectively followed up for neutropenia. METHODS: TMP/SMX was used as the initial PJP prophylaxis. An alternative drug was indicated if the patient remained cytopenic for >3 weeks. Average absolute neutrophilic count (ANC), average % of oral mercaptopurine (6-MP), and methotrexate doses were calculated over a period of 6 months before and after shifting to dapsone. RESULTS: Sixty-two ALL patients were eligible for analysis. Twenty-four patients (38.7%) received TMP/SMX for PJP prophylaxis, whereas 34 patients received Dapsone (54.8%). Only 3 patients received IV pentamidine (4.8%), whereas 1 patient (1.6%) received atovaquone. The incidence of prophylaxis failure was 1/1041 months on TMP/SMX and 1/528 months on dapsone. After shifting to dapsone, patients maintained significantly higher ANC (1.46+/-0.46 vs. 1.17+/-0.40, P=0.0053), and received significantly higher doses of 6-MP (62.61%+/-11.45 vs. 57.45+/-10.14, P=0.0081) and methotrexate (64.9%+/-14.29 vs. 56.5%+/-9.9, P=0.0176), with a significantly shorter duration of chemotherapy interruption (1.94+/-1.2 vs. 3.25+/-1.29 wk, P=0.0002).

Most published cases have used nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens, show higher incidences of rejection and relapse rates and umbilical cord blood transplant has been reported to be suboptimal in patients with GATA2 deficiency because of longer period of engraftment leads to more infections and mortality. We report a 4.5-year-old girl with GATA2 deficiency who underwent matched unrelated donor HSCT utilizing a myeloablative conditioning regimen including intravenous busulfan (total dose of 12.8 mg/kg) and fludarabine (total dose of 160 mg/m) She tolerated the conditioning regimen and bone marrow infusion well. Her initial chimerism was mixed (90% donor), cyclosporine was gradually weaned and discontinued at day+85 and this resulted in conversion to full-donor chimerism.

PROCEDURE: This was a retrospective review of all patients with AML, who were treated according to the AML02 protocol between 2011 and 2015. The medical records were reviewed for any positive cultures from the initiation of the protocol until death or protocol discontinuation. Patient demographics, type of infections, type of isolated bacteria, and intensive care unit admissions were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were evaluated, who were of a mean age of 8 years+/-5.1 (SD). We identified 77 episodes of bacterial infections in 42 (84%) patients. Among those bacterial infections, 73 episodes were with bacteremia and included 45 (62%) gram-positive bacterial infections, 24 (33%) gram-negative bacterial infections, and 4 (6%) mixed gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial infections. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Viridans streptococci were the most commonly isolated bacteria in 33% and 30% of the episodes, respectively. Seventeen (45%) patients with bacteremia required intensive care unit admission. CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of bacterial infection was detected in patients who received the AML02 protocol, mainly gram-positive bacterial infections.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Group I (n=11): de novo ALL patients aged 1 to 18 years. Group II (n=46): pediatric ALL survivors in first complete remission and ALL patients on maintenance chemotherapy. We stratified group II into 3 subgroups according to the postdiagnosis period (group IIa: 8 to 24 mo, group IIb: 24 to 48 mo, group IIc: >48 mo). Group III (n=22): healthy siblings of group II. Daily oral vit D3 and Ca carbonate was given only to group I. In group I, BMD was measured at diagnosis and after completion of intensive chemotherapy (TP1 and TP2). RESULTS: A significant increase in Ca (P=0.024) and 25-OH vit D (P=0.01), and a decrease in magnesium (P=0.023) were detected at TP2 compared with TP1 in group I. Mean plasma levels of 25-OH vit D were <20 ng/mL in all the groups. Total body (P=0.005), total body less head (P=0.005), and L1 to L4 BMD Z scores (P=0.025) decreased significantly at TP2 compared with TP1. The lowest BMD scores were found at 8 to 24 months after diagnosis in unsupplemented patients. A gradual increase in BMD Z scores was shown, with the highest scores in group IIc. CONCLUSION: Vit D and Ca supplementation in pediatric ALL patients during intensive chemotherapy may not prevent bone mineral loss.

Different classes of molecules are currently under investigation and novel oral drugs have recently been approved or are in a late stage of clinical development. Areas covered: We present biological data illustrating the heterogeneous mechanisms of action of new oral drugs in CLL. Moreover, we provide clinical data from phase I to III studies, and discuss efficacy and side effects profile of these new therapies. Data are derived from peer-reviewed articles indexed in PubMed and from abstracts presented at major international meetings. Expert opinion: Novel oral drugs represent a valuable alternative to chemo-immunotherapy for patients with CLL, especially when high-risk disease features are present and when age or comorbidities preclude the use of standard treatments. Based on data from ongoing clinical trials, the indications of already approved agents will most likely be expanded and new options will soon be available. Moreover, treatment combinations will broaden the therapeutic armamentarium of physicians treating CLL. The availability of multiple choices is of benefit for patients with CLL, but also represents a challenge for the need of choosing the right drug for each patient.",,"['Vitale, Candida', 'Griggio, Valentina', 'Todaro, Maria', 'Salvetti, Chiara', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Coscia, Marta']","['Vitale C', 'Griggio V', 'Todaro M', 'Salvetti C', 'Boccadoro M', 'Coscia M']",,"['a Division of Hematology , University of Torino, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino , Torino , Italy.', 'b Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences , University of Torino , Torino , Italy.', 'a Division of Hematology , University of Torino, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino , Torino , Italy.', 'b Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences , University of Torino , Torino , Italy.', 'a Division of Hematology , University of Torino, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino , Torino , Italy.', 'b Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences , University of Torino , Torino , Italy.', 'a Division of Hematology , University of Torino, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino , Torino , Italy.', 'b Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences , University of Torino , Torino , Italy.', 'a Division of Hematology , University of Torino, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino , Torino , Italy.', 'b Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences , University of Torino , Torino , Italy.', 'a Division of Hematology , University of Torino, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino , Torino , Italy.', 'b Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences , University of Torino , Torino , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*ibrutinib', '*idelalisib', '*new drugs', '*target therapy', '*venetoclax']",,2017/02/25 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2017/02/25 06:00'],"['2017/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14656566.2017.1293655 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2017 Mar;18(4):411-425. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2017.1293655.

Materials and Methods Mortality risks were compared in nationwide cohorts of 45 634 FGI MDs and 64 401 psychiatrists. Cause of death was ascertained from the National Death Index. Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for FGI MDs versus psychiatrists, with adjustment (via stratification) for year of birth and attained age. Results During follow-up (1979-2008), 3506 FGI MDs (86 women) and 7814 psychiatrists (507 women) died. Compared with psychiatrists, FGI MDs had lower total (men: RR, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.77, 0.83]; women: RR, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.63, 1.00]) and cancer (men: RR, 0.92 [95% CI: 0.85, 0.99]; women: RR, 0.83 [95% CI: 0.58, 1.18]) mortality. Mortality because of specific types of cancer, total and specific types of circulatory diseases, and other causes were not elevated in FGI MDs compared with psychiatrists. On the basis of small numbers, leukemia mortality was elevated among male FGI MDs who graduated from medical school before 1940 (RR, 3.86; 95% CI: 1.21, 12.3). Conclusion Overall, total deaths and deaths from specific causes were not elevated in FGI MDs compared with psychiatrists. These findings require confirmation in large cohort studies with individual doses, detailed work histories, and extended follow-up of the subjects to substantially older median age at exit.

A variety of hematological malignancies demonstrate elevated CD47 expression, suggesting that CD47 may mediate immune escape. We discovered three unique CD47-SIRPalpha blocking anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with low nano-molar affinity to human and cynomolgus monkey CD47, and no hemagglutination and platelet aggregation activity. To characterize the anti-cancer activity elicited by blocking CD47, the mAbs were cloned into effector function silent and competent Fc backbones. Effector function competent mAbs demonstrated potent activity in vitro and in vivo, while effector function silent mAbs demonstrated minimal activity, indicating that blocking CD47 only leads to a therapeutic effect in the presence of Fc effector function. A non-human primate study revealed that the effector function competent mAb IgG1 C47B222-(CHO) decreased red blood cells (RBC), hematocrit and hemoglobin by >40% at 1 mg/kg, whereas the effector function silent mAb IgG2sigma C47B222-(CHO) had minimal impact on RBC indices at 1 and 10 mg/kg.

The mechanisms contributing to enhanced transcription of the gene coding for PKCbetaII, PRKCB, in CLL cells remain poorly described, but could be important because of potential insight into how the phenotype of these cells is regulated. Here, we show that SP1 is the major driver of PKCbetaII expression in CLL cells where enhanced association of this transcription factor with the PRKCB promoter is likely because of the presence of histone marks permissive of gene activation. We also show how vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulates PRKCB promoter function in CLL cells, stimulating PKCbeta gene transcription via increased association of SP1 and decreased association of STAT3. Taken together, these results are the first to demonstrate a clear role for SP1 in the up regulation of PKCbetaII expression in CLL cells, and the first to link SP1 with the pathogenesis of this and potentially other B cell malignancies where PKCbetaII is overexpressed.",,"['Al-Sanabra, Ola', 'Duckworth, Andrew D', 'Glenn, Mark A', 'Brown, Benjamin R B', 'Angelillo, Piera', 'Lee, Kelvin', 'Herbert, John', 'Falciani, Francesco', 'Kalakonda, Nagesh', 'Slupsky, Joseph R']","['Al-Sanabra O', 'Duckworth AD', 'Glenn MA', 'Brown BR', 'Angelillo P', 'Lee K', 'Herbert J', 'Falciani F', 'Kalakonda N', 'Slupsky JR']",,"['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool. 1st Floor Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool. 1st Floor Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool. 1st Floor Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool. 1st Floor Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool. 1st Floor Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton St, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Technology Directorate Computational Biology Facility, University of Liverpool, Biosciences Building, Crown Street, Liverpool, L69 7ZB, United Kingdom.', 'Technology Directorate Computational Biology Facility, University of Liverpool, Biosciences Building, Crown Street, Liverpool, L69 7ZB, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Functional and Comparative Genomics, University of Liverpool Biosciences, Building, Crown Street, Liverpool, L69 7ZB, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool. 1st Floor Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool. 1st Floor Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase C beta/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism']",PMC5324130,,,,2017/02/25 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2017/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['srep43228 [pii]', '10.1038/srep43228 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Feb 24;7:43228. doi: 10.1038/srep43228.,20170224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, MSCs have been studied extensively for their ability to treat glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly form of brain cancer in adults. MSCs are attractive therapeutics because they can be obtained relatively easily from patients, are capable of being expanded numerically in vitro, can be easily engineered and are inherently capable of homing to tumors, making them ideal vehicles for delivering biological antitumoral agents. Oncolytic viruses are promising biological therapeutic agents that have been used in the treatment of GBMs, and MSCs are currently being explored as a means of delivering these viruses.

This study aims to estimate the number of people living in Italy after a childhood cancer for all cancers combined and for a selection of cancer types. We computed 15-year prevalence using data from 15 Italian population-based cancer registries (covering 19% of Italian population) and estimated complete prevalence for Italy by using the CHILDPREV method, implemented in the COMPREV software. A total of 44,135 persons were alive at January 1st, 2010 after a cancer diagnosed during childhood. This number corresponds to a proportion of 73 per 100,000 Italians and to about 2% of all prevalent cases. Among them, 54% were males and 64% had survived after being diagnosed before 1995, the start of the observation period. A quarter of all childhood prevalent cases were diagnosed with brain and central nervous system tumors, a quarter with acute lymphoid leukemia, and 7% with Hodgkin lymphoma. Nearly a quarter of prevalent patients were aged 40 years and older.

Drugs such as proteasome inhibitors in multiple myeloma and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma have changed the face of treatment of hematologic malignancies. There are several reports of cardiovascular adverse events related to these newer agents. Both ""on-target"" and ""off-target"" effects of these agents can cause organ-specific toxicity. The need for long-term administration for most of these agents requires continued monitoring of toxicity. Moreover, the patient population is older, often over 50 years of age, making them more susceptible to cardiovascular side effects.

Approximately 10% of all leukemias harbor MLL1 translocations. Of these, two patient populations comprise the majority of cases: patients younger than 1 year of age at diagnosis (primarily acute lymphoblastic leukemias) and young- to-middle-aged adults (primarily acute myeloid leukemias). A much rarer subgroup of patients with MLL1 rearrangements develop leukemia that is attributable to prior treatment with certain chemotherapeutic agents-so-called therapy-related leukemias. In general, outcomes for all of these patients remain poor when compared to patients with non-MLL1 rearranged leukemias. In this review, we will discuss the normal biological roles of MLL1 and its fusion partners, how these roles are hypothesized to be dysregulated in the context of MLL1 rearrangements, and the clinical manifestations of this group of leukemias.

We have investigated how normal bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) support the in vitro proliferation of primary human AML cells. Both MSCs and primary AML cells show constitutive release of several soluble mediators, and the mediator repertoires of the two cell types are partly overlapping. The two cell populations were cocultured on transwell plates, and MSC effects on AML cells mediated through the local cytokine/soluble mediator network could thus be evaluated. The presence of normal MSCs had an antiapoptotic and growth-enhancing effect on primary human AML cells when investigating a group of 51 unselected AML patients; this was associated with increased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream targets, and the effect was independent of cytogenetic or molecular-genetic abnormalities. The MSCs also supported the long-term proliferation of the AML cells. A subset of the patients also showed an altered cytokine network with supra-additive levels for several cytokines. The presence of cytokine-neutralizing antibodies or receptor inhibitors demonstrated that AML cells derived from different patients were heterogeneous with regard to effects of various cytokines on AML cell proliferation or regulation of apoptosis.

For many years, we and others have reported on the role of these cells in the immune response to human cytomegalovirus in transplant patients, pregnant women, neonates, immunodeficient children, and healthy people. Indeed, and as described for CD8(+) T cells, CMV infection leaves a specific imprint on the gammadelta T cell compartment: (i) driving a long-lasting expansion of oligoclonal gammadelta T cells in the blood of seropositive individuals, (ii) inducing their differentiation into effector/memory cells expressing a TEMRA phenotype, and (iii) enhancing their antiviral effector functions (i.e., cytotoxicity and IFNgamma production). Recently, two studies using murine CMV (MCMV) have corroborated and extended these observations. In particular, they have illustrated the ability of adoptively transferred MCMV-induced gammadelta T cells to protect immune-deficient mice against virus-induced death. In vivo, expansion of gammadelta T cells is associated with the clearance of CMV infection as well as with reduced cancer occurrence or leukemia relapse risk in kidney transplant patients and allogeneic stem cell recipients, respectively. Taken together, all these studies show that gammadelta T cells are important immune effectors against CMV and cancer, which are life-threatening diseases affecting transplant recipients. The ability of CMV-induced gammadelta T cells to act independently of other immune cells opens the door to the development of novel cellular immunotherapies that could be particularly beneficial for immunocompromised transplant recipients.",,"['Khairallah, Camille', 'Dechanet-Merville, Julie', 'Capone, Myriam']","['Khairallah C', 'Dechanet-Merville J', 'Capone M']",,"['Immunoconcept, CNRS UMR 5164, Bordeaux University , Bordeaux , France.', 'Immunoconcept, CNRS UMR 5164, Bordeaux University , Bordeaux , France.', 'Immunoconcept, CNRS UMR 5164, Bordeaux University , Bordeaux , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC5298998,['NOTNLM'],"['antiviral immunity', 'bone marrow and organ transplantation', 'cytomegalovirus', 'memory T cells', 'gammadelta T cells']",,2017/02/25 06:00,2017/02/25 06:01,['2017/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00105 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Feb 9;8:105. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00105. eCollection 2017.,20170209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant differentiation during these stages can result in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). However, the mechanisms regulating the initial stages of human T-cell differentiation are obscure. Through loss of function studies, we showed BCL11B, a transcription factor recurrently mutated T-ALL, is essential for T-lineage commitment, particularly the repression of NK and myeloid potentials, and the induction of T-lineage genes, during the initial stages of human T-cell differentiation. In gain of function studies, BCL11B inhibited growth of and induced a T-lineage transcriptional program in T-ALL cells. We found previously unknown differentiation stage-specific DNA binding of BCL11B at multiple T-lineage genes; target genes showed BCL11B-dependent expression, suggesting a transcriptional activator role for BCL11B at these genes. Transcriptional analyses revealed differences in the regulatory actions of BCL11B between human and murine thymopoiesis.

Here, we report Cordon-bleu protein-like 1 (Cobll1) as a distinct molecular marker associated with drug resistance as well as progression to BC. In detail, Cobll1 increases IKKgamma stability, leading to NF-kappaB activation and reduction of nilotinib-dependent apoptosis, suggesting Cobll1-mediated NF-kappaB could be involved in drug resistance. Recently, NF-kappaB signalling has been highlighted as a core mechanism for chronic phase (CP)-BC progression, stem cell survival and tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. We also demonstrated that high expression of Cobll1 confers drug resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CML cell line as well as patient samples. The analysis of large sets of primary CML samples (n=90) shows that Cobll1 expression is dramatically increased in BC but not in CP, which is correlated with a poor survival rate (P=0.002). Moreover, our studies show that Cobll1 is highly expressed in CD34(+) primitive stem cell populations, and the zebrafish paralog Cobll1b is important for normal hematopoiesis during embryonic development.

We here found that activated autologous BM Th cells supported MM cell growth in a contact- and CD40L-dependent manner in vitro. MM cells had retained the ability to activate Th cells that reciprocated and stimulated MM cell proliferation. Autologous BM Th cells supported MM cell growth in xenografted mice and were found in close contact with MM cells. MM cells secreted chemokines that attracted Th cells, secretion was augmented by CD40-stimulation.

Using a short hairpin RNA strategy, we demonstrate here that the 2 mammalian RBPs, PUMILIO (PUM)1 and PUM2, members of the PUF family of posttranscriptional regulators, are essential for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation and survival in vitro and in vivo upon reconstitution assays. Moreover, we found that PUM1/2 sustain myeloid leukemic cell growth. Through a proteomic approach, we identified the FOXP1 transcription factor as a new target of PUM1/2. Contrary to its canonical repressive activity, PUM1/2 rather promote FOXP1 expression by a direct binding to 2 canonical PUM responsive elements present in the FOXP1-3' untranslated region (UTR). Expression of FOXP1 strongly correlates with PUM1 and PUM2 levels in primary HSPCs and myeloid leukemia cells. We demonstrate that FOXP1 by itself supports HSPC and leukemic cell growth, thus mimicking PUM activities. Mechanistically, FOXP1 represses the expression of the p21(-CIP1) and p27(-KIP1) cell cycle inhibitors. Enforced FOXP1 expression reverses shPUM antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities. Altogether, our results reveal a novel regulatory pathway, underscoring a previously unknown and interconnected key role of PUM1/2 and FOXP1 in regulating normal HSPC and leukemic cell growth.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Naudin, Cecile', 'Hattabi, Aurore', 'Michelet, Fabio', 'Miri-Nezhad, Ayda', 'Benyoucef, Aissa', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Guillonneau, Francois', 'Fichelson, Serge', 'Vigon, Isabelle', 'Dusanter-Fourt, Isabelle', 'Lauret, Evelyne']","['Naudin C', 'Hattabi A', 'Michelet F', 'Miri-Nezhad A', 'Benyoucef A', 'Pflumio F', 'Guillonneau F', 'Fichelson S', 'Vigon I', 'Dusanter-Fourt I', 'Lauret E']",,"['INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', ""Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives, DSV-IRCM-SCSR-LSHL, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'INSERM, U967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; and.', ""Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives, DSV-IRCM-SCSR-LSHL, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France."", 'INSERM, U967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Universite Paris-Sud, UMR 967, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; and.', 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', '3P5 Proteomic Facility, Paris Descartes University, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (FOXP1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PUM1 protein, human)', '0 (PUM2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC5429137,,,,2017/02/25 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2017/02/25 06:00'],"['2016/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33415-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-10-747436 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 May 4;129(18):2493-2506. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-10-747436.

Hitherto, studies on SSc pathogenesis centered on immune cells, vascular cells, and fibroblasts. Although dysregulated keratinocytes in SSc have been recently reported, the contribution of epithelial cells to pathogenesis remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated the induction of SSc-like molecular phenotype in keratinocytes by gene silencing of transcription factor Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli1), the deficiency of which is implicated in SSc pathogenesis. Keratin 14-expressing epithelial cell-specific Fli1 knockout mice spontaneously developed dermal and esophageal fibrosis with epithelial activation.

Recent discoveries have identified underlying disease-modifying molecular aberrations contributing to disease initiation and progression. Here, we report that deletion of Nol3 (Nucleolar protein 3) in mice leads to an MPN resembling primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Nol3(-/-) MPN mice harbor an expanded Thy1(+)LSK stem cell population exhibiting increased cell cycling and a myelomonocytic differentiation bias. Molecularly, this phenotype is mediated by Nol3(-/-)-induced JAK-STAT activation and downstream activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (Cdk6) and MycNol3(-/-) MPN Thy1(+)LSK cells share significant molecular similarities with primary CD34(+) cells from PMF patients. NOL3 levels are decreased in CD34(+) cells from PMF patients, and the NOL3 locus is deleted in a subset of patients with myeloid malignancies. Our results reveal a novel genetic PMF-like mouse model and identify a tumor suppressor role for NOL3 in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies.",['(c) 2017 Stanley et al.'],"['Stanley, Robert F',

Most cases involve the T-cell leukemia-1 (TCL1) gene at 14q11.2 resulting in overexpression of TCL-1, which is helpful for distinguishing T-PLL from other T-cell neoplasms. We report a patient with T-PLL whose leukemic cells were positive for TCL-1 by immunohistochemistry but with a normal karyotype. The patient had anti-CD52 antibody therapy for 12 weeks. In a follow-up bone marrow biopsy specimen, numerous TCL-1-positive cells were present, which raised the differential diagnosis of residual T-PLL. However, further immunophenotypic studies confirmed that these cells were hematogones. Therefore a diagnosis of recovering bone marrow was established. The patient underwent stem cell transplant and is now in complete remission. This case demonstrates that hematogones can express TCL-1, and this knowledge is very important for the differential diagnosis in the follow-up marrow of T-PLL patients.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Despite much recent advancement in therapy, CLL is still incurable. Lymph nodes and bone marrow represent sanctuary sites preserving leukemic cells from spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis, and infiltration of leukemic cells in these districts correlates with clinical stages and prognosis. The central role played by the microenvironment in the disease has become increasingly clear. Different chemokines (CXCL12, CXCL13, CCL19, CCL21) may in fact participate in attracting CLL cells into bone marrow and lymph nodes, where various factors, such as IL-15 and CXCL12, enhance leukemic cells survival. Recently, we have suggested that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), produced by microenvironmental stromal cells, can contribute to CLL pathogenesis. We have demonstrated that HGF exerts a double effect on CLL B cells through the interaction with its receptor c- MET; HGF, infact, protects CLL B cells, which are c-MET+, from apoptosis, and also polarizes mono/macrophages towards the M2 phenotype, thus facilitating the evasion of the CLL clone from immune control. This double effect appears mediated by the activation of two major signaling pathways: STAT3TYR705 and AKT. The aim of this review is to summarize data on HGF and c-MET expression in normal B cells and in B cell malignancies, with a particular emphasis on our results obtained in CLL. Altogether, the observations described here suggest that the HGF/c-MET axis may have a prominent role in malignancy progression further indicating novel potential therapeutic options aimed to block HGF-induced signaling pathways in B lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Giannoni, P', 'Cutrona, G', 'Totero, D de']","['Giannoni P', 'Cutrona G', 'Totero D']",,"['Stem Cell Laboratory, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMeS), University of Genoa, Via L.B.

G-CSF users had a shorter time to ANC recovery than the no G-CSF group (p<0.001). The chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia (CIFN) duration was significantly shorter in the preemptive group than in other groups (p<0.001). The incidence of CIFN was not significantly different between preemptive and non-G-CSF users (84.8% versus 82.4%). Preemptive G-CSF administration modestly improved treatment-related mortality (TRM), compared with no G-CSF administration (p=0.076 in multivariate analysis). G-CSF administration did not affect relapse-free or overall survivals or the cumulative relapse incidence among the groups. In conclusion, preemptive G-CSF administration reduced CIFN duration and modestly improved TRM without affecting chemotherapy outcomes.

Unfortunately, for many therapeutic targets such alleles are not available. To address this issue, we evaluated whether CRISPR-Cas9-mediated insertion/deletion (indel) mutagenesis can produce drug-resistance alleles at endogenous loci. This method takes advantage of the heterogeneous in-frame alleles produced following Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage, which we show can generate rare alleles that confer resistance to the growth-arrest caused by chemical inhibitors. We used this approach to identify novel resistance alleles of two lysine methyltransferases, DOT1L and EZH2, which are each essential for the growth of MLL-fusion leukemia cells. We biochemically characterized the DOT1L mutation, showing that it is significantly more active than the wild-type enzyme. These findings validate the on-target anti-leukemia activities of existing DOT1L and EZH2 inhibitors and reveal a simple method for deriving drug-resistance alleles for novel targets, which may have utility during early stages of drug development.",,"['Ipsaro, Jonathan J', 'Shen, Chen', 'Arai, Eri', 'Xu, Yali', 'Kinney, Justin B', 'Joshua-Tor, Leemor', 'Vakoc, Christopher R', 'Shi, Junwei']","['Ipsaro JJ', 'Shen C', 'Arai E', 'Xu Y', 'Kinney JB', 'Joshua-Tor L', 'Vakoc CR', 'Shi J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8427-6316'],"['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, United States of America.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, United States of America.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, United States of America.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, United States of America.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, United States of America.', 'W.

Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and histone acetyltransferase p300 (P300) are two well-known regulators for transcription factors; however, their roles in MRTF-A-related effect on neuronal injuries during I/R are still unclear. In this study, in a model rat cerebral I/R injury via middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion, we found that the expression and activity of HDAC5 was upregulated, whereas p300 and MRTF-A were downregulated both in expression and activity during I/R. Their expression changes and the interaction of the MRTF-A with HDAC5 or p300 were further verified by double immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation. In cultured neuronal apoptosis model induced by H2O2, MRTF-A exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect by enhancing the transcription of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 via CArG box binding. MRTF-A-induced anti-apoptotic effect was effectively inhibited by HDAC5, but was significantly enhanced by p300. The results suggest that both HDAC5 and p300 are involved in MRTF-A-mediated effect on neuronal apoptosis during ischemia/reperfusion injury, but with opposite effects.",,"['Li, Na', 'Yuan, Qiong', 'Cao, Xiao-Lu', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Min, Zhen-Li', 'Xu, Shi-Qiang', 'Yu, Zhi-Jun', 'Cheng, Jing', 'Zhang, Chunxiang', 'Hu, Xia-Min']","['Li N', 'Yuan Q', 'Cao XL', 'Zhang Y', 'Min ZL', 'Xu SQ', 'Yu ZJ', 'Cheng J', 'Zhang C', 'Hu XM']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Drug Research Base of Cardiovascular and Cerebral Vascular, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Drug Research Base of Cardiovascular and Cerebral Vascular, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Drug Research Base of Cardiovascular and Cerebral Vascular, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Drug Research Base of Cardiovascular and Cerebral Vascular, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Drug Research Base of Cardiovascular and Cerebral Vascular, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Drug Research Base of Cardiovascular and Cerebral Vascular, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Drug Research Base of Cardiovascular and Cerebral Vascular, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Drug Research Base of Cardiovascular and Cerebral Vascular, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Drug Research Base of Cardiovascular and Cerebral Vascular, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine and School of Engineering, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.', 'Drug Research Base of Cardiovascular and Cerebral Vascular, College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430065, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (myocardin-related transcription factor-A, rat)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Ep300 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Hdac5 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reperfusion Injury/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology']",PMC5386465,,,,2017/02/24 06:00,2017/10/31 06:00,['2017/02/24 06:00'],"['2016/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201716 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.16 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Feb 23;8(2):e2624. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.16.,20170223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, recent studies provided increased knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid tumors in children exposed to Chornobyl fallout. The risk of several forms of leukemia including myelodysplastic syndromes is elevated in Chornobyl liquidators. Furthermore, the upward trends of increases in a variety of other tumors including breast cancer, cancers of central nervous system and renal cancer have been reported in the persons exposed to Chornobyl fallout. There is growing evidence that insufficient apoptosis allows irradiated cells to survive and thereby contributes to carcinogenesis. The purpose of the present survey is to summarize the recent findings related to apoptotic biomarkers among cancer patients from the different populations affected by the Chornobyl catastrophe. Among the particularly radiosensitive cancer sites, we focused on thyroid cancer and leukemia. Several genes and/or proteins controlling apoptosis directly or indirectly have been incorporated into the analysis. The data reviewed here provide a mechanistic link between the apoptosis alterations and development of radiation-related cancer in the 30-year post-Chornobyl period. We suggest that the type of mutations arising from misrepair of DNA double strand breaks (gene fusion and amplification) is the initial signature event in radiation-induced thyroid cancer.

Numerous investigations emphasized the significance of genetic susceptibility to the radiation carcinogenesis. The aim of the work was to study the distribution of TP53 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CLL patients exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) due to Chornobyl nuclear power plant accident and estimate their impact on disease development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The TP53 exonic and intronic SNPs were analyzed in 236 CLL patients by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. The main group included 106 IR exposed CLL patients and thecontrol group was composed of 130 IR non-exposed CLL patients. RESULTS: Nineteen TP53 SNPs were found in the observed CLL cohort. No significant differences were found between the main and the control groups, but increased frequencies of T/T rs12947788 + G/G rs12951053 homozygotes and rs146340390 C/T variants were found among IR-exposed CLL patients compared with healthy Europeans (data from the 1000 Genomes Project). Rare nucleotide substitution rs146340390 (c.665C>T) was found only in the main group. These features were primarily typical for the most affected group of IR-exposed patients, namely, cleanup workers engaged in emergency works in the 2(nd) quarter of 1986. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings don't contradict the assumption on possible influence of IR on CLL development via the p53-dependent pathway.

Its physiologically active metabolite retinoic acid (RA), acting through nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), is a potent regulator of patterning during embryonic development, as well as being necessary for adult tissue homeostasis. Vitamin A deficiency during pregnancy increases risk of maternal night blindness and anemia and may be a cause of congenital malformations. Childhood Vitamin A deficiency can cause xerophthalmia, lower resistance to infection and increased risk of mortality. RA signaling appears to be essential for expression of genes involved in developmental hematopoiesis, regulating the endothelial/blood cells balance in the yolk sac, promoting the hemogenic program in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros area and stimulating eryrthropoiesis in fetal liver by activating the expression of erythropoietin. In adults, RA signaling regulates differentiation of granulocytes and enhances erythropoiesis. Vitamin A may facilitate iron absorption and metabolism to prevent anemia and plays a key role in mucosal immune responses, modulating the function of regulatory T cells. Furthermore, defective RA/RARalpha signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia due to a failure in differentiation of promyelocytes.

The aim was to establish a dual-label time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TRFIA) for the simultaneous determination of ferritin (FER) and beta2 -microglobulin (beta2 -MG) for the early screening and follow-up surveillance of lymphocytic leukemia. METHODS: The sandwich immunoassay was used to detect the concentration of FER, and the competitive immunoassay was used to detect the concentration of beta2 -MG in serum. FER in serum was captured by anti- FER antibody immobilized on microtiter wells, and then banded together with another anti- FER labeled with europium(III) Eu(3+) chelate, followed by fluorescence measurement using time-resolved fluorometry (TRF). Sm(3+) labeled beta2 -MG and beta2 -MG samples were added to compete with a certain amount of anti-beta2 -MG antibody, followed by fluorescence measurement using TRF. The performance of this dual-label TRFIA was evaluated using the clinical blood and compared with the commercial assays. RESULTS: The linear correlation coefficient (R(2) ) of the FER and beta2 -MG standard curves were 0.9914 and 0.9927, respectively. The sensitivity for FER detection was 8 ng/mL (dynamic range 0-1000 ng/mL), the average recovery was 100.51%; The sensitivity for beta2 -MG detection was 1 ng/mL (dynamic range 0-1000 ng/mL), the average recovery was 101.02%. High correlation coefficients (R(2) ) were obtained between the commercial assays (R(2) =.9966 for FER, and R(2) =.9897 for beta2 -MG). CONCLUSION: The present dual-label TRFIA has high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in clinical sample analysis.

Understanding the sequela of systemic involvement is key for proper diagnosis and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Over the decades, new research has emerged regarding neurological complications of the myeloid or lymphoid leukemias. Central nervous system involvement usually confers a poor prognosis and requires emergent treatment. Standard of care still involves systemic therapy, intrathecal administration of chemotherapeutic agents, and cranial radiation. Treatment-related side effects can occur and need to be recognized by any practitioner involved with patient care.

However, pre-clinical and clinical studies have established that under certain circumstances, anti-tumor responses can occur despite the absence of high levels of durable donor cell engraftment. Tumor response with little or no donor engraftment has been termed ""microtransplantation."" It has been hard to define conditions leading to tumor responses without donor cell persistence in humans because the degree of engraftment depends very heavily upon many patient-specific factors, including immune status and degree of prior therapy. Likewise, it is unknown to what degree donor chimerism in the blood or tissue is required for an anti-tumor effect under conditions of microtransplantation. In this review, we summarize some key studies supporting the concept of microtransplantation and emphasize the importance of recent large studies of microtransplantation in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). These AML studies provide the first evidence of the efficacy of microtransplantation as a therapeutic strategy and lay the foundation for additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that will refine the understanding of the mechanisms involved and guide its further development as a treatment modality.",,"['David, Kevin A', 'Cooper, Dennis', 'Strair, Roger']","['David KA', 'Cooper D', 'Strair R']",,"['Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, 195 Little Albany Street, New Brunswick, NJ, 08901, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, 195 Little Albany Street, New Brunswick, NJ, 08901, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, 195 Little Albany Street, New Brunswick, NJ, 08901, USA. strairrk@cinj.rutgers.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myelogenous leukemia', '*Graft-versus-tumor', '*Microtransplantation', '*Stem cell transplantation']",,2017/02/24 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2017/02/24 06:00'],"['2017/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-017-0361-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-017-0361-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2017 Feb;12(1):51-60. doi: 10.1007/s11899-017-0361-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Performing single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments, we showed that the aptamer sgc8c bound with high probability (38.3 +/- 7.48%) and high specificity to PTK7, as demonstrated by receptor blocking experiments and through comparison with the binding behavior of a nonspecific aptamer. The determined kinetic off-rate (koff = 5.16 s(-1)) indicates low dissociation of the sgc8c-PTK7 complex. In addition to the pulling force experiments, simultaneous topography and recognition imaging (TREC) experiments using AFM tips functionalized with sgc8c aptamers were realized on the outer regions surface of surface-immobilized Jurkat cells for the first time. This allowed determination of the distribution of PTK7 without any labeling and at near physiological conditions. As a result, we could show a homogeneous distribution of PTK7 molecules on the outer regions of ALL cells with a surface density of 325 +/- 12 PTK7 receptors (or small receptor clusters) per mum(2). Graphical Abstract The specific interaction of the DNA aptamer sgc8c and protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7) on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells was characterized. AFM based single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) yielded a kinetic off-rate of 5.16 s(-1) of the complex.

Besides vasculopathy, thrombophilia, or cardiac disorders, cancer and chemotherapy are known predisposing factors for AIS. Leukemia can be associated with different abnormal coagulation parameters, but severe bleeding or thrombosis occurs rarely. Clinical Course: We report the case of a 2-year-old boy who was presented to our emergency ward after a prolonged seizure with right sided postictal hemiparesis. Cranial computed tomography scan revealed a large infarction and edema due to thrombosis of the left carotid artery, the middle cerebral artery, and the anterior cerebral artery. Laboratory workup showed 196 g/L leukocytes with 75% myeloid blast cells. Immediate exchange transfusion, hydration, and chemotherapy with cytarabine were started. During the hospital course intracranial pressure increased and the patient developed a unilateral dilated pupil unresponsive to light. Cranial computed tomography scan revealed a new infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory. Refractory increased intracranial pressure and brain stem herniation developed, and the child died 3 days after admission to hospital. Conclusion: Seizures with postictal hemiparesis due to cerebral infarction can be a rare manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia. Leukocytosis and cancer-induced coagulopathy are main reasons for thrombosis and/or hemorrhage. High leukocyte counts need immediate interventions with hydration, careful chemotherapy, and perhaps exchange transfusion or leukapharesis. In the presence of thrombosis, anticoagulation must be discussed despite the risk of bleeding due to hyperfibrinolysis and low platelet counts. Mortality may be reduced by awareness of this rare presentation of leukemia and prompt institution of leucoreductive treatment.",,"['Olivieri, Martin', 'Kurnik, Karin', 'Heinen, Florian', 'Schmid, Irene', 'Hoffmann, Florian', 'Reiter, Karl', 'Gerstl, Lucia']","['Olivieri M', 'Kurnik K', 'Heinen F', 'Schmid I', 'Hoffmann F', 'Reiter K', 'Gerstl L']",,"[""Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany."", ""Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany."", ""Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany."", ""Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany."", ""Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany."", ""Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany."", ""Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, LMU Munich, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Glob Pediatr Health,Global pediatric health,101670224,,,,PMC5308527,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'emergency medicine', 'epileptic seizure', 'hematology/oncology', 'hyperleukocytosis', 'pediatric stroke']","['Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",2017/02/24 06:00,2017/02/24 06:01,['2017/02/24 06:00'],"['2016/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2333794X16681934 [doi]', '10.1177_2333794X16681934 [pii]']",epublish,Glob Pediatr Health. 2016 Dec 13;3:2333794X16681934. doi: 10.1177/2333794X16681934. eCollection 2016.,20161213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SGI-1776, a small molecule, is the first clinically tested inhibitor of the Pim kinase family. Here, we aimed to explore the effect of SGI-1776 on salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC). Expression of Pim-1 was confirmed in SACC and control tissues by qRT-PCR. After SGI-1776 treatment, the Pim-1 expressions and Pim-1 kinase activity in both SACC-83 and SACC-LM cell lines were measured. Cell proliferation, cell invasion, cell cycle, apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed. Also, the expression of FOXO3a, p-FOXO3a, RUNX3, Bcl-2, BAD, p-BAD, Bim and p-Bim were detected by Western blot. The results showed that Pim-1 was significantly overexpressed in SACC tissues. SGI-1776 down-regulated the Pim-1 expression, inhibited Pim-1 kinase activity, reduced cell proliferation, decreased invasive ability, increased caspase-3 activity and induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial depolarization. Reduced expression was also seen in p-FOXO3a, RUNX3, Bcl-2, p-BAD and p-Bim, whereas no significant changes were observed from FOXO3a, BAD and Bim. These results confirm the pivotal role of Pim-1 in SACC and suggest that targeting Pim-1 kinase signal pathway by SGI-1776 might be a promising therapeutic modality for SACC.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Yet, compared to leukocytes, the regulation of inflammatory pathways in fibroblasts is largely unknown. Here, we report that analyses of genes coordinately upregulated with IL-6 pointed to STAT4 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as potentially linked. Gene silencing revealed that STAT4 was required for IL-6 transcription. STAT4 was recruited to the IL-6 promoter after fibroblast activation, and LIF receptor (LIFR) and STAT4 formed a molecular complex that, together with JAK1 and TYK2 kinases, controlled STAT4 activation. Importantly, a positive feedback loop involving autocrine LIF, LIFR, and STAT4 drove sustained IL-6 transcription. Besides IL-6, this autorine loop also drove the production of other key inflammatory factors including IL-8, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-33, IL-11, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent an attractive approach for delivery of therapeutic agents to cancer sites owing to their tropism towards tumors, but their immunosuppression capabilities, especially induced by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), should also be taken into consideration. METHODS: Human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) were genetically modified to secrete Tandab (CD3/CD19), a tetravalent bispecific tandem diabody with two binding sites for CD3 and two for CD19. The tropism of MSCs towards Raji cells in vitro was determined by migration assays, and the homing property of MSCs in vivo was analyzed with firefly luciferase-labeled MSCs (MSC-Luc) by bioluminescent imaging (BLI). The cytotoxicity of T cells induced by MSC-secreting Tandab (CD3/CD19) was detected in vitro and in vivo in combination with D-1-methyl-tryptophan (D-1MT), an IDO pathway inhibitor. RESULTS: The purified Tandab (CD3/CD19) was functional with high-binding capability both for CD3-positive cells and CD19-positive cells and was able to induce specific lysis of CD19-positive cell lines (Raji, Daudi, and BJAB) in the presence of T cells. Additionally, results from co-culture killing experiments demonstrated that Tandab (CD3/CD19) secreted from MSCs was also effective. Then, we confirmed that D-1MT could enhance the cytotoxicity of T cells triggered by MSC-Tandab through reversing T cell anergy with down-regulation of CD98 and Jumonji and restoring the proliferation capacity of T cells. Furthermore, MSC-Luc could selectively migrate to tumor site in a BALB/c nude mouse model with Raji cells.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHOD: In this research, 330 LSCC patients, 310 healthy controls, and 155 vocal leukoplakia patients were genotyped for the BCL11A (rs11886868 C/T and rs4671393 A/G) genotypes by pyrosequencing; the BCL11A concentration was measured using ELISA. RESULTS: LSCC Patients had a notably higher occurrence of CT at rs11886868 (OR = 2.64, P = 0.025) than the control group; they also had higher GG at rs4671393 (OR = 2.53, P = 0.018). Advanced (III and IV) stage LSCC patients had a notably greater frequency of CT at rs11886868 than those with initial (I and II) stage LSCC (OR = 2.71, P = 0.044 vs. OR = 2.58, P = 0.051). Additionally, there was a 1.59 fold increase in susceptibility for initial stage LSCC related to the G allele (AG/GG) at rs4671393 (P = 0.005); while for patients of advanced stage LSCC the OR was 1.73 (P = 0.002). Moreover, the OR of lymph node metastasis patients at rs4671393 G alleles was 2.41 (P < 0.01); it was 1.38 (P = 0.035) in patients without lymph metastasis. Patients with high incidences of the rs4671393 variation genotype had high plasma BCL11A levels. CONCLUSIONS: BCL11A rs11886868 and rs4671393 genotype variations and correspondingly high BCL11A plasma levels are related to LSCC, besides, differences in plasma levels and genotype distribution may be related to lymph node metastasis status and the stage of LSCC.",,"['Zhou, Jian', 'Yang, Yue', 'Zhang, Duo', 'Zhou, Liang', 'Tao, Lei', 'Lu, Li-Ming']","['Zhou J', 'Yang Y', 'Zhang D', 'Zhou L', 'Tao L', 'Lu LM']",,"['Department of Otolaryngology, Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Clinical Disciplines of otorhinolaryngology, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Clinical Disciplines of otorhinolaryngology, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Clinical Disciplines of otorhinolaryngology, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Clinical Disciplines of otorhinolaryngology, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Key Clinical Disciplines of otorhinolaryngology, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Immunology, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (BCL11A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*blood/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*blood/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Repressor Proteins']",PMC5321498,,,,2017/02/23 06:00,2017/08/22 06:00,['2017/02/23 06:00'],"['2016/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0171116 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-29722 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Feb 22;12(2):e0171116. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0171116. eCollection 2017.,20170222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most successful CARs used to date are those targeting CD19 (ref. 2), which offer the prospect of complete remission in patients with chemorefractory or relapsed B-cell malignancies. CARs are typically transduced into the T cells of a patient using gamma-retroviral vectors or other randomly integrating vectors, which may result in clonal expansion, oncogenic transformation, variegated transgene expression and transcriptional silencing. Recent advances in genome editing enable efficient sequence-specific interventions in human cells, including targeted gene delivery to the CCR5 and AAVS1 loci. Here we show that directing a CD19-specific CAR to the T-cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) locus not only results in uniform CAR expression in human peripheral blood T cells, but also enhances T-cell potency, with edited cells vastly outperforming conventionally generated CAR T cells in a mouse model of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We further demonstrate that targeting the CAR to the TRAC locus averts tonic CAR signalling and establishes effective internalization and re-expression of the CAR following single or repeated exposure to antigen, delaying effector T-cell differentiation and exhaustion. These findings uncover facets of CAR immunobiology and underscore the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to advance immunotherapies.",,"['Eyquem, Justin', 'Mansilla-Soto, Jorge', 'Giavridis, Theodoros', 'van der Stegen, Sjoukje J C', 'Hamieh, Mohamad', 'Cunanan, Kristen M', 'Odak, Ashlesha', 'Gonen, Mithat', 'Sadelain, Michel']","['Eyquem J', 'Mansilla-Soto J', 'Giavridis T', 'van der Stegen SJ', 'Hamieh M', 'Cunanan KM', 'Odak A', 'Gonen M', 'Sadelain M']",,"['Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Center for Cell Engineering and Immunology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, New York 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', '*CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Editing', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Loci/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Translational Research, Biomedical']",PMC5558614,,,,2017/02/23 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2017/02/23 06:00'],"['2016/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['nature21405 [pii]', '10.1038/nature21405 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2017 Mar 2;543(7643):113-117. doi: 10.1038/nature21405.

Although many aspects of the workup for acute leukemia are well accepted, few guidelines have addressed the different aspects of the diagnostic evaluation of samples from patients suspected to have acute leukemia. OBJECTIVE: - To develop a guideline for treating physicians and pathologists involved in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of new acute leukemia samples, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage. DESIGN: - The College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Hematology convened a panel of experts in hematology and hematopathology to develop recommendations. A systematic evidence review was conducted to address 6 key questions. Recommendations were derived from strength of evidence, feedback received during the public comment period, and expert panel consensus. RESULTS: - Twenty-seven guideline statements were established, which ranged from recommendations on what clinical and laboratory information should be available as part of the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of acute leukemia samples to what types of testing should be performed routinely, with recommendations on where such testing should be performed and how the results should be reported. CONCLUSIONS: - The guideline provides a framework for the multiple steps, including laboratory testing, in the evaluation of acute leukemia samples. Some aspects of the guideline, especially molecular genetic testing in acute leukemia, are rapidly changing with new supportive literature, which will require on-going updates for the guideline to remain relevant.",,"['Arber, Daniel A', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Cessna, Melissa', 'Etzell, Joan', 'Foucar, Kathryn', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Rizzo, J Douglas', 'Theil, Karl', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Smith, Anthony T', 'Rumble, R Bryan', 'Thomas, Nicole E', 'Vardiman, James W']","['Arber DA', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Cessna M', 'Etzell J', 'Foucar K', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Rizzo JD', 'Theil K', 'Wang SA', 'Smith AT', 'Rumble RB', 'Thomas NE', 'Vardiman JW']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Pathology, Clinical/*standards']",,,,,2017/02/23 06:00,2017/10/21 06:00,['2017/02/23 06:00'],"['2017/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/arpa.2016-0504-CP [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2017 Oct;141(10):1342-1393. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2016-0504-CP.

In checking the CD4+ : CD8+ T-cell ratio and verifying the impossibility of raising the level of immunoglobulins, we must weigh the possible benefits of continuing treatment with monoclonal antibody against the risks. 3. Physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for the development of PML in patients under treatment with monoclonal antibodies, especially when there is a new development of neurological signs or symptoms.Key words: JC virus - progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy - recommendation - rituximab.",,"['Sokol, Juraj', 'Lisa, Lenka', 'Zelenakova, Jana', 'Balharek, Tomas', 'Plamenova, Ivana', 'Stasko, Jan', 'Kubisz, Peter']","['Sokol J', 'Lisa L', 'Zelenakova J', 'Balharek T', 'Plamenova I', 'Stasko J', 'Kubisz P']",,,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain/*diagnostic imaging', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/immunology', 'JC Virus', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/*diagnosis/etiology/immunology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Rituximab/*adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,,,2017/02/23 06:00,2017/09/13 06:00,['2017/02/23 06:00'],"['2017/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['60343 [pii]'],ppublish,Vnitr Lek.

Studies were performed to investigate the relationship between EBV infection and immunophenotyping of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chromosome aberrations. Additionally, the effects of EBV on clinical prognosis were described. Fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) was used to detect EBV-DNA copy numbers from bone marrow in 110 cases of patients with ALL, 75 cases of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 37 cases of hematologically healthy control subjects. EBV-DNA copies were found in 64 of 185 (34.6%) patients with AL and 2 of 37 healthy control subjects (P < 0.001). The EBV infection rate of ALL patients, AML patients, and healthy controls was 40.9% (45/110), 25.3% (19/75), and 5.4% (2/37), respectively. The positive rate of EBV in the ALL and AML groups was higher than in healthy subjects (P < 0.05). EBV-DNA copies were found in 1 of 12 (8.3%) T-ALLs and 44 of 98 (44.9%) B-ALLs, the positive rate of EBV in B-ALLs increased significantly compared to the rate of T-ALLs (P < 0.05). Chromosome karyotype analysis showed that EBV infection rates in B-ALL, T-ALL, and AML patients with chromosome abnormalities were 46.3% (25/54), 33.3% (1/3), and 30% (9/30), respectively. There was no statistical significance between chromosome abnormality and EBV infection (P > 0.05). In addition, EBV(+) -ALLs had higher relapse and mortality rates than that of EBV(-) -ALLs. Together, we conclude that EBV infection may be correlated with the incidence of AL, and the infection rate of EBV in B-ALL was higher than that of T-ALL. EBV-positive patients showed an unfavorable prognosis.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Guan, Hongzai', 'Miao, Hongxia', 'Ma, Na', 'Lu, Wei', 'Luo, Bing']","['Guan H', 'Miao H', 'Ma N', 'Lu W', 'Luo B']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6541-5958'],"['Department of Hematology, Qingdao University Medical College, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qingdao University Medical College, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ji Ning Medical College, Ji Ning, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qingdao University Medical College, Qingdao, China.', 'Departmentof Microbiology, Qingdao University Medical College, Qingdao, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/virology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Viral Load', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Epstein-Barr virus', '*FQ-PCR', '*acute leukemia', '*chromosome', '*karyotyping']",,2017/02/23 06:00,2018/02/01 06:00,['2017/02/23 06:00'],"['2016/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.24797 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2017 Aug;89(8):1453-1460. doi: 10.1002/jmv.24797.

We aimed to assess the TLs of interphase and metaphase cells of MDS and telomerase activity (TA) and to find out prognostic significances of TL and TA. METHODS: The prognostic significance of TA by quantitative PCR and TL by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (QFISH) of interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosome arms of bone marrow cells from patients with MDS were evaluated. RESULTS: MDS patients had shorter interphase TL than normal healthy donors (P<0.001). Average interphase and metaphase TL were inversely correlated (P=0.013, p arm; P=0.029, q arm), but there was no statistically significant correlation between TA and TL (P=0.258). The progression free survival was significantly shorter in patients with high TA, but the overall survival was not different according to average TA or interphase TL groups. Multivariable Cox analysis showed that old age, higher International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) subtypes, transformation to AML, no history of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and short average interphase TL (<433 TL) as independent prognostic factors for poorer survival (P=0.003, 0.001, 0.005, 0.005, and 0.013, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of correlation between age and TL, TA, and TL, and the inverse relationship between TL and TA in MDS patients reflect the dysregulation of telomere status and proliferation. As a prognostic marker for leukemia progression, TA may be considered, and since interphase TL has the advantage of automated measurement by QFISH, it may be used as a prognostic marker for survival in MDS.",['(c) The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine'],"['Park, Hee Sue', 'Choi, Jungeun', 'See, Cha Ja', 'Kim, Jung Ah', 'Park, Si Nae', 'Im, Kyongok', 'Kim, Sung Min', 'Lee, Dong Soon', 'Hwang, Sang Mee']","['Park HS', 'Choi J', 'See CJ', 'Kim JA', 'Park SN', 'Im K', 'Kim SM', 'Lee DS', 'Hwang SM']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Korea University Anam Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cytogenetics Team, Seegene Medical Foundation, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. soonlee@snu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea. sangmee1@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Telomere Shortening']",PMC5339091,['NOTNLM'],"['Interphase', 'Metaphase', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'Prognosis', 'Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization', 'Telomerase activity', 'Telomere length']",,2017/02/23 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2017/02/23 06:00'],"['2016/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['37.195 [pii]', '10.3343/alm.2017.37.3.195 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2017 May;37(3):195-203. doi: 10.3343/alm.2017.37.3.195.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although differentiation induction therapy utilizing 1,25(OH)2 D3 (VD3) has shown great promise for the improvement of AML treatment efficacy, severe side effects caused by its supraphysiological dose limit its clinical application. Here we investigated the combinatorial effect of l-asparaginase (ASNase)-mediated amino acid depletion and the latent alternation of VD3 activity on the induction of myeloid differentiation. ASNase treatment enhanced VD3-driven phenotypic and functional differentiation of three-different AML cell lines into monocyte/macrophages, along with c-Myc downregulation. Using gene silencing with shRNA and a chemical blocker, we found that reduced c-Myc is a critical factor for improving VD3 efficacy. c-Myc-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 signaling and induction of autophagy were involved in the enhanced AML cell differentiation. In addition, in a postculture of AML cells after each treatment, ASNase supports the antileukemic effect of VD3 by inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis. Finally, we confirmed that the administration of ASNase significantly improved VD3 efficacy in the prolongation of survival time in mice bearing tumor xenograft. Our results are the first to demonstrate the extended application of ASNase, which is currently used for acute lymphoid leukemia, in VD3-mediated differentiation induction therapy for AML, and suggest that this drug combination may be a promising novel strategy for curing AML.",['(c) 2017 UICC.'],"['Song, Ju Han', 'Park, Eunchong', 'Kim, Myun Soo', 'Cho, Kyung-Min', 'Park, Su-Ho', 'Lee, Arim', 'Song, Jiseon', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Koh, Jeong-Tae', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Song JH', 'Park E', 'Kim MS', 'Cho KM', 'Park SH', 'Lee A', 'Song J', 'Kim HJ', 'Koh JT', 'Kim TS']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0384-4407'],"['Division of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, 58128, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Dental Therapeutics, Research Center for Biomineralization Disorders, School of Dentistry, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, 61186, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Asparaginase/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*1,25(OH)2D3', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*autophagy', '*c-Myc', '*l-asparaginase', '*mTORC1', '*myeloid differentiation']",,2017/02/23 06:00,2017/05/11 06:00,['2017/02/23 06:00'],"['2016/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.30662 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2017 May 15;140(10):2364-2374. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30662.

METHODS: Patients received nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, up to 24 months. RESULTS: At screening, 983 patients were identified as Ph+ and 30 patients as Ph-/BCR-ABL + based on cytogenetic and RT-PCR assessment; 76 patients had unknown karyotype (excluded from this sub-analysis). In the Ph-/BCR-ABL1 + subgroup, no additional chromosomal aberrations were reported. In the Ph+ subgroup, 952 patients had safety and molecular assessments. In the Ph-/BCR-ABL1 + subgroup, 30 patients had safety assessments and 28 were followed up for molecular assessments. At 18 months, the molecular response (MR) 4 rate [MR(4); BCR-ABL1 </=0.01% on International Scale (IS)] was similar in the Ph-/BCR-ABL1+ (39.3%) and Ph+ subgroups (38.1%). By 24 months, the cumulative rates of major molecular response (BCR-ABL1(IS) </=0.1%;), MR(4), and MR(4.5) (BCR-ABL1(IS) </=0.0032%) were 85.7, 60.7, and 50.0%, respectively, in the Ph-/BCR-ABL1 + subgroup, and 80.3, 54.7, and 38.3%, respectively, in the Ph+ subgroup. In both Ph-/BCR-ABL1 + and Ph+ subgroups, rash (20 and 22%), pruritus (16.7 and 16.7%), nasopharyngitis (13.3 and 10.4%), fatigue (10 and 14.2%), headache (10 and 15.8%), and nausea (6.7 vs 11.4%) were frequent non-hematologic adverse events, whereas hypophosphatemia (23.3 and 6.8%), anemia (10 and 6.5%), and thrombocytopenia (3.3 and 10.2%) were the common hematologic/biochemical laboratory events.

It has been suggested that miRNAs may play an important role in progression of MDS. We analyzed bone marrow samples collected from MDS patients according to different risk stratification indicated by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). We demonstrated that miR-196b-5p was up-regulated in intermediate II and higher groups, and in secondary AML (s-AML) patients in particular (P < 0.01) compared with healthy controls, suggesting that the higher expression levels are associated with increased risk of the development of MDS. We observed changes in proliferation and apoptosis in MDS-L cells following transfection with miR-196-5p mimics or inhibitors. After up-regulating the expression of miR-196b-5p, proliferation of MDS-L cells was up-regulated, whereas apoptosis was down-regulated (P < 0.05). In contrast, down-regulation of miR-196b-5p expression decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (P < 0.05).

Tremendous improvements in AML prognostication arose from a comprehensive analysis of leukemia cell genomes. Among normal karyotype AML cases, mutations in the FLT3 gene are the ones most commonly detected as having a deleterious prognostic impact. FLT3 is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, and alterations of the FLT3 gene such as internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) deregulate FLT3 downstream signaling pathways in favor of increased cell proliferation and survival. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) emerged as a new therapeutic option in FLT3-ITD AML, and clinical trials are ongoing with a variety of TKI either alone, combined with chemotherapy, or even as maintenance after allogenic stem cell transplantation.

In the present study, we found that RNF6 was overexpressed in more than 70% of breast cancer tissues and it was associated with overall survival. RNF6 increased breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and reduced cell sensitivity to doxorubicin. Further studies showed that RNF6 was closely associated with increased expression of estrogen receptor, a critical factor in the development of breast cancers. RNF6 was found to induce ERalpha expression and increased its stability. In doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells, RNF6 was found to be elevated in association with increased ERalpha and anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, but not pro-apoptotic Bim-1. In consistence with this finding, overexpression of ERalpha led to increased Bcl-xL but had no effects on Bim-1. Therefore, this study demonstrated that there exists an RNF6/ERalpha/Bcl-xL axle in breast cancer which promotes cancer cell proliferation and survival.

Cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases account for approximately 75% of the mortality seen in persons with Down syndrome. This review summarises the cardiovascular, respiratory and immune challenges faced by individuals with Down syndrome, and the genetic underpinnings of their pathobiology.

However, Ezh2 can also modify non-histone substrates, although it is unclear whether this mechanism has a role during development. Here, we present evidence for a chromatin-independent role of Ezh2 during T-cell development and immune homeostasis. T-cell-specific depletion of Ezh2 induces a pronounced expansion of natural killer T (NKT) cells, although Ezh2-deficient T cells maintain normal levels of H3K27me3. In contrast, removal of Suz12 or Eed destabilizes canonical PRC2 function and ablates NKT cell development completely. We further show that Ezh2 directly methylates the NKT cell lineage defining transcription factor PLZF, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Sustained PLZF expression in Ezh2-deficient mice is associated with the expansion of a subset of NKT cells that cause immune perturbation. Taken together, we have identified a chromatin-independent function of Ezh2 that impacts on the development of the immune system.",['(c) 2017 The Authors.'],"['Vasanthakumar, Ajithkumar', 'Xu,

We enrolled 797 patients who had been diagnosed with myelodysplasia at initial presentation and received transplantation via the Japan Marrow Donor Program. Targeted-capture sequencing was performed to identify mutations in 69 genes, together with copy-number alterations, whose effects on transplantation outcomes were investigated. We identified 1776 mutations and 927 abnormal copy segments among 617 patients (77.4%). In multivariate modeling using Cox proportional-hazards regression, genetic factors explained 30% of the total hazards for overall survival; clinical characteristics accounted for 70% of risk. TP53 and RAS-pathway mutations, together with complex karyotype (CK) as detected by conventional cytogenetics and/or sequencing-based analysis, negatively affected posttransplant survival independently of clinical factors. Regardless of disease subtype, TP53-mutated patients with CK were characterized by unique genetic features and associated with an extremely poor survival with frequent early relapse, whereas outcomes were substantially better in TP53-mutated patients without CK. By contrast, the effects of RAS-pathway mutations depended on disease subtype and were confined to myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs). Our results suggest that TP53 and RAS-pathway mutations predicted a dismal prognosis, when associated with CK and MDS/MPNs, respectively. However, for patients with mutated TP53 or CK alone, long-term survival could be obtained with transplantation. Clinical sequencing provides vital information for accurate prognostication in transplantation.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Yoshizato, Tetsuichi', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Shiozawa, Yusuke', 'Iijima-Yamashita, Yuka', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Suzuki, Hiromichi', 'Nagata, Yasunobu', 'Sato, Yusuke', 'Kakiuchi, Nobuyuki', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Chiba, Kenichi', 'Tanaka, Hiroko', 'Ueno, Hiroo', 'Nakagawa, Masahiro M', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Aoki, Kosuke', 'Itonaga, Hidehiro', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Ogawa, Seishi']","['Yoshizato T', 'Nannya Y', 'Atsuta Y', 'Shiozawa Y', 'Iijima-Yamashita Y', 'Yoshida K', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Suzuki H', 'Nagata Y', 'Sato Y', 'Kakiuchi N', 'Matsuo K', 'Onizuka M', 'Kataoka K', 'Chiba K', 'Tanaka H', 'Ueno H', 'Nakagawa MM', 'Przychodzen B', 'Haferlach C', 'Kern W', 'Aoki K', 'Itonaga H', 'Kanda Y', 'Sekeres MA', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Haferlach T', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Horibe K', 'Sanada M', 'Miyano S', 'Makishima H', 'Ogawa S']",,"['Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Diagnosis, Clinical Research Center, Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular and Clinical Epidemiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Sequence Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research and Leukemia Program, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusha Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan;

IL-32 gene consists of eight small exons, and IL-32 mRNA has nine alternative spliced isoforms, and was thought to be secreted because it contains an internal signal sequence and lacks a transmembrane region. IL-32 is initially expressed selectively in activated T cells by mitogen and activated NK cells and their expression is strongly augmented by microbes, mitogens, and other cytokines. The IL-32 is induced mainly by pathogens and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but IL-32 is more prominent in immune cells than in non-immune tissues. The IL-32 transcript is expressed in various human tissues and organs such as the spleen, thymus, leukocyte, lung, small intestine, colon, prostate, heart, placenta, liver, muscle, kidney, pancreas, and brain. Cytokines are critical components of cell signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, metabolism, hormone signaling, immune regulation and a variety of other physiological functions. Earlier studies have demonstrated that IL-32 regulates cell growth, metabolism and immune regulation and is therefore involved in the pathologic regulator or protectant of inflammatory diseases. Previous studies defined that IL-32 is upregulated in the patients with several inflammatory diseases, and is induced by inflammatory responses. However, several reports suggested that IL-32 is downregulated in several inflammatory diseases including asthma, HIV infection disease, neuronal diseases, metabolic disorders, experimental colitis and metabolic disorders. IL-32 is also involved in various cancer malignancies including renal cancer, esophageal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, breast cancer, colon cancer and thyroid carcinoma. Other studies suggested that IL-32 decreases tumor development including cervical cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, review articles that discuss the roles and its mechanism of IL-32 isoforms focusing on the therapeutic approaches have not yet been reported. In this review article, we will discuss recent findings regarding IL-32 in the development of diseases and further discuss therapeutic approaches targeting IL-32. Moreover, we will suggest that IL-32 could be the target of several diseases and the therapeutic agents for targeting IL-32 may have potential beneficial effects for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancers. Future research should open new avenues for the design of novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-32.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive study on 30 cases of primary breast sarcoma. We carried out a univariate and multivariate analysis correlating clinical, pathological and therapeutic parameters with disease-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: The mean age was 46.8 years. The mean tumour size was 10cm. The 30 cases were 18 phyllodes sarcomas, eight angiosarcomas, three liposarcomas and a case of granulocytic sarcoma. Sixteen patients had adjuvant radiotherapy and only seven patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 64 months. Overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 49.1% and 33.7%. Disease-free survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 22.8% and 15.2% respectively. The analytical study of the following parameters: tumour size and presence or absence of node or distant metastases, showed no correlation with overall survival nor with disease-free survival. Furthermore, adjuvant radiotherapy did not improve overall survival (P=0.298; hazard ratio [HR]=1 [0.982-1.04]) nor disease-free survival (P=0.61; HR=0.942 [0.862-1.029]). By univariate analyses, we identified a correlation between overall survival, surgical margins (>1cm) (P=0005; HR=3.4 [1.217-9.919]) and tumour necrosis (P=0.028; HR=0.099 [0.014-0.682]). We did not find any independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of primary breast sarcoma seems to depend essentially on optimal surgical excision (margin over 1cm). The only potential histological parameter correlated with the prognosis is the presence of tumour necrosis. The histological subtype should not be considered as a prognostic marker for overall or disease-free survival in patients with primary breast sarcoma.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).', 'Published by Elsevier SAS.

However, tumor antigen escape has emerged as a main challenge for the long-term disease control of this promising immunotherapy in B cell malignancies.

Results CPT significantly potentiated the antiproliferative effect of DOXO in gastric cancer cell lines. CPT combined with DOXO induced apoptosis and cleavage of caspases-3,-7,-9 as well as PARP. CPT or a STAT3 siRNA significantly suppressed constitutive and IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 Tyr705, decreasing the levels of proteins encoded by STAT3-target genes (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, survivin, and XIAP).

The objective of the current study was to evaluate all CpG sites of the genome and identify prognostic methylation markers for overall survival in patients with AML with normal karyotype (AML-NK). METHODS: AML-NK samples from 7 SWOG trials were analyzed using a novel genome-wide approach called ""CHARMcox"" (comprehensive high-throughput array-based relative methylation analysis combined with the Cox proportional hazards model) controlling for known clinical covariates. CHARMcox was applied to a phase 1 discovery cohort (72 patients) to identify survival-associated methylation regions (SAMRs). Subsequently, using bisulfite pyrosequencing, SAMRs were studied in phase 2 model-building (65 patients) and phase 3 validation (65 patients) cohorts. An independent external cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML study (LAML) was used for further validation (93 patients). RESULTS: Two SAMRs, located at the CpG island shores of leucine zipper tumor suppressor 2 (LZTS2) and nuclear receptor subfamily 6 group a member 1 (NR6A1), respectively, were identified. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that hypomethylation of either LZTS2 or NR6A1 was associated with worse overall survival in the SWOG cohort (P<.001). The prognosis was validated in patients with AML-NK from the TCGA-LAML cohort. Methylation values below the median at both markers predicted worse overall survival (SWOG: hazard ratio, 1.89 [P<.001]; and TCGA-LAML: hazard ratio, 2.08 [P=.006]). The C-statistic was 0.71 for both cohorts, and the impact was independent of the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) status. CONCLUSIONS: The 2 methylation markers, measurable by clinically applicable assays such as bisulfite pyrosequencing, are promising for risk stratification among patients with AML-NK.

The incidence of treatment-related morbidity and late mortality with aging is unknown. METHODS: This study reports survival probabilities, estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the cumulative incidence of cause-specific mortality and chronic conditions among ESSs in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who were treated between 1970 and 1986. Piecewise exponential models were used to estimate relative rates (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for these outcomes. Chronic conditions were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). RESULTS: Among 404 5-year ESSs (median age at last follow-up, 34.8 years; range, 9.1-54.8 years), the 35-year survival rate was 70% (95% CI, 66%-74%). Late recurrence (cumulative incidence at 35 years, 15.1%) was the most common cause of death, and it was followed by treatment-related causes (11.2%). There were 53 patients with subsequent neoplasms (SNs; cumulative incidence at 35 years, 24.0%), and 38 were malignant (14.3% at 35 years). The standardized incidence ratios were 377.1 (95% CI, 172.1-715.9) for osteosarcoma, 28.9 (95% CI, 3.2-104.2) for acute myeloid leukemia, 14.9 (95% CI, 7.9-25.5) for breast cancer, and 13.1 (95% CI, 4.8-28.5) for thyroid cancer. Rates of chronic conditions were highest for musculoskeletal (RR, 18.1; 95% CI, 12.8-25.7) and cardiac complications (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3). Thirty-five years after the diagnosis, the cumulative incidences of any chronic conditions and 2 or more chronic conditions were 84.6% (95% CI, 80.4%-88.8%) and 73.8% (95% CI, 67.8%-79.9%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With extended follow-up, ESSs' risk for late mortality and SNs does not plateau. Treatment-related chronic conditions develop years after therapy, and this supports the need for lifelong follow-up. Cancer 2017;123:2551-60.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional pilot study. . SETTING: Bone marrow unit at the University of Louisville Hospital in Kentucky and caregiver support organizations in Louisville.. SAMPLE: 49 current cancer caregivers who were primarily spouses or partners of individuals with lymphoma or leukemia and provided care for a median of 30 hours each week for 12 months.. METHODS: Caregivers completed questionnaires assessing caregiver burden, RNT, and depressive symptoms.. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Caregiver burden, RNT, and depressive symptoms.. FINDINGS: Results showed that RNT mediated the relationship between burden (as a result of impact on schedule or finances) and depressive symptoms. Although burden from a lack of family support and impact on health was positively related to depressive symptoms, these relationships were not mediated by RNT. In addition, caregiver esteem was not associated with RNT or depressive symptoms. . CONCLUSIONS: RNT plays an important role in maintaining and potentially exacerbating caregiver distress. Assessment and intervention regarding RNT in cancer caregivers may reduce depressive symptoms prompted by burden from an impact on schedule or finances..

The laboratory-specific conversion factors derived from the IS can convert local different values to the IS without changing procedures. The standardization of BCR-ABL1 also includes the whole analytical process, so it is noteworthy to pay attention to the quality control before BCR-ABL1 quantitative analysis. More importantly, the World Health Organization has validated a first genetic reference panel which is limited to the manufacturers to produce and calibrate secondary reference reagents. Also, a certified reference plasmid, ERM-AD623, was internationally accepted. This article mainly focuses on BCR-ABL1 measurement and these standardization efforts in progress.",,"['Yu, Shuping', 'Cui, Ming', 'He, Xiao', 'Jing, Rongrong', 'Wang, Huimin']","['Yu S', 'Cui M', 'He X', 'Jing R', 'Wang H']",,"['.', '.', '.', '.', '.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cytogenetic Analysis/standards', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/genetics/standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis', 'Plasmids/genetics/metabolism', 'Quality Control', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/standards', 'Reference Standards']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1 measurement', 'BCR-ABL1 monitoring', 'standardization']",,2017/02/22 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2017/02/22 06:00'],"['2016/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/cclm-2016-0927 [doi]', '/j/cclm.ahead-of-print/cclm-2016-0927/cclm-2016-0927.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2017 Aug 28;55(10):1465-1473. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2016-0927.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both diseases are chronic in nature and can lead to the disruption of normal immunological or physiological processes. Cattle are the major reservoir of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), a cause of foodborne illness in humans. We tested the hypothesis that cattle infected with BLV or MAP are more likely to shed STEC. We conducted a cross-sectional study during the summers of 2011 and 2012 in 11 Michigan cattle herds. A fecal sample from each animal was collected for STEC culture, and multiplex PCR for stx1, stx2, and eaeA was used to screen suspect colonies for STEC confirmation. Antibody detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for BLV and MAP were used to screen serum from each animal. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the percentage of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils in a subsample (n =497) of blood samples. Of the animals sampled, 34.9% were BLV positive, 2.7% were MAP positive, and 16% were shedding STEC. Cattle in the dairy herds had a higher frequency of BLV and MAP than did those in beef herds, but more cattle in beef herds were shedding STEC. Neither BLV nor MAP was associated with STEC shedding (P values of 0.6838 and 0.3341, respectively). We also observed no association between STEC status and the percentage of neutrophils (P value of 0.3565), lymphocytes (P value of 0.8422), or the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (P value of 0.1800). Although controlling both BLV and MAP is important for overall herd health and productivity, we found no evidence that controlling BLV and MAP has an impact on STEC shedding in cattle.",,"['Venegas-Vargas, Cristina', 'Manning, Shannon D', 'Coussens, Paul M', 'Roussey, Jonathan A', 'Bartlett, Paul', 'Grooms, Daniel']","['Venegas-Vargas C', 'Manning SD', 'Coussens PM', 'Roussey JA', 'Bartlett P', 'Grooms D']",,"['Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA.', 'Department of Animal Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA.', 'Department of Animal Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA.', 'Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA.', 'Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Food Prot,Journal of food protection,7703944,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/microbiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Michigan', '*Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis', 'Shiga-Toxigenic Escherichia coli']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bovine leukemia virus', '*Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis', '*Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli']",,2017/02/22 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2017/02/22 06:00'],"['2017/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-090 [doi]'],ppublish,J Food Prot. 2017 Jan;80(1):86-89. doi: 10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and Methods Patients age 18 to 59 years old with intermediate- or unfavorable-risk AML in first remission and no identified donor for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) were eligible. Two hundred twenty-one patients were randomly assigned to receive three CLARA or three HDAC consolidation cycles. The primary end point was relapse-free survival (RFS). To handle the confounding effect of SCT that could occur in patients with late donor identification, hazard ratios (HRs) of events were adjusted on the time-dependent treatment x SCT interaction term. Results At 2 years, RFS was 58.5% (95% CI, 49% to 67%) in the CLARA arm and 46.5% (95% CI, 37% to 55%) in the HDAC arm. Overall, 110 patients (55 in each arm) received SCT in first remission. On the basis of a multivariable Cox-adjusted treatment x SCT interaction, the HR of CLARA over HDAC before or in absence of SCT was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.98; P = .041). In a sensitivity analysis, when patients who received SCT in first remission were censored at SCT time, 2-year RFS was 53.3% (95% CI, 39% to 66%) in the CLARA arm and 31.0% (95% CI, 19% to 43%) in the HDAC arm (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.98; P = .043). Gain in RFS could be related to the lower cumulative incidence of relapse observed in the CLARA arm versus the HDAC arm (33.9% v 46.4% at 2 years, respectively; cause-specific HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.94; P = .025). CLARA cycles were associated with higher hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity than HDAC cycles. Conclusion These results suggest that CLARA might be considered as a new chemotherapy option in younger patients with AML in first remission.",,"['Thomas, Xavier', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Caillot, Denis', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Lemasle, Emilie', 'Marolleau, Jean-Pierre', 'Berthon, Celine', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Reman, Oumedaly', 'Simon, Marc', 'Recher, Christian', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Castaigne, Sylvie', 'Celli-Lebras, Karine', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Terre, Christine', 'Dombret, Herve']","['Thomas X', 'de Botton S', 'Chevret S', 'Caillot D', 'Raffoux E', 'Lemasle E', 'Marolleau JP', 'Berthon C', 'Pigneux A', 'Vey N', 'Reman O', 'Simon M', 'Recher C', 'Cahn JY', 'Hermine O', 'Castaigne S', 'Celli-Lebras K', 'Ifrah N', 'Preudhomme C', 'Terre C', 'Dombret H']",,"['Xavier Thomas, Lyon-Sud University Hospital, Pierre Benite;

Since PTEN lies at the intersection of these two pathways, we investigated whether PTEN status determines the functional response to combined pathway inhibition. PTEN (gene, mRNA, and protein) status was extensively characterized in a panel of cancer cell lines and combined MEK/mTOR inhibition displayed highly synergistic pharmacologic interactions almost exclusively in PTEN-loss models. Genetic manipulation of PTEN status confirmed a mechanistic role for PTEN in determining the functional outcome of combined pathway blockade. Proteomic analysis showed greater phosphoproteomic profile modification(s) in response to combined MEK/mTOR inhibition in PTEN-loss contexts and identified JAK1/STAT3 activation as a potential mediator of synergistic interactions.

When GALV was discovered and found to cause neoplastic disease in gibbons, it stimulated a great deal of research including investigations into the origins of this virus. A number of publications have suggested that the GALV progenitor was a retrovirus present in one of several species of South East Asian rodents that had close contact with captive gibbons. However, there are no published retroviral sequences from any South East Asian species to support this view. Here we present an alternative hypothesis that the origin of GALV is a virus closely related to Melomys burtoni retrovirus, and that this virus infected human patients in Papua New Guinea from whom biological material was obtained or in some way contaminated these samples.

The IgG1 mAb cetuximab has been used for treatment of RAS(wt) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients, showing limited efficacy. In the present study, we address the potential of adoptive NK cell therapy to overcome these limitations investigating two allogeneic NK cell products, i.e., allogeneic activated peripheral blood NK cells (A-PBNK) and umbilical cord blood stem cell-derived NK cells (UCB-NK). While cetuximab monotherapy was not effective against EGFR(-) RAS(wt), EGFR(+) RAS(mut), and EGFR(+) BRAF(mut) cells, A-PBNK were able to initiate lysis of EGFR(+) colon cancer cells irrespective of RAS or BRAF status. Cytotoxic effects of A-PBNK (but not UCB-NK) were further potentiated significantly by coating EGFR(+) colon cancer cells with cetuximab. Of note, a significantly higher cytotoxicity was induced by UCB-NK in EGFR(-)RAS(wt) (42 +/- 8 versus 67 +/- 7%), EGFR(+) RAS(mut) (20 +/- 2 versus 37 +/- 6%), and EGFR(+) BRAF(mut) (23 +/- 3 versus 43 +/- 7%) colon cancer cells compared to A-PBNK and equaled the cytotoxic efficacy of the combination of A-PBNK and cetuximab.

Here, we studied the function of PAX5-ETV6 and PAX5-FOXP1 in mice expressing these proteins from the Pax5 locus. Both proteins arrested B-lymphopoiesis at the pro-B to pre-B-cell transition and, contrary to their proposed dominant-negative role, did not interfere with the expression of most regulated Pax5 target genes. Pax5-Etv6, but not Pax5-Foxp1, cooperated with loss of the Cdkna2a/b tumor suppressors in promoting B-ALL development. Regulated Pax5-Etv6 target genes identified in these B-ALLs encode proteins implicated in pre-B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and migration/adhesion, which could contribute to the proliferation, survival, and tissue infiltration of leukemic B cells.

Sixty-five patients (16%) were in cytogenetic/molecular relapse and 349 (84%) were in hematological relapse after BMT. In total, 266 out of 414 (64%) patients received chemotherapy and/or molecular-targeted agents in combination with UDLI. The median time from BMT to UDLI was 244 days. The median number of infused CD3(+) cells was 3.51 x 10(7)/kg. Response and survival rates were evaluated at 100 days after UDLI. Complete response was obtained in 37 (57%) of 65 patients with cytogenetic/molecular relapse and in 69 (20%) of 349 patients with hematological relapse (P < .001). Two hundred forty-seven patients (60%) were alive, whereas 110 (26%) had died because of disease progression, 26 (6%) because of infections, 12 (3%) because of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and 13 (3%) because of organ failure. Multivariate analysis identified molecular/cytogenetic relapse, GVHD after UDLI, and CML but not combination with chemotherapy as significant prognostic factors. These results indicate that UDLI may have efficacy in relapsed patients with CML, low tumor burden, or occurrence of GVHD after UDLI.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although adoptive transfer of expanded Tregs limits graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), ex vivo generation of large numbers of functional Tregs remains difficult. Here, we demonstrate that in vivo targeting of the TNF superfamily receptor TNFRSF25 using the TL1A-Ig fusion protein, along with IL-2, resulted in transient but massive Treg expansion in donor mice, which peaked within days and was nontoxic. Tregs increased in multiple compartments, including blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and colon (GVHD target tissue). Tregs did not expand in bone marrow, a critical site for graft-versus-malignancy responses. Adoptive transfer of in vivo-expanded Tregs in the setting of MHC-mismatched or MHC-matched allogeneic HSCT significantly ameliorated GVHD. Critically, transplantation of Treg-expanded donor cells facilitated transplant tolerance without GVHD, with complete sparing of graft-versus-malignancy.

Relapse therefore represents a central problem in the treatment of AML. Despite this, and in contrast to the extensive knowledge about the molecular events underlying the process of leukemogenesis, information about the mechanisms leading to therapy resistance and relapse is still limited. PURPOSE AND CONTENT OF REVIEW: Recently, a number of studies have aimed to fill this gap and provided valuable information about the clonal composition and evolution of leukemic cell populations during the course of disease, and about genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression changes associated with relapse. In this review, these studies are summarized and discussed, and the data reported in them are compiled in order to provide a resource for the identification of molecular aberrations recurrently acquired at, and thus potentially contributing to, disease recurrence and the associated therapy resistance. This survey indeed uncovered genetic aberrations with known associations with therapy resistance that were newly gained at relapse in a subset of patients. Furthermore, the expression of a number of protein coding and microRNA genes was reported to change between diagnosis and relapse in a statistically significant manner. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings foster the expectation that future studies on larger and more homogeneous patient cohorts will uncover pathways that are robustly associated with relapse, thus representing potential targets for rationally designed therapies that may improve the treatment of patients with relapsed AML, or even facilitate the prevention of relapse in the first place.",,"['Hackl, Hubert', 'Astanina, Ksenia', 'Wieser, Rotraud']","['Hackl H', 'Astanina K', 'Wieser R']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4384-6658'],"['Division of Bioinformatics, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innrain 80, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, 1090, Wien, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, 1090, Wien, Austria. rotraud.wieser@meduniwien.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,IM,"['Clone Cells', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Recurrence']",PMC5322789,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Clonal evolution', '*Copy number variation', '*Cytogenetics', '*DNA methylation', '*Gene expression profiling', '*Relapse', '*Single nucleotide variants', '*Therapy resistance']",,2017/02/22 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2017/02/22 06:00'],"['2016/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-017-0416-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-017-0416-0 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2017 Feb 20;10(1):51. doi: 10.1186/s13045-017-0416-0.,20170220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Retrospective analysis of 258 patients with AML in CR (186 cases in CR(1), 72 cases in CR(2)) who underwent allogeneic HSCT in our hospital between April 2012 and March 2015 according to NCCN (2015) risk stratification. Of them, 63 cases were classified as low risk, 112 cases intermediate risk and 83 cases high risk. Results: 1 in circleWith the median follow up of 18 (5-41) months, two-year disease free surviva (DFS) in 258 patients was 78.0% (95% CI 60.4%-96.6%) . Two-year DFS in AML after transplantation was 78.6% (95% CI 61.0%-96.2%) in low risk, 76.0% (95% CI 84.0%-93.6%) in intermediate risk and 80.3% (95% CI 62.7%-97.9%) (P=0.886) in high risk groups respectively. 2 in circleUnivariate analysis showed that DFS has no significant difference in patient age, the median disease course before HSCT, the WBC number at the beginning of the disease, blood routine and chromosomes examination before transplantation, extramedullary disease before transplantation, disease status before transplantation, conditioning regimen, donor type, donor and recipient sex, recipient blood type, transfused MNC number, transfused CD34(+) cell number and transfused CD3(+) cell number. DFS was significant lower in primary AML than that in secondary AML (P=0.006) and also lower in MRD positive than that in MRD negative (P=0.003) . The accumulative relapse was significant higher in CR(2) compared to that in CR(1) (P=0.046) . Accumulative non-relapse mortality (NRM) was significanlyt higher in secondary AML compared to that in primary AML (P=0.004) and also higher in MRD positive compared to that in MRD negative (P=0.010) . 3 in circleMultivariate analysis showed that MRD positive was the only significant factor in DFS and NRM. Conclusion: Allo-HSCT treatment of AML CR patients could achieve a high efficacy, which is similar between CR(1) and CR(2) patients. There is no significant correlation between NCCN (2015) risk stratification and the prognosis of AML patients with allo-HSCT treatment.

The expressions of EVI1 and BRE genes were detected by real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) . The correlation and prognostic significance were statistically tested. Results: 11q23/MLL rearrangements were confirmed by karyotyping and FISH, respectively in 47 patients. According to immunophenotypic analyses of 37 patients, 5 patients showed positive for CD19, CD79a or CD10, 1 for CD7; the others for CD33, CD13, CD14 and CD15, and 16 of them for CD34. Of the 47 patients, 18 patients showed EVI1 overexpression and most of them presented with t (6;11) and M(4)/M(5). The EVI1 expression was high in t (6;11) or t (9;11) subgroup comparable with levels observed in normal subgroup (P=0.038, 0.022, respectively) . 15 patients showed high BRE expression, and most of them presented with t (9;11) and M(4)/M(5). High BRE expression was found in t (4;11) , t (6;11) , t (9;11) and t (11;19) subgroups, respectively by comparing with normal subgroup. The BRE expression was higher in t (4;11) (P=0.004) or t (9;11) (P=0.012) subgroup than in t (6;11) subgroup. Patients with EVI1 overexpression had a short survival compared with those with low EVI1 expression (P=0.049) and it also did in t (9;11) subgroup (P=0.024) . Patients with t (9;11) and high BRE expression had a long survival compared with those with t (9;11) and low BRE expression (P=0.024) . Conclusion: The EVI1 overexpression was significantly frequent in acute leukemia patients with 11q23/MLL rearranged, especially within t (6;11) subgroup and M(4)/M(5), which was associated with an inferior outcome. High BRE expression was observed frequently in 11q23/MLL-rearranged acute leukemia especially within t (9;11) subgroup and M(5).",,"['Gong, Y L', 'Zhang, J R', 'Zhang, J', 'Bai, S X', 'Cen, J N', 'Shen, H J', 'Chou, H Y', 'Chen, S N', 'Pan, J L']","['Gong YL', 'Zhang JR', 'Zhang J', 'Bai SX', 'Cen JN', 'Shen HJ', 'Chou HY', 'Chen SN', 'Pan JL']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Homeostasis, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Prognosis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC7348406,['NOTNLM'],"['Gene rearrangement, MLL', 'Gene, BRE', 'Gene, EVI1', 'In situ hybridization, fluorescence', 'Leukemia, acute']",,2017/02/22 06:00,2018/05/23 06:00,['2017/02/22 06:00'],"['2017/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2017.01.005 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2017 Jan 14;38(1):22-27. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2017.01.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemokine receptor CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand, CXC motif ligand 12 (CXCL12), also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha, are key mediators of this interaction. CXCL12 is produced by the BM microenvironment, binds and activates its cognate receptor CXCR4 on leukemic cells, facilitates leukemia cell trafficking and homing in the BM microenvironment, and keeps leukemic cells in close contact with the stromal cells and extracellular matrix that constitutively generate growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic signals. Indeed, a high level of CXCR4 expression on AML blasts is known to be associated with poor prognosis. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have revealed the safety and potential clinical utility of targeting the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in AML with different classes of drugs, including small molecules, peptides, and monoclonal antibodies. In this review, we describe recent evidence of targeting these leukemia-stroma interactions, focusing on the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis.

The underlying epigenetic mechanism is obscure. We show here that megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) is an epigenetic mediator of TNF-alpha-induced proinflammatory transcription. Overexpression of a dominant negative form of MKL1 abrogates TNF-alpha-induced transactivation of proinflammatory genes. Proteomic analysis identifies the histone H3K4 trimethyltransferase ASH2 as a potential cofactor for MKL1. In response to TNF-alpha stimulation, ASH2 is recruited by MKL1 and interacts with MKL1 to catalyze H3K4 di- and trimethylation. ASH2 modulates proinflammatory transcription at least in part by altering the affinity of p65 for target promoters.

The heterogeneity of leukemia led us to look for new specific molecules for leukemia subtypes or for therapy-resistant cases. Among heterocyclic derivatives that attracted attention due to their wide range of biological activities, we focused our interest on the pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxaline heterocyclic framework that has been previously identified as an interesting scaffold for antiproliferative activities against various human cancer cell lines. In this work, new ethyl 4-[4-(4-substituted piperidin-1-yl)]benzylpyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalinecarboxylate derivatives (1 a-o) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated against five different leukemia cell lines, including Jurkat and U266 (lymphoid cell lines) and K562, U937, and HL60 (myeloid cell lines), as well as on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This new pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxaline series showed interesting cytotoxic potential against all tested leukemia cell lines. In particular, pyrroloquinoxalines 1 a and 1 m,n seem to be interesting due to their high activity against leukemia and their low activity against normal hematopoietic cells, leading to a high index of selectivity.","['(c) 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Median age at SCT was 11.5 years. Twenty-three patients had primary refractory and 21 relapsed refractory AML. Refractory disease was confirmed by cytogenetics/molecular genetics in 24 cases. Median follow-up of the whole cohort is 6.8 years (2.1-14.9 years). Thirty patients (68%) achieved a CR following SCT. Transplant-related mortality at 1 year was 18%. Acute GVHD incidence was 52% (grade III 19%), chronic 7%. Relapse was the major cause of treatment failure and occurred in 32% of patients at a median of 61 days post SCT. Five-year overall survival and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 43% (95% CI 31-61%). All patients with favorable cytogenetics (n=6) are alive in CR. Outcomes in patients with primary refractory disease were equivalent to those with relapsed refractory AML. Blast percentage 30% in the BM pre-SCT, myeloablative conditioning and acute GVHD proved to be favorable prognostic features. We could stratify patients according to age 10 years and >30% blasts in BM pre-SCT. Patients with none/one of these risk factors were highly salvageable (5 years LFS 53%) whereas those with both factors had a very poor prognosis (5 years LFS 10%).

METHOD: The analysis explains the major steps of the evolution of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and compares the results of the unique Hungarian allogeneic center. RESULTS: The significant shift in the transplantation indications from chronic myeloid leukemia to myelodysplastic syndromes and the rising age of the recipients are in line with world wide tendencies. The latter one is the consequence of the introduction and improvement of the concept of reduced intensity conditioning regimens, originally arising from the idea of Endre Kelemen. The most limiting factor, the donor availability seems to be resolved with the use of a new immunomodulating regimen, the application of posttransplantation cyclophosphamide, which allows the transplantation through HLA barriers with haploidentical family donors with comparable results to the HLA matched volunteer unrelated donors. The above mentioned tendencies result the wider use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation less dependent from recipient age, comorbidities and even donor availability. CONCLUSIONS: The publication highlights the need of expanding the stem cell transplantation budget and the involvement of new centers in Hungary in allogeneic of stem cell transplantation. Orv.

In this study, we investigate the effect of leukemia microvesicles on healthy umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem cells to find evidence of cell information transferring. Leukemia microvesicles were isolated from acute myeloid leukemia patients and were co-incubated with healthy hematopoietic stem cells. After 7 days, cell count, hematopoietic stem cell-specific cluster of differentiation (CD) markers, colony-forming unit assay, and some microRNA gene expressions were assessed. Data showed a higher number of hematopoietic stem cells after being treated with leukemia microvesicles compared with control (treated with no microvesicles) and normal (treated with normal microvesicles) groups. Also, increased levels of microRNA-21 and microRNA-29a genes were observed in this group, while colony-forming ability was still maintained and high ranges of CD34(+), CD34(+)CD38(-), CD90(+), and CD117(+) phenotypes were observed as stemness signs.

For experiments, 8505C and CAL62 human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells were used. Cell viability, the percentage of viable cells, and cytotoxic activity were measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, multiplexed cytotoxicity assay, and cytotoxicity assay, respectively. Reactive oxygen species production was measured. In experiments, doxorubicin and cucurbitacin B reduced cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cotreatment of doxorubicin and cucurbitacin B, compared with treatment of doxorubicin alone, decreased the percentage of viable cells and increased cytotoxic activity. All of the combination index values were lower than 1.0, suggesting the synergism between doxorubicin and cucurbitacin B in induction of cytotoxicity. In cells treated with both doxorubicin and cucurbitacin B, compared with doxorubicin alone, the protein levels of cleaved poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase and cyclooxygenase 2 and reactive oxygen species production were enhanced. In contrast, the protein levels of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 and survivin and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2/B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2-associated x protein ratio were diminished. The protein levels of Janus kinase 2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 were reduced, while phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 protein levels were elevated without change in total extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 protein levels. These results suggest that doxorubicin synergizes with cucurbitacin B in induction of cytotoxicity in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells. Moreover, synergistic cytotoxicity of doxorubicin with cucurbitacin B is mediated by B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 family proteins, survivin, and reactive oxygen species and modulated by Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells.",,"['Kim, Si Hyoung', 'Kang, Jun Goo', 'Kim, Chul Sik', 'Ihm, Sung-Hee', 'Choi, Moon Gi', 'Yoo, Hyung Joon', 'Lee, Seong Jin']","['Kim SH', 'Kang JG', 'Kim CS', 'Ihm SH', 'Choi MG', 'Yoo HJ', 'Lee SJ']",,"['1 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.', '1 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.', '1 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.', '1 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.', '1 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.', '1 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.', '1 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, Republic of Korea.', '2 Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Anyang-Si, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0115W5MABF (cucurbitacin B)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Thyroid Carcinoma, Anaplastic/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma', 'cucurbitacin B', 'doxorubicin', 'synergism']",,2017/02/22 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2017/02/21 06:00'],"['2017/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1010428317692252 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2017 Feb;39(2):1010428317692252. doi: 10.1177/1010428317692252.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This prospective study included 87 adult hematological patients with febrile neutropenia after an intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or after an autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Plasma ADMA and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured from the onset of fever (d0) and for 2 days (d1-d2) thereafter. The levels of ADMA were stable or had only minimal changes during the study period. There was no difference between the levels at any time-point in patients having complicated course compared to those without it. On the other hand, CRP levels were significantly higher on d1 (p = 0.016) in patients with bacteremia and/or septic shock than in those without.

Research on psychological and socioeconomic effects of leukemia treatment had been conducted in Western countries, but little is known within Africa including Kenya. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 62 out of 72 parents of children undergoing leukemia treatment at Kenyatta National Hospital. Data were collected between May and August 2015 using structured questionnaires while qualitative data were collected using focus group discussions. This manuscript is based on quantitative data which were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Psychological distress index was created by counting the number of psychological experiences reported by respondents. Kendall's tau-b was used to test the association between the psychological distress index and socioeconomic characteristics; P </= 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The respondents experienced anxiety, shock, and fatigue. Spending a higher proportion of family's income was associated with higher psychological distress index (P = 0.009). The economic challenge led to significantly heightened tension in the family (P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Financial challenge is a major cause of psychological distress thus needs for financial support through collaboration with government institutions, for example, NHIF, development agencies, and nongovernment organization who can contribute toward the treatment cost.

Leukemia stem cell (LSC) populations, although rare, are essential contributors of treatment failure and relapse. Recent researches have provided the compelling evidence that link the erratic spicing activity to the LSC phenotype in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this article, we describe the diverse roles of aberrant splicing in hematological malignancies, particularly in AML and their contributions to the characteristics of LSC. We review these promising strategies to exploit the addiction of aberrant spliceosomal machinery for anti-leukemic therapy with aim to eradicate LSC.

Two hundred and fifteen patients were recruited to assess the primary end point of complete remission (CR) rates according to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria. Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rate, minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity and safety. At final analysis, CR rates were 69.8 FCR vs 69.3% FCM-R (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): (0.53-1.79), P=0.932).

By co-culturing mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with the REH acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cell line, we have established an in vitro leukemic niche for the functional evaluation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC, CD34+ cells). We showed that the normal homeostatic control exerted by the MSC over the HSPC is considerably lost in this leukemic microenvironment: HSPC increased their proliferation rate and adhesion to MSC. The adhesion molecules CD54 and CD44 were consequently upregulated in HSPC from the leukemic niche. Consequently, with this adhesive phenotype, HSPC showed less Stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-directed migration. Interestingly, multipotency was severely affected with an important reduction in the absolute count and the percentage of primitive progenitor colonies. It was possible to simulate most of these HSPC alterations by incubation of MSC with a REH-conditioned medium, suggesting that REH soluble factors and their effect on MSC are important for the observed changes. Of note, these HSPC alterations were reproduced when primary leukemic cells from an ALL type B (ALL-B) patient were used to set up the leukemic niche. These results suggest that a general response is induced in the leukemic niche to the detriment of HSPC function and in favor of leukemic cell support. This in vitro leukemic niche could be a valuable tool for the understanding of the molecular events responsible for HSPC functional failure and a useful scenario for therapeutic evaluation.",,"['Vernot, Jean-Paul', 'Bonilla, Ximena', 'Rodriguez-Pardo, Viviana', 'Vanegas, Natalia-Del Pilar']","['Vernot JP', 'Bonilla X', 'Rodriguez-Pardo V', 'Vanegas NP']",,"['Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Biomedical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota D.C. 111321, Colombia. jpvernoth@unal.edu.co.', 'Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Biomedical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota D.C. 111321, Colombia. xmbonillaf@unal.edu.co.', 'Inmunobiology and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Science, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota D.C. 110231, Colombia. vivianar@javeriana.edu.co.', 'Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Biomedical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota D.C. 111321, Colombia. npvanegasa@unal.edu.co.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', '*Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Stem Cell Niche', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC5343770,['NOTNLM'],"['REH-conditioned medium', 'adhesion', 'cell malfunction', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'leukemic niche', 'mesenchymal stem cell', 'microenvironment', 'multipotency', 'progenitor cells', 'proliferation']",,2017/02/22 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2017/02/21 06:00'],"['2016/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18020199 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18020199 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Feb 14;18(2). pii: ijms18020199. doi: 10.3390/ijms18020199.,20170214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forced FOG1 expression in human K562 erythroleukemia cells induced the expression of erythroid genes (SLC4A1, globins) but repressed that of GATA-2 and PU.1. A quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated increased GATA-1 chromatin occupancy at both FOG1-activated as well as FOG1-repressed gene loci. However, while TAL1 chromatin occupancy was significantly increased at FOG1-activated gene loci, it was significantly decreased at FOG1-repressed gene loci. When FOG1 was overexpressed in TAL1-knocked down K562 cells, FOG1-mediated activation of HBA, HBG, and SLC4A1 was significantly compromised by TAL1 knockdown, suggesting that FOG1 may require TAL1 to activate GATA-1 target genes. Promoter analysis and quantitative ChIP analysis demonstrated that FOG1-mediated transcriptional repression of PU.1 would be mediated through a GATA-binding element located at its promoter, accompanied by significantly decreased H3 acetylation at lysine 4 and 9 (K4 and K9) as well as H3K4 trimethylation. Our results provide important mechanistic insight into the role of FOG1 in the regulation of GATA-1-regulated genes and suggest that FOG1 has an important role in inducing cells to differentiate toward the erythroid lineage rather than the myelo-lymphoid one by repressing the expression of PU.1.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Upon their differentiation, we found hematopoietic phenotypes of graded severity and/or stage specificity that together delineate a phenotypic roadmap of disease progression culminating in serially transplantable leukemia. We also show that disease stage transitions, both reversal and progression, can be modeled in this system using genetic correction or introduction of mutations via CRISPR/Cas9 and that this iPSC-based approach can be used to uncover disease-stage-specific responses to drugs.

We performed preclinical trials investigating primary murine acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) generated by retroviral insertional mutagenesis in Kras(G12D) ""knockin"" mice with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (PD901). One outlier AML responded and exhibited intrinsic drug resistance at relapse. Loss of wild-type (WT) Kras enhanced the fitness of the dominant clone and rendered it sensitive to MEK inhibition. Similarly, human colorectal cancer cell lines with increased KRAS mutant allele frequency were more sensitive to MAP kinase inhibition, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated replacement of WT KRAS with a mutant allele sensitized heterozygous mutant HCT116 cells to treatment. In a prospectively characterized cohort of patients with advanced cancer, 642 of 1,168 (55%) with KRAS mutations exhibited allelic imbalance.

The most common mutation, DNMT3A(R882H), has dominant negative activity that reduces DNA methylation activity by approximately 80% in vitro. To understand the contribution of DNMT3A-dependent methylation to leukemogenesis, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of primary leukemic and non-leukemic cells in patients with or without DNMT3A(R882) mutations. Non-leukemic hematopoietic cells with DNMT3A(R882H) displayed focal methylation loss, suggesting that hypomethylation antedates AML. Although virtually all AMLs with wild-type DNMT3A displayed CpG island hypermethylation, this change was not associated with gene silencing and was essentially absent in AMLs with DNMT3A(R882) mutations. Primary hematopoietic stem cells expanded with cytokines were hypermethylated in a DNMT3A-dependent manner, suggesting that hypermethylation may be a response to, rather than a cause of, cellular proliferation. Our findings suggest that hypomethylation is an initiating phenotype in AMLs with DNMT3A(R882), while DNMT3A-dependent CpG island hypermethylation is a consequence of AML progression.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Patients undergoing stem cell transplant procedure require blood transfusion on a daily basis. Currently, there is paucity of data from developing countries on transfusion practices. This audit was undertaken to determine the consumption of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfusion in the bone marrow transplant unit of the Aga Khan University Hospital. Subjects and Methods: A retrospective audit was conducted for packed red cell transfusion ordering practice over a period from June 2014 approximately June 2015. All consecutive patients, admitted for stem cell transplant procedure for various underlying diseases were included. Outcome measures used in this study were (i) cross match to transfusion (C: T) ratio and (ii) transfusion trigger. Results: During the study period, n=25 patients underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplant. There were n=19 males and n=6 females. One patient was less than 15 years of age while rests were adults. Median age+/-SD was 26.5+/-14.5 years (12 approximately 54 years). The underlying diagnosis included Aplastic anemia (n=8), Thalassemia major (n=3), Multiple Myeloma (n=4), Acute leukemia (n=5), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=4), PRCA (n=1). Grand total consumption of PRBCs during the study period was 204 while 258 products were crossmatch. The C:T ratio was 1.26. The transfusion trigger was Hb level of less than 8 gms/dl.

It has a mutation in Plp coding for proteolipid protein and DM20. Its behavior is normal at birth but from the age of ~2 weeks it shows severe convulsions associated with oligodendrocyte/myelination deficits and early death. A normally occurring increase in oxygen consumption by highly elevated K(+) concentrations is absent in Jimpy brain slices and cultured astrocytes, reflecting that Plp at early embryonic stages affects common precursors as also shown by the ability of conditioned medium from normal astrocytes to counteract histological abnormalities. This metabolic response is now known to reflect opening of L-channels for Ca(2+). The resulting deficiency in Ca(2+) entry has many consequences, including lack of K(+)-stimulated glycogenolysis and release of gliotransmitter ATP. Lack of purinergic stimulation compromises oligodendrocyte survival and myelination and affects connexins and K(+) channels. Mice lacking the oligodendrocytic connexins Cx32 and 47 show similar neurological dysfunction as Jimpy. This possibly reflects that K(+) released by intermodal axonal Kv channels is transported underneath a loosened myelin sheath instead of reaching the extracellular space via connexin-mediated transport to oligodendrocytes, followed by release and astrocytic Na(+),K(+)-ATPase-driven uptake with subsequent Kir4.1-facilitated release and neuronal uptake.",,"['Chaban, Y H Gerald', 'Chen, Ye', 'Hertz, Elna', 'Hertz, Leif']","['Chaban YHG', 'Chen Y', 'Hertz E', 'Hertz L']",,"['University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.', 'Henry M.

Nowadays, it is used as an alternative treatment in selected patients. Due to unlimited treatment time, monitoring and early prediction of response are important. Moreover, IFNalpha is used in the therapy of chronic hepatitis C, where a single nucleotide polymorphism of interleukin-28B gene (IL28B) correlates with therapy response. The role of this polymorphism in therapy response of IFNalpha-treated patients with HCL is unknown. Thirty-seven HCL patients treated between 1978 and 2014 were included in this study. Treatment strategy and response parameters (blood cell counts, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2R), and bone marrow examination) have been assessed. Relative decrease of sIL2R was correlated with outcome parameters. Response parameters of IFNalpha-treated patients were correlated with IL28B polymorphism. Twenty-one patients were analyzed for the correlation of sIL2R ratio and outcome. After 1 and 3 months of therapy (IFNalpha or cladribine (CDA)), the median sIL2R level showed a relative decrease of 79 and 91%. These decreases significantly correlate with time to complete remission (CR, p = 0.029 and p = 0.018). Correlation analyses of IL28B genotype with outcome parameters are not significant. Six patients (16%) were diagnosed with secondary malignancies, and one death was registered (median follow-up time 14 years). IFNalpha is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated long-term treatment in HCL. Relative decreases of sIL2R levels correlate with time to CR and are useful as early predictor for response. There is no significant correlation between IL28B polymorphism and treatment response to IFNalpha.

Myeloid immune cells, such as macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are often hijacked by tumors and become pivotal inhibitors of antitumor immunity. Immunosuppressive functions of tumor-associated myeloid cells result from the activity of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), a transcription factor with well-defined tumorigenic and tolerogenic roles in human cancers. To overcome challenges in the development of pharmacological STAT3 inhibitors, we recently developed oligonucleotide-based strategies for cell-selective, in vivo STAT3 targeting. Conjugation of a STAT3siRNA or decoy STAT3 inhibitors to synthetic Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists, CpG oligonucleotides, allowed for selective delivery into TLR9-positive cells. Cellular target for CpG-STAT3 inhibitors include non-malignant, tumor-associated myeloid cells, such as polymorphonuclear MDSCs, as well as cancer cells in acute myeloid leukemia, B cell lymphoma and in certain solid tumors. The chemically modified CpG-STAT3 inhibitors resist serum nucleases and thus can be administered intravenously. Their potency relies on the intracellular gain-of-function effect: release of the central immune checkpoint regulator (STAT3) to unleash proinflammatory signaling (CpG/TLR9) in the same antigen-presenting cell. At the cellular level, CpG-STAT3 inhibitors exert two-pronged effect by rescuing T cells from the immune checkpoint control while decreasing survival of cancer cells.

In our cohort of B-ALL patients, alterations of IKZF1, PAX5, and CDKN2A/B were detected by aCGH analysis in 43, 52, and 57% of samples, respectively. Deletions of IKZF1 were present in 9 samples, including 5 cases positive for both PAX5 and IKZF1 deletions, implying digenic impairment. Furthermore, all cases with IKZF1 deletions also had additional genomic alterations, including BCR-ABL1 gene fusions, PAX5 deletions, CDKN2A/B deletions, and FLT3 amplification. Deletions of CDKN2A/B represented the most frequent abnormalities in our group of patients. Our study demonstrates the high incidence of PAX5, IKZF1, and CDKN2A/B alterations in B-ALL detected by aCGH analysis. Due to the small size and variability in the deletion breakpoints, FISH studies showed false-negative results in 10, 40, and 28% of the samples tested for the IKZF1,PAX5, and CDKN2A/B gene deletions, respectively. The PAX5 and IKZF1 abnormalities are highly specific to B-ALL and can be used as diagnostic markers. Moreover, IKZF1 alterations frequently coexist with a BCR-ABL gene fusion. Our study revealed multiple additional B-ALL-specific genomic alterations and showed that aCGH is a more sensitive method than FISH, allowing whole genome profiling and identification of aberrations of diagnostic and prognostic significance in patients with B-ALL.","['(c) 2017 S.

The aim of this study was to characterize the suitability of HL-60 cells differentiated to neutrophil-like cells (nHL-60) as substitute for blood-derived human neutrophils to investigate the interaction of neutrophils with Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: For this purpose, antimicrobial activity, bacterial uptake, production of reactive oxygen species and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by nHL-60 cells were analyzed and compared to primary blood-derived neutrophils using Staphylococcus aureus as important human and animal pathogen. RESULTS: Overall, the antimicrobial activities of nHL-60 cells were distinctly lower compared to blood-derived neutrophils. Furthermore, production of reactive oxygen species as well as NET formation was clearly impaired in nHL-60 cells.

To understand this mechanism, 180day-old chicks, divided into two groups, C (control group) and L (low Se group), were fed with either a Se-sufficient (0.23mg/kg) or Se-deficient (0.033mg/kg) diets for 25days, respectively. Heart tissues and blood samples were collected. In L group, the activities of serum creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-myoglobin (CK-MB) increased and typical ultrastructural apoptotic features were observed. Se deficiency up-regulated the mRNA levels of Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (Caspase-3), Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 8 (Caspase-8), Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 9 (Caspase-9), B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 Associated X Protein (Bax), (P<0.05), whereas, the mRNA levels of Microtubuleassociated protein light chains 3-1 (LC3-1), Autophagy associated gene 5 (ATG-5), Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Dynein and Becline-1 were down-regulated (P<0.05). Noticeably, Microtubuleassociated protein light chains 3-2 (LC3-2) mRNA level increased (P<0.05) by 20%. Western blot results showed that Se deficiency decreased the expression of Becline-1 and LC3-1 protein, however, the expression of Bax, Caspase-3 and Cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 12 (Caspase-12) increased at protein levels. The present study revealed that Se deficiency induced apoptosis while inhibited autophagy in chicken cardiomyocytes through Bax/Bcl-2 inhibition and caspases-mediated cleavage of Becline-1. Moreover, correlation analysis illustrates that apoptosis and autophagy might function contradictorily. Altogether we conclude that Se deficient chicken cardiomyocytes experienced apoptosis rather than autophagy which is considered to be more pro-survival.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Whilst it has been eradicated in most of Western Europe and Scandinavia, it remains a problem in other regions, particularly Eastern Europe and South America. For this study, in 2013, 24 cattle from three farms in three regions of Moldova were screened by ELISA and nested PCR. Of these cattle, 14 which were PCR positive, and these were molecularly characterized based on the nucleotide sequence of the env gene and the deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded gp51 protein. Our results demonstrated a low level of genetic variability (0-2.9%) among BLV field strains from Moldova, in contrast to that observed for other retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (20-38%) Mason IL (Trudy vologod moloch Inst 146-164, 1970) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) (~40%) Willems L et al (AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 16(16):1787-1795, 2000), where the envelope gene exhibits high levels of variation Polat M et al (Retrovirology 13(1):4, 2016). Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis revealed that BLV genotype 7 (G7) is predominant in Moldova and that the BLV population in Moldovan cattle is a mixture of at least three new sub-genotypes: G7D, G7E and G4C. Neutrality tests revealed that negative selection was the major force operating upon the 51-kDa BLV envelope surface glycoprotein subunit gp51, although one positively selected site within conformational epitope G was detected in the N-terminal part of gp51. Furthermore, two functional domains, linear epitope B and the zinc-binding domain, were found to have an elevated ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous codon differences. Together, these data suggest that the evolutionary constraints on epitopes G and B and the zinc-binding domains of gp51 differ from those on the other domains, with a tendency towards formation of homogenous genetic groups, which is a common concept of global BLV diversification during virus transmission that may be associated with genetic drift.",,"['Pluta, Aneta', 'Rola-Luszczak, Marzena', 'Kubis, Piotr', 'Balov, Svetlana', 'Moskalik, Roman', 'Choudhury, Bhudipa', 'Kuzmak, Jacek']","['Pluta A', 'Rola-Luszczak M', 'Kubis P', 'Balov S', 'Moskalik R', 'Choudhury B', 'Kuzmak J']",,"['OIE Reference Laboratory for EBL, Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland. aneta.pluta@piwet.pulawy.pl.', 'OIE Reference Laboratory for EBL, Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland.', 'OIE Reference Laboratory for EBL, Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland.', 'Republican Center for Veterinary Diagnostic, Chisinau, Moldova.', 'Scientific Practical Institute for Biotechnologies and Zootechny and Veterinary Medicine, Chisinau, Moldova.', 'OIE Reference Laboratory for EBL, Department of Virology, Animal and Plant Health Agency, Weybridge, UK.', 'OIE Reference Laboratory for EBL, Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/epidemiology/*virology', '*Dairying', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*virology', 'Genes, env/genetics', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Moldova/epidemiology', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",PMC5425504,,,,2017/02/19 06:00,2017/07/21 06:00,['2017/02/19 06:00'],"['2016/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00705-017-3241-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00705-017-3241-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2017 Jun;162(6):1563-1576. doi: 10.1007/s00705-017-3241-4.

Data were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and published reports with clearcut denominators. When no data existed, risk populations were used to estimate frequencies of fungal infections, using previously described methodology. The population of Egypt in 2011 was approximately 82,500,000; 31% children, and 8% women >60 years of age. Amongst about 21.8 million women aged 15-50 years, recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (>/=4 episodes/year) is estimated to occur in 1.3 million (3,169/100,000 females). Using a low international average rate of 5/100,000, we estimate 4,127 cases of candidaemia, and 619 patients with intra-abdominal candidiasis. Amongst the survivors of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in Egypt in 2012, 319 new cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) are likely, a prevalence of 1,005 post-TB and a total prevalence estimate of 3,015 CPA patients in all. Asthma is common in Egypt, affecting 9.4% of adults, 5.35 million, and so ABPA and SAFS were estimated in around 162/100,000 and 214/100,000 respectively. Invasive aspergillosis is estimated to affect 495 patients following leukaemia therapy, there are an estimated 37 cases in renal and liver transplant recipients, and an estimated 132 patients develop IA in the context of lung cancer. Amongst 641,000 COPD admissions to hospital each year, 8,337 patients develop IA. The total HIV-infected population is small, with an estimated 6,500 patients, 2,500 not on antiretroviral therapy. Amongst HIV-infected patients, 38 (0.6%) cases of cryptococcal meningitis and 125 (1.9%) cases of Pneumocystis pneumonia are estimated each year. Fungal keratitis is common, with 28-55% (mean 40%) of corneal infections being fungal, an estimated total of 11,550 cases.

Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase are common mutations in AML, confer poor prognosis, and stimulate myeloproliferation. AML patient samples with FLT3-ITD express high levels of RUNX1, a transcription factor with known tumor-suppressor function. In this study, to understand this paradox, we investigated the impact of RUNX1 and FLT3-ITD coexpression. FLT3-ITD directly impacts on RUNX1 activity, whereby up-regulated and phosphorylated RUNX1 cooperates with FLT3-ITD to induce AML. Inactivating RUNX1 in tumors releases the differentiation block and down-regulates genes controlling ribosome biogenesis. We identified Hhex as a direct target of RUNX1 and FLT3-ITD stimulation and confirmed high HHEX expression in FLT3-ITD AMLs. HHEX could replace RUNX1 in cooperating with FLT3-ITD to induce AML. These results establish and elucidate the unanticipated oncogenic function of RUNX1 in AML. We predict that blocking RUNX1 activity will greatly enhance current therapeutic approaches using FLT3 inhibitors.",['(c) 2017 Behrens et al.'],"['Behrens, Kira', 'Maul, Katrin', 'Tekin, Nilgun', 'Kriebitzsch, Neele', 'Indenbirken, Daniela', 'Prassolov, Vladimir', 'Muller, Ursula', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Cammenga, Jorg', 'Stocking, Carol']","['Behrens K', 'Maul K', 'Tekin N', 'Kriebitzsch N', 'Indenbirken D', 'Prassolov V', 'Muller U', 'Serve H', 'Cammenga J', 'Stocking C']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0800-8472', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3322-8314', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7837-5422', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4440-2442']","['Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Virus Genomics, Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Viral Transformation, Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Engelhardt Institute for Molecular Biology, 119991 Moscow, Russia.', 'Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, 58185 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Retroviral Pathogenesis, Heinrich-Pette-Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, 20251 Hamburg, Germany c.stocking@uke.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (HHEX protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*physiology']",PMC5339673,,,,2017/02/19 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/02/19 06:00'],"['2016/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20160927 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20160927 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2017 Mar 6;214(3):737-752. doi: 10.1084/jem.20160927.

PRRs mediate the production of immune modulatory factors and direct the elimination of RNA viruses. Here, we show a unique PRR that mediates antiviral response. Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (TIPARP), a Cysteine3 Histidine (CCCH)-type zinc finger-containing protein, binds to Sindbis virus (SINV) RNA via its zinc finger domain and recruits an exosome to induce viral RNA degradation. TIPARP typically localizes in the nucleus, but it accumulates in the cytoplasm after SINV infection, allowing targeting of cytoplasmic SINV RNA. Redistribution of TIPARP is induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent oxidization of the nuclear pore that affects cytoplasmic-nuclear transport. BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) and BCL2 antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family members, mediate mitochondrial damage to generate ROS after SINV infection.

Serum from non-infected healthy controls (NI) and HTLV-1-infected patients, categorized as asymptomatic (AS), putatively progressing to HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis - HAM/TSP (pHAM) or with clinical diagnosis of HAM/TSP (HT) were assayed in two-parallel flow cytometry platforms, referred as: Fix and Fix&Perm protocols. Operating-characteristics analysis indicated that a single pair of attributes (""serum dilution/cut-off"") for Fix and Fix&Perm protocols presented excellent performance for the diagnosis of HTLV-1 infection. Conversely, Fix and Fix&Perm protocols displayed weak/moderate overall performances when applied with prognosis purposes of HTLV-1 infection. A panoramic snapshot provided by the reactivity boards revealed clearly the higher sensitivity of Fix&Perm protocol for detecting seropositivity for HT, suggesting that stepwise combinatory criteria would improve the global performance of using a single pair of attributes. Three data mining strategies were tested, including endpoint titer analysis, heatmap assemblage and decision tree analysis. Bi-dimensional heatmap analysis demonstrated that, while the clustering profile of NI vs HTLV-1(+) revealed segregation in opposite poles, AS vs HT presented discrete segregation but still displaying an intertwined distribution pattern. The combination of methods for segregating AS from HT displayed a moderate but superior global accuracy (85.7%; LOOCV=71.4%).

CD38 positive status (>/=30%) on flow cytometry predicted 2.7 times increased risk of high-risk CE (acquisition of deletion 17p or 11q) on multivariate analysis. Prior CLL therapy was not a significant predictor of CE. CE was associated with 4.1 times greater risk of death when analyzed as a time-dependent variable for OS after adjusting for age, lymphocyte count, and FISH timing. High-risk CE was associated with worse OS while acquisition of low/intermediate-risk abnormalities (trisomy 12, deletion 13q, and IGH translocation) had no difference in OS.

We developed a high sensitivity (HS) assay utilizing wild-type blocking polymerase chain reaction achieved via bridged and locked nucleic acids. We used this high sensitivity assay in combination with Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing (NGS) and tested cellular DNA and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from patients with CLL treated with the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib. We also tested ibrutinib-naive patients with CLL. HS testing achieved 100x greater sensitivity than Sanger. HS Sanger sequencing was capable of detecting < 1 mutant allele in background of 1000 wild-type alleles (1:1000). Similar sensitivity was achieved with HS NGS. No BTK or PLCgamma2 mutations were detected in any of the 44 ibrutinib-naive CLL patients. We demonstrate that without the HS testing 56% of positive samples would have been missed for BTK and 85% of PLCgamma2 would have been missed. With the use of HS, we were able to detect multiple mutant clones in the same sample in 37.5% of patients; most would have been missed without HS testing. We also demonstrate that with HS sequencing, plasma cfDNA is more reliable than cellular DNA in detecting mutations. Our studies indicate that wild-type blocking and HS sequencing is necessary for proper and early detection of BTK or PLCgamma2 mutations in monitoring patients treated with BTK inhibitors. Furthermore, cfDNA from plasma is very reliable sample-type for testing.",,"['Albitar, Adam', 'Ma, Wanlong', 'DeDios, Ivan', 'Estella, Jeffrey', 'Ahn, Inhye', 'Farooqui, Mohammed', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Albitar A', 'Ma W', 'DeDios I', 'Estella J', 'Ahn I', 'Farooqui M', 'Wiestner A', 'Albitar M']",,"['NeoGenomics Laboratories, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'NeoGenomics Laboratories, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'NeoGenomics Laboratories, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'NeoGenomics Laboratories, Irvine, CA, USA.', 'Medical Oncology Service, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'NeoGenomics Laboratories, Irvine, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'DNA/analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Phospholipase C gamma/*genetics', 'Piperidines', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC5392298,['NOTNLM'],"['BTK', 'CLL', 'PLCgamma2', 'ibrutinib', 'resistance']",,2017/02/18 06:00,2017/09/21 06:00,['2017/02/18 06:00'],"['2016/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['15316 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15316 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Mar 14;8(11):17936-17944. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15316.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this approach, pools of Boff-p210-edited cells and single edited cell-derived clones were obtained and functionally studied in vitro. The loss of p210 expression in Boff-p210 cells resulted in the loss of ability to grow in the absence of IL-3, as the Baf/3 parental line, showing significantly increased apoptosis levels. Notably, in a single edited cell-derived clone carrying a frame-shift mutation that prevents p210 oncoprotein expression, the effects were even more drastic, resulting in cell death. These edited cells were injected subcutaneously in immunosuppressed mice and tumor growth was followed for three weeks. BCR/ABL-edited cells developed smaller tumors than those originating from unedited Boff-p210 parental cells. Interestingly, the single edited cell-derived clone was unable to develop tumors, similar to what is observed with the parental Baf/3 cell line.CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing technology allows the ablation of the BCR/ABL fusion gene, causing an absence of oncoprotein expression, and blocking its tumorigenic effects in vitro and in the in vivo xenograft model of CML. The future application of this approach in in vivo models of CML will allow us to more accurately assess the value of CRISPR/Cas9 technology as a new therapeutic tool that overcomes resistance to the usual treatments for CML patients.",,"['Garcia-Tunon, Ignacio', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Maria', 'Ordonez, Jose Luis', 'Alonso-Perez, Veronica', 'Alamo-Quijada, Miguel', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Guerrero, Carmen', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus Maria', 'Sanchez-Martin, Manuel']","['Garcia-Tunon I', 'Hernandez-Sanchez M', 'Ordonez JL', 'Alonso-Perez V', 'Alamo-Quijada M', 'Benito R', 'Guerrero C', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Sanchez-Martin M']",,"['Unidad de Diagnostico Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Unidad de Diagnostico Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Unidad de Diagnostico Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Unidad de Diagnostico Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Unidad de Diagnostico Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Unidad de Diagnostico Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Instituto Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer (USAL/CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Unidad de Diagnostico Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Transgenesis, Nucleus, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Departamento de Medicina, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', '*CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Editing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Tumor Burden/genetics']",PMC5432235,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL', 'CRISPR/Cas9', 'genome edition', 'leukemia']",,2017/02/18 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/02/18 06:00'],"['2016/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['15215 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15215 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 18;8(16):26027-26040. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15215.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of a treatment of this potentially fatal allergy has led to intensive research on vaccine development. Here, we describe the design and initial characterization of a carrier-bound peptide derived from the most potent peanut allergen, Ara h 2, as a candidate vaccine. Based on the adjuvant capability of bacterial surface (S-) layers, a fusion protein of the S-layer protein SlpB from Lactobacillus buchneri CD034 and the Ara h 2-derived peptide AH3a42 was produced. This peptide comprised immunodominant B-cell epitopes as well as one T cell epitope. The fusion protein SlpB-AH3a42 was expressed in E. coli, purified, and tested for its IgE binding capacity as well as for its ability to activate sensitized rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells. The capacity of Ara h 2-specific IgG rabbit-antibodies raised against SlpB-AH3a42 or Ara h 2 to inhibit IgE-binding was determined by ELISA inhibition assays using sera of peanut allergic patients sensitized to Ara h 2. IgE specific to the SlpB-AH3a42 fusion protein was detected in 69% (25 of 36) of the sera. Despite the recognition by IgE, the SlpB-AH3a42 fusion protein was unable to induce beta-hexosaminidase release from sensitized RBL cells at concentrations up to 100ng per ml. The inhibition of IgE-binding to the natural allergen observed after pre-incubation of the 20 sera with rabbit anti-SlpB-AH3a42 IgG was more than 30% for four sera, more than 20% for eight sera, and below 10% for eight sera. In comparison, anti-Ara h 2 rabbit IgG antibodies inhibited binding to Ara h 2 by 48% +/-13.5%. Our data provide evidence for the feasibility of this novel approach towards the development of a peanut allergen peptide-based carrier-bound vaccine.

We studied 373 children with ALL enrolled on the Total XV study, which prospectively used minimal residual disease (MRD) for risk assignment. MRD on day 19 and at the end of remission induction (day 46), cumulative incidence of relapse/refractory disease (CIR), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using sets of four, three and two subgroups based on BMI at diagnosis, along with BMI percentile change during remission induction. Higher BMI was associated with older age and higher treatment risk. There was no association between MRD on days 19 or 46 and BMI for four, three or two BMI subgroups (P>0.1 in all cases), nor was BMI associated with CIR or EFS. Obese patients had worse OS compared with non-obese (P=0.031) due to treatment-related mortality and less salvage after refractory disease or bone marrow relapse. No association between BMI change during remission induction and MRD, CIR, EFS or OS was seen. BMI at diagnosis does not predict poorer response or relapse in a contemporary MRD-directed ALL regimen.

However, outcomes for patients with high-risk (HR) features remain unacceptably poor. As novel technologies for the identification of HR biomarkers and the detection of residual disease are developed, risk stratification and the application of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are evolving. HSCT has been shown to benefit subpopulations of pediatric patients with AML, including those with HR cytogenetic translocations, genetic mutations, and/or residual disease after induction. Targeted therapies have shown promise for improving outcomes, and their integration into standard therapy and HSCT regimens is a critical area of interest. Also, expansion of the donor pool has led to the successful use of alternative donor sources for those patients without a matched sibling. However, transplant-related morbidity and mortality and late effects are major limiting factors. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens have resulted in outcomes equivalent to those achieved with myeloablative regimens among patients in complete remission. The limitation of transplant-related morbidity and mortality through reduced-intensity conditioning and supportive care, and improved survival through optimal alloreactivity in combination with targeted therapy, are steps toward advancing outcomes for pediatric patients who have AML with HR features.",,"['Flower, Allyson', 'Cairo, Mitchell S']","['Flower A', 'Cairo MS']",,"['New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York.', 'New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,2017/02/18 06:00,2017/03/01 06:00,['2017/02/18 06:00'],"['2017/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2017 Jan;15(1):52-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As results obtained in clinical trials are facing increased pressure to be confirmed by real-world data, we aimed to test whether data obtained in the AZA-AML-001 trial accurately represent observations made in routine clinical practice by analysing additional AML patients treated with azacitidine front-line within the Austrian Azacitidine Registry (AAR; NCT01595295; registered: May 2012) and directly comparing patient-level data of both cohorts. We assessed the efficacy of front-line azacitidine in a total of 407 patients with newly-diagnosed AML. Firstly, we compared data from AML patients with WBC </= 15 G/L and >30% BM blasts included within the AZA-AML-001 trial treated with azacitidine (""AML-001"" cohort; n = 214) with AAR patients meeting the same inclusion criteria (""AAR (001-like)"" cohort; n = 95). The current analysis thus represents a new sub-analysis of the AML-001 trial, which is directly compared with a new sub-analysis of the AAR. Baseline characteristics, azacitidine application, response rates and OS were comparable between all patient cohorts within the trial or registry setting. Median OS was 9.9 versus 10.8 months (p = 0.616) for ""AML-001"" versus ""AAR (001-like)"" cohorts, respectively. Secondly, we pooled data from both cohorts (n = 309) and assessed the outcome. Median OS of the pooled cohorts was 10.3 (95% confidence interval: 8.7, 12.6) months, and the one-year survival rate was 45.8%. Thirdly, we compared data from AAR patients meeting AZA-AML-001 trial inclusion criteria (n = 95) versus all AAR patients with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined AML (""AAR (WHO-AML)"" cohort; n = 193). Within the registry population, median OS for AAR patients meeting trial inclusion criteria versus all WHO-AML patients was 10.8 versus 11.8 months (p = 0.599), respectively. We thus tested and confirmed the efficacy of azacitidine as a front-line agent in patients with AML, >30% BM blasts and WBC </= 15 G/L in a routine clinical practice setting. We further show that the efficacy of azacitidine does not appear to be limited to AML patients who meet stringent clinical trial inclusion criteria, but instead appears efficacious as front-line treatment in all patients with WHO-AML.",,"['Pleyer, Lisa', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Seymour, John F', 'Schuh, Andre C', 'Beach, C L', 'Swern, Arlene S', 'Burgstaller, Sonja', 'Stauder,

Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare constitutional bone marrow failure, usually presents an increased possibility of clonal evolution, due to the increase in chromosomal instability, TP53 activation, and cell death. The evolution of FA may include aplastic anemia by the progressive failure of the bone marrow and myelod neoplasias, such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Chromosome abnormalities, particularly of chromosomes, 1, 3, and 7, during the aplastic phase of the disease are predictive of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. Cytogenetic studies are indispensable to characterize chromosome abnormalities, and thus an important part of the clinical management, and for planning of therapeutic interventions.

This is similar to many-body physics of a condensed phase that many important properties are not determined by a single atom or molecule. The rapidly accumulating large 'omics' data also require a new mechanistic and global underpinning to organize for rationalizing cancer complexity. A unifying and quantitative theory was proposed by some of the present authors that cancer is a robust state formed by the endogenous molecular-cellular network, which is evolutionarily built for the developmental processes and physiological functions. Cancer state is not optimized for the whole organism. The discovery of crucial players in cancer, together with their developmental and physiological roles, in turn, suggests the existence of a hierarchical structure within molecular biology systems. Such a structure enables a decision network to be constructed from experimental knowledge. By examining the nonlinear stochastic dynamics of the network, robust states corresponding to normal physiological and abnormal pathological phenotypes, including cancer, emerge naturally. The nonlinear dynamical model of the network leads to a more encompassing understanding than the prevailing linear-additive thinking in cancer research.

To the authors' knowledge, there currently are no data regarding factors influencing transplantation outcomes. METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied outcomes of transplantation for cases of PREF ALL reported to European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry. Eligibility criteria for the current analysis included adult patients who underwent their first HCT for PREF ALL between 2000 and 2012. PREF disease was defined as the failure to achieve a morphological CR after >/=2 courses of induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: Data regarding 86 adult patients were analyzed. With a median follow-up of 106 months, the probability of survival was 36% at 2 years and 23% at 5 years. The probability of leukemia-free survival was 28% and 17%, respectively, and the probability of nonrecurrence mortality was 20% and 29%, respectively, at 2 years and 5 years. For 66 patients who achieved a CR (77%), the survival at 2 years and 5 years was 36% and 29%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, use of total body irradiation was found to be associated with improved survival. Total body irradiation and infusion of female hematopoietic cells into male recipients was associated with improved leukemia-free survival. These findings were incorporated into a scoring system that identified 3 groups (those with 2, 1, or no prognostic factors) with survival rates of 57%, 22%, and 8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall these patients would clearly benefit from the introduction of novel antileukemic therapies, the data from the current study support the use of allogeneic HCT in selected patients with PREF ALL.

In single-dose experiments and under culture conditions preserving leukemia stem cell activity, our strategy considerably reduces the number of tests needed for the identification of promising compound combinations. Initially conducted with a selected library of 5000 small molecules and 20 primary AML specimens, it reveals 5 broad classes of sensitized therapeutic target pathways along with their synergistic patient-specific fingerprints.

Relapse is driven by leukemia stem cells, a chemoresistant subpopulation capable of re-establishing disease. Patients with p53 mutant AML are at an extremely high risk of relapse. B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1) is required for the self-renewal and maintenance of AML stem cells. Here we studied the effects of a novel small molecule inhibitor of BMI-1, PTC596, in AML cells. Treatment with PTC596 reduced MCL-1 expression and triggered several molecular events consistent with induction of mitochondrial apoptosis: loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, BAX conformational change, caspase-3 cleavage and phosphatidylserine externalization. PTC596 induced apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. PTC596 induced apoptosis along with the reduction of MCL-1 and phosphorylated AKT in patient-derived CD34(+)CD38(low/-) stem/progenitor cells. Mouse xenograft models demonstrated in vivo anti-leukemia activity of PTC596, which inhibited leukemia cell growth in vivo while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Our results indicate that PTC596 deserves further evaluation in clinical trials for refractory or relapsed AML patients, especially for those with unfavorable complex karyotype or therapy-related AML that are frequently associated with p53 mutations.",,"['Nishida, Y', 'Maeda, A', 'Kim, M J', 'Cao, L', 'Kubota, Y', 'Ishizawa, J', 'AlRawi, A', 'Kato, Y', 'Iwama, A', 'Fujisawa, M', 'Matsue, K', 'Weetall, M', 'Dumble, M', 'Andreeff, M', 'Davis, T W', 'Branstrom, A', 'Kimura, S', 'Kojima, K']","['Nishida Y', 'Maeda A', 'Kim MJ', 'Cao L', 'Kubota Y', 'Ishizawa J', 'AlRawi A', 'Kato Y', 'Iwama A', 'Fujisawa M', 'Matsue K', 'Weetall M', 'Dumble M', 'Andreeff M', 'Davis TW', 'Branstrom A', 'Kimura S', 'Kojima K']",,"['Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'PTC Therapeutics, South Plainfield, NJ, USA.', 'PTC Therapeutics, South Plainfield, NJ, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kameda Medical Center, Kamogawa, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kameda Medical Center, Kamogawa, Japan.', 'PTC Therapeutics, South Plainfield, NJ, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'PMV Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cranbury, NJ, USA.', 'PTC Therapeutics, South Plainfield, NJ, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",PMC5386342,,,,2017/02/18 06:00,2017/11/07 06:00,['2017/02/18 06:00'],"['2016/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj20178 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2017.8 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2017 Feb 17;7(2):e527. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2017.8.,20170217,,['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients before standard chemotherapy underwent MRI scans at 1.5 Tesla using conventional diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and IVIM (b = 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 s/mm(2) ) in the sagittal plane covering the lumbar bone marrow. The IVIM parameters (perfusion fraction [f], molecular diffusion coefficient [D], and perfusion-related D [D*] and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were extracted from the bone marrow images. All patients were divided into complete remission (CR) and nonremission (NR) group according to the treatment response. RESULTS: All patients underwent the first remission induction chemotherapy, with 33 patients achieved CR and 20 patients achieved NR. The ADC values were not significant different between the two groups (P = 0.118). However, D value of CR group was significantly higher (P = 0.010), and f value of CR group was significantly lower (P = 0.021) than those of NR group. D* values had no significant differences between the two groups (P = 0.955). The D and f values were significant prognostic factors of AML after controlling for potential confounding factors (age, gender and smoking). Using receiver operator characteristic analysis, the area under the curve of D and f were 0.759 and 0.666, respectively, in evaluating prognosis of AML before treatment. CONCLUSION: There were significant differences in IVIM parameters between CR and NR patients of AML before treatment, and the D and f could play a potential role in prognosticating patients with AML.

We aimed to evaluate the genotype frequency and allelic distribution of the two HFE gene mutations (C282Y and H63D) in a sample of Egyptian pediatric ALL survivors and to detect the impact of these two mutations on their iron profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was performed on 35 ALL survivors during their follow-up visits to the Hematology and Oncology Unit, Pediatric Department, Menoufia University Hospitals. Thirty-five healthy children of matched age and sex were chosen as controls. After completing treatment course, ALL survivors were screened for the prevalence of these two mutations by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Serum ferritin levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique (ELISA). RESULTS: C282Y mutation cannot be detected in any of the 35 survivors or the 35 controls. The H63D heterozygous state (CG) was detected in 28.6% of the survivors group and in 20% of controls, while the H63D homozygous (GG) state was detected in 17.1% of survivors. No compound heterozygosity (C282Y/H63D) was detected at both groups with high G allele frequency (31.4%) in survivors more than controls (10%). There were significant higher levels of iron parameters in homozygote survivors than heterozygotes and the controls. CONCLUSION: H63D mutation aggravates the iron overload status in pediatric ALL survivors.",,"['El-Rashedi, Farida H', 'El-Hawy, Mahmoud A', 'El-Hefnawy, Sally M', 'Mohammed, Mona M']","['El-Rashedi FH', 'El-Hawy MA', 'El-Hefnawy SM', 'Mohammed MM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3420-922X'],"['a Department Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine , Menoufia University , Shebin El-Kom , Egypt.', 'a Department Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine , Menoufia University , Shebin El-Kom , Egypt.', 'b Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine , Menoufia University , Shebin El-Kom , Egypt.', 'c Department Pediatrics , Benha Educational Hospital , Benha , Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hemochromatosis Protein)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Anthropometry', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Hemochromatosis Protein/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Iron/blood', 'Iron Overload/blood/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Survivors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'HFE', 'iron', 'survivors']",,2017/02/18 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/02/18 06:00'],"['2017/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1289324 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2017 Aug;22(7):398-404. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1289324.

Uric acid (UA) is a strong immunological danger signal. METHODS: Laboratory results were analyzed from patients undergoing either allogeneic or autologous HCT or induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia (n = 50 per group, n = 150 total). RESULTS: During therapy, UA levels declined from normal values to hypouricemic values (all p < 0.001). Alongside hematopoietic recovery, UA serum levels returned to baseline values. During aplasia, UA levels remained low and started steadily increasing (defined as >two consecutive days, median one 2-day increase) at a median of 1 day before rising leukocytes in allogeneic HCT (p = 0.01) and together with leukocytes in autologous HCT (median one 2-day increase). During induction chemotherapy, a UA increase was also observed alongside rising leukocytes/neutrophils but also several times during aplasia (median 3 increases). Most HCT patients had no detectable leukocytes during aplasia, while some leukocytes remained detectable after induction therapy. No increase in UA levels was observed without concomitant or subsequent rise of leukocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in UA serum levels can indicate incipient or remaining immunological activity after HCT or induction therapy. They may, therefore, help to differentiate between PGF and GF.",,"['Haen, Sebastian P', 'Eyb, Vicky', 'Mirza, Nora', 'Naumann, Aline', 'Peter, Andreas', 'Loffler, Markus W', 'Faul, Christoph', 'Vogel, Wichard', 'Bethge, Wolfgang A', 'Rammensee, Hans-Georg', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Heni, Martin']","['Haen SP', 'Eyb V', 'Mirza N', 'Naumann A', 'Peter A', 'Loffler MW', 'Faul C', 'Vogel W', 'Bethge WA', 'Rammensee HG', 'Kanz L', 'Heni M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3655-4668'],"['Medizinische Universitaetsklinik, Abteilung II fuer Onkologie, Haematologie, Immunologie, Rheumatologie und Pulmologie, Otfried Mueller Str. 10, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany. sebastian.haen@med.uni-tuebingen.de.', 'Interfakultaeres Institut fuer Zellbiologie, Abteilung Immunologie, Auf der Morgenstelle 15, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany. sebastian.haen@med.uni-tuebingen.de.', 'Medizinische Universitaetsklinik, Abteilung II fuer Onkologie, Haematologie, Immunologie, Rheumatologie und Pulmologie, Otfried Mueller Str. 10, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Universitaetsklinik, Abteilung II fuer Onkologie, Haematologie, Immunologie, Rheumatologie und Pulmologie, Otfried Mueller Str. 10, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Interfakultaeres Institut fuer Zellbiologie, Abteilung Immunologie, Auf der Morgenstelle 15, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institut fuer klinische Epidemiologie und angewandte Biometrie, Silcherstr. 5, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Universitaetsklinik, Abteilung IV fuer Endokrinologie, Diabetologie, Angiologie, Nephrologie und Klinische Chemie, Otfried Mueller Str. 10, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases (IDM) of the Helmholtz Center Munich at the University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Muenchen-Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Interfakultaeres Institut fuer Zellbiologie, Abteilung Immunologie, Auf der Morgenstelle 15, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Universitaetsklinik, Abteilung II fuer Onkologie, Haematologie, Immunologie, Rheumatologie und Pulmologie, Otfried Mueller Str. 10, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Universitaetsklinik, Abteilung II fuer Onkologie, Haematologie, Immunologie, Rheumatologie und Pulmologie, Otfried Mueller Str. 10, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Universitaetsklinik, Abteilung II fuer Onkologie, Haematologie, Immunologie, Rheumatologie und Pulmologie, Otfried Mueller Str. 10, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Interfakultaeres Institut fuer Zellbiologie, Abteilung Immunologie, Auf der Morgenstelle 15, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Universitaetsklinik, Abteilung II fuer Onkologie, Haematologie, Immunologie, Rheumatologie und Pulmologie, Otfried Mueller Str. 10, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Universitaetsklinik, Abteilung IV fuer Endokrinologie, Diabetologie, Angiologie, Nephrologie und Klinische Chemie, Otfried Mueller Str. 10, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases (IDM) of the Helmholtz Center Munich at the University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Muenchen-Neuherberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/*blood/etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/immunology/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Uric Acid/*blood', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'Autologous stem cell transplantation', 'Danger signal', 'Leukemia', 'Uric acid']",,2017/02/18 06:00,2017/04/15 06:00,['2017/02/18 06:00'],"['2016/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-017-2348-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-017-2348-z [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2017 May;143(5):759-771. doi: 10.1007/s00432-017-2348-z.

Environmental and different genetic factors affect disease process, prognosis and treatment. Among different genetic factors NPM1, FLT3, MLL and BAALC genes are the most effective on patient's survival rate. The aim of this study was to assess amount of BAALC gene expression in AML patients, and its relation to survival rate. Methods: In this case-control study, from all 94 individuals referred to Ghaem Medical Center during 2012-2015, 47 cases were normal cytogenetic AML and others were healthy individuals that were studied as control group. Real-time PCR method was applied for gene expression evaluation. Other information of patients was extracted from medical documents. SPSS v.21 was used for data processing. Results: Mean age of studied cases was 31.50 years. The most of BAALC gene expression was seen in M1 and M2 subtypes, and the less was in M5. A significant relation was found between amount of gene expression and patient's survival rate. Conclusion: BAALC gene expression was increased significantly in AML cases.

CD8 T cells and gammadelta T cells are only weakly affected at diagnosis. Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor expression by NK cells, but not NKG2A and CD85j, was downregulated. Interestingly, the development of NK cells appeared altered as the most immature CD56(bright) NK cells were seriously underrepresented. Finally, we showed that NK cell functions were only partially restored 6 weeks after CT as degranulation capabilities of NK cells recovered, whereas cytokine production remained low.

This study explored the effect of a curcumin/AA combination on human cancer cell lines. The curcumin/AA combination was assessed by isobologram analysis using the Loewe additivity drug interaction model. The drug combination showed additive cytotoxicity toward CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cell lines and HCT116p53(+/+) and HCT116p53(-/-) colon cancer cell line, while the glioblastoma cell lines U87MG and U87MG.DeltaEGFR showed additive to supra-additive cytotoxicity.

Novel LSD1 inhibitors, NCD25 and NCD38, inhibited growth of MLL-AF9 leukemia as well as erythroleukemia, megakaryoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) overt leukemia cells in the concentration range that normal hematopoiesis was spared. NCD25 and NCD38 invoked the myeloid development programs, hindered the MDS and AML oncogenic programs, and commonly upregulated 62 genes in several leukemia cells. NCD38 elevated H3K27ac level on enhancers of these LSD1 signature genes and newly activated ~500 super-enhancers. Upregulated genes with super-enhancer activation in erythroleukemia cells were enriched in leukocyte differentiation. Eleven genes including GFI1 and ERG, but not CEBPA, were identified as the LSD1 signature with super-enhancer activation. Super-enhancers of these genes were activated prior to induction of the transcripts and myeloid differentiation. Depletion of GFI1 attenuated myeloid differentiation by NCD38. Finally, a single administration of NCD38 causes the in vivo eradication of primary MDS-related leukemia cells with a complex karyotype.

Although the two fusion proteins are closely related, they can lead to different clinical outcomes. A thorough understanding of the signaling programs employed by these two fusion proteins is necessary to explain these clinical differences. We took an integrated approach by coupling protein-protein interaction analysis using biotinylation identification with global phosphorylation analysis to investigate the differences in signaling between these two fusion proteins.

In cancer, apoptosis evasion through dysregulation of specific BCL-2 family genes is a recurring event; accordingly, selective inhibition of specific anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins represents an exciting therapeutic opportunity. A combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based screening and structure-based drug design has yielded the first bona fide BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) mimetics, including the BCL-2 and BCL-XL dual antagonist navitoclax, which is the first BCL-2 family inhibitor to show efficacy in patients with cancer. Clinical experience with navitoclax prompted the generation of the highly selective BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, which is now approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with 17p deletion who have received at least one prior therapy. Recent advances have also been made in the development of potent and selective inhibitors of BCL-XL and myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (MCL1), which are additional BCL-2 family members with established anti-apoptotic roles in cancer.

We performed CSF3R, SRSF2 and SETBP1 mutational analyses in 10 CNL and 56 CMML patients. In this sample cohort, 80% of CNL patients harbored CSF3R mutations, of which the CSF3R T618I mutation was dominant. Mutations in CSF3R and SETBP1 were found in 7.1% and 5.3% CMML patients respectively, while 25% of CMML patients carried SRSF2 mutations. Strikingly, we identified that all of the CSF3R mutations detected in CMML patients were represented by a P733T mutation. The CSF3R P733T mutation represents a novel CSF3R mutation. In addition, none of the four CSF3R P733T mutated patients carried SRSF2 mutations [0/14 (0%) patients with combined CSF3R P733T and SRSF2 mutations vs. 4/42 (9.5%) with CSF3R P733T and wt SRSF2, P < 0.001].

While we found no significant differences in OS and PFS as a consequence of CSF3R mutation status, our work suggest that the CSF3R T618I mutation is a diagnostic marker with good specificity and sensitivity for CNL.

We identified mutations in the Cbl gene, which encodes a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, in a subset of CMML patients. To investigate the contribution of mutant Cbl in CMML pathogenesis, we generated conditional knockin mice for Cbl that express wild-type Cbl in a steady state and inducibly express Cbl(Q367P) , a CMML-associated Cbl mutant. Cbl(Q367P) mice exhibited sustained proliferation of myelomonocytes, multilineage dysplasia, and splenomegaly, which are the hallmarks of CMML. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT and JAK-STAT pathways were constitutively activated in Cbl(Q367P) hematopoietic stem cells, which promoted cell cycle progression and enhanced chemokine-chemokine receptor activity. Gem, a gene encoding a GTPase that is upregulated by Cbl(Q367P) , enhanced hematopoietic stem cell activity and induced myeloid cell proliferation. In addition, Evi1, a gene encoding a transcription factor, was found to cooperate with Cbl(Q367P) and progress CMML to AML. Furthermore, targeted inhibition for the PI3K-AKT and JAK-STAT pathways efficiently suppressed the proliferative activity of Cbl(Q367P) -bearing CMML cells.

Moreover, consistent with an adaptive identity, NK cells from patients with GATA2 mutation displayed altered expression of cytotoxic granule constituents and produced interferon-gamma upon Fc-receptor engagement but not following combined interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-18 stimulation. Canonical, PLZF-expressing NK cells were retained in asymptomatic carriers of GATA2 mutation. Developmentally, GATA-binding protein-2 (GATA-2) was expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, but not in NK-cell progenitors, CD3(-)CD56(bright), canonical, or adaptive CD3(-)CD56(dim) NK cells. Peripheral blood NK cells from individuals with GATA2 mutation proliferated normally in vitro, whereas lineage-negative progenitors displayed impaired NK-cell differentiation. In summary, adaptive NK cells can persist in patients with GATA2 mutation, even after NK-cell progenitors expire. Moreover, our data suggest that adaptive NK cells are more long-lived than canonical, immunoregulatory NK cells.",,"['Schlums, Heinrich', 'Jung, Moonjung', 'Han, Hongya', 'Theorell, Jakob', 'Bigley, Venetia', 'Chiang, Samuel C C', 'Allan, David S J', 'Davidson-Moncada, Jan K', 'Dickinson, Rachel E', 'Holmes, Tim D', 'Hsu, Amy P', 'Townsley, Danielle', 'Winkler, Thomas', 'Wang, Weixin', 'Aukrust, Pal', 'Nordoy, Ingvild', 'Calvo, Katherine R', 'Holland, Steve M', 'Collin, Matthew', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E', 'Bryceson, Yenan T']","['Schlums H', 'Jung M', 'Han H', 'Theorell J', 'Bigley V', 'Chiang SC', 'Allan DS', 'Davidson-Moncada JK', 'Dickinson RE', 'Holmes TD', 'Hsu AP', 'Townsley D', 'Winkler T', 'Wang W', 'Aukrust P', 'Nordoy I', 'Calvo KR', 'Holland SM', 'Collin M', 'Dunbar CE', 'Bryceson YT']",,"['Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Broegelmann Research Laboratory, Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD;

B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas are further classified into histological subtypes, with Burkitt lymphoma and Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma being the most common subgroups in pediatric patients. Translocations involving the MYC oncogene are known as relevant but not sufficient for Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis. Recently published large-scale next-generation sequencing studies unveiled sets of additional recurrently mutated genes in samples of pediatric and adult B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. ID3, TCF3 and CCND3 are potential drivers of Burkitt lymphomagenesis. In the study herein, frequency and clinical relevance of mutations in ID3, TCF3 and CCND3 were analyzed within a well-defined cohort of 84 uniformly diagnosed and treated pediatric B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster group. Mutation frequency was 78% (ID3), 13% (TCF3) and 36% (CCND3) in Burkitt lymphoma (including Burkitt leukemia). ID3 and CCND3 mutations were associated with more advanced stages of the disease in MYC rearrangement positive Burkitt lymphoma. In conclusion, ID3-TCF3-CCND3 pathway genes are mutated in more than 88% of MYC-rearranged pediatric B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and the pathway may represent a highly relevant second hit of Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis, especially in children and adolescents.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Rohde, Marius', 'Bonn, Bettina R', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Lange, Jonas', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Oschlies, Ilske', 'Szczepanowski, Monika', 'Nagel, Inga', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Loeffler, Markus', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Reiter, Alfred', 'Burkhardt, Birgit']","['Rohde M', 'Bonn BR', 'Zimmermann M', 'Lange J', 'Moricke A', 'Klapper W', 'Oschlies I', 'Szczepanowski M', 'Nagel I', 'Schrappe M', 'Loeffler M', 'Siebert R', 'Reiter A', 'Burkhardt B']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Munster, Germany.', 'Translational Oncology, Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Munster; Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion, Munster, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrecht University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrecht University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel/Christian-Albrecht University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel & University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics Statistics and Epidemiology, University Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel & University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Ulm and University Medical Center Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Munster, Germany birgit.burkhardt@ukmuenster.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '147785-34-0 (ID3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Child', 'Cyclin D3/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', '*Mutation Rate', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",PMC5451341,,,,2017/02/18 06:00,2018/03/15 06:00,['2017/02/18 06:00'],"['2016/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.156885 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.156885 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Jun;102(6):1091-1098. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.156885.

Analyzing a tissue microarray of 608 breast carcinoma patient specimens, we documented EVI1 overexpression in both estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) and estrogen receptor-negative (ER(-)) breast carcinomas. Here, we report prognostic relevance of EVI1 overexpression in triple-negative breast carcinoma but not in the HER2-positive breast carcinoma subset. In human breast cancer cells, EVI1 silencing reduced proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and tumorigenicity, effects rescued by estrogen supplementation in ER(+) breast carcinoma cells. Estrogen addition restored ERK phosphorylation in EVI1-silenced cells, suggesting that EVI1 and estradiol signaling merge in MAPK activation. Conversely, EVI1 silencing had no effect on constitutive ERK activity in HER2(+) breast carcinoma cells. Microarray analyses revealed G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) signaling as a prominent EVI1 effector mechanism in breast carcinoma.

One process suggested to participate in resistance is reduced uptake into tumor cells via nucleoside transporters, although precise mechanisms are not understood. Through transcriptomic profiling, we determined that low expression of the ergothioneine transporter OCTN1 (SLC22A4; ETT) strongly predicts poor event-free survival and overall survival in multiple cohorts of AML patients receiving treatment with the cytidine nucleoside analogue cytarabine. Cell biological studies confirmed OCTN1-mediated transport of cytarabine and various structurally related cytidine analogues, such as 2'deoxycytidine and gemcitabine, occurs through a saturable process that is highly sensitive to inhibition by the classic nucleoside transporter inhibitors dipyridamole and nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside. Our findings have immediate clinical implications given the potential of the identified transport system to help refine strategies that could improve patient survival across multiple cancer types where nucleoside analogues are used in cancer treatment.

In this study, we report the development of a second-generation BET protein degrader, BETd-246, which exhibits superior selectivity, potency, and antitumor activity. In human TNBC cells, BETd-246 induced degradation of BET proteins at low nanomolar concentrations within 1 hour of exposure, resulting in robust growth inhibition and apoptosis. BETd-246 was more potent and effective in TNBC cells than its parental BET inhibitor compound BETi-211. RNA-seq analysis revealed predominant downregulation of a large number of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis in cells treated with BETd-246, as compared with BETi-211 treatment that upregulated and downregulated a similar number of genes. Functional investigations identified the MCL1 gene as a critical downstream effector for BET degraders, which synergized with small-molecule inhibitors of BCL-xL in triggering apoptosis. In multiple murine xenograft models of human breast cancer, BETd-246 and a further optimized analogue BETd-260 effectively depleted BET proteins in tumors and exhibited strong antitumor activities at well-tolerated dosing schedules. Overall, our findings show that targeting BET proteins for degradation represents an effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC treatment. Cancer Res; 77(9); 2476-87.

Impact of care at NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCC) or Children's Oncology Group sites (COG) on survival disparities remains unstudied.Methods: Using the Los Angeles cancer registry, we identified 1,870 ALL or AML patients between 1 and 39 years at diagnosis. Cox regression analyses assessed risk of mortality; younger age + CCC/COG served as the referent group. Logistic regression was used to determine odds of care at CCC/COG, adjusting for variables above.Results: ALL outcome: AYAs at non-CCC/COG experienced inferior survival (15-21 years: HR = 1.9, P = 0.005; 22-29 years: HR = 2.6, P < 0.001; 30-39 years: HR = 3.0, P < 0.001). Outcome at CCC/COG was comparable between children and young AYAs (15-21 years: HR = 1.3, P = 0.3; 22-29 years: HR = 1.2, P = 0.2) but was inferior for 30- to 39-year-olds (HR = 3.4, P < 0.001). AML outcome: AYAs at non-CCC/COG experienced inferior outcome (15-21 years: HR = 1.8, P = 0.02; 22-39 years: HR = 1.4, P = 0.06). Outcome at CCC/COG was comparable between children and 15- to 21-year-olds (HR = 1.3, P = 0.4) but was inferior for 22- to 39-year-olds (HR = 1.7, P = 0.05). Access: 15- to 21-year-olds were less likely to use CCC/COG than children (P < 0.001). In 22- to 39-year-olds, public/uninsured (ALL: P = 0.004; AML<0.001), African American/Hispanics (ALL: P = 0.03), and 30- to 39-year-olds (ALL: P = 0.03) were less likely to use CCC/COG.Conclusions: Poor survival in AYAs with ALL and AML is mitigated by care at CCC/COG. Barriers to CCC/COG care include public/uninsured, and African American/Hispanic race/ethnicity.Impact: Care at CCC/COG explains, in part, inferior outcomes in AYAs with ALL and AML.

So the objective of our investigation is to identify the cardioprotective action of flaxseed oil (FSO), a natural compound against As2O3 induced cardiotoxicity. METHODS: Male wistar rats were treated with As2O3 (4 mg/kg) to induce cardiotoxicity. FSO (250 and 500 mg/kg) was given in combination with As2O3 for evaluating its cardioprotective efficacy. RESULTS: Treatment with As2O3 resulted in deposition of arsenic in heart tissue, increased cardiac marker enzymes release, lipid peroxidation (LPO), oxidative insults and pathological damages in the heart. Co-treatment with FSO (500 mg/kg) significantly reduced the arsenic accumulation, cardiac marker enzymes, LPO and cardiac structural alterations. FSO treatment significantly improved cardiac glutathione content, antioxidant enzymes and reduced the pathological damages in cardiac tissue. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the major fatty acid content in the FSO is alpha-linolenic acid, which has a strong milieu in cardiac health. CONCLUSION: The results of the current investigation suggested that FSO is an effective agent in reducing arsenic-induced cardiac toxicity and can be used as an adjunct/dietary supplement for the cancer patients on As2O3 therapy.",,"['Varghese, Mathews V', 'Abhilash, M', 'Alex, Manju', 'Paul, M V Sauganth', 'Prathapan, A', 'Raghu, K G', 'Nair, R Harikumaran']","['Varghese MV', 'Abhilash M', 'Alex M', 'Paul MVS', 'Prathapan A', 'Raghu KG', 'Nair RH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2701-2661'],"['a School of Biosciences , Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , India.', 'a School of Biosciences , Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , India.', 'a School of Biosciences , Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , India.', 'a School of Biosciences , Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , India.', 'b Biochemistry and Molecular Mechanism Laboratory, Agroprocessing and Technology Division , CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST) , Trivandrum , India.', 'b Biochemistry and Molecular Mechanism Laboratory, Agroprocessing and Technology Division , CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST) , Trivandrum , India.', 'a School of Biosciences , Mahatma Gandhi University , Kottayam , India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Redox Rep,Redox report : communications in free radical research,9511366,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '8001-26-1 (Linseed Oil)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Cardiotoxicity/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Linseed Oil/*therapeutic use', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",PMC6837500,['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenic trioxide', 'alpha-linolenic acid', 'flax seed oil', 'lipid peroxidation', 'omega-3 fatty acid', 'oxidative stress']",,2017/02/18 06:00,2018/06/12 06:00,['2017/02/18 06:00'],"['2017/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13510002.2017.1289313 [doi]'],ppublish,Redox Rep. 2017 Nov;22(6):346-352. doi: 10.1080/13510002.2017.1289313.

CTCs are, especially at the early stages of cancer development, extremely rare cells hidden in a vast background of regular blood cells. We describe a new strategy for the isolation of CTCs from whole blood. The key component is a medical wire coated with a multilayer assembly that allows highly specific capture of EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) positive CTCs from blood. The assembly is generated in a layer-by-layer fashion through photochemically induced C,H insertion reactions and consists of a protective layer, which shields the contacting solution from the metal, a protein resistant layer, which prevents nonspecific interactions with proteins and a layer containing the EpCAM antibodies. In vitro experiments show that these surfaces can capture tumor cells from whole blood with enrichment factors (specifically vs nonspecifically bound cells) of up to about 3000 compared to the number of leucocytes in the blood. The purity of the isolated cells is greater than 90%. After ""fishing"" them from the blood, the cells, still bound to the wire, can be genetically analyzed.

Its main biological function is to inhibit beta-catenin by sequestration and promotion of its proteasomal degradation in the Wnt canonical pathway; however, GSK-3beta interacts with multiple signalling pathways, and aberrant expression of the enzyme was reported in many solid neoplasms. This study aimed to investigate the biological relevance of GSK-3beta in classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHL). METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the functional status of GSK-3beta enzyme in cHL by using antibodies raised against fixation-resistant epitopes of phospho Y216 GSK-3beta (active form), phospho S9 GSK-3beta (inactive form) and beta-catenin protein. We first detected the pY216 GSK-3beta active form of the enzyme in 100 of 100 (100%) of the cases, and in line with the latter expression profile, the beta-catenin protein was found in only 12 of 100 (12%) of the samples. As reported previously in bladder cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, we showed an aberrant nuclear localization in the neoplastic clone of active pY216 GSK-3beta in 78 of 100 (78%) of cHL cases. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the activation of GSK-3beta in cHL resulting in inhibition of the Wnt/beta-catenin signal cascade and the aberrant accumulation of its activated form in nuclei of Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg and Hodgkin cells. These findings may be relevant for future clinical studies, identifying GSK-3beta as a potential therapeutic target for cHL.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Carloni, Silvia', 'Limarzi, Francesco', 'Righi, Simona', 'Laginestra, Maria Antonella', 'Musuraca, Gerardo', 'Fiorentino, Michelangelo', 'Napolitano, Roberta', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Vergara, Daniele', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi', 'Sabattini, Elena', 'Pileri, Stefano A', 'De Matteis, Serena']","['Agostinelli C', 'Carloni S', 'Limarzi F', 'Righi S', 'Laginestra MA', 'Musuraca G', 'Fiorentino M', 'Napolitano R', 'Cuneo A', 'Vergara D', 'Zinzani PL', 'Sabattini E', 'Pileri SA', 'De Matteis S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4945-1422'],"[""Hematopathology Unit, Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology 'L. e A.

To assess the oncogenic capacity of individual mutations, reliable and scalable in vitro experimental approaches are required. Since 1988, researchers have used the IL-3 dependent Ba/F3 transformation assay to validate the oncogenic potential of mutations to drive factor-independent growth. Here we report a previously unrecognized phenomenon whereby Ba/F3 cells, engineered to express weakly transforming mutations, present with additional acquired mutations in the expressed transgene following factor withdrawal. Using four mutations with known transformative capacity in three cytokine receptors (CSF2RB, CSF3R and IL7R), we demonstrate that the mutated receptors are highly susceptible to acquiring additional mutations. These acquired mutations of unknown functional significance are selected by factor withdrawal but appear to exist prior to the removal of growth factor. This anomaly has the potential to confound efforts to both validate and characterize oncogenic mutations in leukemia, particularly when it is not standard practice to sequence validate cDNAs from transformed Ba/F3 lines.

Part of the risk likely resides in inherent interindividual differences in their DNA repair capacity (DRC), which is thought to influence the effect chemotherapeutic treatments have on the patient's stem cells prior to aHCT. Measuring DRC involves identifying small differences in repair proficiency among individuals. Initially, we investigated the cell model in healthy individuals (primary lymphocytes and/or lymphoblastoid cell lines) that would be appropriate to measure genetically determined DRC using host-cell reactivation assays. We present evidence that interindividual differences in DRC double-strand break repair (by non-homologous end-joining [NHEJ] or single-strand annealing [SSA]) are better preserved in non-induced primary lymphocytes. In contrast, lymphocytes induced to proliferate are required to assay base excision (BER) or nucleotide excision repair (NER). We established that both NHEJ and SSA DRCs in lymphocytes of healthy individuals were inversely correlated with the age of the donor, indicating that DSB repair in lymphocytes is likely not a constant feature but rather something that decreases with age (~0.37% NHEJ DRC/year). To investigate the predictive value of pre-aHCT DRC on outcome in patients, we then applied the optimized assays to the analysis of primary lymphocytes from lymphoma patients and found that individuals who later developed t-MDS/AML (cases) were indistinguishable in their DRC from controls who never developed t-MDS/AML. However, when DRC was investigated shortly after aHCT in the same individuals (21.6 months later on average), aHCT patients (both cases and controls) showed a significant decrease in DSB repair measurements. The average decrease of 6.9% in NHEJ DRC observed among aHCT patients was much higher than the 0.65% predicted for such a short time frame, based on ageing results for healthy individuals.",,"['Lacoste, Sandrine', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Chen, Yanjun', 'Bhatia, Ravi', ""O'Connor, Timothy R""]","['Lacoste S', 'Bhatia S', 'Chen Y', 'Bhatia R', ""O'Connor TR""]",,"['Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Young Adult']",PMC5313139,,,,2017/02/17 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2017/02/17 06:00'],"['2016/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0171473 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-33163 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Feb 16;12(2):e0171473. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0171473. eCollection 2017.,20170216,,"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA176611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PARP inhibitors have been used either alone or with other drugs to augment cancer cell death. However, whether PARP inhibitors may also augment cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents in CML cells has not been studied. K562 cells with or without PARP-1 knockdown were treated with cisplatin alone or together with olaparib. The cell death was investigated by propidium iodide staining and apoptosis-related proteins were detected by western blotting. Olaparib suppressed cisplatin-induced cell death in K562 and MEG01 cells. Moreover, PARP-1 knockdown also attenuated cisplatin toxicity in CML cells. Inhibition of PARP decreased cisplatin toxicity by attenuating caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity. These results indicated that the toxicity of cisplatin in CML cells requires PARP activity.

METHODS: Registrations for 1606 15-24 year olds diagnosed with a new primary malignant tumor between 2000 and 2009 were obtained from the New Zealand Cancer Registry and classified according to AYA diagnostic group and subgroup, age, sex, and prioritized ethnicity. Age-standardized incidence rates (IRs) per million person years and 5-year relative survival ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Cancer incidence was 228.6 per million for adolescents aged 15-19 years and 325.7 per million for young adults aged 20-24 years. Overall IRs were consistent across all ethnic groups but there were unique ethnic differences by tumor group including a higher incidence of bone tumors, carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract, and gonadal germ cell tumors among Maori, a higher incidence of leukemia among Pacific peoples, and a higher incidence of melanoma among non-Maori/non-Pacific peoples. Five-year relative survival for adolescents (75.1%) and AYA overall (80.6%) appeared poorer than had been achieved in other high-income countries. Maori (69.5%) and Pacific (71.3%) AYA had lower 5-year survival compared to non-Maori/non-Pacific peoples (84.2%).

In the intermediate-risk subgroup, the 5-year DFS of AUTO (53.9%) was not different from the conventional donors in multivariate analysis, presenting a low NRM rate (5.1%).

We conducted a meta-analysis to address these issues. Four databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library) were searched to select eligible studies. All donor-recipient pairs were high-resolution typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, DQB1 and DPB1 loci. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were extracted and pooled using a random-effects model. A total of 36 studies were included, with 100,072 patients receiving HCT. Surprisingly, we found that HLA-DQB1 locus mismatches had no significantly increased risk of multiple outcomes including acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), overall mortality and disease relapse (HR, 1.07; P = .153; HR, 1.07; P = .271; HR, 1.09; P = .230; HR, 1.07; P = .142 and HR, 1.02; P = .806, respectively).

We studied four oxaliplatin-derived platinum(iv) complexes with varying axial ligands in various in vitro and in vivo settings. The ability to interfere with DNA (pUC19) in the presence and absence of a reducing agent (ascorbic acid) was investigated in cell-free experiments. Cytotoxicity was compared under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in monolayer cultures and multicellular spheroids of colon carcinoma cell lines. Effects on the cell cycle were investigated by flow cytometry, and the capacity of inducing apoptosis was confirmed by flow cytometry and Western blotting. The anti-cancer activity of one complex was studied in vivo in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice, and the platinum levels in various organs and the tumor after treatment were quantified. The results demonstrate that modification of the axial ligands can improve the cytotoxic potency. The complexes are able to interfere with plasmid DNA, which is enhanced by co-incubation with a reducing agent, and cause cell cycle perturbations. At higher concentrations, they induce apoptosis, but generate only low levels of reactive oxygen species. Two of the complexes increase the life span of leukemia (L1210) bearing mice, and one showed effects similar to oxaliplatin in a CT26 solid tumor model, despite the low platinum levels in the tumor. As in the case of oxaliplatin, activity in the latter model depends on an intact immune system.

Their expression patterns could be classified into either pluripotent state-specific, differentiating stage-specific, or non-specific Cxs. We focused on Cx30.3 as typical of the first category. Cx30.3 was pluripotent state-specific and upregulated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a specific cytokine that maintains the pluripotent state of ES cell, via a Jak signaling pathway. Cx30.3 protein was localized to both the cell membrane and cytosol. The dynamic movement of Cx30.3 in the cell membrane was suggested by the imaging analysis by means of overexpressed Cx30.3-EGFP fusion protein. The cytosolic portion was postulated to be a ready-to-use Cx pool. The Cx30.3 expression level in ES cell colonies dramatically decreased immediately after their separation into single cells. It was suggested that mRNA for Cx30.3 and Cx30.3 protein might be decomposed more rapidly than mRNA for Cx43 and Cx43 protein, respectively. These indicate possible involvement of Cx30.3 in the rapid formation and/or decomposition of gap junctions; implying a functional relay between Cx30.3 and other systems such as adhesion proteins.",,"['Saito, Mikako', 'Asai, Yuma', 'Imai, Keiichi', 'Hiratoko, Shoya', 'Tanaka, Kento']","['Saito M', 'Asai Y', 'Imai K', 'Hiratoko S', 'Tanaka K']",,"['Department of Biotechnology and Life Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 2-24-16, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Life Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 2-24-16, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Life Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 2-24-16, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Life Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 2-24-16, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Life Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 2-24-16, Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Connexins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147652-21-9 (connexin 30.3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Connexins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Imaging', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Multigene Family', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC5304323,,,,2017/02/17 06:00,2018/10/31 06:00,['2017/02/17 06:00'],"['2016/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['srep42403 [pii]', '10.1038/srep42403 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Feb 13;7:42403. doi: 10.1038/srep42403.,20170213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Static knowledge on biological networks is often combined with the dynamics observed in gene expression levels over disease development, to find markers for diagnostics and therapy, and also putative disease-modulatory drug targets and drugs. The basis of current methods ranges from a focus on expression-levels (Limma) to concentrating on network characteristics (PageRank, HITS/Authority Score), and both (DeMAND, Local Radiality). We present an integrative approach (the FocusHeuristics) that is thoroughly evaluated based on public expression data and molecular disease characteristics provided by DisGeNet. The FocusHeuristics combines three scores, i.e. the log fold change and another two, based on the sum and difference of log fold changes of genes/proteins linked in a network. A gene is kept when one of the scores to which it contributes is above a threshold. Our FocusHeuristics is both, a predictor for gene-disease-association and a bioinformatics method to reduce biological networks to their disease-relevant parts, by highlighting the dynamics observed in expression data. The FocusHeuristics is slightly, but significantly better than other methods by its more successful identification of disease-associated genes measured by AUC, and it delivers mechanistic explanations for its choice of genes.",,"['Ernst, Mathias', 'Du, Yang', 'Warsow, Gregor', 'Hamed, Mohamed', 'Endlich, Nicole', 'Endlich, Karlhans', 'Murua Escobar, Hugo', 'Sklarz, Lisa-Madeleine', 'Sender, Sina', 'Junghanss, Christian', 'Moller, Steffen', 'Fuellen, Georg', 'Struckmann, Stephan']","['Ernst M', 'Du Y', 'Warsow G', 'Hamed M', 'Endlich N', 'Endlich K', 'Murua Escobar H', 'Sklarz LM', 'Sender S', 'Junghanss C', 'Moller S', 'Fuellen G', 'Struckmann S']",,"['Institute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Strasse 8, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'Institute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Strasse 8, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'Annoroad Gene Technology, No. 88 Kechuang 6th Street, Beijing, 100176, China.', 'Institute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Strasse 8, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'Institute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Strasse 8, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Greifswald, Friedrich-Loeffler-Strasse 23c, Greifswald 17487, Germany.', 'Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Greifswald, Friedrich-Loeffler-Strasse 23c, Greifswald 17487, Germany.', 'Clinic for Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'Clinic for Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'Clinic for Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'Clinic for Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Medicine, Rostock University Medical Center, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'Institute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Strasse 8, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'Institute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Strasse 8, 18057 Rostock, Germany.', 'Institute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research, Rostock University Medical Center, Ernst-Heydemann-Strasse 8, 18057 Rostock, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biomarkers', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/*methods', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve']",PMC5311990,,,,2017/02/17 06:00,2018/10/31 06:00,['2017/02/17 06:00'],"['2016/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['srep42638 [pii]', '10.1038/srep42638 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Feb 16;7:42638. doi: 10.1038/srep42638.,20170216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physical examination revealed generalized lymphadenopathy, pale mucous membranes, systolic heart murmur, dehydration, and fever. Hematologic abnormalities included moderate-to-marked leukocytosis, characterized by neutrophilia with a left shift to progranulocytes and 2% presumptive myeloid blasts, marked anemia that was nonregenerative, and marked thrombocytopenia. Dysplasia was evident in neutrophils and platelets. Bone marrow examination revealed marked myeloid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia with 7% blasts, erythroid hypoplasia, and trilineage dysplasia. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that bone marrow cells were mostly of neutrophil lineage, with reduced expression of common leukocyte antigens (CD45, CD18) and neutrophil-specific antigen. Bone marrow cells were cytogenetically analyzed for the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson oncogene using multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization. The genetic aberration was present in 7% of cells, which was a negative result (>10% of cells is considered positive). Euthanasia was elected. Histologic examination showed extensive infiltration of multiple organs by neoplastic myeloid cells, with effacement of lymph node and splenic architecture. The final diagnosis was atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), an uncommon myeloproliferative disorder with features of myelodysplastic syndromes (dysplasia) and chronic leukemia (neutrophilic leukocytosis with <20% marrow blasts, extramedullary infiltrates).

CASE REPORT: This report describes a transfusion reaction in an elderly patient diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, transfused with a 4-day-old buffy coat PC through a central venous catheter. The transfusion was interrupted when a large fibrous clot in the PC obstructed infusion pump flow. Shortly afterward, a red blood cell (RBC) unit transfusion started. After septic symptoms were developed, the RBC transfusion was also interrupted. While the RBC unit tested negative for bacterial contamination, the PC and the patient samples were found to be contaminated with a S. aureus strain that exhibited the same phenotypic and genome sequencing profiles. The isolated S. aureus forms biofilms and produces the superantigen enterotoxin-like U, which was detected in a sample of the transfused PCs. The patient received posttransfusion antibiotic treatment and had her original central line removed and replaced. DISCUSSION: As the implicated PC had been tested for bacterial contamination during routine screening yielding negative results, this is a false-negative transfusion sepsis case.

By accurately identifying patients with persistent MRD who are at highest risk for relapse, we may be able to better design rational post-remission therapies using novel agents, such as inotuzumab ozogamicin, blinatumomab, and CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cells, all of which have been shown to be effective in achieving MRD negativity, even in patients with relapsed or refractory disease.

However, the functional role of TIEG1 in the heart has not been fully defined. In this study, we first investigated the role of TIEG1 in ischaemic heart disease. For in vitro experiments, cardiomyocytes were isolated from both TIEG1 knockout (KO) and wile-type (WT) mice, and the apoptotic ratios were evaluated after a 48h ischaemic insult. A cell proliferation assay was performed after 7 days of incubation under normoxic conditions. In addition, the angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells was determined by tube formation assay. For in vivo experiments, a model of myocardial infarction (MI) was established using both TIEG1 KO and WT mice. Echocardiography was performed at 3 and 28 days post-MI, whereas the haemodynamics test was performed 28 days post-MI. Histological analyses of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis and infarct zone assessments were performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining, BrdU immunostaining, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)/CD31 immunostaining and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. Changes in the expression of related proteins caused by TIEG1 deficiency were confirmed using both reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that the absence of TIEG1 prevented cardiomyocytes from undergoing apoptosis and promoted higher proliferation; it stimulated the proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Improved cardiac function and less scar formation were observed in TIEG1 KO mice, and we also observed the altered expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), Akt and Bcl-2/Bax, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

For this purpose, in the present study, the expression levels of lncRNAs and mRNAs were calculated using the RNA-seq V2 data for AML, following which a lncRNAlncRNA co-expression network (LLCN) was constructed. This revealed a total of 8 AML prognosisrelated lncRNA modules were identified, which displayed a significant correlation with patient survival (p</=0.05). Subsequently, a prognosis-related lncRNA module pathway network was constructed to interpret the functional mechanism of the prognostic modules in AML. The results indicated that these prognostic modules were involved in the AML pathway, chemokine signaling pathway and WNT signaling pathway, all of which play important roles in AML. Furthermore, the investigation of lncRNAs in these prognostic modules suggested that an lncRNA (ZNF571-AS1) may be involved in AML via the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway by regulating KIT and STAT5.

It can cause adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and other diseases. The HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factor (HBZ), which is encoded by the minus-strand of the provirus, is expressed in all cases of ATL and involved in T cell proliferation. However, the exact mechanism underlying its growth-promoting activity is poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrated that HBZ suppressed cyclin D1 expression by inhibiting the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling pathway. Among the potential mechanisms of cyclin D1 inhibition mediated by HBZ, we found that HBZ suppressed cyclin D1 promoter activity. Luciferase assay analysis revealed that HBZ repressed cyclin D1 promoter activity by suppressing NF-kappaBdriven transcription mediated by the p65 subunit. Using an immunoprecipitation assay, we found that HBZ could bind to p65, but not p50. Finally, we showed that HBZ selectively interacted with p65 via its AD+bZIP domains.

Loss of PGR expression in the murine uterine epithelium during the preimplantation period is a marker for uterine receptivity and embryo attachment. We hypothesized that the decrease in progesterone receptor A (PGRA) expression is necessary for successful embryo implantation. To test this hypothesis, a mouse model constitutively expressing PGRA (mPgrALsL/+) was generated. Expression of PGRA in all uterine compartments (Pgrcre) or uterine epithelium (Wnt7acre) resulted in infertility with defects in embryo attachment and stromal decidualization. Expression of critical PGRA target genes, indian hedgehog, and amphiregulin (Areg), was maintained through the window of receptivity while the estrogen receptor target gene, the leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), a key regulator of embryo receptivity, was decreased. Transcriptomic and cistromic analyses of the mouse uterus at day 4.5 of pregnancy identified an altered group of genes regulating molecular transport in the control of fluid and ion levels within the uterine interstitial space. Additionally, LIF and its cognate receptor, the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), exhibited PGR-binding events in regions upstream of the transcriptional start sites, suggesting PGRA is inhibiting transcription at these loci.

However, the expression patterns and biological functions of lncRNAs in acute leukemia have not been well studied. Here, we performed transcriptome-wide lncRNA expression profiling of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples, along with non-leukemia control hematopoietic samples. We found that lncRNAs were differentially expressed in AML samples relative to control samples. Notably, we identified that lncRNAs upregulated in AML (relative to the control samples) are associated with a lower degree of DNA methylation and a higher ratio of being bound by transcription factors such as SP1, STAT4, ATF-2 and ELK-1 compared with those downregulated in AML. Moreover, an enrichment of H3K4me3 and a depletion of H3K27me3 were observed in upregulated lncRNAs in AML. Expression patterns of three types of lncRNAs (antisense, enhancer and intergenic lncRNAs) have previously been characterized.

Hematologic neoplasms, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), have been commonly reported in association with SS. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an emerging entity that is a precursor state to myeloid neoplasms. CHIP has not been previously associated with SS. We report the case of a 71-year-old man who presented with recurrent, painful edematous and erythematous papules and nodules for 18 months despite treatment with corticosteroids. He had normal blood counts, but a macrocytosis was noted (110 fl). Alternative causes of macrocytosis were ruled out. A skin biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of SS. Bone marrow biopsy specimen yielded a normal karyotype except for loss of the Y chromosome and equivocal morphologic findings. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of selected genes from the peripheral blood demonstrated a mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) partial tandem duplication (PTD) and sequence variant in CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of CHIP. The patient was treated with 5-azacitidine and achieved a complete remission of his skin lesions and was able to discontinue corticosteroids. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with recurrent SS associated with CHIP. In addition to other myeloid neoplasms like AML and MDS, CHIP should be considered as a potential etiology in cases of recurrent SS.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review study was conducted using data recorded from 2011 to 2012 from hospitals in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. Patients were included if they had been discharged with a diagnosis of IFI due to Candida or Aspergillus, which was culture proven or suspected based on clinical criteria. Hospital data were abstracted for a random sample of patients to capture demographics, treatment patterns, hospital resource utilization, and clinical outcomes. Descriptive results were reported. RESULTS: Five hospitals participated and provided data on 102 patients with IFI (51 from Lebanon and 51 from Saudi Arabia). The mean age of the patients was 55 years, and 55% were males. Comorbidities included diabetes (41%), coronary artery disease (24%), leukemia (19%), moderate-to-severe renal disease (16%), congestive heart failure (15%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15%). Twenty percent of patients received corticosteroids prior to admission and 26% had received chemotherapy in the past 90 days. Inpatient mortality was 42%, and the mean hospital length of stay was 32.4+/-28.6 days. Fifty-five percent of patients required intensive care unit admission (17.2+/-14.1 days), 37% required mechanical ventilation (13.7+/-13.2 days), and 11% required dialysis (14.6+/-14.2 days). The most commonly used first-line antifungal was fluconazole.

T-cell mediated immune responses specific for peptides from the murine scFv antigen-binding domain of the CAR can develop in patients and result in premature elimination of CAR T-cells increasing the risk of tumor relapse. As fully human scFv might reduce immunogenicity, we generated CD19-specific human scFvs with similar binding characteristics as the murine FMC63-derived scFv using human Ab/DNA libraries. CARs were constructed in various formats from several scFvs and used to transduce primary human T-cells. The resulting CD19-CAR T-cells were specifically activated by CD19-positive tumor cell lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, and eliminated human lymphoma xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Certain fully human CAR constructs were superior to the FMC63-CAR, which is widely used in clinical trials.

In this study, we report that KIR2DS2 reporter cells recognize a ligand expressed by cancer cell lines. All cancer targets recognized by KIR2DS2 were also recognized by KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 reporters. Trogocytosis of membrane proteins from the cancer targets was observed with responding reporter cells, indicating the formation of KIR2DS2 ligand-specific immunological synapses. HLA-C typing of target cells showed that KIR2DS2 recognition was independent of the HLA C1 or C2 group, whereas targets cells that were only recognized by KIR2DL3 expressed C1 group alleles. Anti-HLA class I Abs blocked KIR2DL3 responses toward C1-expressing targets, but they did not block KIR2DS2 recognition of cancer cells. Small interfering RNA knockdown of beta2-microglobulin reduced the expression of class I H chain on the cancer targets by >97%, but it did not reduce the KIR2DS2 reporter responses, indicating a beta2-microglobulin-independent ligand for KIR2DS2. Importantly, KIR2DL3 responses toward some KIR2DS2 ligand-expressing cells were also undiminished after beta2-microglobulin knockdown, and they were not blocked by anti-HLA class I Abs, suggesting that KIR2DL3, in addition to the traditional HLA-C ligands, can bind to the same beta2-microglobulin-independent ligand as KIR2DS2. These observations indicate the existence of a novel, presently uncharacterized ligand for the activating NK cell receptor KIR2DS2. Molecular identification of this ligand may lead to improved KIR-HLA mismatching in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy for leukemia and new, more specific NK cell-based cancer therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Thiruchelvam-Kyle, Lavanya', 'Hoelsbrekken, Sigurd E', 'Saether, Per C', 'Bjornsen, Elisabeth Gyllensten', 'Pende, Daniela', 'Fossum, Sigbjorn', 'Daws, Michael R', 'Dissen, Erik']","['Thiruchelvam-Kyle L', 'Hoelsbrekken SE', 'Saether PC', 'Bjornsen EG', 'Pende D', 'Fossum S', 'Daws MR', 'Dissen E']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1565-451X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4128-4228', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0216-6739']","['Division of Anatomy, Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway; and lavanya.thiruchelvam-kyle@medisin.uio.no.', 'Division of Anatomy, Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Division of Anatomy, Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Division of Anatomy, Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Laboratorio Immunologia, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino-Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, 16132 Genoa, Italy.', 'Division of Anatomy, Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Division of Anatomy, Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Division of Anatomy, Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL2)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR2DL2/*metabolism']",,,,,2017/02/17 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/02/17 06:00'],"['2016/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1600930 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1600930 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2017 Apr 1;198(7):2556-2567. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1600930.

In this study, we conducted an RNAi-based screen to identify druggable chromatin regulator-based targets in leukemias marked by oncogenic rearrangements of the MLL gene. In this manner, we discovered the H4K16 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) MOF to be important for leukemia cell growth. Conditional deletion of Mof in a mouse model of MLL-AF9-driven leukemogenesis reduced tumor burden and prolonged host survival. RNA sequencing showed an expected downregulation of genes within DNA damage repair pathways that are controlled by MOF, as correlated with a significant increase in yH2AX nuclear foci in Mof-deficient MLL-AF9 tumor cells. In parallel, Mof loss also impaired global H4K16 acetylation in the tumor cell genome. Rescue experiments with catalytically inactive mutants of MOF showed that its enzymatic activity was required to maintain cancer pathogenicity. In support of the role of MOF in sustaining H4K16 acetylation, a small-molecule inhibitor of the HAT component MYST blocked the growth of both murine and human MLL-AF9 leukemia cell lines. Furthermore, Mof inactivation suppressed leukemia development in an NUP98-HOXA9-driven AML model. Taken together, our results establish that the HAT activity of MOF is required to sustain MLL-AF9 leukemia and may be important for multiple AML subtypes. Blocking this activity is sufficient to stimulate DNA damage, offering a rationale to pursue MOF inhibitors as a targeted approach to treat MLL-rearranged leukemias. Cancer Res; 77(7); 1753-62.

Understanding the relationship between tobacco exposures and specific mutations may yield etiologic insights. We carried out a case-only analysis to explore whether prenatal and early-life tobacco smoke exposure influences the formation of leukemogenic genomic deletions. Somatic copy number of 8 genes frequently deleted in ALL (CDKN2A, ETV6, IKZF1, PAX5, RB1, BTG1, PAR1 region, and EBF1) was assessed in 559 pretreatment tumor samples from the California Childhood Leukemia Study. Parent and child's passive tobacco exposure was assessed using interview-assisted questionnaires as well as DNA methylation in aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR), a sentinel epigenetic biomarker of exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Multivariable Poisson regressions were used to test the association between the smoking exposures and total number of deletions. Deletion burden varied by subtype, with a lower frequency in high-hyperdiploid and higher frequency in ETV6-RUNX1 fusion ALL. The total number of deletions per case was positively associated with tobacco smoke exposure, in particular for maternal ever-smoking (ratio of means, RM, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.59), maternal smoking during pregnancy (RM, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12-1.94), and during breastfeeding (RM, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.48-3.02). The magnitude of association with maternal ever-smoking was stronger in male children compared with females (Pinteraction = 0.04). The total number of deletions was also associated with DNA methylation at the AHRR epigenetic biomarker (RM, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02-1.69). Our results suggest that prenatal and early-life tobacco smoke exposure increase the frequency of somatic deletions in children who develop ALL. Cancer Res; 77(7); 1674-83.

However, a causal relationship between Mcl-1 degradation and anticancer drug responses has not been directly established, especially in solid tumor cells where Mcl-1 inhibition alone is insufficient to trigger cell death. In this study, we present evidence that Mcl-1 participates directly in determining effective therapeutic responses in colon cancer cells. In this setting, Mcl-1 degradation was induced by a variety of multikinase inhibitor drugs, where it relied upon GSK3beta phosphorylation and FBW7-dependent ubiquitination. Specific blockade by genetic knock-in (KI) abolished apoptotic responses and conferred resistance to kinase inhibitors. Mcl-1-KI also suppressed the antiangiogenic and anti-hypoxic effects of kinase inhibitors in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, these same inhibitors also induced the BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein PUMA, which is required for apoptosis. Degradation-resistant Mcl-1 bound and sequestered PUMA from other prosurvival proteins to maintain cell survival, which was abolished by small-molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors. Our findings establish a pivotal role for Mcl-1 degradation in the response of colon cancer cells to targeted therapeutics, and they provide a useful rational platform to develop Mcl-1-targeting agents that can overcome drug resistance.

Microvesicles released by cancer cells may incorporate diverse biomolecules (e.g., active lipids, proteins, and RNA), which can be delivered and internalized by recipient cells, potentially altering the gene expression of recipient cells and eventually impacting disease progression. Leukemia in vitro model systems were used to investigate microvesicles as vehicles of protein-coding messages. Several leukemic cells (K562, LAMA-87, TOM-1, REH, and SHI-1), each carrying a specific chromosomal translocation, were analyzed. In the leukemic cells, these chromosomal translocations are transcribed into oncogenic fusion transcripts and the transfer of these transcripts was monitored from leukemic cells to microvesicles for each of the cell lines. Microarray gene expression profiling was performed to compare transcriptomes of K562-derived microvesicles and parental K562 cells. The data show that oncogenic BCR-ABL1 transcripts and mRNAs related to basic functions of leukemic cells were included in microvesicles. Further analysis of microvesicles cargo revealed a remarkable enrichment of transcripts related to cell membrane activity, cell surface receptors, and extracellular communication when compared with parental K562 cells. Finally, coculturing of healthy mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with K562-derived microvesicles displayed the transfer of the oncogenic message, and confirmed the increase of target cell proliferation as a function of microvesicle dosage.Implications: This study provides novel insight into tumor-derived microvesicles as carriers of oncogenic protein-coding messages that can potentially jeopardize cell-directed therapy, and spread to other compartments of the body.

In this study, we investigated the role of fumarate hydratase (Fh1), a key component of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and cytosolic fumarate metabolism, in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. Hematopoiesis-specific Fh1 deletion (resulting in endogenous fumarate accumulation and a genetic TCA cycle block reflected by decreased maximal mitochondrial respiration) caused lethal fetal liver hematopoietic defects and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) failure. Reexpression of extramitochondrial Fh1 (which normalized fumarate levels but not maximal mitochondrial respiration) rescued these phenotypes, indicating the causal role of cellular fumarate accumulation. However, HSCs lacking mitochondrial Fh1 (which had normal fumarate levels but defective maximal mitochondrial respiration) failed to self-renew and displayed lymphoid differentiation defects. In contrast, leukemia-initiating cells lacking mitochondrial Fh1 efficiently propagated Meis1/Hoxa9-driven leukemia. Thus, we identify novel roles for fumarate metabolism in HSC maintenance and hematopoietic differentiation and reveal a differential requirement for mitochondrial Fh1 in normal hematopoiesis and

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 130 children with newly-diagnosed childhood ALL. Infections occurring during the induction chemotherapy, pathogenic strains, and drug-resistance spectrum were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence rate of clinical infection and/or microbial infection reached 76.2%. The lungs were the most common infection site (46.2%). The children with severe infection accounted for 52.3%, among whom 60 had pulmonary infection and/or 21 had sepsis. A total of 50 pathogenic strains were detected, which consisted of 29 bacterial strains and 21 fungal strains. Of all the children, 28.5% experienced infections caused by at least one microbe. Among the 29 bacterial strains, there were 19 (65.5%) Gram-negative bacteria and 10 (34.5%) Gram-positive bacteria. The most common Gram-negative bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were 100% sensitive to imipenem. The most common Gram-positive bacterium was Streptococcus viridans, which was 100% sensitive to vancomycin. The infections caused by fungi accounted for 16.2%, with Candida albicans as the most common fungus. Compared with those with non-severe infections, the children with severe infections had a significantly shorter time to the occurrence of agranulocytosis, a significantly longer duration of agranulocytosis, significantly higher incidence of fever and C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and a significantly longer length of hospital stay (P<0.05).

However, data on risk factors for infections are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hemoplasma spp. infections in cats in Southern Germany and to assess risk factors associated with infection. RESULTS: DNA was extracted from blood samples of 479 cats presented to different veterinary hospitals for various reasons. DNA of feline hemoplasmas was amplified by use of a previously reported PCR assay. Direct sequencing was used to confirm all purified amplicons and compared to hemoplasma sequences reported in GenBank. Results were evaluated in relation to the age, sex, housing conditions, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) status of the cats. The overall hemoplasma prevalence rate was 9.4% (45/479; 95% CI: 7.08-12.36). 'Candidatus Mycoplasma (M.) haemominutum' (Mhm) DNA was amplified from 42 samples, M. haemofelis from 2, and M. haemocanis from 1 sample. There was a significantly higher risk of hemoplasma infection in cats from multi-cat households, in outdoor cats, as well as in cats with FIVinfection and in cats with abortive FeLV infection, but not in cats with progressive or regressive FeLV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Mhm infection is common in cats in Southern Germany. Higher prevalence in multi-cat households and associations with FeLV infection likely reflect the potential for direct transmission amongst cats.

Its prevalence varies widely across different populations and geographic regions. A population-based study in the city of Salvador, located in the Northeast region of Brazil, showed an overall prevalence of HTLV-1 seropositivity of 1.7%. Blood borne virus infections are recognized as important hazards for patients and staff in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) units but most studies focus on hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses. There are scarce data about HTLV-1 infection in the MHD population. We aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors for HTLV-1 infection among MHD patients in the city of Salvador-Bahia, Brazil. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center, cross-sectional study nested in a prospective cohort of MHD patients enrolled from four outpatient clinics. HTLV-1 screening was performed with ELISA and positive cases were confirmed by Western Blot. Factors associated with HTLV-1 seropositivity were identified by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: 605 patients were included in the study. The overall prevalence of HTLV-1 infection was 2.48% (15/605), which was similar to that of hepatitis B [1.98% (12/605)] and C [3.14% (19/605)] viruses in our sample. HTLV-1 seropositivity was positively associated with age [prevalence odds ratio (POR) 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.08], unmarried status (POR 3.65; 95% CI 1.13-11.65), and history of blood transfusion (POR 3.35; 95% CI 1.01-11.13). CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in a sample of MHD patients was similar to that of other viral infections, such as hepatitis B and C. Our data revealed that MHD patients who are older, unmarried or who have received blood transfusions are at higher risk for HTLV-1 infection.",,"['Santos, Rilma F S', 'Conceicao, Gildasio C', 'Martins, Marcia S', 'Kraychete, Angiolina', 'Penalva, Maria A C', 'Carvalho, Edgar M', 'Lopes, Antonio Alberto', 'Rocha, Paulo Novis']","['Santos RF', 'Conceicao GC', 'Martins MS', 'Kraychete A', 'Penalva MA', 'Carvalho EM', 'Lopes AA', 'Rocha PN']",,"['Division of Nephrology, Hospital Geral Roberto Santos, Salvador, Brazil. rilma_santos@yahoo.com.br.', 'Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil. rilma_santos@yahoo.com.br.', 'Department of Biochemistry, APAE, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Unit of Clinical Epidemiology and Evidence Based Medicine of the Professor Edgard Santos University Hospital, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Unit of Clinical Epidemiology and Evidence Based Medicine of the Professor Edgard Santos University Hospital, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Diretoria Medica da Clinica Nephron-Itapua, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Centro de Pesquisas Goncalo Moniz (Fiocruz-Ba), Salvador, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Diagnostic Support, Medical School of Bahia, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Unit of Clinical Epidemiology and Evidence Based Medicine of the Professor Edgard Santos University Hospital, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Diagnostic Support, Medical School of Bahia, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Diagnostic Support, Medical School of Bahia, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,BMC Nephrol,BMC nephrology,100967793,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Causality', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*epidemiology/*therapy/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Renal Dialysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5312583,['NOTNLM'],"['Blood Transfusion', 'Chronic Kidney 47 Disease', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type 1']",,2017/02/17 06:00,2018/02/22 06:00,['2017/02/17 06:00'],"['2016/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12882-017-0484-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12882-017-0484-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Nephrol. 2017 Feb 15;18(1):64. doi: 10.1186/s12882-017-0484-y.,20170215,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the basis of lineage-specific alterations, we analyzed global DNA damage in primary B cell precursors expressing leukemia-inducing oncogenes by ChIP-seq. We identified more than 1,000 sensitive regions, of which B lineage-specific genes constitute the most prominent targets. Identified hotspots at B lineage genes relate to DNA-DSBs, affect genes that harbor genomic lesions in human leukemia, and associate with ectopic deletion in successfully transformed cells. Furthermore, we show that most identified regions overlap with gene bodies of highly expressed genes and that induction of a myeloid lineage phenotype in transformed B cell precursors promotes de novo DNA damage at myeloid loci. Hence, we demonstrate that lineage-specific transcription predisposes lineage-specific genes in transformed B cell precursors to DNA damage, which is likely to promote the frequent alteration of lineage-specific genes in human leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s).

We explored whether residential proximity to oil and gas development was associated with risk for hematologic cancers using a registry-based case-control study design. METHODS: Participants were 0-24 years old, living in rural Colorado, and diagnosed with cancer between 2001-2013. For each child in our study, we calculated inverse distance weighted (IDW) oil and gas well counts within a 16.1-kilometer radius of residence at cancer diagnosis for each year in a 10 year latency period to estimate density of oil and gas development. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, race, gender, income, and elevation was used to estimate associations across IDW well count tertiles for 87 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases and 50 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases, compared to 528 controls with non-hematologic cancers. FINDINGS: Overall, ALL cases 0-24 years old were more likely to live in the highest IDW well count tertiles compared to controls, but findings differed substantially by age. For ages 5-24, ALL cases were 4.3 times as likely to live in the highest tertile, compared to controls (95% CI: 1.1 to 16), with a monotonic increase in risk across tertiles (trend p-value = 0.035). Further adjustment for year of diagnosis increased the association. No association was found between ALL for children aged 0-4 years or NHL and IDW well counts. While our study benefited from the ability to select cases and controls from the same population, use of cancer-controls, the limited number of ALL and NHL cases, and aggregation of ages into five year ranges, may have biased our associations toward the null. In addition, absence of information on O&G well activities, meteorology, and topography likely reduced temporal and spatial specificity in IDW well counts. CONCLUSION: Because oil and gas development has potential to expose a large population to known hematologic carcinogens, further study is clearly needed to substantiate both our positive and negative findings. Future studies should incorporate information on oil and gas development activities and production levels, as well as levels of specific pollutants of interest (e.g. benzene) near homes, schools, and day care centers; provide age-specific residential histories; compare cases to controls without cancer; and address other potential confounders, and environmental stressors.",,"['McKenzie, Lisa M', 'Allshouse, William B', 'Byers, Tim E', 'Bedrick, Edward J', 'Serdar, Berrin', 'Adgate, John L']","['McKenzie LM', 'Allshouse WB', 'Byers TE', 'Bedrick EJ', 'Serdar B', 'Adgate JL']",,"['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado Anschutz Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado Anschutz Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado Anschutz Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Epidemiology and Biostatistics Department, Mel &Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, United States of America.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado Anschutz Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado Anschutz Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colorado/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Oil and Gas Industry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology']",PMC5310851,,,,2017/02/16 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/02/16 06:00'],"['2016/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0170423 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-36074 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Feb 15;12(2):e0170423. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0170423. eCollection 2017.,20170215,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, through off-target activity, AID has a much broader effect on genomic instability by initiating oncogenic chromosomal translocations and mutations involved in the development and progression of lymphoma. AID expression is tightly regulated in B cells and its overexpression leads to enhanced genomic instability and lymphoma formation. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta) pathway regulates AID by suppressing its expression in B cells. Drugs for leukaemia or lymphoma therapy such as idelalisib, duvelisib and ibrutinib block PI3Kdelta activity directly or indirectly, potentially affecting AID expression and, consequently, genomic stability in B cells. Here we show that treatment of primary mouse B cells with idelalisib or duvelisib, and to a lesser extent ibrutinib, enhanced the expression of AID and increased somatic hypermutation and chromosomal translocation frequency to the Igh locus and to several AID off-target sites. Both of these effects were completely abrogated in AID-deficient B cells. PI3Kdelta inhibitors or ibrutinib increased the formation of AID-dependent tumours in pristane-treated mice. Consistently, PI3Kdelta inhibitors enhanced AID expression and translocation frequency to IGH and AID off-target sites in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, and patients treated with idelalisib, but not ibrutinib, showed increased somatic hypermutation in AID off-targets. In summary, we show that PI3Kdelta or Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors increase genomic instability in normal and neoplastic B cells by an AID-dependent mechanism. This effect should be carefully considered, as such inhibitors can be administered to patients for years.",,"['Compagno, Mara', 'Wang, Qi', 'Pighi, Chiara', 'Cheong, Taek-Chin', 'Meng, Fei-Long',

However, the rather low systemic bioavailability resulted from its poor solubility in water and fast metabolism/excretion in vivo has hampered its applications in cancer therapy. To increase the aqueous solubility of curcumin while retaining the stability in blood circulation, here we report curcumin-loaded copolymer micelles with excellent in vitro and in vivo stability and antitumor efficacy. The two copolymers used for comparison were methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (mPEG-PCL) and N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-l-phenylalanine end-capped mPEG-PCL (mPEG-PCL-Phe(Boc)). In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation against human pancreatic SW1990 cell line showed that the delivery of curcumin in mPEG-PCL-Phe(Boc) micelles to cancer cells was efficient and dosage-dependent. The pharmacokinetics in ICR mice indicated that intravenous (i.v.) administration of curcumin/mPEG-PCL-Phe(Boc) micelles could retain curcumin in plasma much better than curcumin/mPEG-PCL micelles. Biodistribution results in Sprague-Dawley rats also showed higher uptake and slower elimination of curcumin into liver, lung, kidney, and brain, and lower uptake into heart and spleen of mPEG-PCL-Phe(Boc) micelles, as compared with mPEG-PCL micelles. Further in vivo efficacy evaluation in multidrug-resistant human erythroleukemia K562/ADR xenograft model revealed that i.v. administration of curcumin-loaded mPEG-PCL-Phe(Boc) micelles significantly delayed tumor growth, which was attributed to the improved stability of curcumin in the bloodstream and increased systemic bioavailability. The mPEG-PCL-Phe(Boc) micellar system is promising in overcoming the key challenge of curcumin's to promote its applications in cancer therapy.",,"['Gong, Feirong', 'Chen, Dan', 'Teng, Xin', 'Ge, Junhua', 'Ning, Xianfeng', 'Shen, Ya-Ling', 'Li, Jian', 'Wang, Shanfeng']","['Gong F', 'Chen D', 'Teng X', 'Ge J', 'Ning X', 'Shen YL', 'Li J', 'Wang S']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9790-5970'],"['Key Laboratory for Ultrafine Materials of Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center for Biomanufacturing Technology, School of Biotechnology, East China University of Science and Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Ultrafine Materials of Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University , Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University , Qingdao 266003, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center for Biomanufacturing Technology, School of Biotechnology, East China University of Science and Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University , Qingdao 266003, China.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The University of Tennessee , Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Lactones)', '0 (Polyesters)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (methoxy poly(ethylene glycol-co-epsilon-caprolactone))', '0 (poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(epsilon-caprolactone))', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/*chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lactones/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Polyesters/chemistry', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Polymers/*chemistry', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*antitumor', '*blood-stable', '*curcumin', '*polymer micelles']",,2017/02/16 06:00,2018/05/01 06:00,['2017/02/16 06:00'],"['2017/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b01171 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2017 Aug 7;14(8):2585-2594. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b01171.

However, less is known about the possible familial associations of melanoma with other discordant cancers. A risk for discordant cancer may provide useful information about shared genetic and environmental risk factors and it may be relevant background data in clinical genetic counseling. Using the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, we assessed the relative risk (RR) for any cancer in families with increasing numbers of first-degree relatives diagnosed with melanoma, including multiple melanoma, and in reverse order RR for melanoma in families of multiple discordant cancers. Close to 9% of melanoma was familial; among these 92% were in 2-case families and 8% in families with 3 cases or more. Cancers that were associated with melanoma, in at least two independent analyses, included breast, prostate, colorectal, skin and nervous system cancers. Other associations included cancer of unknown primary, acute myeloid leukemia/myelofibrosis and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia/myeloma. Significant results, which appear biologically plausible, were also obtained for rare nasal melanoma and mesothelioma.

Predisposing factors to IFI-FF are multiple and should be stratified. The objective of this study was to identify key risk factors for IFI-FF in onco-haematological patients in different clinical settings. METHODS: Prospective national Delphi study. Risk factors for IFI-FF in patients with onco-haematological diseases were identified by a systematic review of the literature. An anonymous survey was sent by e-mail to a panel of experts. A key risk factor was defined when at least 70% of the surveyed participants assigned a ""maximal"" or ""high"" risk. RESULTS: In allogenic stem cell transplantation, 18 of the 42 risk factors analyzed were classified as key risk factors, including neutropenia, previous IFI-FF, grade III/IV acute or extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), umbilical cord blood transplantation, HLA mismatching transplantation, graft failure, absence of HEPA filters, absence of laminar air flow, diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia, haploidentical transplantation, anti-TNF-alpha drugs, alemtuzumab, anti-thymocyte globulin, immunosuppressive prophylaxis for GVHD, lymphocytopenia, cytomegalovirus infection, and proximity to construction areas. In acute leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AL/MDS), 7 of 25 risk factors were defined as key risk factors, including neutropenia, consolidation therapy without response, induction therapy, antifungal prophylaxis with azoles, proximity to construction areas, and absence of HEPA filters. In lymphoma/multiple myeloma (MM), the five key risk factors among 21 analyzed were use of steroids, neutropenia, progressive disease, anti-CD52 therapies, and proximity to construction areas. CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi method was useful for the classification and stratification of risk factors for IFI-FF in patients with onco-haematological diseases.

Because exosomal miR-140-3p is considered to have an inflammation-associated biological function in airway smooth muscle cells and targets Myomarker muscle-specific transmembrane protein, it appears that its overexpression in circulating exosomal miR-140-3p may have some role in the mechanism underlying self-limited musculoskeletal pain.",,"['Asano, Michiyo', 'Umezu, Tomohiro', 'Katagiri, Seiichiro', 'Kobayashi, Chiaki', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Gotoh, Moritaka', 'Ando, Keiko', 'Okabe, Seiichi', 'Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Asano M', 'Umezu T', 'Katagiri S', 'Kobayashi C', 'Tauchi T', 'Gotoh M', 'Ando K', 'Okabe S', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Wytemaweg 80, 3015 CN, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, 160-0023, Tokyo, Japan. ohyashik@rr.iij4u.or.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn140 microRNA, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Exosomes/chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*complications', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood/*physiology', 'Musculoskeletal Pain/*blood', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Up-Regulation', 'Withholding Treatment']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Discontinuation of TKIs', 'Exosomes', 'Musculoskeletal pain', 'miRNA-140-3p']",,2017/02/16 06:00,2017/04/27 06:00,['2017/02/16 06:00'],"['2016/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2199-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2199-z [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Apr;105(4):419-422. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2199-z.

It is critical to diagnose cytopenias from these secondary complications of CLL accurately, since prognosis and therapy are substantially different from patients who have cytopenias due to extensive bone marrow infiltration by CLL. The pathogenesis of autoimmune cytopenias in CLL is complex; and it involves antigen presentation by CLL cells to polyclonal B cells resulting in production of autoantibody, and alteration of the T cell milieu tilting the balance in favor of an autoimmune response. Traditional therapy of autoimmune complications in CLL consists of immunosuppression with corticosteroids and/or anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. In patients who have a suboptimal response, treating the underlying CLL is generally effective in ameliorating secondary cytopenias. Although novel oral therapies such as ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax have been shown to be extremely effective in the management of CLL, prospective data from larger numbers of patients with longer follow-up are needed prior to recommending their routine use in the management of autoimmune cytopenias in CLL.",,"['Tsang, Mazie', 'Parikh, Sameer A']","['Tsang M', 'Parikh SA']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. parikh.sameer@mayo.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Agranulocytosis/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology']",PMC5420315,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autoimmune cytopenias', '*Autoimmune hemolytic anemia', '*Immune thrombocytopenia', '*Pure red cell aplasia', '*Small lymphocytic lymphoma']",,2017/02/16 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2017/02/16 06:00'],"['2017/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-017-0366-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-017-0366-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2017 Feb;12(1):29-38. doi: 10.1007/s11899-017-0366-1.,,,['K12 CA090628/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS852550'],,,,,,,,,

Apart from ALL and NHL further indications of ASNASE are preclinically and clinically evaluated. METHODS: We reviewed ASNASE literature and especially focused on the mechanism of action, on biomarker, which determine ASNASE sensitivity and resistance, and on ASNASE pharmacodynamics in vivo. RESULTS: More than 40 years after the clinical introduction of ASNASE its mechanism of action is yet not fully understood. Studies on asparagine synthetase (ASNS) as biomarker for ASNASE resistance are contradictory and complicated by methodological obstacles. The role of glutamine hydrolysis for ASNASE efficacy is still debated, other mechanisms are possibly not yet identified. In addition, individual pharmacokinetic/-dynamic relationships cannot be properly addressed because of methodological limitations. CONCLUSION: More sophisticated preclinical models and suitable methods for monitoring of ASNASE pharmacodynamics are urgently needed (1) to understand the mechanism of action, (2) to establish valid biomarkers for ASNASE sensitivity and resistance, (3) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics/-dynamics of ASNASEs in individual patients, and (4) to compare the bioequivalence of clinically established, as well as new ASNASE preparations.",,"['Lanvers-Kaminsky, Claudia']",['Lanvers-Kaminsky C'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-9764-8035'],"[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany. lanvers@uni-muenster.de.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Asparaginase', '*Asparagine synthetase', '*Drug resistance', '*Glutaminase', '*Pharmacodynamics']",,2017/02/16 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2017/02/16 06:00'],"['2016/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-016-3236-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-016-3236-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2017 Mar;79(3):439-450. doi: 10.1007/s00280-016-3236-y.

There were great differences in the anti-viability effect of resveratrol between different types of human cancer cells. While the inhibition of cell viability by resveratrol was marked in U937 and MOLT-4 leukemia cells, resveratrol moderately inhibited cell viability in MCF-7 breast, HepG2 liver, and A549 lung cancer cells, and the effect was slight on cell viability in Caco-2, HCT116, and SW480 colon cancer cells. Following resveratrol treatment, U937 and MOLT-4 markedly increased the population of late apoptotic cells but MCF-7 and HepG2 underwent apoptosis with an increased population of early apoptosis, and resveratrol-induced DNA fragmentation was observed only in leukemic cells. Activation of sirtuin 1 and adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase was not responsible for resveratrol-induced cancer cell death. Instead, resveratrol significantly reduced Akt activation with the downregulation of H-Ras, resulting in facilitation of Bax translocation to mitochondria in leukemic cells. This study suggests that resveratrol can induce apoptotic cell death in human leukemic cells to a greater extent than in human solid tumor cells via reducing Akt activation due to Ras downregulation.",,"['Takashina, Michinori', 'Inoue, Sayaka', 'Tomihara, Kei', 'Tomita, Kengo', 'Hattori, Kohshi', 'Zhao, Qing-Li', 'Suzuki, Tokiko', 'Noguchi, Makoto', 'Ohashi, Wakana', 'Hattori, Yuichi']","['Takashina M', 'Inoue S', 'Tomihara K', 'Tomita K', 'Hattori K', 'Zhao QL', 'Suzuki T', 'Noguchi M', 'Ohashi W', 'Hattori Y']",,"['Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Relief Center, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Sirtuin 1/metabolism', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,,,2017/02/16 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2017/02/16 06:00'],"['2016/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2017.3859 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2017 Mar;50(3):787-797. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2017.3859.

Historically, cytogenetic analysis has been a useful prognostic tool to classify patients into favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable prognostic risk groups. However, the intermediate-risk group, consisting predominantly of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), itself exhibits diverse clinical outcomes and requires further characterization to allow for more optimal treatment decision-making. The recent advances in clinical genomics have led to the recategorization of CN-AML into favorable or unfavorable subgroups. The relapsing nature of AML is thought to be due to clonal heterogeneity that includes founder or driver mutations present in the leukemic stem cell population. In this article, we summarize the clinical outcomes of relevant molecular mutations and their cooccurrences in CN-AML, including NPM1, FLT3(ITD), DNMT3A, NRAS, TET2, RUNX1, MLL(PTD), ASXL1, BCOR, PHF6, CEBPA(biallelic), IDH1, IDH2(R140), and IDH2(R170), with an emphasis on their relevance to the leukemic stem cell compartment.

This catastrophic genomic event, involved in tumorigenesis, is characterized by tens to hundreds of simultaneously acquired locally clustered rearrangements on one chromosome. We hypothesized that leukemias developing in individuals with Ataxia Telangiectasia, who are born with two mutated copies of the ATM gene, an essential guardian of genome stability, would show a higher prevalence of chromothripsis due to the associated defect in DNA double-strand break repair. Using whole-genome sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA sequencing, we characterized the genomic landscape of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) arising in patients with Ataxia Telangiectasia. We detected a high frequency of chromothriptic events in these tumors, specifically on acrocentric chromosomes, as compared with tumors from individuals with other types of DNA repair syndromes (27 cases total, 10 with Ataxia Telangiectasia). Our data suggest that the genomic landscape of Ataxia Telangiectasia ALL is clearly distinct from that of sporadic ALL. Mechanistically, short telomeres and compromised DNA damage response in cells of Ataxia Telangiectasia patients may be linked with frequent chromothripsis. Furthermore, we show that ATM loss is associated with increased chromothripsis prevalence in additional tumor entities.",,"['Ratnaparkhe, M', 'Hlevnjak, M', 'Kolb, T', 'Jauch, A', 'Maass, K K', 'Devens, F', 'Rode, A', 'Hovestadt, V', 'Korshunov, A', 'Pastorczak, A', 'Mlynarski, W', 'Sungalee, S', 'Korbel, J', 'Hoell, J', 'Fischer, U', 'Milde, T', 'Kramm, C', 'Nathrath, M', 'Chrzanowska, K', 'Tausch, E', 'Takagi, M', 'Taga, T', 'Constantini, S', 'Loeffen, J', 'Meijerink, J', 'Zielen, S', 'Gohring, G', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Maass, E', 'Siebert, R', 'Kunz, J', 'Kulozik, A E', 'Worst, B', 'Jones, D T', 'Pfister, S M', 'Zapatka, M', 'Lichter, P', 'Ernst, A']","['Ratnaparkhe M', 'Hlevnjak M', 'Kolb T', 'Jauch A', 'Maass KK', 'Devens F', 'Rode A', 'Hovestadt V', 'Korshunov A', 'Pastorczak A', 'Mlynarski W', 'Sungalee S', 'Korbel J', 'Hoell J', 'Fischer U', 'Milde T', 'Kramm C', 'Nathrath M', 'Chrzanowska K', 'Tausch E', 'Takagi M', 'Taga T', 'Constantini S', 'Loeffen J', 'Meijerink J', 'Zielen S', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Maass E', 'Siebert R', 'Kunz J', 'Kulozik AE', 'Worst B', 'Jones DT', 'Pfister SM', 'Zapatka M', 'Lichter P', 'Ernst A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7580-9184', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8287-5967']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), and Department of Neuropathology University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'EMBL Heidelberg, Genome Biology, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'EMBL Heidelberg, Genome Biology, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Pediatric Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University of Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Group Osteosarcoma, Pediatric Oncology Center, Department of Pediatrics, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Klinikum Kassel, Kassel, Germany.', ""Department of Medical Genetics, The Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warsaw, Poland."", 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Dana Children's Hospital, Tel-Aviv Medical Center, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."", ""Erasmus Medical Center -

METHODS: Patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for t-MDS/AML from 2003 to 2014 were reviewed to analyse their diagnostic features, details of antecedent disorder and treatment, approach to management and survival. RESULTS: 39 patients who developed t-MDS/AML were identified with incidence of 8.7%. Median age and gender distribution were similar to de novo MDS but t-MDS/AML patients had greater degree of cytopenia and adverse karyotypes. Time to development of t-MDS/AML was shortest for patients with antecedent haematological malignancy compared to solid tumours and autoimmune disorders (46, 85 and 109 months). Patients with prior acute leukaemia had the shortest latency and poor overall survival. Treatment options included best supportive care (56%), Azacitidine (31%) or intensive chemotherapy/allogeneic transplant (13%). Median OS of all patients was 14 months. Survival declined markedly after two years and 5-year OS was 13.8%. Longer survival was associated with blast count <5% at diagnosis, previous haematological disorder, lower risk IPSS-R and a normal karyotype. Four out of five patients who received intensive therapy/transplant remain alive with median OS of 14 months. Median OS of Azacitidine-treated group was 11 months. DISCUSSION: t-MDS/AML patients showed unique characteristics which influenced their treatment and outcomes. IPSS-R may be useful in risk-adapted treatment approaches and can predict outcomes. Survival remains poor but improved outcomes were seen with allogeneic transplantation.

During the post genomic era, high throughput genomic sequencing has advanced exponentially, leading to identification of countless cancer associated mutations with potential for targeted therapy. Mouse models of cancer serve as excellent tools to examine the functionality of gene mutations and their contribution to the malignant process. However, it remains unclear whether the genetic events that occur during transformation are similar in mice and humans. To address that, we chose several transgenic mouse models of hematopoietic malignancies and identified acquired mutations in these mice by means of targeted re-sequencing of known cancer-associated genes as well as whole exome sequencing. We found that mutations that are typically found in acute myeloid leukemia or T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients are also common in mouse models of the respective disease. Moreover, we found that the most frequent mutations found in a mouse model of lymphoma occur in a set of epigenetic modifier genes, implicating this pathway in the generation of lymphoma. These results demonstrate that genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) mimic the genetic evolution of human cancer and serve as excellent platforms for target discovery and validation.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Goldberg, Liat', 'Gough, Sheryl M', 'Lee, Fan', 'Dang, Christine', 'Walker, Robert L', 'Zhu, Yuelin J', 'Bilke, Sven', 'Pineda, Marbin', 'Onozawa, Masahiro', 'Jo Chung, Yang', 'Meltzer, Paul S', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Goldberg L', 'Gough SM', 'Lee F', 'Dang C', 'Walker RL', 'Zhu YJ', 'Bilke S', 'Pineda M', 'Onozawa M', 'Jo Chung Y', 'Meltzer PS', 'Aplan PD']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5686-9969'],"['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Center for Medical Education/Department of hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutation']",PMC5399546,,,,2017/02/15 06:00,2017/05/10 06:00,['2017/02/15 06:00'],"['2016/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22451 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2017 Jun;56(6):472-483. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22451.

With each cell division, telomeric repeats are lost because DNA polymerases are incapable to fully duplicate the very ends of linear chromosomes. Loss of repeats causes cell senescence, and apoptosis. Telomerase neutralizes loss of telomeric sequences by adding telomere repeats at the 3' telomeric overhang. Telomere biology is frequently associated with human cancer and dysfunctional telomeres have been proved to participate to genetic instability. This review covers the information on telomerase expression and genetic alterations in the most relevant types of hematological diseases. Telomere erosion hampers the capability of hematopoietic stem cells to effectively replicate, clinically resulting in bone marrow failure. Furthermore, telomerase mutations are genetic risk factors for the occurrence of some hematologic cancers. New discoveries in telomere structure and telomerase functions have led to an increasing interest in targeting telomeres and telomerase in anti-cancer therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AIMS: To study the effect of induction chemotherapy on coagulation parameters in pediatric ALL patients. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Thirty-seven newly diagnosed patients of ALL up to 18 years of age were evaluated along with 30 age- and sex-matched controls. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: At the time of diagnosis (day 0), various coagulation parameters were tested. These were sequentially analyzed on day 14 (after the completion of L-asparaginase doses) and on day 28 of therapy (after the completion of induction). Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, protein C (PC) activity, and protein S (PS) activity were done by a clot-based method. Antithrombin (AT) assay was performed by chromogenic method. D-dimer (D-DI), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) levels were assayed by ELISA method. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 17.0. RESULTS: No major change in PT and APTT was observed during chemotherapy; however, fibrinogen levels declined significantly (P = 0.04), following L-asparaginase treatment. D-DI levels were significantly raised at diagnosis (P < 0.001) and throughout induction therapy (P < 0.001). PC, PS, and AT were reduced in the initial part of induction, followed by a rise in the second half of therapy, reaching their respective baseline levels (P < 0.05). The tPA levels were significantly reduced in the patients at diagnosis and throughout therapy (P < 0.001). PAI-1 levels were comparable to controls at presentation and showed a rising trend during therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that both the malignant process and the drugs used in combined chemotherapy cause thrombin activation, decrease in natural inhibitors, and hypofibrinolysis, resulting in hypercoagulability. Thus, ALL per se is a hypercoagulable state and the prothrombotic condition at the time of diagnosis gets enhanced during induction chemotherapy.",,"['Sehgal, Shivali', 'Sharma, Sunita', 'Chandra, Jagdish', 'Nangia, Anita']","['Sehgal S', 'Sharma S', 'Chandra J', 'Nangia A']",,"[""Department of Pathology, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, New Delhi, India."", ""Department of Pathology, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, New Delhi, India."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, New Delhi, India."", ""Department of Pathology, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, New Delhi, India.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antithrombins)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antithrombins/metabolism', 'Blood Coagulation/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Thrombin/metabolism', 'Thrombophilia/*chemically induced']",,,,,2017/02/15 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2017/02/15 06:00'],"['2017/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2017_60_1_50_200029 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.200029 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2017 Jan-Mar;60(1):50-56. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.200029.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are diagnosed by either the presence of antigens of more than one lineage or by the presence of dual population of blasts belonging to two or more lineages. We highlight the clinicopathological, immunophenotype, and genetic data of a cohort (n = 14) of patients diagnosed and treated at our center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive cases of MPAL diagnosed in our flow cytometry laboratory from May 2012 to August 2015. These cases were diagnosed based on immunophenotyping of peripheral blood/bone marrow aspirates and morphology/genetics wherever available as per the World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 guideline. RESULTS: Among 628 consecutive acute leukemia (AL) cases diagnosed and evaluated during this period, we identified 14 (2.2%) patients with MPAL fulfilling WHO 2008/EGIL criteria for immunological characterizing of AL criteria. Majority of these were males (n = 8, male:female ratio 1.3:1) and adults (n = 11, 78.5%). The median age of this cohort was 41 years (range 2-80). These cases were further classified as: B/myeloid (n = 9), T/myeloid (n = 4), and B/T MPAL (n = 1). Cytogenetics was available in 12 out of 14 cases, out of which, three cases had normal karyotype, three with t(9;22)(q34;q11), and two cases with complex karyotype. We also came across a rare case of B + T lymphoid MPAL who had mixed-lineage leukemia gene t(v; 11q23) rearrangement. CONCLUSION: MPAL is a complex entity with heterogeneous clinical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular features. Multiparametric flowcytometry by using comprehensive antibody panels is a valuable tool for diagnosis. Subsequent cytogenetic and molecular analysis for further prognostic stratification and treatment modalities are important.",,"['Pawar, Ravikiran N', 'Banerjee, Sambhunath', 'Bramha, Subhajit', 'Krishnan, Shekhar', 'Bhattacharya, Arpita', 'Saha, Vaskar', 'Chakrapani, Anupam', 'Bhave, Saurabh', 'Chandy, Mammen', 'Nair, Reena', 'Parihar, Mayur', 'Arora, Neeraj', 'Mishra, D K']","['Pawar RN', 'Banerjee S', 'Bramha S', 'Krishnan S', 'Bhattacharya A', 'Saha V', 'Chakrapani A', 'Bhave S', 'Chandy M', 'Nair R', 'Parihar M', 'Arora N', 'Mishra DK']",,"['Department of Laboratory Haematology and Molecular Genetics, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Haematology and Molecular Genetics, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Haematology and Molecular Genetics, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Haematology and Cytognetics, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Haematology and Molecular Genetics, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Laboratory Haematology and Molecular Genetics, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2017/02/15 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2017/02/15 06:00'],"['2017/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2017_60_1_43_200057 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.200057 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2017 Jan-Mar;60(1):43-49. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.200057.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of IGVH mutations as well as the predominant gene usage shows geographical variations. However, there is no study from India addressing immunogenetics of CLL. In a first Indian study we document the immunogenetics of CLL in a large tertiary hospital. METHODS: We analyzed IGVH mutation status, VH gene usage, cytogenetic abnormalities using FISH, immunophenotyping data and correlated them with standard clinical variables in 84 patients of CLL. RESULTS: Advanced Rai stage (Stage 3/4) was seen in 45% of our patients, where as 13q deletion was the commonest clonal cytogenetic abnormality detected in 48.4% of the cases. IGVH unmutated cases (55.2%) showed higher proportion expressing CD38 and CD49d, a preferential usage for VH1 and VH3 families (55.2%), presentation at an advanced Rai stage (52.8%) as well as more frequent presence of p53 deletions. As compared to the IGVH mutated cases greater proportion of IGVH unmutated patients (70%) required treatment. However, there was no significant difference in the time to treatment between mutated and unmutated cases which can be attributed to relatively short median follow up of 10 months. CONCLUSION: To summarize, we have seen a higher proportion of IGVH unmutated patients in our cohort (55.2%). The commonly used VH genes in the Indian population are IGVH 2-5, IGVH 1-2 and IGVH 1-69. Longer clinical follow up and a larger cohort is necessary to confirm the prognostic value of IGVH mutation analysis in Indian Patients with CLL.",,"['Patkar, Nikhil', 'Rabade, Nikhil', 'Kadam, Pratibha Amare', 'Mishra, Falguni', 'Muranjan, Aditi', 'Tembhare, Prashant', 'Chaudhary, Shruti', 'Joshi, Swapnali', 'Jain, Hasmukh', 'Dangi, Uma', 'Bagal, Bhausaheb', 'Khattry, Navin', 'Menon, Hari', 'Gujral, Sumeet', 'Sengar, Manju', 'Subramanian, P G']","['Patkar N', 'Rabade N', 'Kadam PA', 'Mishra F', 'Muranjan A', 'Tembhare P', 'Chaudhary S', 'Joshi S', 'Jain H', 'Dangi U', 'Bagal B', 'Khattry N', 'Menon H', 'Gujral S', 'Sengar M', 'Subramanian PG']",,"['Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Cancer Cytogenetics, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genotype', 'Genotyping Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'India', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",,,,,2017/02/15 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2017/02/15 06:00'],"['2017/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2017_60_1_38_200051 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.200051 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2017 Jan-Mar;60(1):38-42. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.200051.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common cytogenetic abnormality associated with T-PLL is inv(14)(q11.2q32) involving TCL1, but other abnormalities also have been reported. In this study, we correlated cytogenetic abnormalities with clinical outcome in 97 T-PLL patients, including 66 men and 31 women with a median age of 63 years (range, 34-81). Twenty-seven patients had a normal karyotype (NK), one had two chromosomal aberrations, and 69 had a complex karyotype (CK). Patients with a CK had poorer overall survival (OS) than patients with a NK (P = .0016). In the CK group, the most common aberrations involved 14q (n = 45) and 8q (n = 38). Additional deletions of chromosomes 17p, 11q, 6q, 12p, 13q were observed frequently. No individual cytogenetic abnormality impacted OS. Patients with >/=5 aberrations had an OS of 11 months versus 22 months in patients with <5 aberrations (P = 0.0132). Fluorescence in situ hybridization for TCL1 successfully performed in 27 cases showed rearrangement in 8/10 (80%) NK versus 16/17 (94%) CK cases. OS of patients with TCL1 rearrangement and/or 14q aberrations was not significantly different from patients without TCL1 rearrangement and 14q aberrations (P = .3467). Patients with refractory disease showed worse OS in both the NK and CK groups (P = .0014 and P < .0001, respectively), compared with patients who achieved remission but then relapsed. Stem cell transplantation did not appear to improve OS regardless of karyotype complexity. In conclusion, patients with T-PLL often have a CK which is a poor prognostic factor, particularly in patients with >/=5 cytogenetic aberrations.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hu, Zhihong', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Fang, Lianghua', 'Sun, Yi', 'Tang, Zhenya', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Sun, Tsieh', 'Quesada, Andres E', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Pei, Lin', 'Lu, Xinyan']","['Hu Z', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Fang L', 'Sun Y', 'Tang Z', 'Tang G', 'Sun T', 'Quesada AE', 'Hu S', 'Wang SA', 'Pei L', 'Lu X']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8809-6729', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7333-7478']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,2017/02/15 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2017/02/15 06:00'],"['2016/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24679 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 May;92(5):441-447. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24679.

They have not previously been reported concurrently. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37 year old woman presented with painful enlarging leg mass. Biopsy of the mass was consistent with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Staging imaging revealed a PET avid anterior mediastinal lymph node. Excisional biopsy of this mass was consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Hybridization capture-based next-generation DNA sequencing did not reveal shared somatic tumor mutations. Germline analysis did not show identifiable aberrations of TP53 or other heritable cancer susceptibility genes.

Boolean networks are among the simplest of models, yet they have been shown to adequately model many of the complex dynamics of biological systems. In our recent work, we utilized a logic minimization approach to identify quality single variable targets for intervention from the state space of a Boolean network. However, as the number of variables in a network increases, the more likely it is that a successful intervention strategy will require multiple variables. Thus, for larger networks, such an approach is required in order to identify more complex intervention strategies while working within the limited view of the network's state space. Specifically, we address three primary challenges for the large network arena: the first challenge is how to consider many subsets of variables, the second is to design clear methods and measures to identify the best targets for intervention in a systematic way, and the third is to work with an intractable state space through sampling. RESULTS: We introduce a multiple variable intervention target called a template and show through simulation studies of random networks that these templates are able to identify top intervention targets in increasingly large Boolean networks. We first show that, when other methods show drastic loss in performance, template methods show no significant performance loss between fully explored and partially sampled Boolean state spaces. We also show that, when other methods show a complete inability to produce viable intervention targets in sampled Boolean state spaces, template methods maintain significantly consistent success rates even as state space sizes increase exponentially with larger networks. Finally, we show the utility of the template approach on a real-world Boolean network modeling T-LGL leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results demonstrate how template-based approaches now effectively take over for our previous single variable approaches and produce quality intervention targets in larger networks requiring sampled state spaces.",,"['Verdicchio, Michael P', 'Kim, Seungchan']","['Verdicchio MP', 'Kim S']",,"['Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, The Citadel, Charleston, 29409 SC USA.grid.421223.40000000121534843', 'Integrated Cancer Genomics Division, Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, 85004 AZ USA.grid.250942.80000000405073225']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,EURASIP J Bioinform Syst Biol,EURASIP journal on bioinformatics & systems biology,101263720,,,,PMC5270454,['NOTNLM'],"['Attractors', 'Boolean networks', 'Intervention', 'Leukemia', 'Logic minimization']",,2014/07/19 00:00,2014/07/19 00:01,['2017/02/15 06:00'],"['2014/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13637-014-0011-4 [doi]', '11 [pii]']",epublish,EURASIP J Bioinform Syst Biol. 2014 Jul 19;2014:11. doi: 10.1186/s13637-014-0011-4. eCollection 2014 Dec.,20140719,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the relative impact of aerobic and resistant training interventions on cytokine production remains poorly defined. In this study, we compared effects of dynamic and static load on cytokine plasma content in elite strength- and endurance-trained athletes vs. healthy untrained volunteers. The plasma cytokine content was measured before, immediately after, and 30 min post-exercise using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pedaling on a bicycle ergometer increased IL-6 and IL-8 content in the plasma of trained athletes by about 4- and 2-fold, respectively. In contrast to dynamic load, weightlifting had negligible impact on these parameters in strength exercise-trained athletes. Unlike IL-6 and IL-8, dynamic exercise had no impact on IL-15 and LIF, whereas static load increases the content of these cytokines by ~50%. Two-fold increment of IL-8 content seen in athletes subjected to dynamic exercise was absent in untrained individuals, whereas the ~50% increase in IL-15 triggered by static load in the plasma of weightlifting athletes was not registered in the control group. Thus, our results show the distinct impact of static and dynamic exercises on cytokine content in the plasma of trained athletes.

Metabolic alterations have been involved in tumor progression and attracted interest as a target for therapeutic intervention. However, few studies analyzed the adaptations of cellular metabolism in the context of FLT3/ITD mutation. Here, we report that FLT3/ITD causes a significant increase in aerobic glycolysis through AKT-mediated upregulation of mitochondrial hexokinase (HK2), and renders the leukemia cells highly dependent on glycolysis and sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of glycolytic activity. Inhibition of glycolysis preferentially causes severe ATP depletion and massive cell death in FLT3/ITD leukemia cells. Glycolytic inhibitors significantly enhances the cytotoxicity induced by FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Importantly, such combination provides substantial therapeutic benefit in a murine model bearing FLT3/ITD leukemia. Our study suggests that FLT3/ITD mutation promotes Warburg effect, and such metabolic alteration can be exploited to develop effective therapeutic strategy for treatment of AML with FLT3/ITD mutation via metabolic intervention.",,"['Ju, H-Q', 'Zhan, G', 'Huang, A', 'Sun, Y', 'Wen, S', 'Yang, J', 'Lu, W-H', 'Xu, R-H', 'Li, J', 'Li, Y', 'Garcia-Manero, G', 'Huang, P', 'Hu, Y']","['Ju HQ', 'Zhan G', 'Huang A', 'Sun Y', 'Wen S', 'Yang J', 'Lu WH', 'Xu RH', 'Li J', 'Li Y', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Huang P', 'Hu Y']",,"['Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (3-bromo-2-oxopropionate-1-propyl ester)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Brominated)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Propionates)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (hexokinase 2, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Glycolysis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Hexokinase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Brominated/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Sorafenib', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology']",PMC5629368,,,,2017/02/15 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/02/15 06:00'],"['2016/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu201745 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.45 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Oct;31(10):2143-2150. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.45.

Although currently used chemotherapy is capable of initially reducing the tumor burden producing a complete remission, most patients will ultimately relapse and will succumb to their disease. As such, new therapeutic strategies are needed. AML cells differentially expressed serotonin receptor type 1 (HTR1) compared with healthy blood cells and the most primitive hematopoietic fraction; in fact, HTR1B expression on AML patient samples correlated with clinical outcome. Inhibition of HTR1s activated the apoptosis program, induced differentiation and reduced the clonogenic capacity, while minimal effect was observed on healthy blood cells. In vivo regeneration capacity of primary AML samples was disrupted upon inhibition of HTR1. The self-renewal capacity remaining in AML cells upon in vivo treatment was severely reduced as demonstrated by serial transplantation. Thus, treatment with HTR1 antagonists showed antileukemia effect, especially anti-LSC activity while sparing healthy blood cells. Our results highlight the importance of HTR1 in leukemogenesis and LSC survival and identify this receptor family as a new target for therapy in AML with prognostic value.",,"['Etxabe, A', 'Lara-Castillo, M C', 'Cornet-Masana, J M', 'Banus-Mulet, A', 'Nomdedeu, M', 'Torrente, M A', 'Pratcorona, M', 'Diaz-Beya, M', 'Esteve, J', 'Risueno, R M']","['Etxabe A', 'Lara-Castillo MC', 'Cornet-Masana JM', 'Banus-Mulet A', 'Nomdedeu M', 'Torrente MA', 'Pratcorona M', 'Diaz-Beya M', 'Esteve J', 'Risueno RM']",,"['Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT1)', '0 (Serotonin Antagonists)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT1/*drug effects', 'Serotonin Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2017/02/15 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2017/02/15 06:00'],"['2016/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu201752 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.52 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Nov;31(11):2288-2302. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.52.

However, the factors involved in maintaining the persistence, function, and phenotype of the memory pool are undefined. Eomesodermin (Eomes) is required for the establishment of the memory pool. Here, we show that in T cells transitioning to memory, the expression of high levels of Eomes is not constitutive but rather requires a continuum of cell-intrinsic NFkappaB signaling. Failure to maintain NFkappaB signals after the peak of the response led to impaired Eomes expression and a defect in the maintenance of CD8 T-cell memory. Strikingly, we found that antigen receptor [T-cell receptor (TCR)] signaling regulates this process through expression of the NFkappaB-dependent kinase proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus-1 (PIM-1), which in turn regulates NFkappaB and Eomes. T cells defective in TCR-dependent NFkappaB signaling were impaired in late expression of Pim-1, Eomes, and CD8 memory. These defects were rescued when TCR-dependent NFkappaB signaling was restored. We also found that NFkappaB-Pim-1 signals were required at memory to maintain memory CD8 T-cell longevity, effector function, and Eomes expression.

These therapeutic benefits were associated with restoration of leukemic cell differentiation, and the normalization of hematopoiesis was derived from mutant cells. By contrast, combining AG-221 or 5-azacytidine with FLT3 inhibition resulted in a reduction in mutant allele burden, progressive recovery of normal hematopoiesis from non-mutant stem-progenitor cells, and reversal of dysregulated DNA methylation and transcriptional output. Together, our studies suggest combined targeting of signaling and epigenetic pathways can increase therapeutic response in AML.Significance: AMLs with mutations in TET2 or IDH2 are sensitive to epigenetic therapy through inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity by 5-azacytidine or inhibition of mutant IDH2 through AG-221.

In vitro studies have provided proof of concept for mutant IDH inhibition as a therapeutic approach. We report the discovery and characterization of AG-221, an orally available, selective, potent inhibitor of the mutant IDH2 enzyme. AG-221 suppressed 2HG production and induced cellular differentiation in primary human IDH2 mutation-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells ex vivo and in xenograft mouse models. AG-221 also provided a statistically significant survival benefit in an aggressive IDH2(R140Q)-mutant AML xenograft mouse model. These findings supported initiation of the ongoing clinical trials of AG-221 in patients with IDH2 mutation-positive advanced hematologic malignancies.Significance: Mutations in IDH1/2 are identified in approximately 20% of patients with AML and contribute to leukemia via a block in hematopoietic cell differentiation.

Second, we discuss the current evidence indicating that TGF-beta signaling has a dual function in disorders of the hematopoietic system.

We identified 70 adult B-ALL patients from three institutions and performed genome-wide analysis via single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays on DNA isolated from their initial diagnostic sample and, when available, relapse bone marrow specimens to identify recurring copy number alterations (CNA). As B-cell developmental genes play a crucial role in this leukemia, we assessed such for recurrent deletions in diagnostic and relapse samples. We confirmed previous findings that the most prevalent deletions of these genes occur in CDKN2A, IKZF1, and PAX5, with several others at lower frequencies. Of the 16 samples having paired diagnostic and relapse samples, 5 showed new deletions in these recurrent B-cell related genes and 8 showed abolishment. Deletion of EBF1 heralded a significant negative prognostic impact on relapse free survival in univariate and multivariate analyses. The combination of both a CDKN2A/B deletion and an IKZF1 alteration (26% of cases) also showed a trend toward predicting worse overall survival compared to having only one or neither of these deletions.

This study evaluated some probable predictors of metabolic syndrome (MS), such as leptin and adiponectin concentrations, the leptin/adiponectin ratio, insulin resistance, and adiposity, in a sample of child survivors of lymphoma and leukemia in Mexico City. METHODS: Fifty two children (leukemia n = 26, lymphoma n = 26), who were within the first 5 years after cessation of therapy, were considered as eligible to participate in the study. Testing included fasting insulin, glucose, adipokines and lipids; body fat mass was measured by DXA. The MS components were analyzed according to tertiles of adipokines, insulin resistance, and adiposity. Comparisons between continuous variables were performed according to the data distribution. The MS components were analyzed according to tertiles of adipokines, insulin resistance, and adiposity. With the purpose of assessing the risk of a present MS diagnosis, odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% IC) were obtained using logistic regression analysis according to the various metabolic markers. RESULTS: The median children age was 12.1 years, and the interval time from the completion of therapy to study enrollment was 4 years. Among the MS components, the prevalence of HDL-C low was most common (42%), followed by central obesity (29%). The HOMA-IR (OR 9.0, 95% CI 2.0; 41.1), body fat (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.6; 19.3), leptin level (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.6; 20.2) and leptin/adiponectin ratio (OR 9.4, 95% CI 2.0; 49.8) in the highest tertile, were predictive factors of developing MS; whereas the lowest tertile of adiponectin was associated with a protective effect but not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers such as HOMA-IR, leptin and leptin/adiponectin are associated with each of the components of the MS and with a heightened risk of suffering MS among children survivors of cancer. Given the close relationship between MS with risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, it is imperative to implement prevention measures in this population and especially in developing countries where these pathologies have become the leading cause of death.",,"['Barbosa-Cortes, Lourdes', 'Lopez-Alarcon, Mardia', 'Mejia-Arangure, Juan Manuel', 'Klunder-Klunder, Miguel', 'Del Carmen Rodriguez-Zepeda, Maria', 'Rivera-Marquez, Hugo', 'de la Vega-Martinez, Alan', 'Martin-Trejo, Jorge', 'Shum-Luis, Juan', 'Solis-Labastida, Karina', 'Lopez-Aguilar, Enrique', 'Matute-Gonzalez, Guadalupe', 'Bernaldez-Rios, Roberto']","['Barbosa-Cortes L', 'Lopez-Alarcon M', 'Mejia-Arangure JM', 'Klunder-Klunder M', 'Del Carmen Rodriguez-Zepeda M', 'Rivera-Marquez H', 'de la Vega-Martinez A', 'Martin-Trejo J', 'Shum-Luis J', 'Solis-Labastida K', 'Lopez-Aguilar E', 'Matute-Gonzalez G', 'Bernaldez-Rios R']",,"['Medical Nutrition Research Unit, 21st Century Pediatric Hospital, National Medical Center, MexicanInstitute of Social Security, Mexico City, Mexico. bcmariade@hotmail.com.', 'Medical Nutrition Research Unit, 21st Century Pediatric Hospital, National Medical Center, Mexican Institute of Social Security, Avenida Cuauhtemoc 330 Col.

The importance of these lesions in ALL has, until now, remained unclear. Here, by combining studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing and RNA sequencing, we identify a novel B-lymphoid program for transcriptional repression of glucose and energy supply. Our metabolic analyses revealed that PAX5 and IKZF1 enforce a state of chronic energy deprivation, resulting in constitutive activation of the energy-stress sensor AMPK. Dominant-negative mutants of PAX5 and IKZF1, however, relieved this glucose and energy restriction. In a transgenic pre-B ALL mouse model, the heterozygous deletion of Pax5 increased glucose uptake and ATP levels by more than 25-fold. Reconstitution of PAX5 and IKZF1 in samples from patients with pre-B ALL restored a non-permissive state and induced energy crisis and cell death. A CRISPR/Cas9-based screen of PAX5 and IKZF1 transcriptional targets identified the products of NR3C1 (encoding the glucocorticoid receptor), TXNIP (encoding a glucose-feedback sensor) and CNR2 (encoding a cannabinoid receptor) as central effectors of B-lymphoid restriction of glucose and energy supply. Notably, transport-independent lipophilic methyl-conjugates of pyruvate and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites bypassed the gatekeeper function of PAX5 and IKZF1 and readily enabled leukaemic transformation. Conversely, pharmacological TXNIP and CNR2 agonists and a small-molecule AMPK inhibitor strongly synergized with glucocorticoids, identifying TXNIP, CNR2 and AMPK as potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the empirical finding that glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of B-lymphoid but not myeloid malignancies. Thus, B-lymphoid transcription factors function as metabolic gatekeepers by limiting the amount of cellular ATP to levels that are insufficient for malignant transformation.",,"['Chan, Lai N', 'Chen, Zhengshan', 'Braas, Daniel', 'Lee, Jae-Woong', 'Xiao, Gang', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Cosgun, Kadriye Nehir', 'Hurtz, Christian', 'Shojaee, Seyedmehdi', 'Cazzaniga, Valeria', 'Schjerven, Hilde', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Pufall, Miles A', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Liu, Grace J', 'Milne, Thomas A', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Ross, Theodora S', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Isidro', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Yamamoto, Keith R', 'Dickins, Ross A', 'Graeber, Thomas G', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Chan LN', 'Chen Z', 'Braas D', 'Lee JW', 'Xiao G', 'Geng H', 'Cosgun KN', 'Hurtz C', 'Shojaee S', 'Cazzaniga V', 'Schjerven H', 'Ernst T', 'Hochhaus A', 'Kornblau SM', 'Konopleva M', 'Pufall MA', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Liu GJ', 'Milne TA', 'Koeffler HP', 'Ross TS', 'Sanchez-Garcia I', 'Borkhardt A', 'Yamamoto KR', 'Dickins RA', 'Graeber TG', 'Muschen M']",,"['Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute and City of Hope National Medical Center, Pasadena, California 91016, USA.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute and City of Hope National Medical Center, Pasadena, California 91016, USA.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, UCLA Metabolomics Center and Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute and City of Hope National Medical Center, Pasadena, California 91016, USA.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute and City of Hope National Medical Center, Pasadena, California 91016, USA.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute and City of Hope National Medical Center, Pasadena, California 91016, USA.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Hamatologie/Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Hamatologie/Onkologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, USA.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale S.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of smoking on survival and progression to advanced phases of disease. METHODS: Based on the data of the German CML Study IV, the authors analyzed the effect of smoking using a multivariate Cox model with the addition of the European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) long-term survival score variables of age, spleen size, thrombocytes, and peripheral blasts as well as sex, comorbidities, and type of treatment center. RESULTS: The 8-year survival probability was 87% for a nonsmoking patient and 83% for a patient who smoked. The authors noted a 2.08-times higher risk of death for smokers in comparison with nonsmokers and a 2.11-times higher cause-specific hazard of disease progression. An interaction between smoking and age was found in the model for survival. No significant difference with regard to molecular response was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Even when considering differences in socioeconomic status and lifestyle between patients who smoke and nonsmokers, the current analysis demonstrated that smoking also might affect disease biology. The results of the current study indicate that patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, in particular those aged <60 years, should be encouraged to quit smoking. Cancer 2017;123:2467-71.

Although the hypomethylating agent azacitidine prolongs survival among patients with higher risk (HR)-MDS compared with conventional care, no drug has been shown conclusively to prolong survival or delay progression to AML among patients with lower-risk MDS (LR-MDS). Lenalidomide is the drug with the most impressive clinical activity in the subset of anemic LR-MDS patients who harbor a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q-), where it leads to high rates of transfusion independence and cytogenetic responses. Furthermore, lenalidomide delays progression to AML and prolongs survival among responders. In this article, we review the recently recognized mechanisms of action of lenalidomide and discuss the most recent clinical data regarding its use in patients with both 5q- MDS as well as non-5q- MDS.

This is caused by a shift in expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family members. Pro-survival proteins B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-XL), BCL-2-related protein A1 (BFL-1) and myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1 (MCL-1) are upregulated by LN-residing T cells through CD40L interaction, presumably via nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling. Macrophages (Mphis) also reside in the LN, and are assumed to provide important supportive functions for CLL cells. However, if and how Mphis are able to induce survival is incompletely known. We first established that Mphis induced survival because of an exclusive upregulation of MCL-1. Next, we investigated the mechanism underlying MCL-1 induction by Mphis in comparison with CD40L. Genome-wide expression profiling of in vitro Mphi- and CD40L-stimulated CLL cells indicated activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-V-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which was confirmed in ex vivo CLL LN material. Inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling abrogated MCL-1 upregulation and survival by Mphis, as well as CD40 stimulation. MCL-1 can be regulated at multiple levels, and we established that AKT leads to increased MCL-1 translation, but does not affect MCL-1 transcription or protein stabilization. Furthermore, among Mphi-secreted factors that could activate AKT, we found that induction of MCL-1 and survival critically depended on C-C motif chemokine receptor-1 (CCR1). In conclusion, this study indicates that two distinct micro-environmental factors, CD40L and Mphis, signal via CCR1 to induce AKT activation resulting in translational stabilization of MCL-1, and hence can contribute to CLL cell survival.",,"['van Attekum, M H A', 'Terpstra, S', 'Slinger, E', 'von Lindern, M', 'Moerland, P D', 'Jongejan, A', 'Kater, A P', 'Eldering, E']","['van Attekum MHA', 'Terpstra S', 'Slinger E', 'von Lindern M', 'Moerland PD', 'Jongejan A', 'Kater AP', 'Eldering E']",,"['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematopoiesis, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Ccr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, CCR1)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'CD40 Ligand/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Receptors, CCR1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Transfection']",PMC5584520,,,,2017/02/14 06:00,2017/10/13 06:00,['2017/02/14 06:00'],"['2015/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016515 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.515 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Jun 29;36(26):3651-3660. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.515.

Results indicated that phosphorus deficiency decreased the growth performance of young grass carp. In addition, the results first demonstrated that compared with the optimal phosphorus level, phosphorus deficiency depressed the lysozyme (LZ) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities and the complement 3 (C3), C4 and immunoglobulin M (IgM) contents, and down-regulated the mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides, anti-inflammatory cytokines, inhibitor of kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) and target of rapamycin (TOR), whereas it up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65 and NF-kappaB p52 mRNA levels to decrease fish head kidney and spleen immune functions. Moreover, phosphorus deficiency up-regulated the mRNA levels of Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1a (Keap1a), Fas ligand (FasL), apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), caspase -2, -3, -7, -8 and -9, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), whereas it depressed the glutathione (GSH) contents and antioxidant enzymes activities, and down-regulated the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2), myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and tight junction complexes to attenuate fish head kidney and spleen structural integrity. In addition, phosphorus deficiency increased skin hemorrhage and lesions morbidity. Finally, based on the percent weight gain (PWG) and the ability to combat skin hemorrhage and lesions, the dietary available phosphorus requirements for young grass carp (254.56-898.23 g) were estimated to be 4.10 and 4.13 g/kg diet, respectively.

Alterations in DNA methylation and histone modifications are common manifestations of the disease. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is not an exception. Therefore, drugs that target epigenetic processes suggest an appealing strategy for APL treatment. In this study we tested the anti-leukemic activity of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) Belinostat (PXD101, (2E)-N-Hydroxy-3-[3-(phenylsulfamoyl)phenyl]prop-2-enamide), and histone methyltransferase inhibitor (HMTi) 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep, 5R-(4-amino-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-1-yl)-3-(hydroxymethyl)-3-cyclopentene-1S,2R -diol) combined with retinoic acid (RA) in APL cells NB4 and HL-60. We demonstrated that APL cell treatment with combinations of differentiation inductor RA, HDACi Belinostat and HMTi DZNep caused a depletion of leukemia cell growth and viability, initiated apoptosis and exaggerated RA induced granulocytic differentiation. Also an increased expression of transcription factors C/EBPepsilon and PPARgamma was demonstrated, while no significant reduction in C/EBPalpha gene level was detected. Furthermore, combined treatment depleted gene expression levels of EZH2 and SUZ12, especially in HL-60 cells, and diminished protein levels of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) components EZH2, SUZ12 and EED. In addition, our study has shown that Belinostat and DZNep together with RA caused a depletion in HDAC1 and HDAC2 protein levels, HDAC2 gene expression and increased hyperacetylation of histone H4 in both leukemia cell lines. Using ChIP method we also demonstrated the increased association of hyperacetylated histone H4 with the C/EBPalpha and C/EBPepsilon promoter regions in HL-60 cells. Summarizing, these findings indicate that combined treatment with RA, Belinostat and 3-Deazaneplanocin A is an effective epigenetic inducer for leukemia cell differentiation.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the practical informativeness of STR chimerism by integrating theoretical and analytical points. METHODS: Theoretical and practical informativess of 16 STR loci were evaluated from 1249 pairs of recipients and donors who were prepared for HSCT. RESULTS: Theoretical informativeness was influenced by genetic diversity including allele frequency and heterozygosity, and was higher in the unrelated HSCT group (90.5+/-5.3%) compared to the related HSCT group (66.2+/-4.4%). Practical informativeness was lower than theoretical (6.1+/-1.7%) because several STR loci were excluded due to stutter peaks and less reliable results, especially in type II-2 donor-recipient match pattern with no recipient-specific allele. We simulated an efficient STR combination for reliable chimerism analysis. Eight informative STR loci were required to analyze chimerism with at least one practically informative locus in the related HSCT group (D18S51, FGA, D2S1338, D13S317, D8S1179, D21S11, D16S539 and D7S820) while only three loci were needed in the unrelated group (D2S1338, FGA and D18S51). A minimum set of 2, 4 or 7 STR loci were required to provide at least 1, 3 or 5 practically informative loci in 95% of the unrelated HSCT group while 3, 8 or 12 loci were required in the related HSCT group. CONCLUSION: We deducted the practical informativeness of STR chimerism, identified the major influencing factors on the practical informativeness of each STR locus, and successfully simulated the efficient STR combination for reliable chimerism analysis.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, through transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of hematopoietic cells, we reveal that EVI1 overexpression alters cellular metabolism. A screen using pooled short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) identified the ATP-buffering, mitochondrial creatine kinase CKMT1 as necessary for survival of EVI1-expressing cells in subjects with EVI1-positive AML. EVI1 promotes CKMT1 expression by repressing the myeloid differentiation regulator RUNX1. Suppression of arginine-creatine metabolism by CKMT1-directed shRNAs or by the small molecule cyclocreatine selectively decreased the viability, promoted the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of human EVI1-positive cell lines, and prolonged survival in both orthotopic xenograft models and mouse models of primary AML. CKMT1 inhibition altered mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, an effect that was abrogated by phosphocreatine-mediated reactivation of the arginine-creatine pathway. Targeting CKMT1 is thus a promising therapeutic strategy for this EVI1-driven AML subtype that is highly resistant to current treatment regimens.",,"['Fenouille, Nina', 'Bassil, Christopher F',

Nephromegaly is a rare presentation of childhood ALL with hepatic mass being even rarer. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 3 year-old child with unilateral renal mass and hepatic mass lesion with normal blood counts, initially suspected to have metastatic Wilms tumor based on clinical, radiological and WT1 positivity on immunocytochemistry of renal mass. He was later diagnosed as ALL with peripheral blood flowcytometry and bone marrow examination. DISCUSSION: Renomegaly at presentation of acute leukemia is not necessarily due to leukemic infiltration and rarely leads to renal impairment. The radiological differential of such a renal mass includes both benign and malignant entities including metastasis. Over-expression of WT1 mRNA has been found in a number of solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is far from being diagnostic of Wilms tumor. Again, a small number of children with acute leukemia may have a deceptively normal complete blood count at presentation. Though, initial all (clinical, radiological, hematological, and immunocytological) parameters pointed towards a diagnosis of Wilms tumor in our case, the subsequent development of thrombocytopenia and lymphocytic leukocytosis prompted further investigation and final diagnosis of ALL. CONCLUSION: WT1 positivity is a known phenomenon in childhood ALL and undifferentiated lymphoblasts may be positive for WT1 and negative for Leucocyte common antigen.

To evaluate the relationship between steady-state through plasma concentration and clinical response in CML patients. The objectives of this study were to assess the variability in Imatinib pharmacokinetics and to explore the effects of several demographic and biological covariates on the disposition of Imatinib. METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on 170 plasma samples from 74 adult Iranian chronic myeloid leukemia patients. A population pharmacokinetics model was developed to evaluate the influence of covariates on clearance and volume of distribution. RESULTS: A one-compartment model with first-order absorption appropriately described the data, giving a mean (+/-SEM) clearance of 14.3l (+/-1.0) and a volume of distribution of 347 l (+/-62). Clearance was influenced by body weight, age and gender. By considering these covariates the interindividual variability decreased from 47% to 19%. A large proportion of the interindividual variability (19% of clearance and 45% of volume of distribution) remained unexplained by these demographic covariates. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: By considering morphological and biological covariates, a unique covariate model could be used to accurately describe Imatinib pharmacokinetics in our population and because of the pharmacokinetic variability of Imatinib and the reported relationships between its plasma concentration and efficacy and toxicity, the usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring as an aid to optimizing therapy should be further investigated.",,"['Ansari, Mehdi', 'Kalantary-Khandani, Behjat', 'Pardakhty, Abbas', 'Safavi, Moein', 'Mosavi, Nabi', 'Mohajeri, Ehsan']","['Ansari M', 'Kalantary-Khandani B', 'Pardakhty A', 'Safavi M', 'Mosavi N', 'Mohajeri E']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Pharmaceutics Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Kuwait,Gulf J Oncolog,The Gulf journal of oncology,101500911,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Iran', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Middle East', 'Population Surveillance']",,,,,2017/02/14 06:00,2018/10/16 06:00,['2017/02/14 06:00'],"['2016/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Gulf J Oncolog. 2016 Sep;1(22):26-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical factors associated with alloimmunization to the D antigen in RhD-negative oncology patients when they receive transfusion with RhD-positive red blood cells (RBCs) have not been well defined. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a 4-year, retrospective analysis identifying RhD-negative oncology patients who received RhD-positive RBCs and were not previously alloimmunized to the D antigen. Age, sex, race, ABO group, primary oncology diagnosis, and numbers of RhD-incompatible RBC transfusions were recorded. The association between antibody formation and clinical factors was studied. The incidence of alloanti-D was calculated from a subsequent antibody-detection test performed at least 28 days after receipt of the first transfusion of RhD-positive RBCs. RESULTS: In total, 545 RhD-negative oncology patients received 4295 RhD-positive RBC transfusions. Of these, 76 (14%) became alloimmunized to the D antigen. Diagnosis type was the only factor significantly associated with responder status. The logistic regression model indicated that patients who had myelodysplastic syndrome or solid malignancies were more likely to be responders than those who had acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: We measured a 14% sensitization rate to the D antigen in our RhD-negative oncology population. The rate of alloimmunization was higher in patients who had solid cancers (22.6%) or myelodysplastic syndrome (23%) compared with those who had other hematologic malignancies (7%).

One month later, he was admitted to our hospital because of headache and high blood pressure (194/108 mmHg). His urine test showed protein 3+ and occult blood 2+. His eGFR rapidly deteriorated from 45.6 to 28.5 after admission. MR angiography showed left renal artery stenosis. He thus underwent angioplasty of the left renal artery with a stent implantation. His renal function subsequently improved. Cardiovascular events such as PAOD (peripheral artery occlusive disease) during NIL treatment were recently reported. However, to date, only four cases including our present patient with renal artery stenosis associated with NIL have been reported. These observations suggest assessment of risk factors for cardiovascular events at the start of NIL and careful monitoring to be important during tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment of CML patients.",,"['Hatsuse, Mayumi', 'Daikoku, Yuka', 'Tamoto, Yuta', 'Uehara, Masahiro', 'Kitani, Takashi', 'Tamagaki, Keiichi', 'Fuchida, Shin-Ichi', 'Okano, Akira', 'Murakami, Satoshi', 'Shimazaki, Chihiro']","['Hatsuse M', 'Daikoku Y', 'Tamoto Y', 'Uehara M', 'Kitani T', 'Tamagaki K', 'Fuchida SI', 'Okano A', 'Murakami S', 'Shimazaki C']",,"['Department of Hematology, Japan Community Health care Organization, Kyoto Kuramaguchi Medical Center.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Angioplasty', 'Blood Pressure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Renal Artery Obstruction/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/therapy']",,,,,2017/02/14 06:00,2017/05/31 06:00,['2017/02/14 06:00'],"['2017/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.58.15 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2017;58(1):15-19. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.58.15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we will discuss the role of bone marrow evaluation and peripheral blood monitoring in the diagnosis, management, and follow up of AML patients. For patients with circulating blasts, it is reasonable to perform the necessary studies needed for diagnosis and risk stratification, including multiparametric flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular analysis, on a peripheral blood specimen. The day 14 marrow is used to document hypocellularity in response to induction chemotherapy, but it is unclear if that assessment is necessary as it often does not affect immediate management. Currently, response assessments performed at count recovery for evaluation of remission and measurable residual disease rely on bone marrow sampling. For monitoring of relapse, peripheral blood evaluation may be adequate, but the sensitivity of bone marrow testing is in some cases superior. While bone marrow evaluation can certainly be avoided in particular situations, this cumbersome and uncomfortable procedure currently remains the de facto standard for response assessment.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of MEG3, a lncRNA, in imatinib resistance and demonstrate its underlying mechanisms. RNAs were extracted from CML patients' peripheral blood cells and human leukemic K562 cells, and the expression of MEG3 was measured by RT-qPCR. Cell proliferation and cell apoptosis were evaluated. Western blotting was used to measure the protein expression of several multidrug resistant transporters. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine the binding between MEG3 and miR-21. Our results showed that MEG3 was significantly decreased in imatinib-resistant CML patients and imatinib-resistant K562 cells. Overexpression of MEG3 in imatinib-resistant K562 cells markedly decreased cell proliferation, increased cell apoptosis, reversed imatinib resistance, and reduced the expression of MRP1, MDR1, and ABCG2. Interestingly, MEG3 binds to miR-21. MEG3 and miR-21 were negatively correlated in CML patients. In addition, miR-21 mimics reversed the phenotype of MEG3-overexpression in imatinib-resistant K562 cells. Taken together, MEG3 is involved in imatinib resistance in CML and possibly contributes to imatinib resistance through regulating miR-21, and subsequent cell proliferation, apoptosis and expression of multidrug resistant transporters.",,"['Zhou, Xiangyu', 'Yuan, Ping', 'Liu, Qi', 'Liu, Zhiqiang']","['Zhou X', 'Yuan P', 'Liu Q', 'Liu Z']",,"['Department of Vascular and Thyroid, the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan 646000, China.', 'Department of Neurology, the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan 646000, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nanchong Central Hospital, Nanchong, Sichuan 637000, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77054, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Biomol Ther (Seoul),Biomolecules & therapeutics,101472832,,,,PMC5590792,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Drug resistance', 'Imatinib', 'MEG3', 'MiR-21']",,2017/02/14 06:00,2017/02/14 06:01,['2017/02/14 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/14 06:01 [medline]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['biomolther.2016.162 [pii]', '10.4062/biomolther.2016.162 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomol Ther (Seoul). 2017 Sep 1;25(5):490-496. doi: 10.4062/biomolther.2016.162.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GD1109 strain of ALV-J reportedly causes hemangioma (HE) and NX0101 reportedly causes myeloma (ML) in susceptible chickens. Temporal changes of both gga-let-7b and gga-let-7i expression in ALV-J infected chickens were observed in contrast to its counterpart of a non-infected negative control group of chickens (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) during the first 120 days post infection. Use of the web-based computational DIANA-mirPath software (available at http://microrna.gr/mirpath ), it was predicted that both gga-let-7b and gga-let-7i were involved in multiple pathways including signaling pathways, such as MAPK, TGF-beta, Notch, Wnt, mTOR, Cell cycle, P53 and Jak-STAT.

Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), a member of the B-cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) apoptosis family, is involved in liver fibrosis and is targeted by miR-29b via its 3'-UTR in cultured cell lines. We investigate the role of MCL-1 and miR-29b in primary intestinal fibroblasts and tissue from stricturing CD patients. Transfection of CD intestinal fibroblasts with pre-miR-29b resulted in a significant increase in the mRNA expression of MCL-1 isoforms [MCL-1Long (L)/Extra Short (ES) and MCL-1Short (S)], although MCL-1S was expressed at significantly lower levels. Western blotting predominantly detected the anti-apoptotic MCL-1L isoform, and immunofluorescence showed that staining was localised in discrete nuclear foci. Transfection with pre-miR-29b or anti-miR-29b resulted in a significant increase or decrease, respectively, in MCL-1L foci. CD fibroblasts treated with IL-6 and IL-8, inflammatory cytokines upstream of MCL-1, increased the total mass of MCL-1L-positive foci. Furthermore, transfection of intestinal fibroblasts with pre-miR-29b resulted in an increase in mRNA and protein levels of IL-6 and IL-8. Finally, immunohistochemistry showed reduced MCL-1 protein expression in fibrotic CD samples compared to non-stricturing controls. Together, our findings suggest that induction of MCL-1 by IL-6/IL-8 may surmount any direct down-regulation by miR-29b via its 3'-UTR. We propose that an anti-fibrotic miR-29b/IL-6 IL-8/MCL-1L axis may influence intestinal fibrosis in CD. In the future, therapeutic modulation of this pathway might contribute to the management of fibrosis in CD.",,"['Nijhuis, Anke', 'Curciarello, Renata', 'Mehta, Shameer', 'Feakins, Roger', 'Bishop, Cleo L', 'Lindsay, James O', 'Silver, Andrew']","['Nijhuis A', 'Curciarello R', 'Mehta S', 'Feakins R', 'Bishop CL', 'Lindsay JO', 'Silver A']",,"['Centre for Genomics and Child Health and National Centre for Bowel Research, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, 4 Newark St, Whitechapel, E1 2AT, London, UK.', 'Centre for Immunobiology, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, 4 Newark St, Whitechapel, E1 2AT, London, UK.', 'Centre for Genomics and Child Health and National Centre for Bowel Research, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, 4 Newark St, Whitechapel, E1 2AT, London, UK.', 'Department of Histopathology, The Royal London Hospital, London, UK.', 'Centre for Cell Biology and Cutaneous Research, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Immunobiology, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, 4 Newark St, Whitechapel, E1 2AT, London, UK. james.lindsay@bartshealth.nhs.uk.', 'Centre for Genomics and Child Health and National Centre for Bowel Research, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, 4 Newark St, Whitechapel, E1 2AT, London, UK. a.silver@qmul.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Crohn Disease/*genetics/*pathology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intestines/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",PMC5397660,['NOTNLM'],"[""*Crohn's disease"", '*Fibrosis', '*MCL-1', '*miR-29b', '*microRNA']",,2017/02/13 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/02/13 06:00'],"['2016/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00441-017-2576-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00441-017-2576-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2017 May;368(2):325-335. doi: 10.1007/s00441-017-2576-1.

However, the mechanisms by which Ikaros functions as a tumor suppressor in pre-B ALL remain poorly understood. Here, we analyzed a mouse model of BCR-ABL1(+) pre-B ALL together with a new model of inducible expression of wild-type Ikaros in IKZF1 mutant human BCR-ABL1(+) pre-B ALL. We performed integrated genome-wide chromatin and expression analyses and identified Ikaros target genes in mouse and human BCR-ABL1(+) pre-B ALL, revealing novel conserved gene pathways associated with Ikaros tumor suppressor function. Notably, genetic depletion of different Ikaros targets, including CTNND1 and the early hematopoietic cell surface marker CD34, resulted in reduced leukemic growth. Our results suggest that Ikaros mediates tumor suppressor function by enforcing proper developmental stage-specific expression of multiple genes through chromatin compaction at its target genes.",['(c) 2017 Schjerven et al.'],"['Schjerven, Hilde', 'Ayongaba, Etapong F', 'Aghajanirefah, Ali', 'McLaughlin, Jami', 'Cheng, Donghui', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Boyd, Joseph R', 'Eggesbo, Linn M', 'Lindeman, Ida', 'Heath, Jessica L', 'Park, Eugene', 'Witte, Owen N', 'Smale, Stephen T', 'Frietze, Seth', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Schjerven H', 'Ayongaba EF', 'Aghajanirefah A', 'McLaughlin J', 'Cheng D', 'Geng H', 'Boyd JR', 'Eggesbo LM', 'Lindeman I', 'Heath JL', 'Park E', 'Witte ON', 'Smale ST', 'Frietze S', 'Muschen M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9287-3375', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2960-9808', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8969-9676', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8343-2842', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1771-2242', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8432-5168', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4461-4533']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143 Hilde.Schjerven@ucsf.edu Seth.Frietze@med.uvm.edu.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Oslo, 0316 Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.', 'Department of Biochemistry and University of Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Oslo, 0316 Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Oslo, 0316 Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Molecular Biology Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Molecular Biology Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory and Radiation Science, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 Hilde.Schjerven@ucsf.edu Seth.Frietze@med.uvm.edu.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute and City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Pasadena, CA 91016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukosialin/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",PMC5339667,,,,2017/02/13 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/02/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20160049 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20160049 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2017 Mar 6;214(3):793-814. doi: 10.1084/jem.20160049.

To examine IKAROS function in this context, we have developed novel mouse models allowing reversible RNAi-based control of Ikaros expression in established B-ALL in vivo. Notably, leukemias driven by combined BCR-ABL1 expression and Ikaros suppression rapidly regress when endogenous Ikaros is restored, causing sustained disease remission or ablation. Comparison of transcriptional profiles accompanying dynamic Ikaros perturbation in murine B-ALL in vivo with two independent human B-ALL cohorts identified nine evolutionarily conserved IKAROS-repressed genes. Notably, high expression of six of these genes is associated with inferior event-free survival in both patient cohorts. Among them are EMP1, which was recently implicated in B-ALL proliferation and prednisolone resistance, and the novel target CTNND1, encoding P120-catenin. We demonstrate that elevated Ctnnd1 expression contributes to maintenance of murine B-ALL cells with compromised Ikaros function. These results suggest that IKZF1 alterations in B-ALL leads to induction of multiple genes associated with proliferation and treatment resistance, identifying potential new therapeutic targets for high-risk disease.",['(c) 2017 Witkowski et al.'],"['Witkowski, Matthew T', 'Hu, Yifang', 'Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Boer, Judith M', 'McKenzie, Mark D', 'Liu, Grace J', 'Le Grice, Oliver D', 'Tremblay, Cedric S', 'Ghisi, Margherita', 'Willson, Tracy A', 'Horstmann, Martin A', 'Aifantis, Iannis', 'Cimmino, Luisa', 'Frietze, Seth', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Dickins, Ross A']","['Witkowski MT', 'Hu Y', 'Roberts KG', 'Boer JM', 'McKenzie MD', 'Liu GJ', 'Le Grice OD', 'Tremblay CS', 'Ghisi M', 'Willson TA', 'Horstmann MA', 'Aifantis I', 'Cimmino L', 'Frietze S', 'den Boer ML', 'Mullighan CG', 'Smyth GK', 'Dickins RA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5019-0119', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8200-0052', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5557-769X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2396-776X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4833-7342', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8559-8862', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8729-6435', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5795-2921', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9221-2892', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4112-5304']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3004, Australia.', 'Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville 3010, Victoria, Australia.', 'Bioinformatics Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Victoria, Australia.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC -

However, the role of the HCT-CI after cord blood transplantation (CBT) has not been fully investigated. In this analysis, we sought to evaluate the predictive value of the HCT-CI in patients undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) CBT. Between 2006 and 2013, HCT-CI scores were prospectively tabulated for patients with hematologic malignancies sequentially enrolled on multicenter RIC CBT studies coordinated by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center: 151 patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 101), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 3), acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 24), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 8), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 3), and other hematologic malignancies (n = 12) underwent RIC CBT and were included. Two patients received a single CBT and the remaining 149 received a double CBT. All patients received cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Median HCT-CI for the whole group was 3 (range, 0 to 8). Using the HCT-CI categories of low (0), intermediate (1 or 2), and high risk (>3), there was no significant difference in TRM between the 3 groups. However, when the patients were divided into 2 groups, HCT-CI </= 3 or > 3, the incidence of TRM at 3 years after transplantation was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17 to 36) in the HCT-CI </= 3 group versus 50% (95% CI, 30 to 67) in the HCT-CI > 3 group (P = .01). Overall survival for patients with HCT-CI </= 3 was 40% (95% CI, 27 to 51) versus 29% in patients with HCT-CI >3 (95% CI, 12 to 48) (P = .08). Our study demonstrates that HCT-CI score > 3 is associated with an increased risk of TRM at 3 years after transplantation in patients undergoing RIC CBT. Because of the significant risk of TRM in patients with HCT-CI > 3 compared with risk for those with HCT-CI </= 3, patients with an HCT-CI score >3 should be counseled before undergoing RIC CBT.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The effect of the CGE on survival of relapsed allo-HCT recipients is not clear. The effect of previously received chemotherapy to induce CGE in this patient population has not been studied. The aims of our study are to (1) characterize the patterns of cytogenetic change in patients with myeloid neoplasms who relapsed after an allo-HCT, (2) evaluate the effect of CGE on survival, and (3) explore the association of CGE with previous chemotherapy (including the lines of salvage therapy, type of induction, and conditioning therapy). Of 49 patients with a myeloid malignancy (27 acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 19 myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]/myeloproliferative neoplasm [MPN], and 3 chronic myelogenous leukemia) who relapsed after an allo-HCT, CGE was observed in 25 (51%), whereas 24 patients had unchanged cytogenetic findings at relapse. The CGE group carried more cytogenetic abnormalities at original diagnosis. The most frequent cytogenetic change was the acquisition of 3 or more new chromosomal abnormalities followed by acquisition of unbalanced abnormalities, aneuploidy, and emergence of apparently new clones unrelated to the original clone. The CGE cohort had higher proportion of MDS and MPN and fewer patients with de novo AML. Disease risk assessment category showed a trend to higher frequency of high-risk patients in the CGE group, though the difference was not statistically significant. Time from diagnosis to transplantation and time from transplantation to relapse were not different between the CGE and non-CGE groups. CGE and non-CGE cohorts had similar exposures to salvage therapy and to induction chemotherapy, as well as similar conditioning regimens; thus, no particular type of chemotherapy emerged as a predisposing factor to CGE. CGE was associated with significantly shortened post-transplantation and postrelapse survival when compared with those of the non-CGE group (P = .004 and P < .001, respectively). Our results underscore the significance of CGE in progression of myeloid malignancies after an allo-HCT.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

After the first cycle, the overall response and the complete remission (CR) rates were 86.4% and 81.8%, respectively. CR was achieved in 90.9% of the normal karyotype group and in 80.0% of patients with unfavorable karyotypes at baseline. The median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival rates were 17 and 13 months, respectively, with a 2-year OS of 34.8%. The median OS of the patients who received >/=3 cycles of SC-MST was significantly longer than those who received only 1 or 2 cycles of treatment. The regimen was well tolerated with a 4-week mortality of 4.3%, and no GVHD was observed. The most common adverse events were hematologic toxicities.

Previously, we have shown a broad anticancer activity of LE which is, in contrast to the structurally related and clinically used anthracycline doxorubicin (Dx), only mildly affected by multidrug resistance-mediated drug efflux. In the present study, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity of landomycin E towards Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells were dissected focusing on the involvement of radical oxygen species (ROS). LE-induced apoptosis distinctly differed in several aspects from the one induced by Dx. Rapid generation of both extracellular and cell-derived hydrogen peroxide already at one hour drug exposure was observed in case of LE but not found before 24h for Dx. In contrast, Dx but not LE induced production of superoxide radicals. Mitochondrial damage, as revealed by JC-1 staining, was weakly enhanced already at 3h LE treatment and increased significantly with time. Accordingly, activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway initiator caspase-9 was not detectable before 12h exposure. In contrast, cleavage of the down-stream caspase substrate PARP-1 was clearly induced already at the three hour time point. Out of all caspases tested, only activation of effector caspase-7 was induced at this early time points paralleling the LE-induced oxidative burst. Accordingly, this massive cleavage of caspase-7 at early time points was inhibitable by the radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Additionally, only simultaneous inhibition of multiple caspases reduced LE-induced apoptosis. Specific scavengers of both H2O2 and OH(*) effectively decreased LE-induced ROS production, but only partially inhibited LE-induced apoptosis. In contrast, NAC efficiently blocked both parameters. Summarizing, rapid H2O2 generation and a complex caspase activation pattern contribute to the antileukemic effects of LE. As superoxide generation is considered as the main cardiotoxic mechanism of Dx, LE might represent a better tolerable drug candidate for further (pre)clinical development.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the decision-making remains controversial in some situations. To figure out the treatment choice, we retrospectively investigated 172 consecutive patients with primary AML who received auto- (n=46) or allo-SCT (n=126) from a single transplant center. Auto- and allo-SCT group demonstrated comparable overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.616, P=0.559, respectively). Cytogenetic classification and minimal residual disease (MRD) after one course of consolidation were identified as independent risk factors for DFS (hazard ratio (HR), 1.800; 95% CI, 1.172-2.763; P=0.007; HR, 2.042; 95%CI, 1.003-4.154; P=0.049; respectively). We subsequently found that auto- and allo-SCT offered comparable DFS to patients with favorable or intermediate risk and were tested MRD(neg) after one course of consolidation (P=0.270) otherwise auto-SCT were inferior due to increased risk of leukemia relapse. Our study indicated that the combination of cytogenetic classification and MRD monitoring correlated with outcome of auto- versus allo-SCT and might help the choice between the two types of SCT for adults with primary AML, which is of significance for patients with expected intermediate prognosis in the current scenario.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Earlier works using the ceramide analog, C6-ceramide, demonstrated that the antiestrogen tamoxifen, a first generation P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, blocked C6-ceramide glycosylation and magnified apoptotic responses. The present investigation was undertaken with the goal of discovering non-anti-estrogenic alternatives to tamoxifen that could be employed as adjuvants for improving the efficacy of ceramide-centric therapeutics in treatment of cancer. Herein we demonstrate that the tamoxifen metabolites, desmethyltamoxifen and didesmethyltamoxifen, and specific, high-affinity P-gp inhibitors, tariquidar and zosuquidar, synergistically enhanced C6-ceramide cytotoxicity in multidrug resistant HL-60/VCR acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, whereas the selective estrogen receptor antagonist, fulvestrant, was ineffective. Active C6-ceramide-adjuvant combinations elicited mitochondrial ROS production and cytochrome c release, and induced apoptosis. Cytotoxicity was mitigated by introduction of antioxidant. Effective adjuvants markedly inhibited C6-ceramide glycosylation as well as conversion to sphingomyelin. Active regimens were also effective in KG-1a cells, a leukemia stem cell-like line, and in LoVo human colorectal cancer cells, a solid tumor model. In summary, our work details discovery of the link between P-gp inhibitors and the regulation and potentiation of ceramide metabolism in a pro-apoptotic direction in cancer cells. Given the active properties of these adjuvants in synergizing with C6-ceramide, independent of drug resistance status, stemness, or cancer type, our results suggest that the C6-ceramide-containing regimens could provide alternative, promising therapeutic direction, in addition to finding novel, off-label applications for P-gp inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) has no effective therapy and high levels of cell surface transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) expression have been reported in ATLL by us and other groups. In this study, to develop a novel molecular-targeted therapy against TFR1 to modulate iron metabolism, we initially determined the expression pattern of several iron-related genes along with TFR1 and found that ATLL cells presented characteristic of an iron-deficiency state such as high expression of iron-regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) and low expression of its E3 ubiquitin-ligase, FBXL5. Therefore, we developed human IgG monoclonal antibodies to human TFR1 using a phage display method (ICOS method) to block the incorporation of the transferrin (TF)-iron complex into ATLL cells for inhibiting cell growth. One of the mAbs, JST-TFR09, presented its greater affinity to TFR1 on ATLL cells in flow cytometry (FCM) analysis than those of commercially available anti-TFR1 antibodies and identified high expression of TFR1 in most of the acute-type ATLL cells. Moreover, JST-TFR09 could interfere with binding between TFR1 and TF, which resulted in effective blockade of TFR1 internalization and induction of cell apoptosis by the treatment of ATLL cells with JST-TFR09. JST-TFR09 showed dual activities through direct cell cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and the treatment of JST-TFR09 significantly suppressed cell growth of ATLL cells with induction of apoptosis in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Thus, JST-TFR09 described here may become a promising therapeutic antibody for the treatment of ATLL.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The niche is essential to support HSC function and to maintain a correct balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Recent advances in defining different mesenchymal and endothelial bone marrow cell populations, as well as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, greatly enhanced our understanding of these niches and of the molecular mechanisms by which they regulate HSC function. In addition to the role in maintaining HSC homeostasis, the niche has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of blood disorders including hematological malignancies. Characterizing the extrinsic regulators and the cellular context in which the niches interact with HSCs will be crucial to define new strategies to enhance blood regeneration. Furthermore, a better understanding of the role of the niche in leukemia development will open new possibilities for the treatment of these disorders by using therapies aiming to target the leukemic niche specifically.

Diesel combustion is the major sources of ultrafine particles (UFP) in the environment, particularly in urbanized areas. In the last years, there is an increasing use of biomass-derived fuels because they are a renewable source of energy that may mitigate climate change through the reduction of net CO2 with respect to conventional fossil fuels. Although there is a general agreement on biofuels ability to reduce conventional pollutants, new and potentially harmful pollutants can be formed during biofuel combustion. In particular, the emission of sub-10nm particles is strongly increased with respect to that of larger soot particles. METHODS: Organic sub-10nm particles are separated from larger sizes particulate matter by collection in water suspension for toxicological and inflammatory tests. After exposure to sub-10nm particles, the effects on proliferation, apoptosis and secretion of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors networks production is analyzed in immortalized non-tumorigenic human dermal keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) and human alveolar epithelial-like cells (A549). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Nanoparticles exert different cytotoxic effects in the two cell lines, suggesting that the dermal way of exposure is more sensitive than the inhalant way. These differences are most evident in the secretion of pro-inflammatory, angiogenic and proliferative cytokines and chemokines whose expression is more finely modulated in HaCaT cells compared to A-549 cells. Considering the size of these particles, it is important to promote the culture of prevention also for the dermal way in particularly exposed workers.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The association of NF-1, juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia has been described in the literature. It is unclear whether JXG alone constitute a risk factor for leukemia or other malignancies in children with NF-1. OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is an association between NF-1, JXG, and malignancy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study comparing children with NF-1 and malignancy (cases) with sex- and age-matched children with NF-1 without malignancy (controls). RESULTS: We identified 739 patients with NF-1 over a 20-year period, 14 of whom also had a diagnosis of malignancy. These cases include 9 (64%) boys and 5 (36%) girls. JXG were found in 4/14 (28.5%) cases and 6/29 (21%) controls (odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.35-6.6, P = .56). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design, small number of cases, and inconsistent documentation of clinical findings, including age at disappearance of JXG. CONCLUSIONS: Juvenile xanthogranulomas do not appear to confer an increased risk for malignancy in children with NF-1.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

As in the case of KYN, increased NPT levels dropped after achieving remission. When correlating KYN and NPT levels with a selection of other markers tested, significant association was revealed only in the case of CRP and IL-6.

Arsenic sulfide (As2S2), the main active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicine realgar, has been proved to have antitumor efficacy in several tumor types including acute promyelocytic leukemia, gastric cancer and colon cancer. Here, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of As2S2 in osteosarcoma both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated that As2S2 potently suppressed cell proliferation by inducing G2/M phase arrest in various osteosarcoma cell lines. Also, treatment with As2S2 induced apoptosis and autophagy in osteosarcoma cells. The apoptosis induction was related to PARP cleavage and activation of caspase-3, -8, -9. As2S2 was demonstrated to induce autophagy as evidenced by formation of autophagosome and accumulation of LC3II. Further studies showed that As2S2-induced apoptosis and autophagy could be significantly attenuated by ROS scavenger and JNK inhibitor. Moreover, we found that As2S2 inhibited Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and suppressing Akt and mTOR kinases activity can increase As2S2-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Finally, As2S2in vivo suppressed tumor growth with few side effects. In summary, our results revealed that As2S2 induced G2/M phase arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy via activing ROS/JNK and blocking Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in human osteosarcoma cells.

Recently, it has been established that the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family, Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG/alphaKG)-dependent oxygenases initiate 5-methylcytosine demethylation by iterative oxidation reactions. Mutations in the TET2 gene are frequently detected in patients with myeloid malignancies. Here, we describe the cloning of untagged human TET2 demethylase using Gateway technology and its efficient expression in E. coli. The untagged TET2 enzyme was purified using cation exchange and heparin sepharose chromatography. In addition, a reliable quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based assay was utilized to analyze the activity of TET2 oxygenase. This assay was further used to analyze the activity of a number of clinical TET2 variants with mutations in the 2OG binding sites. Our results demonstrate that the activity of one TET2 mutant, TET2-R1896S, can be restored using an excess of 2OG in the reaction mixture. These studies suggest that dietary 2OG supplements, which are commonly used for several other conditions, may be used to treat some patients with myeloid malignancies harboring TET2-R1896S mutation. Results described in this paper serve as a foundation for better characterization of wild type as well as mutant TET2 demethylases.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, dysregulated Wnt signaling pathway is strongly associated with several diseases including cancer. Previously, we have shown that AF1q associates with a poor prognosis in leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloid, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. Also, AF1q plays a pivotal role as an oncogene and metastasis enhancer in breast cancer via activation of Wnt signaling pathway. AF1q is highly expressed in stem cells, and this expression is diminished by differentiation. To understand the role of AF1q in stem-like population, we examined stem-like cells derived from breast cells which dysregulated Wnt signaling pathway by alteration of AF1q expression. The effect of Wnt signaling pathway by AF1q on EMT marker expression, stem cell marker expression, and sphere formation was determined. Activated Wnt signaling pathway by AF1q enriched stem-like population showed enhanced sphere formation ability. Interestingly, Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor, Quercetin, decreased the sphere formation in these cells. These results suggest that AF1q would have a role as an enhancer in generation of stem-like population through activation of Wnt signaling pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we have estimated the burden of serious fungal diseases from data obtained from clinical reports, WHO reports, Chilean census, OECD reports and comprehensive literature search available on PubMed and SciELO, among other scientific resources. Due the lack of official data about fungal diseases, frequencies were calculated based on the specific populations at risk. Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (>4 episodes/year) is estimated to occur in 3108/100,000. Using a low international average rate of 5/100,000, we estimate 878 candidaemia cases and 132 patients with intra-abdominal candidiasis. Due to the low incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in Chile, limited numbers of patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis are likely: a total of 1212, 25% following TB. Invasive aspergillosis is estimated to affect 296 patients following leukaemia therapy, transplantation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 1.7/100,000. In addition, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (SAFS) were estimated to be around 97.9/100,000 and 127/100,000 respectively, in 675,772 adult asthmatics and 1700 CF patients. Given a 38,000 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population, with around 2189 new cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) annually, cryptococcal meningitis and Pneumocystis pneumonia are estimated at 0.12/100,000 and 4.3/100,000, respectively.

However, emerging evidence suggests that MLL5 is distinct from the other MLL (KMT2) family members, and the protein it encodes appears to lack intrinsic histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity towards histone substrates. MLL5 has been reported to play key roles in diverse biological processes, including cell cycle progression, genomic stability maintenance, adult hematopoiesis, and spermatogenesis. Recent studies of MLL5 variants and isoforms and putative MLL5 homologs in other species have enriched our understanding of the role of MLL5 in gene expression regulation, although the mechanism of action and physiological function of MLL5 remains poorly understood.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individual data were collected from 15 Cancer and Leukemia Group B (615 patients) and 2 North Central Cancer Treatment Group (101 patients) phase II trials. The effects of 5 risk factors for OS and PFS, including age, histology, performance status (PS), white blood cell count, and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk score, were used in the analysis. Individual-level surrogacy was assessed by Kendall's tau through a Clayton bivariate Copula survival (CBCS) model. Summary-level surrogacy was evaluated via the association between logarithms of the hazard ratio (log HR)-log HROS and log HRPFS-measured in R(2) from a weighted least-square (WLS) regression model and the CBCS model. RESULTS: The median PFS for all patients was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-3.5 months) and the median OS was 7.2 months (95% CI, 6.5-8.0 months). Moderate correlations between PFS and OS were observed across all risk factors at the individual level, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.46 to 0.47. The summary-level surrogacy varied among risk factors. The Copula R(2) ranged from 0.51 for PS to 0.78 for histology. The WLS R(2) ranged from 0.26 for EORTC and PS to 0.67 for age. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses demonstrated low to moderate individual-level surrogacy between PFS and OS. At the summary level, the surrogacy between PFS and OS varied significantly across different risk factors. With a short postprogression survival and a moderate correlation between PFS and OS, there is no evidence that PFS is a valid surrogate endpoint for OS in malignant mesothelioma. The Oncologist 2017;22:189-198Implications for Practice: For better disease management and for more efficient clinical trial designs, it is important to know if progression-free survival (PFS) is a good surrogate endpoint for overall survival in malignant mesothelioma. With a relatively large database of 17 phase II trials and 716 patients from Cancer and Leukemia Group B and North Central Cancer Treatment Group, we conducted statistical analyses and found that there is no evidence to suggest that PFS is a valid surrogate endpoint for OS for malignant mesothelioma.

However, it is unknown whether this is also the case for trisomy 12 CLL-phenotype monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). METHODS: We analyzed the expression of several markers in a series of 89 cytogenetically characterized MBL (including 17 trisomy 12 cases). Additionally, we compared the expression of these markers between trisomy 12 MBL, trisomy 12 CLL and a series of cases with trisomy 12 but fulfilling only 3 of the 5 Moreau CLL diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: CD20, CD22 and CD79b were expressed more intensely in trisomy 12 MBL than in non-trisomy 12 MBL and there was a trend towards a dimmer expression of CD43 in trisomy 12 MBL. There were no differences between trisomy 12 CLL and trisomy 12 MBL. Expression of CD20 was dimmer and that of CD43 brighter in trisomy 12 MBL than in cases with trisomy 12 and 3 Moreau criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, trisomy 12 and non-trisomy 12 MBL were phenotypically different, but the differences are similar to those described between trisomy 12 and non-trisomy 12 CLL, suggesting that they are a distinct subgroup within CLL, given that the differences can already be found at its precursor stage.

We elaborated common guidelines which take advantage of the possibilities of multi-color FCM: marker panel requirements, immunological blast gating, in-sample controls, tri-partite antigen expression rating (negative vs. weak or strong positive) with capturing of blast cell heterogeneities and subclone formation, refined ALL subclassification, and a dominant lineage assignment algorithm able to distinguish ""simple"" from bilineal/""complex"" mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) cases, which is essential for choice of treatment.

However, the underlying mechanism is still not clear. A randomForest analysis of the gene expression array data from 55 MDS patients (GSE4619) demonstrated a significant (p = 0.0007) correlation (Pearson r =-0.4068) between GPI-anchor biosynthesis gene expression and genomic instability, in which PIGN, a gene participating in GPI-AP biosynthesis, was ranked as the third most important in predicting risk of MDS progression. Furthermore, we observed that PIGN gene expression aberrations (increased transcriptional activity but diminished to no protein production) were associated with increased frequency of GPI-AP deficiency in leukemic cells during leukemic transformation/progression. PIGN gene expression aberrations were attributed to partial intron retentions between exons 14 and 15 resulting in frameshifts and premature termination which were confirmed by examining the RNA-seq data from a group of AML patients (phs001027.v1.p1). PIGN gene expression aberration correlated with the elevation of genomic instability marker expression that was independent of the TP53 regulatory pathway. Suppression/elimination of PIGN protein expression caused a similar pattern of genomic instability that was rescued by PIGN restoration. Finally, we found that PIGN bound to the spindle assembly checkpoint protein, MAD1, and regulated its expression during the cell cycle.

To increase the potency of idelalisib and bendamustine, we tested their combination in primary CLL lymphocytes. While each compound alone produced a moderate response, combination at several concentrations resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity. Idelalisib enhanced the bendamustine-mediated DNA damage/repair response, indicated by the phosphorylation of ATM, Chk2, and p53. Each drug alone activated gammaH2AX but combination treatment further increased the expression of this DNA damage marker. Compared with the control, idelalisib treatment decreased global RNA synthesis, resulting in a decline of early-response and short-lived MCL1 transcripts. In concert, there was a decline in total Mcl-1 protein in CLL lymphocytes.

To isolate genes responsible for leukemia cells regeneration following multiple challenges with irradiation we performed a genome-wide shRNA screen. Some of the isolated hits are known players in the DNA damage response (e.g. p53, CHK2), whereas other, e.g. SMYD2 lysine methyltransferase (KMT), remains uncharacterized in the AML context. Here we report that SMYD2 knockdown confers relative resistance to human AML cells against multiple classes of DNA damaging agents. Induction of the transient quiescence state upon SMYD2 downregulation correlated with the resistance. We revealed that diminished SMYD2 expression resulted in the upregulation of the related methyltransferase SET7/9, suggesting compensatory relationships. Indeed, pharmacological targeting of SET7/9 with (R)-PFI2 inhibitor preferentially inhibited the growth of cells expressing low levels of SMYD2.Finally, decreased expression of SMYD2 in AML patients correlated with the reduced sensitivity to therapy and lower probability to achieve complete remission. We propose that the interplay between SMYD2 and SET7/9 levels shifts leukemia cells from growth to quiescence state that is associated with the higher resistance to DNA damaging agents and rationalize SET7/9 pharmacological targeting in AML.",,"['Zipin-Roitman, Adi', 'Aqaqe, Nasma', 'Yassin, Muhammad', 'Biechonski, Shahar', 'Amar, Mariam', 'van Delft, Mark F', 'Gan, Olga I', 'McDermott, Sean P', 'Buzina, Alla', 'Ketela, Troy', 'Shlush, Liran', 'Xie, Stephanie', 'Voisin, Veronique', 'Moffat, Jason', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Dick, John E', 'Milyavsky, Michael']","['Zipin-Roitman A', 'Aqaqe N', 'Yassin M', 'Biechonski S', 'Amar M', 'van Delft MF', 'Gan OI', 'McDermott SP', 'Buzina A', 'Ketela T', 'Shlush L', 'Xie S', 'Voisin V', 'Moffat J', 'Minden MD', 'Dick JE', 'Milyavsky M']",,"['Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Leidos Biomedical Research, Washington D.C., USA.', 'Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomedical Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomedical Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomedical Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomedical Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SETD7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SMYD2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'DNA Damage/physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transfection']",PMC5369996,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'DNA damage', 'SMYD2 lysine methyltransferase', 'chemotherapy', 'quiescence']",,2017/02/12 06:00,2017/08/25 06:00,['2017/02/11 06:00'],"['2016/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['15147 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15147 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Mar 7;8(10):16712-16727. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15147.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We applied AMP-NGS technology in the evaluation of a 56-year-old gentleman with myelodysplastic syndrome transformed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patient was initially diagnosed with low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory cytopenias and multilineage dysplasia (MDS-RCMD), progressed to AML after failing hypomethylating agent therapy. At progression patients had normal cytogenetics but NGS profiling showed ETV6 c.416_417del CT frame shift and U2AF1 S34F mutations. Patient attains brief remission of 2 months after induction chemotherapy and then he was refractory to 2 salvage chemotherapy regimens. Reassessment after failing second salvage, identified t(12;17)(p13;p13)[20] by karyotype. It was postulated that the 12p13 locus might represent a new rearrangement of ETV6. AMP-NGS confirmed involvement of the ETV6 with discovery of a novel fusion partner, HIC1. The detection of the novel fusion partners was supported by the breakpoints originally observed by karyotype. This discovery of ETV6-HIC1 gene fusion by AMP-NGS technology provided new insight into a leukemogenic pathway in AML.

However, there is limited information on the cellular mechanisms of response and particularly on the effect of cell differentiation state to TKI sensitivity in vivo and ex vivo/in vitro. We used multiple, independent high-throughput drug sensitivity and resistance testing platforms that collectively evaluated 295 oncology compounds to characterize ex vivo drug response profiles of primary cells freshly collected from newly-diagnosed patients with BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia (n = 40) and healthy controls (n = 12). In contrast to the highly TKI-sensitive cells from blast phase CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, primary CP CML cells were insensitive to TKI therapy ex vivo. Despite maintaining potent BCR-ABL1 inhibitory activity, ex vivo viability of cells was unaffected by TKIs. These findings were validated in two independent patient cohorts and analysis platforms. All CP CML patients under study responded to TKI therapy in vivo. When CP CML cells were sorted based on CD34 expression, the CD34-positive progenitor cells showed good sensitivity to TKIs, whereas the more mature CD34-negative cells were markedly less sensitive. Thus in CP CML, TKIs predominantly target the progenitor cell population while the differentiated leukemic cells (mostly cells from granulocytic series) are insensitive to BCR-ABL1 inhibition. These findings have implications for drug discovery in CP CML and indicate a fundamental biological difference between CP CML and advanced forms of BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia.",,"['Pietarinen, Paavo O', 'Eide, Christopher A', 'Ayuda-Duran, Pilar', 'Potdar, Swapnil', 'Kuusanmaki, Heikki', 'Andersson, Emma I', 'Mpindi, John P', 'Pemovska, Tea', 'Kontro, Mika', 'Heckman, Caroline A', 'Kallioniemi, Olli', 'Wennerberg, Krister', 'Hjorth-Hansen, Henrik', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Enserink, Jorrit M', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Porkka, Kimmo']","['Pietarinen PO', 'Eide CA', 'Ayuda-Duran P', 'Potdar S', 'Kuusanmaki H', 'Andersson EI', 'Mpindi JP', 'Pemovska T', 'Kontro M', 'Heckman CA', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Wennerberg K', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Druker BJ', 'Enserink JM', 'Tyner JW', 'Mustjoki S', 'Porkka K']",,"['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Oslo University Hospital, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, St Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway and Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Oslo University Hospital, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/classification/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5410248,['NOTNLM'],"['CD34', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'ex vivo', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,2017/02/12 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2017/02/11 06:00'],"['2016/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['15146 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15146 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 4;8(14):22606-22615. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15146.,,,"['R00 CA151457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA065823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA065823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

B392 caused mitotic arrest and ultimately led to apoptosis. It was further demonstrated to be a novel microtubule-depolymerizing agent. The effects of oral administration of B392 showed relative potent anti-leukemia activity in an in vivo xenograft model. Further investigation revealed that B392 triggered induction of the mitotic arrest, followed by mitochondrial membrane potential loss and caspases cleavage by activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In addition, B392 enhanced the cytotoxicity of sirolimus in sirolimus-resistant acute leukemic cells through inhibition of Akt/mTOR pathway and Mcl-1 protein expression, and also was active in the p-glycoprotein (p-gp)-overexpressing National Cancer Institute/Adriamycin-Resistant cells with little susceptibility to p-gp.

Four months later, the dog developed multiple skin masses, hyphema, pericardial and mild bicavitary effusions, myocardial masses, and marked plasmacytosis in the peripheral blood. Circulating plasma cells expressed CD34 and MHC class II by flow cytometry. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that these cells were strongly positive for multiple myeloma oncogene 1/interferon regulatory factor 4 (MUM-1) and weakly to moderately positive for Pax5. The dog was hypoglobulinemic but had a monoclonal IgA gammopathy detected by serum immunofixation electrophoresis. The PCR analysis of antigen receptor gene rearrangements (PARR) by fragment analysis using GeneScan methodology revealed that plasmacytoid cells in the original cutaneous plasmacytoma and peripheral blood had an identical immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) rearrangement, indicating that both populations were derived from the same neoplastic clone. Canine cutaneous plasmacytoma rarely progresses to a malignant form and plasma cell leukemia is rarely diagnosed in the dog. This report describes a case of cutaneous plasmacytoma progressing to plasma cell leukemia with a rapid and aggressive clinical course.

Genomic copy number variations (CNV) were analyzed by single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP array) in case 1. The results were confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Variations of acute lymphoblastic leukemia-related genes including CDKN2A/AB and PAX5 were detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplication (MLPA). RESULTS: Deletions and duplications on derivative chromosome 9 detected by FISH were confirmed by SNP array analysis. The distances between the BCR/ABL fusion signals on the idic(Ph) chromosomes in the two patients have differed greatly. The idic(Ph) in the second patient was supposed to be formed by two Ph chromosomes joined at their q terminals, where as the idic(Ph) in the first patient have been shown to be fused at the satellite regions of their p arms.

METHODS: A total of 172 adult CML patients and 480 unrelated healthy controls were screened for the presence of KIR with sequence-specific primers-PCR (PCR-SSP) and sequence-based typing (SBT) of HLA-A, -B and -C loci. Polymorphisms of the KIR-HLA system were analyzed at 4 levels, and the frequencies of KIR framework genes and KIR profiles, classHLA ligands, matched KIR+HLA pairs and KIR-HLA compound profile were compared between the two groups. P values were calculated using SPSS 13.0 software. RESULTS: For the CML group, the frequencies of HLA-C2 ligand, 2DL1+HLA-C2 pair and HLA-B Bw4-80I were significantly lower than those of the control group, suggesting a protective effect against CML (HLA-C2: OR=0.386, 95%CI:0.240-0.620, P<0.01; 2DL1+HLA-C2: OR=0.316, 95%CI:0.191-0.525, P<0.01; HLA-B Bw4-80I: OR=0.576, 95%CI:0.384-0.862, P<0.01). The frequencies of KIR2DL1 ligand (HLA-C2) and KIR3DL1 ligand (HLA-B Bw4-80I) in the CML group were significantly lower than that of the control group, suggesting that the HLA-C2 and HLA-B Bw4-80I expression is probably decreased in the CML patient group, which led to reduced inhibitory signal and enhanced activating signal of KIR2DL1(+) and/or KIR3DL1(+) NK cells. Notably, the frequency of KIR-HLA compound profiles ID2 (KIR AA1-HLA-C1/C1-Bw6/Bw6-A3/11) in CML patients significantly increased in the CML patient group compared with the control group, suggesting that the KIR-HLA compound profiles ID2 may be a risk factor for CML (OR=2.163, 95%CI 1.198-3.906, P<0.01).

The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) is a master regulator of myeloid differentiation, and the identification of C/EBPalpha target genes is key to understand this process. Here we identified the Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 2B (EVI2B) gene as a direct target of C/EBPalpha. We showed that the product of the gene, the transmembrane glycoprotein EVI2B (CD361), is abundantly expressed on the surface of primary hematopoietic cells, the highest levels of expression being reached in mature granulocytes. Using shRNA-mediated downregulation of EVI2B in human and murine cell lines and in primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we demonstrated impaired myeloid lineage development and altered progenitor functions in EVI2B-silenced cells. We showed that the compromised progenitor functionality in Evi2b-depleted cells can be in part explained by deregulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, we generated an Evi2b knockout murine model and demonstrated altered properties of hematopoietic progenitors, as well as impaired G-CSF dependent myeloid colony formation in the knockout cells. Remarkably, we found that EVI2B is significantly downregulated in human acute myeloid leukemia samples characterized by defects in CEBPA.

Using a microarray-based genome-wide screen for genes responding to DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) inhibition in MM cells, we identified RECQ1 among the most downregulated genes. RecQ helicases are DNA unwinding enzymes involved in the maintenance of chromosome stability. Here we show that RECQ1 is significantly overexpressed in MMCs compared to normal plasma cells and that increased RECQ1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in three independent cohorts of patients. Interestingly, RECQ1 knockdown inhibits cells growth and induces apoptosis in MMCs. Moreover, RECQ1 depletion promotes the development of DNA double-strand breaks, as evidenced by the formation of 53BP1 foci and the phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and histone variant H2A.X (H2AX). In contrast, RECQ1 overexpression protects MMCs from melphalan and bortezomib cytotoxicity. RECQ1 interacts with PARP1 in MMCs exposed to treatment and RECQ1 depletion sensitizes MMCs to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor.

In order to increase the drug efficacy, ceaseless search for novel combinations of drugs and supporting molecules is under way. MiRNAs are natural candidates for facilitating drug effect in various cell types. We used several systems to evaluate the effect of miR-29 family on etoposide toxicity in HeLa cells. We show that miR-29b significantly increases etoposide toxicity in HeLa cells. Because Mcl-1 protein has been recognized as a miR-29 family target, we evaluated downregulation of Mcl-1 protein splicing variant expression induced by miR-29 precursors and confirmed a key role of Mcl-1 protein in enhancing etoposide toxicity. Despite downregulation of Mcl-1 by all three miR-29 family members, only miR-29b significantly enhanced etoposide toxicity. We hypothesized that this difference may be linked to the change in Mcl-1L/Mcl-1S ratio induced by miR-29b. We hypothesized that the change could be due to miR-29b nuclear shuttling. Using specifically modified miR-29b sequences with enhanced cytosolic and nuclear localization we show that there is a difference, albeit statistically non-significant. In conclusion, we show that miR-29b has the synergistic effect with etoposide treatment in the HeLa cells and that this effect is linked to Mcl-1 protein expression and nuclear shuttling of miR-29b.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, observational trial with 6 time points was conducted; 177 patients were recruited in 23 centers in Poland who were treated with nilotinib as second-line therapy because of the ineffectiveness or intolerance of their previous therapy. QOL was evaluated with the standard European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life questionnaire. Adherence to the therapy was assessed using the 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale by patients and their physicians. RESULTS: The average QOL in patients who completed the study was significantly higher during the last visit (69.4 +/- 17.4) than at the start of the study (59.1 +/- 18.8; P < .001). At their first visit, 120 (83.2%) patients assessed themselves as highly compliant and 135 (93.4%) at the fifth visit. Low-compliance patients represented 3 (1.7% of the total) during visit 1; none of the patients self-assessed as low compliance since the fourth visit. At the first visit 151 (85.3%) patients were categorized by their physicians as highly compliant and 138 (96.0%) during the last 3 visits. Patients' and their physicians' assessments were significantly correlated. CONCLUSION: The QOL among patients receiving nilotinib administered as second-line therapy was very good and adherence to the treatment was high. The efficacy and safety of the drug were confirmed in the real-life setting.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The stages usually correspond to different subtypes or classes of the disease, and the difficulty to identify them often comes from patient heterogeneity and sample variability that can hide the biomedical relevant changes that characterize each stage, making standard differential analysis inadequate or inefficient. RESULTS: We propose a methodology to study diseases or disease stages ordered in a sequential manner (e.g. from early stages with good prognosis to more acute or serious stages associated to poor prognosis). The methodology is applied to diseases that have been studied obtaining genome-wide expression profiling of cohorts of patients at different stages. The approach allows searching for consistent expression patterns along the progression of the disease through two major steps: (i) identifying genes with increasing or decreasing trends in the progression of the disease; (ii) clustering the increasing/decreasing gene expression patterns using an unsupervised approach to reveal whether there are consistent patterns and find genes altered at specific disease stages. The first step is carried out using Gamma rank correlation to identify genes whose expression correlates with a categorical variable that represents the stages of the disease. The second step is done using a Self Organizing Map (SOM) to cluster the genes according to their progressive profiles and identify specific patterns. Both steps are done after normalization of the genomic data to allow the integration of multiple independent datasets. In order to validate the results and evaluate their consistency and biological relevance, the methodology is applied to datasets of three different diseases: myelodysplastic syndrome, colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease. A software script written in R, named genediseasePatterns, is provided to allow the use and application of the methodology. CONCLUSION: The method presented allows the analysis of the progression of complex and heterogeneous diseases that can be divided in pathological stages. It identifies gene groups whose expression patterns change along the advance of the disease, and it can be applied to different types of genomic data studying cohorts of patients in different states.",,"['Aibar, Sara', 'Abaigar, Maria', 'Campos-Laborie, Francisco Jose', 'Sanchez-Santos, Jose Manuel', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M', 'De Las Rivas, Javier']","['Aibar S', 'Abaigar M', 'Campos-Laborie FJ', 'Sanchez-Santos JM', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'De Las Rivas J']",,"['Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics research group, Cancer Research Center (IMBCC, CSIC/USAL) and Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Unidad de Diagnostico Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Cancer Research Center (IMBCC, CSIC/USAL) and Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca (HUS/IBSAL/USAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics research group, Cancer Research Center (IMBCC, CSIC/USAL) and Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics research group, Cancer Research Center (IMBCC, CSIC/USAL) and Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Salamanca (USAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Unidad de Diagnostico Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Cancer Research Center (IMBCC, CSIC/USAL) and Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca (HUS/IBSAL/USAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics research group, Cancer Research Center (IMBCC, CSIC/USAL) and Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain. jrivas@usal.es.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer Disease/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Transcriptome']",PMC5133487,['NOTNLM'],"['Bioinformatics', 'Cancer', 'Data integration', 'Disease progression', 'Disease stage', 'Disease subtype', 'Expression pattern', 'Expression profiling', 'Gene expression', 'Gene signature', 'Leukemia', 'Pattern recognition', 'Transcriptomics']",,2017/02/12 06:00,2017/08/18 06:00,['2017/02/11 06:00'],"['2017/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-016-1290-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-016-1290-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2016 Nov 22;17(Suppl 15):432. doi: 10.1186/s12859-016-1290-4.,20161122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Algorithms that require to specify a-priori number/dimension/length of clusters assumed for the data suffer from a high degree of arbitrariness whenever no precise information are available, and this may strongly affect final estimation on parameters. Within this framework, spatial scan-statistics have been proposed in the literature, representing a valid non-parametric alternative. RESULTS: We adapt the so called Bernoulli-model scan statistic to the genomic field and we propose a multivariate extension, named Relative Scan Statistics, for the comparison of two series of Bernoulli r.v. defined over a common support, with the final goal of highlighting unshared event rate variations. Using a probabilistic approach based on success probability estimates and comparison (likelihood based), we can exploit an hypothesis testing procedure to identify clusters and relative clusters. Both the univariate and the novel multivariate extension of the scan statistic confirm previously published findings. CONCLUSION: The method described in the paper represents a challenging application of scan statistics framework to problem related to genomic data.

Furthermore, we observed that low levels of ASH2L are associated with increased overall survival. We also compared ASH2L levels to the expression of 230 proteins previously analyzed on this array.

Multivariate analysis using a classification and regression tree showed that the incidence of s-MDS/AML was lowest in patients who were not more than 55 years old at transplantation and in whom the target cell dose was collected in fewer than two apheresis sessions (5-year cumulative incidence, 1%), whereas incidence was highest in patients who were more than 55 years old at transplantation and who received a transplant more than 21 months after their initial lymphoma diagnosis (5-year cumulative incidence, 20%). CONCLUSION: Our study defines a subset of relapsed or refractory lymphoma patients who should be closely monitored for development of s-MDS/AML after high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT.",['(c) 2017 AABB.'],"['Ge, Isabell', 'Saliba, Rima M', 'Maadani, Farzaneh', 'Popat, Uday R', 'Qazilbash, Muzaffar H', 'Ravi Pingali, Sai', 'Shah, Nina', 'Ahmed, Sairah', 'Bashir, Qaiser', 'Nieto, Yago', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Hosing, Chitra']","['Ge I', 'Saliba RM', 'Maadani F', 'Popat UR', 'Qazilbash MH', 'Ravi Pingali S', 'Shah N', 'Ahmed S', 'Bashir Q', 'Nieto Y', 'Champlin RE', 'Hosing C']",,"['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Houston Methodist Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Autografts', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', '*Lymphoma/epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",PMC8253453,,,,2017/02/12 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2017/02/11 06:00'],"['2016/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.14016 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2017 Apr;57(4):1052-1057. doi: 10.1111/trf.14016.

Most of these agents are already included into treatment algorithms defined by international practice guidelines, but more clinical investigations are needed to answer still remaining questions. Ibrutinib was proven as a primary choice for patients with the TP53 gene deletion/mutation, who otherwise have no active treatment available. Idelalisib with rituximab is also an active therapy, but due to increased risk of serious infections, its use in first-line treatment is limited to patients for whom ibrutinib is not an option. A new indication for ibrutinib was recently approved for older patients with comorbidities, as an alternative to the already existing indication for chlorambucil with obinutuzumab. The use of kinase inhibitors is already well established in recurrent/refractory disease. Immunochemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab (FCR) remains a major first-line option for many CLL patients without the TP53 gene deletion/mutation, and who have no significant comorbidities or history of infections, and is particularly effective in patients with favorable features including mutated IGHV status. There are a number of issues regarding novel therapies for CLL that need further investigation such as optimum duration of treatment with kinase inhibitors, appropriate sequencing of novel agents, mechanisms of resistance to inhibitors and response to class switching after treatment failure, along with the potential role of combinations of targeted agents.",,"['Jamroziak, Krzysztof', 'Pula, Bartosz', 'Walewski, Jan']","['Jamroziak K', 'Pula B', 'Walewski J']",,"['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, ul.

Affected individuals typically manifest growth restriction and congenital physical abnormalities and most progress to hematological disease including bone marrow aplasia. A rare genetic subtype of FA (FA-D1) is caused by biallelic mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Affected individuals manifest severe congenital anomalies and significant pigmentary changes and are additionally at risk for early onset leukemia and certain solid organ malignancies, including Wilms tumors and brain tumors. Parents of affected individuals are obligate carriers for heterozygous BRCA2 mutations and are thus potentially at risk for adult onset cancers which fall within the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer spectrum. We present two cases of black South African patients with FA diagnosed with biallelic BRCA2 mutations and discuss the phenotypic consequences and implications for them and their families. Recognition of this severe end of the phenotypic spectrum of FA is critical in allowing for confirmation of the diagnosis as well as cascade screening and appropriate care of family members.",,"['Feben, Candice', 'Spencer, Careni', 'Lochan, Anneline', 'Laing, Nakita', 'Fieggen, Karen', 'Honey, Engela', 'Wainstein, Tasha', 'Krause, Amanda']","['Feben C', 'Spencer C', 'Lochan A', 'Laing N', 'Fieggen K', 'Honey E', 'Wainstein T', 'Krause A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1296-3547'],"['Division of Human Genetics, National Health Laboratory Service & School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of the Witwatersrand, Cnr Hospital & De Korte Street, Braamfontein, Johannesburg, 2000, South Africa. candice.feben@nhls.ac.za.', 'Division of Human Genetics, National Health Laboratory Service & School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of the Witwatersrand, Cnr Hospital & De Korte Street, Braamfontein, Johannesburg, 2000, South Africa.', 'Division of Human Genetics, National Health Laboratory Service & School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of the Witwatersrand, Cnr Hospital & De Korte Street, Braamfontein, Johannesburg, 2000, South Africa.', 'Division of Human Genetics & The Department of Medicine, The University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'Division of Human Genetics & The Department of Medicine, The University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Steve Biko Pretoria Academic Hospital & The University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.', 'Division of Human Genetics, National Health Laboratory Service & School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of the Witwatersrand, Cnr Hospital & De Korte Street, Braamfontein, Johannesburg, 2000, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Fam Cancer,Familial cancer,100898211,"['0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (BRCA2 protein, human)']",IM,"['BRCA2 Protein/*genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, BRCA2', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Pedigree', 'South Africa']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BRCA2 mutations', '*Black South African patients', '*Cascade screening', '*Fanconi anaemia', '*Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome']",,2017/02/12 06:00,2018/02/10 06:00,['2017/02/11 06:00'],"['2017/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10689-017-9968-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10689-017-9968-y [pii]']",ppublish,Fam Cancer. 2017 Jul;16(3):441-446. doi: 10.1007/s10689-017-9968-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the United States, ponatinib has received accelerated approval for adults with T315I-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or T315I (gatekeeper mutation)-positive, Philadelphia chromosome-positive, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL), and patients with CML or Ph + ALL for whom no other TKI therapy is indicated. The objective of this phase 1, mass balance study was to evaluate the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of [(14)C]ponatinib in healthy subjects. METHODS: A single 45-mg [(14)C]ponatinib dose was administered orally to six healthy male volunteers, and absorption, metabolism, and excretion were assessed. RESULTS: 86.6 and 5.4% of the dose was recovered in feces and urine, respectively, during days 0-14 postdose. Median time to maximal plasma radioactivity was 5 h and mean terminal elimination half-life of radioactivity was 66.4 h. Ponatinib and its inactive carboxylic acid metabolite M14, the two major circulating radioactive components, accounted for 25.5 and 14.9% of the radioactivity in 0-24 h pooled plasma, with elimination half-lives of 27.4 and 33.7 h, respectively. Major metabolites in urine were M14 and its glucuronides, which, together with other M14-derived metabolites, represented 4.4% of the dose; ponatinib was not detected in urine. In feces, major radioactive components were ponatinib, M31 (hydroxylation), M42 (N-demethylation), and four methylated products accounting for 20.5, 17.7, 8.3, and 8.4% of the radioactive dose, respectively.

AML cells are often sensitive to autophagyinducing stimuli, prompting the idea that targeting autophagy can be useful in AML cytotoxic therapy. AML NB4 cells overexpressing microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-green fluorescent protein were screened with 69 inhibitors to analyze autophagy activity. AML cells were treated with the polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitors RO3280 and BI2536 before autophagy analysis. Cleaved LC3 (LC3-II) and the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, and Unc-51-like kinase 1 during autophagy was detected with western blotting. Autophagosomes were detected using transmission electron microscopy. Several inhibitors had promising autophagy inducer effects: BI2536, MLN0905, SK1-I, SBE13 HCL and RO3280. Moreover, these inhibitors all targeted PLK1. Autophagy activity was increased in the NB4 cells treated with RO3280 and BI2536. Inhibition of PLK1 expression in NB4, K562 and HL-60 leukemia cells with RNA interference increased LC3-II and autophagy activity. The phosphorylation of mTOR was reduced significantly in NB4 cells treated with RO3280 and BI2536, and was also reduced significantly when PLK1 expression was downregulated in the NB4, K562 and HL-60 cells. We demonstrate that PLK1 inhibition induces AML cell autophagy and that it results in mTOR dephosphorylation.

Inactivation of Wnt antagonists could play an important role in leukemia progression by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF1) is one of the important Wnt antagonists. Few miRNAs have been reported to directly target this gene in hematopoiesis. Here, we observed that miR-181a-5p expression was markedly overexpressed in several leukemia cell lines and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples compared with that noted in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MTT assays, soft agar colony formation assays and flow cytometry analysis collectively showed that ectopic expression of miR-181a-5p induced ALL cell growth and proliferation. Furthermore, a mechanistic study disclosed that miR-181a-5p directly downregulated WIF1 expression by binding to its 3'-UTR, and further activated Wnt/betacatenin signaling. These findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into the role of miR-181a-5p in ALL cell growth and proliferation and implicate miR-181a-5p as an attractive candidate for ALL therapy.",,"['Lyu, Xiaoming', 'Li, Jinbang', 'Yun, Xi', 'Huang, Rui', 'Deng, Xubin', 'Wang, Yingping', 'Chen, Youming', 'Xiao, Gang']","['Lyu X', 'Li J', 'Yun X', 'Huang R', 'Deng X', 'Wang Y', 'Chen Y', 'Xiao G']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, P.R.

Lenalidomide (LEN) can correct anemia in 25% of MDS patients without deletion 5q (del5q). As this therapy will inevitably fail, understanding the outcome of these patients will facilitate development of subsequent treatment strategies. To answer this question, an international retrospective study focused on LEN-treated lower-risk, non-del5q, MDS patients was performed. We analyzed the overall survival after LEN failure, its prognostic factors and the impact of post LEN treatment options. We included a total of 384 patients. The median overall survival after failure of LEN was 43 months. In multivariate analysis, adverse cytogenetics, excess of blasts at the initiation of LEN, and the type of failure (classified as stable disease, relapse, intolerance, or progression) were the main determinants of outcome. Subsequent therapy with hypomethylating agents was associated with a prolonged survival compared to BSC (median OS= 51m vs. 36m, p=0.01). In conclusion, the survival for non-del5q MDS patients after failure of LEN remains relatively prolonged, though with a wide range.

Development of more effective, personalized treatment strategies require identification of novel biomarkers of treatment response. Since Pt compounds are inactivated through cellular metabolic activity, we hypothesized that metabolic interrogation can predict the effectiveness of Pt chemotherapy in a pre-clinical model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).We tested the effects of cisplatin (CDDP) and carboplatin (CBP) on DNA damage, activation of cellular death cascades and tumor cell metabolism, specifically lactate production. Pt compounds induced an acute dose-dependent, transient drop in lactate generation in vitro, which correlated with effects on DNA damage and cell death. Neutralization of free radical stress abrogated these effects. The magnitude of this effect on lactate production correlated with the differential sensitivity of HNSCC cells to Pt compounds (CDDP vs CBP) and p53-driven Pt chemotherapy resistance. Using dual flank xenograft tumors, we demonstrated that Pt-driven effects on lactate levels correlate with effects on tumor growth delay in a dose-dependent manner and that lactate levels can define the temporal profile of Pt chemotherapy-induced metabolic stress. Lactate interrogation also predicted doxorubicin effects on cell death in both solid tumor (HNSCC) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines.Real-time metabolic interrogation of acute changes in cell and tumor lactate levels reflects chemotherapy effects on DNA damage, cell death and tumor growth delay.

Published data report engraftment in ~40-66% of cases, mostly of intermediate- or poor-risk subtypes. Here we report that extending follow-up beyond the standard analysis endpoints of 10 to 16 weeks after transplantation permitted leukemic engraftment from nearly every case of xenotransplanted acute myeloid leukemia (18/19, ~95%). Xenogeneic leukemic cells showed conserved immune pheno-types and genetic signatures when compared to corresponding pre-transplant cells and, furthermore, were able to induce leukemia in re-transplantation assays. Importantly, bone marrow biopsies taken at standardized time points failed to detect leukemic cells in 11/18 of cases that later showed robust engraftment (61%, termed ""long-latency engrafters""), indicating that leukemic cells can persist over months at undetectable levels without losing disease-initiating properties. Cells from favorable-risk leukemia subtypes required longer to become detectable in NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma(null) mice (27.5+/-9.4 weeks) than did cells from intermediate-risk (21.9+/-9.4 weeks, P<0.01) or adverse-risk (17+/-7.6 weeks; P<0.0001) subtypes, explaining why the engraftment of the first was missed with previous protocols.

The goal of this study was to determine the optimal combination of flow cytometric markers for a screening approach that balances efficiency and accuracy. METHODS: An audit over 9 months of flow cytometric testing was performed, including rereview of all dot plots from positive cases. RESULTS: Of the 807 cases in which leukaemia/lymphoma testing was performed, 23 were non-diagnostic and 189 represented bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Of the remaining 595 cases, 137 (23%) were positive for an abnormal haematolymphoid population. Review of the positive cases identified minimum requirements for a screening tube as well as analysis strategies to overcome the diagnostic pitfalls noted. It is estimated that 38% fewer antibodies would be used in a screening approach, representing an opportunity for significant cost savings. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a framework for developing an evidence-based screening combination for cost-effective characterisation of haematolymphoid malignancies, promoting adoption of 'just-in-time' testing systems that tailor the evaluation to the diagnostic need.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

New prognostic markers in CLL may be useful to clinicians for predicting outcome and in clinical decision-making. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential prognostic value of the apoptotic/survival-controlling proteins and protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 gene expression in CLL patients and control individuals, correlating such findings with patients' clinical data. METHODS: Fifty-three patients diagnosed with CLL attending the hematology service of a clinical hospital, and 24 healthy individuals with no history of leukemia (Control group) were enrolled in this study. Analyses of apoptotic/survival-controlling proteins were performed by western blot and ZAP-70 gene expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed for the p-p38, Mcl-1 long, and Mcl-1 short proteins when patients were compared with CLL and controls. A positive correlation between the results for Mcl-1 short and Mcl-1 long and lymphocyte count was observed, corroborating the hypothesis of an imbalance between proteins of cell survival pathways/apoptosis in CLL. CONCLUSION: ZAP-70 gene expression was not detected as a discriminant biomarker in these CLL patients. An imbalance between apoptosis-related proteins was observed in the present study, corroborating the hypothesis of increased survival of lymphocytes in CLL patients.","['Copyright (c) 2017 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

T helper cells including Th17 play key roles in aGVHD pathogenesis. Donor regulatory T cell (Tregs) adoptive therapy reduces aGVHD without weakening graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL) in both mouse and human, although the purification and ex vivo expansion of Tregs in clinical scenarios remain costly and technically demanding. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) is a key molecule switch that attenuates Treg but promotes Th17 development. However, whether pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1alpha reduces aGVHD via increasing Treg development and diminishing Th17 responses remains unexplored. METHODS: By using alloantigen-specific mixed lymphocyte culture and murine models of aGVHD and GVL, we evaluated the impacts of HIF-1alpha inhibition by echinomycin on the alloantigen-specific CD4 T cell responses ex vivo, as well as on aGVHD and GVL effect following allo-HSCT. RESULTS: Ex vivo echinomycin treatment resulted in increased number of Tregs in the culture as well as reduced alloantigen-specific Th17 and Th1 responses. In vivo echinomycin treatment reduced GVHD scores and prolonged survival of mice following allo-HSCT, which is associated with increased number of donor Tregs and reduced number of Th17 and Th1 in lymphoid tissues. In murine model of leukemia, echinomycin treatment preserved GVL effect and prolonged leukemia free survival following allo-HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: Echinomycin treatment reduces aGVHD and preserves GVL effect via increasing donor Treg development and diminishing alloantigen-specific Th17 and Th1 responses following allo-HSCT, presumably via direct inhibition of HIF-1alpha that results in preferential Treg differentiation during alloantigen-specific CD4 T cell responses.

Other than stem cell transplantation and intensified chemotherapy, no other improved treatment strategies have been approved clinically. Gene expression profiling represents a powerful approach to identify potential biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for various diseases including leukemias. However, inadequate sample size in many individual experiments has failed to provide adequate study power to yield translatable findings. With the hope of getting new insights into the biological mechanisms underpinning relapsed ALL and identifying more promising biomarkers or therapeutic targets, we conducted a meta-analysis of gene expression studies involving ALL from 3 separate studies. METHOD: By using the keywords ""acute lymphoblastic leukemia"", and ""microarray"", a total of 280 and 275 microarray datasets were found listed in Gene Expression Omnibus database GEO and ArrayExpress database respectively. Further manual inspection found that only three studies (GSE18497, GSE28460, GSE3910) were focused on gene expression profiling of paired diagnosis-relapsed pediatric B-ALL. These three datasets which comprised of a total of 108 matched diagnosis-relapsed pediatric B-ALL samples were then included for this meta-analysis using RankProd approach. RESULTS: Our analysis identified a total of 1795 upregulated probes which corresponded to 1527 genes (pfp < 0.01; FC > 1), and 1493 downregulated probes which corresponded to 1214 genes (pfp < 0.01; FC < 1) respectively. S100A8 appeared as the top most overexpressed gene (pfp < 0.01, FC = 1.8) and is a potential target for further validation. Based on gene ontology biological process annotation, the upregulated genes were most enriched in cell cycle processes (enrichment score = 15.3), whilst the downregulated genes were clustered in transcription regulation (enrichment score = 12.6). Elevated expression of cell cycle regulators (e.g kinesins, AURKA, CDKs) was the key genetic defect implicated in relapsed ALL, and serve as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. CONCLUSION: We identified S100A8 as the most overexpressed gene, and the cell cycle pathway as the most promising biomarker and therapeutic target for relapsed childhood B-ALL. The validity of the results warrants further investigation.",,"['Chow, Yock-Ping', 'Alias, Hamidah', 'Jamal, Rahman']","['Chow YP', 'Alias H', 'Jamal R']",,"['UKM Medical Molecular Biology Institute (UMBI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center, 56000, Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'UKM Medical Molecular Biology Institute (UMBI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center, 56000, Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pediatric, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Malaysia, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center, 56000, Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'UKM Medical Molecular Biology Institute (UMBI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center, 56000, Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. rahmanj@ppukm.ukm.edu.my.', 'Department of Pediatric, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Malaysia, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center, 56000, Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. rahmanj@ppukm.ukm.edu.my.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Calgranulin A)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Calgranulin A/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Child', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Ontology', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology']",PMC5301337,['NOTNLM'],"['*Gene expression', '*Microarray', '*Pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Relapse']",,2017/02/12 06:00,2018/01/19 06:00,['2017/02/11 06:00'],"['2016/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3103-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3103-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 Feb 10;17(1):120. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3103-1.,20170210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hydroxytamoxifen 1, ferrociphenol 17 and several aryl butene analogs have shown strong antiproliferative activity on hormone-dependent and hormone-independent breast cancer cells and were evaluated in leukemia K562 cell proliferation. Their potential to induce skin depigmentation by evaluating their anti-tyrosinase activity was also estimated. In order to better rationalize the tyrosinase inhibitory action and the binding mode of the compounds, docking studies were carried out. CONCLUSION: Hydroxytamoxifen and some aryl butenes showed strong antiproliferative effects against K562 cells at 1 microM without showing tyrosinase inhibition. If phenolic compounds 16 and 17 showed the best antiproliferative activity on K562, Hydroxytamoxifen and compounds 5, 10, 20 and 21 have been identified as candidates for further development against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and are predicted to not induce depigmentation of the skin, a side effect encountered with imatinib, conventionally used for the treatment of CML.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Arbi, Mehdi El', 'Ketata, Emna', 'Neifar, Aref', 'Mihoubi, Wafa', 'Gupta, Girish K', 'Pigeon, Pascal', 'Top, Siden', 'Gargouri, Ali', 'Jaouen, Gerard']","['Arbi ME', 'Ketata E', 'Neifar A', 'Mihoubi W', 'Gupta GK', 'Pigeon P', 'Top S', 'Gargouri A', 'Jaouen G']",,"['Laboratoire de Biotechnologie Microbienne et d`Ingenierie des Enzymes (LBMIE).

This study evaluates the incidence, risk factors and outcomes of SMNs in a tertiary paediatric oncology centre in Singapore. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on patients diagnosed with childhood cancer under age 21 and treated at the National University Hospital, Singapore, from January 1990 to 15 April 2012. Case records of patients with SMNs were reviewed. Results: We identified 1124 cases of childhood cancers with a median follow-up of 3.49 (0 to 24.06) years. The most common primary malignancies were leukaemia (47.1%), central nervous system tumours (11.7%) and lymphoma (9.8%). Fifteen cases developed SMNs, most commonly acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 7). Median interval between the first and second malignancy was 3.41 (0.24 to 18.30) years. Overall 20-year cumulative incidence of SMNs was 5.3% (95% CI, 0.2% to 10.4%). The 15-year cumulative incidence of SMNs following acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was 4.4% (95% CI, 0% to 8.9%), significantly lower than the risk after osteosarcoma of 14.2% (95% CI, 0.7% to 27.7%) within 5 years (P <0.0005). Overall 5-year survival for SMNs was lower than that of primary malignancies. Conclusion: This study identified factors explaining the epidemiology of SMNs described, and found topoisomerase II inhibitor use to be a likely risk factor in our cohort. Modifications have already been made to our existing therapeutic protocols in osteosarcoma treatment. We also recognised the importance of other risk management strategies, including regular long-term surveillance and early intervention for detected SMNs, to improve outcomes of high risk patients.",,"['Lim, Jia Wei', 'Yeap, Frances Sh', 'Chan, Yiong Huak', 'Yeoh, Allen Ej', 'Quah, Thuan Chong', 'Tan, Poh Lin']","['Lim JW', 'Yeap FS', 'Chan YH', 'Yeoh AE', 'Quah TC', 'Tan PL']",,"['Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/therapy', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/therapy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Osteosarcoma/therapy', 'Pediatrics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Singapore/epidemiology', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Time Factors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,,,,2017/02/10 06:00,2017/02/22 06:00,['2017/02/10 06:00'],"['2017/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2017 Jan;46(1):11-19.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanism of TSF on treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains unclear. The present study aimed to identify the therapeutic target of TSF in diabetic renal injuries through microarray-based gene expression profiling and establish its underlying mechanism. TSF treatment significantly attenuated diabetic renal injuries by inhibiting urinary excretion of albumin and renal histological injuries in diabetic (db/db) mice. We found that PLZF might be the molecular target of TSF in DN. In vivo, the db/db mice showed a significant increase in renal protein expression of PLZF and collagen III, and decrease in renal autophagy levels (downregulated LC3 II and upregulated p62/SQSTM1) compared to db/m mice. The application of TSF resulted in the downregulation of PLZF and collagen III and upregulation of autophagy level in the kidneys of db/db mice. In vitro, TSF reduced high glucose (HG)-induced cell proliferation for NRK52E cells. Further studies indicated that the exposure of NRK52E cells to high levels of glucose resulted in the downregulation of cellular autophagy and upregulation of collagen III protein, which was reversed by TSF treatment by decreasing PLZF expression. In conclusion, TSF might have induced cellular autophagy by inhibiting PLZF expression, which in turn resulted in an increase in autophagic degradation of collagen III that attenuated diabetic renal injuries.",,"['Zhao, Hailing', 'Li, Xin', 'Zhao, Tingting', 'Zhang, Haojun', 'Yan, Meihua', 'Dong, Xi', 'Chen, Pengmin', 'Ma, Liang', 'Li, Ping']","['Zhao H', 'Li X', 'Zhao T', 'Zhang H', 'Yan M', 'Dong X', 'Chen P', 'Ma L', 'Li P']",,"['Beijing Key Lab Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases, Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Lab Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases, Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Lab Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases, Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Lab Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases, Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Lab Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases, Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Lab Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases, Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Lab Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases, Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Lab Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases, Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Clinical laboratory, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Lab Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases, Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Collagen Type III)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Collagen Type III/genetics/metabolism', 'Diabetic Nephropathies/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proteolysis', 'Rats', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC5300159,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2017/02/10 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/02/10 06:00'],"['2016/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0171475 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-42303 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Feb 9;12(2):e0171475. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0171475. eCollection 2017.,20170209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 infection is normally detected by screening for HTLV-1 antibodies, and positive samples are confirmed by Western blot (WB). However, WB fails to confirm some samples that were positive for HTLV-1 antibodies on screening. Line immunoassay (LIA) is commonly used in Europe and Brazil, but not in Japan. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of LIA as a method of confirming HTLV-1 antibodies using samples in Japan. METHODS: LIA was compared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and WB using 50 negative and 70 positive samples tested by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) in Miyazaki, Japan, an HTLV-1 endemic area. LIA (INNO-LIA HTLVI/II Score) and WB (Problot HTLV-I) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR for HTLV-1 pX region was performed using DNA derived from white blood cells. The samples that tested negative by real-time PCR were further tested by nested PCR. RESULTS: All 50 CLEIA negative samples were determined to be negative by LIA and PCR. Of the 70 positive samples, 66 tested positive by both of LIA and PCR. Three samples tested negative by LIA and PCR, and the remaining sample (PCR negative) showed non-specific staining in LIA and WB. WB showed more indeterminate results than LIA. Gp21 antibody in LIA demonstrated a high ability to discriminate between positive and negative PCR results. Furthermore, the degree of gp21 antibody reaction by LIA showed correlation with HTLV-1 proviral loads (PVLs). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LIA performs well in confirming HTLV-1 seropositivity by showing a low incidence of indeterminate results and good agreement with PCR using samples in Japan, although the number of samples tested was small. In addition, semi-quantitative antibody titer to gp21 correlated well with HTLV-1 PVLs. Further study including larger samples is necessary to determine the positioning of LIA for HTLV-1 detection in Japan.",,"['Umeki, Kazumi', 'Umekita, Kunihiko', 'Hashikura, Yuuki', 'Yamamoto, Ikuo', 'Kubo, Kazuyoshi', 'Nagatomo, Yasuhiro', 'Okayama, Akihiko']","['Umeki K', 'Umekita K', 'Hashikura Y', 'Yamamoto I', 'Kubo K', 'Nagatomo Y', 'Okayama A']",,,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp21 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', '*Blotting, Western', 'DNA, Viral/blood/genetics', '*Endemic Diseases', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Serologic Tests', 'Viral Load', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*immunology']",,,,,2017/02/10 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2017/02/10 06:00'],"['2017/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2016.160501 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2017 Feb 1;63(2):227-233. doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2016.160501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL1 forms a complex with WDR5, RBBP5, and ASH2L (WRA) which stimulates its activity. The MM-102 compound prevents the interaction between MLL1 and WDR5 and functions as an MLL1 inhibitor. We have studied the effects of four cancer mutations in the catalytic SET domain of MLL1 on the enzymatic activity of MLL1 and MLL1-WRA complexes. In addition, we studied the interaction of the MLL1 mutants with the WRA proteins and inhibition of MLL1-WRA complexes by MM-102. All four investigated mutations had strong effects on the activity of MLL1. R3903H was inactive and S3865F showed reduced activity both alone and in complex with WRA, but its activity was stimulated by the WRA complex. By contrast, R3864C and R3841W were both more active than wild-type MLL1, but still less active than the wild-type MLL1-WRA complex. Both mutants were not stimulated by complex formation with WRA, although no differences in the interaction with the complex proteins were observed. These results indicate that both mutants are in an active conformation even in the absence of the WRA complex and their normal control of activity by the WRA complex is altered. In agreement with this observation, the activity of R3864C and R3841W was not reduced by addition of the MM-102 inhibitor. We show that different cancer mutations in MLL1 lead to a loss or increase in activity, illustrating the complex and tumor-specific role of MLL1 in carcinogenesis. Our data exemplify that biochemical investigations of somatic tumor mutations are required to decipher their pathological role.

This changed when the first CD20 antibody rituximab was introduced. Since 2008, the combination of chemotherapy and CD20 antibodies has become the standard of care for most patients, and a significant fraction of patients had very long-lasting remissions after chemoimmunotherapy. Despite the improvement of response rates and overall survival (OS) by the use of chemoimmunotherapy, most CLL patients will relapse eventually. One approach to achieve more durable responses was the development of obinutuzumab (GA101), a new type of CD20 antibody that has unique molecular and functional characteristics. Obinutuzumab is a type II fully humanized CD20 antibody that binds to a partly different epitope of the CD20 protein than rituximab and due to its glycoengineered design induces greater antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Initial preclinical observations of a more effective B-cell depletion have been successfully reproduced in clinical trials with CLL patients.

Therefore, to improve the capacity of the anticancer activity of carboplatin, we investigated whether combined treatment with carboplatin and thioridazine, which has antipsychotic and anticancer activities, has a synergistic effect on apoptosis. Combined treatment with carboplatin and thioridazine markedly induced caspase-mediated apoptosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (AMC-HN4) cells. Combined treatment with carboplatin and thioridazine induced downregulation of Mcl-1 and c-FLIP expression. Ectopic expression of Mcl-1 and c-FLIP inhibited carboplatin plus thioridazine-induced apoptosis. We found that augmentation of proteasome activity had a critical role in downregulation of Mcl-1 and c-FLIP expression at the post-translational level in carboplatin plus thioridazine-treated cells. Furthermore, carboplatin plus thioridazine induced upregulation of the expression of proteasome subunit alpha 5 (PSMA5) through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. In addition, combined treatment with carboplatin and thioridazine markedly induced apoptosis in human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB231) and glioma (U87MG) cells, but not in human normal mesangial cells and normal human umbilical vein cells (EA.hy926).

It has anti-neoplastic effects on multiple hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Tenovin-6 was recently shown to impair the autophagy pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and pediatric soft tissue sarcoma cells. However, whether tenovin-6 has a general inhibitory effect on autophagy and whether there is any involvement with SIRT1 and p53, both of which are regulators of the autophagy pathway, remain unclear. In this study, we have demonstrated that tenovin-6 increases microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3-II) level in diverse cell types in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, the increase of LC3-II by tenovin-6 is caused by inhibition of the classical autophagy pathway via impairing lysosomal function without affecting the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Furthermore, we have revealed that tenovin-6 activation of p53 is cell type dependent, and tenovin-6 inhibition of autophagy is not dependent on its regulatory functions on p53 and SIRT1. Our results have shown that tenovin-6 is a potent autophagy inhibitor, and raised the precaution in interpreting results where tenovin-6 is used as an inhibitor of SIRT1.",,"['Yuan, Hongfeng', 'Tan, Brandon', 'Gao, Shou-Jiang']","['Yuan H', 'Tan B', 'Gao SJ']",,"['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (tenovin-6)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Autophagosomes/metabolism', 'Autophagy/*physiology', 'Benzamides/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Sirtuin 1/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",PMC5386474,,,,2017/02/10 06:00,2017/11/01 06:00,['2017/02/10 06:00'],"['2016/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201725 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.25 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Feb 9;8(2):e2608. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.25.,20170209,,"['R01 CA197153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA124332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA213275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE025465/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA180779/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132637/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,['Cell Death Dis. 2018 Jul 16;9(8):790.

The treatment of luteolin in these GC cells significantly inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and reduced the expression of STAT3 targeting gene Mcl-1, Survivin and Bcl-xl. Silencing of SHP-1, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, abolished the inhibitory effect of luteolin on STAT3 and cell apoptosis, suggesting that SHP-1 is crucial in luteolin-mediated cellular function. Moreover, this luteolin effect of STAT3 dephosphorylation by SHP-1 involved in HSP-90, which protected STAT3 phosphorylation by forming HSP-90/STAT3 complex. Thus, luteolin inhibited STAT3 activation through disrupting the binding of HSP-90 to STAT3, which promoted its interaction to SHP-1, resulted in the dephosphorylation of STAT3.

Chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs and targeted therapy is required when surgery is difficult, ineffective, or impossible. We previously synthesized the novel synthetic 1-benzylindole derivative 21-900 and found that it inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities and tubulin assembly. Here we tested its effects on the human leukaemia cell lines HL-60 and MOLT-4 in vitro and in vivo. We found that its potent cytotoxic effects were mediated through cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, which increased the population of sub-G1 cells, leading to apoptosis. Further, tubulin was depolymerized by 21-900 in a manner similar to that of vincristine, leading to disruption of microtubule dynamics and increased levels of the mitotic marker MPM-2.

Here, using a combination of Chip-seq to enrich enhancer DNA and a computational approach with multiple DNA alignment procedures, we identify enhancer-associated small insertion variants. Among the 102 tumour cell genomes we analyse, small insertions are frequently observed in enhancer DNA sequences near known oncogenes. Further study of one insertion, somatically acquired in primary leukaemia tumour genomes, reveals that it nucleates formation of an active enhancer that drives expression of the LMO2 oncogene.

Using a machine-learning algorithm we have previously developed the AL- European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) score for prediction of mortality following transplantation. We report here the first external validation of the AL-EBMT score in a cohort of AL patients from the Italian national transplantation network. A total of 1848 patients transplanted between the years 2000-2014 were analyzed. The median age was 45.9. Indications for HSCT were Acute Myeloid Leukemia (68.1%) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (31.9%). The majority of patients were in first complete remission (60.4%), and received myeloablative conditioning (81.3%). Median follow-up was 2 years. The score was well-calibrated for prediction of day 100 mortality and 2-year overall survival (OS), leukemia free survival (LFS), and nonrelapse related mortality, with corresponding area under the receiver-operator curves of 0.698, 0.651, 0.653, and 0.651, respectively. Increasing score intervals were associated with a decreasing probability of 2-year OS and LFS. The highest scoring group was associated with a hazard ratio of 3.16, 2.8, and 2.27 for 2-year OS, LFS, and NRM, respectively. In conclusion, the AL-EBMT score identified three distinct risk groups and was predictive of OS. It is a valid tool for stratifying the risk of acute leukemia patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Shouval, Roni', 'Bonifazi, Francesca', 'Fein, Joshua', 'Boschini, Cristina', 'Oldani, Elena', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Raimondi, Roberto', 'Sacchi, Nicoletta', 'Dabash, Osamah', 'Unger, Ron', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Shouval R', 'Bonifazi F', 'Fein J', 'Boschini C', 'Oldani E', 'Labopin M', 'Raimondi R', 'Sacchi N', 'Dabash O', 'Unger R', 'Mohty M', 'Rambaldi A', 'Nagler A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9827-8032'],"['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Dr. Pinchas Bornstein Talpiot Medical Leadership Program, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'S.

However, the mechanisms used by lncRNAs to control transcription remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we report on HOTAIRM1, a promising lncRNA biomarker in leukemia and solid tumors. We find that HOTAIRM1 contributes to three-dimensional chromatin organization changes required for the temporal collinear activation of HOXA genes. We show that distinct HOTAIRM1 variants preferentially associate with either UTX/MLL or PRC2 complexes to modulate the levels of activating and silencing marks at the bivalent domain. HOTAIRM1 contributes to physical dissociation of chromatin loops at the cluster proximal end, which delays recruitment of the histone demethylase UTX and transcription of central HOXA genes. Interestingly, we find overall proximal HOXA gene activation without chromatin conformation changes by HOTAIRM1 in a different cell type.

Many CAPs including defensins also exhibit selective cytotoxic activity towards mammalian cells via both apoptotic and non-apoptotic processes, and are being investigated as potential anticancer agents. The anti-fungal plant defensin from ornamental tobacco, Nicotiana alata Defensin 1 (NaD1), was recently shown to induce necrotic-like cell death in a number of tumor cell types within 30 min of treatment, at a concentration of 10 muM. NaD1-mediated cell killing within these experimental parameters has been shown to occur via binding to the plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in target cells to facilitate membrane destabilization and subsequent lysis. Whether NaD1 is also capable of inducing apoptosis in tumor cells has not been reported previously. In this study, treatment of MM170 (melanoma) and Jurkat T (leukemia) cells with subacute (<10 muM) concentrations of NaD1 over 6-24 h was investigated to determine whether NaD1 could induce cell death via apoptosis. At subacute concentrations, NaD1 did not efficiently induce membrane permeabilization within 30 min, but markedly reduced cell viability over 24 h. In contrast to other CAPs that have been shown to induce apoptosis through caspase activation, dying cells were not sensitive to a pancaspase inhibitor nor did they display caspase activity or DNA fragmentation over the 24 h treatment time. Furthermore, over the 24 h period, cells exhibited necrotic phenotypes and succumbed to membrane permeabilization. These results indicate that the cytotoxic mechanism of NaD1 at subacute concentrations is membranolytic rather than apoptotic and is also likely to be mediated through a PIP2-targeting cell lytic pathway.",,"['Baxter, Amy A', 'Poon, Ivan Kh', 'Hulett, Mark D']","['Baxter AA', 'Poon IK', 'Hulett MD']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University , Melbourne, VIC 3086, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University , Melbourne, VIC 3086, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University , Melbourne, VIC 3086, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,,,,PMC5253418,,,,2017/02/10 06:00,2017/02/10 06:01,['2017/02/10 06:00'],"['2016/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.102 [doi]'],epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2017 Jan 23;3:16102. doi: 10.1038/cddiscovery.2016.102. eCollection 2017.,20170123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, aberrant RAG1/2 activity promotes lymphocyte malignancies by causing chromosomal translocations and DNA deletions at cancer genes. RAG1/2 can also induce genomic DNA insertions by transposition and trans-V(D)J recombination, but only few such putative events have been documented in vivo. We used next-generation sequencing techniques to examine chromosomal rearrangements in primary murine B cells and discovered that RAG1/2 causes aberrant insertions by releasing cleaved antibody gene fragments that subsequently reintegrate into DNA breaks induced on a heterologous chromosome. We confirmed that RAG1/2 also mobilizes genomic DNA into independent physiological breaks by identifying similar insertions in human lymphoma and leukemia. Our findings reveal a novel RAG1/2-mediated insertion pathway distinct from DNA transposition and trans-V(D)J recombination that destabilizes the genome and shares features with reported oncogenic DNA insertions.",['(c) 2017 Rommel et al.'],"['Rommel, Philipp C', 'Oliveira, Thiago Y', 'Nussenzweig, Michel C', 'Robbiani, Davide F']","['Rommel PC', 'Oliveira TY', 'Nussenzweig MC', 'Robbiani DF']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9790-4086', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2654-0879', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0592-8564', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7379-3484']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065 drobbiani@rockefeller.edu nussen@rockefeller.edu.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065 drobbiani@rockefeller.edu nussen@rockefeller.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (IgK)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Genomic Instability', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'V(D)J Recombination']",PMC5339680,,,,2017/02/10 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/02/10 06:00'],"['2016/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20161638 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20161638 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2017 Mar 6;214(3):815-831. doi: 10.1084/jem.20161638.

The addition of more cases with the same genetic characteristics would establish an acquired aberration as a recurrent change, help determine its prognostic significance, and can provide insight into the mechanisms of leukemogenesis in patients with these rare abnormalities. CASE REPORT: RNA-sequencing was performed on a patient with AML with the bone marrow karyotype 46,XY,t(3;5)(p24;q14)[5]/46,XY[10]. The translocation resulted in fusion of the SATB homeobox 1 gene (SATB1) (3p24) with an expression sequence tag with accession number BG503445 (5q14). The SATB1-BG503445 transcript may code for a SATB1 protein that would lack the C-terminal DNA-binding homeodomain. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to demonstrate rearrangement and disruption of SATB1 in AML. Rearrangements of chromosome band 3p24 were reported in 24 additional AMLs but not in known leukemia-specific chromosomal abnormalities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were exposed for 24 h to increasing concentrations of the studied compounds and cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide staining. Disturbances in apoptosis rate and cell cycle were also examined. RESULTS: Cytotoxic activity of the new platinum complex cis-[PtCl2(TCEP)2] was higher compared to that of cisplatin and cell death was associated with apoptosis. However, the tested compound differently affected the cell-cycle progression than cisplatin. CONCLUSION: The cis-[PtCl2(TCEP)2] seems to be a potent anticancer agent, although further investigations are necessary to elucidate its biological activity.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Henklewska, Marta', 'Pawlak, Aleksandra', 'Pruchnik, Hanna', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz, Bozena']","['Henklewska M', 'Pawlak A', 'Pruchnik H', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz B']",,"['Department of Biochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland marta.henklewska@up.wroc.pl.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Physics and Biophysics, Faculty of Life Sciences and Technology, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Phosphines)', '22OAC2MO2S (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dog Diseases/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/pathology/*veterinary', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Phosphines/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Pt-TCEP', 'apoptosis', 'canine leukemia', 'canine lymphoma', 'cisplatin']",,2017/02/10 06:00,2017/02/14 06:00,['2017/02/10 06:00'],"['2016/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['37/2/539 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11346 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2017 Feb;37(2):539-546. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11346.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is required for specification of the blood program during development, adult hematopoietic stem cell survival and quiescence, and terminal maturation of select blood lineages. Following ectopic expression, SCL contributes to oncogenesis in T-ALL. Remarkably, SCL's activities are all mediated through nucleation of a core quaternary protein complex (SCL:E-protein:LMO1/2 [LIM domain only 1 or 2]:LDB1 [LIM domain-binding protein 1]) and dynamic recruitment of conserved combinatorial associations of additional regulators in a lineage- and stage-specific context. The finely tuned control of SCL's regulatory functions (lineage priming, activation, and repression of gene expression programs) provides insight into fundamental developmental and transcriptional mechanisms, and highlights mechanistic parallels between normal and oncogenic processes.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is curative for FA-related marrow failure or leukemia, but both radiation exposure during transplant and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) may increase risk of later malignancies of the head and neck and anogenital area. In this study, we tested a radiation-free conditioning regimen with a T-cell-depleted graft to eliminate radiation exposure and minimize early and late toxicities of transplant. Forty-five patients (median age, 8.2 years; range 4.3-44) with FA underwent HCT between June 2009 and May 2014. The preparative regimen included busulfan, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin. Busulfan levels were monitored to avoid excess toxicity. All grafts were CD34-selected/T-cell-depleted using the CliniMacs CD34 columns (Miltenyi). Thirty-four patients (75.6%) with marrow failure and 11 (24.4%) with myelodysplastic syndrome underwent HCT using matched unrelated (n = 25, 55.5%), mismatched unrelated (n = 14, 31.1%), or mismatched related donors (n = 6, 13.4%). One year probabilities of overall and disease-free survival for the entire cohort, including patients with myeloid malignancy and those receiving mismatched related/haploidentical grafts, were 80% (+/-6%) and 77.7% (+/-6.2%), respectively (median follow-up 41 months).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data including clinical and laboratory characteristics and treatment strategies of JMML patients were collected retrospectively from pediatric hematology-oncology centers in Turkey. RESULTS: Sixty-five children with JMML diagnosed between 2002 and 2016 in 18 institutions throughout Turkey were enrolled in the study. The median age at diagnosis was 17 months (min-max: 2-117 months). Splenomegaly was present in 92% of patients at the time of diagnosis. The median white blood cell, monocyte, and platelet counts were 32.9x109/L, 5.4x109/L, and 58.3x109/L, respectively. Monosomy 7 was present in 18% of patients. JMML mutational analysis was performed in 32 of 65 patients (49%) and PTPN11 was the most common mutation. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) could only be performed in 28 patients (44%), the majority being after the year 2012. The most frequent reason for not performing HSCT was the inability to find a suitable donor. The median time from diagnosis to HSCT was 9 months (min-max: 2-63 months). The 5-year cumulative survival rate was 33% and median estimated survival time was 30+/-17.4 months (95% CI: 0-64.1) for all patients. Survival time was significantly better in the HSCT group (log-rank p=0.019). Older age at diagnosis (>2 years), platelet count of less than 40x109/L, and PTPN11 mutation were the factors significantly associated with shorter survival time. CONCLUSION: Although there has recently been improvement in terms of definitive diagnosis and HSCT in JMML patients, the overall results are not satisfactory and it is necessary to put more effort into this issue in Turkey.",,"['Tufekci, Ozlem', 'Kocak, Ulker', 'Kaya, Zuhre', 'Yenicesu, Idil', 'Albayrak, Canan', 'Albayrak, Davut', 'Yilmaz Bengoa, Sebnem', 'Patiroglu, Turkan', 'Karakukcu, Musa',

Herein, investigation of the relationship between the N363S and BclI polymorphisms of the GC receptor gene (NR3C1) and the side effects of GCs during pediatric ALL therapy was aimed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: N363S and BclI polymorphisms were analyzed in 49 patients with ALL treated between 2000 and 2012. The control group consisted of 46 patients with benign disorders. The side effects of GCs noted during the induction and reinduction periods were evaluated retrospectively according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. RESULTS: The BclI allele and genotype frequencies were found similar in the two groups. No N363S polymorphism was detected in either of the groups. During induction, dyspepsia was found more frequently in the CG than in the CC (wild-type) genotype (36.4% vs. 5.3%, p=0.018) and depression symptoms more frequent in patients with the G allele (CG+GG) than the CC genotype (39.3% vs. 10.5%, p=0.031). During reinduction, Cushingoid changes, dyspepsia, and depression symptoms were more frequent in patients with the G allele (CG+GG) than in patients with the CC genotype (48.1% vs. 17.6%, p=0.041; 29.6% vs. 0.0%, p=0.016; 40.7% vs. 11.8%, p=0.040, respectively). CONCLUSION: In our study, patients with the BclI polymorphism were found to have developed more frequent side effects.

We performed a systematic search and review to identify publications on ATL in these countries to verify if this disease was getting recognition in these regions as well as the characteristics of the observed cases. The median age of 49.4 years was lower than that referred to in Japan. According to our findings in most Brazilian states and in some other countries, ATL is not being recognized and should be strongly considered in the differential diagnosis of T-cell leukemias/lymphomas. Failure to identify these cases may be due to the unsystematic realization of serology for HTLV-1 and phenotypic identification of non-Hodgkin lymphomas that may result from lack of resources. Detection of ATL cases has been more feasible with cooperation from foreign research centers.

METHODS: The medical literature and ongoing clinical trials were reviewed on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment of leukemic and lymphomatous meningitis. RESULTS: Treatment for secondary leukemic and lymphomatous meningitis remains unsatisfactory, and efforts should be made to prevent and treat subclinical disease. Intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy remain the main therapeutic approaches for this disease. Outcomes have improved in patients with primary CNS lymphoma and meningeal involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate selection of patients at high risk for leukemic and lymphomatous meningitis is important so that preventive strategies can decrease the incidence of this complication of leukemia and lymphoma.

However, with regard to its role in solid tumors, few studies are available and less are for colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we aim to investigate the expression and clinical significance of TCL1A in a cohort of 278 stage II/III CRC patients. As a result, we find TCL1A expression is higher in CRC tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues, and significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, TNM stage and Ki-67 positive rate. The prognostic analysis suggests that TCL1A expression is an independent factor affecting CRC-specific and disease-free survival of these patients. Furthermore, we find stage II/III patients with high TCL1A expression have a significantly higher rate of postoperative local recurrence and metastasis than those with low TCL1A expression. Finally, through subgroup analysis, we find TCL1A expression can stratify the outcome of stage II/III patients who received standard adjuvant chemotherapy. Taken together, our findings suggest TCL1A is not only a useful biomarker for prognostic evaluation in stage II/III CRC patients, but also a promising therapeutic target for improving their clinical outcome.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

METHODS: In a retrospective study of all laboratory-confirmed hMPV infections treated at the authors' institution between April 2012 and May 2015, clinical characteristics, risk factors for progression to an LRI, treatment, and outcomes in patients with cancer were determined. RESULTS: In total, 181 hMPV infections were identified in 90 patients (50%) with hematologic malignancies (HMs), in 57 (31%) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients, and in 34 patients (19%) with solid tumors. Most patients (92%) had a community-acquired infection and presented with URIs (67%), and 43% developed LRIs (59 presented with LRIs and 19 progressed from a URI to an LRI). On multivariable analysis, an underlying HM (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-8.64; P = .029), nosocomial infection (aOR, 26.9; 95% CI, 2.79-259.75; P = .004), and hypoxia (oxygen saturation [SpO2], </= 92%) at presentation (aOR, 9.61; 95% CI, 1.98-46.57; P = .005) were identified as independent factors associated with LRI. All-cause mortality at 30 days from hMPV diagnosis was low (4%), and patients with LRIs had a 10% mortality rate at day 30 from diagnosis; whereas patients with URIs had a 0% mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: hMPV infections in patients with cancer may cause significant morbidity, especially for those with underlying HM who may develop an LRI. Despite high morbidity and the lack of directed antiviral therapy for hMPV infections, mortality at day 30 from this infection remained low in this studied population. Cancer 2017;123:2329-2337.

Cancer cell plasticity in response to evolutionary pressures is fundamental to tumour progression and the development of therapeutic resistance. Here we determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cancer cell plasticity in a conditional oncogenic Kras mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a malignancy that displays considerable phenotypic diversity and morphological heterogeneity. In this model, stochastic extinction of oncogenic Kras signalling and emergence of Kras-independent escaper populations (cells that acquire oncogenic properties) are associated with de-differentiation and aggressive biological behaviour. Transcriptomic and functional analyses of Kras-independent escapers reveal the presence of Smarcb1-Myc-network-driven mesenchymal reprogramming and independence from MAPK signalling. A somatic mosaic model of PDAC, which allows time-restricted perturbation of cell fate, shows that depletion of Smarcb1 activates the Myc network, driving an anabolic switch that increases protein metabolism and adaptive activation of endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-induced survival pathways. Increased protein turnover renders mesenchymal sub-populations highly susceptible to pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the cellular proteostatic machinery and the IRE1-alpha-MKK4 arm of the endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-response pathway. Specifically, combination regimens that impair the unfolded protein responses block the emergence of aggressive mesenchymal subpopulations in mouse and patient-derived PDAC models. These molecular and biological insights inform a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting aggressive mesenchymal features of PDAC.",,"['Genovese, Giannicola', 'Carugo, Alessandro', 'Tepper,

RESULTS: Literature search identified 27 eligible studies comprising 96756 subjects (cases: 38231) and investigating 687 polymorphisms involving 14 clock genes. Overall, 1025 primary and subgroup meta-analyses on 366 gene variants were performed. Study distribution by tumor was as follows: breast cancer (n=15), prostate cancer (n=3), pancreatic cancer (n=2), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=2), glioma (n=1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=1), colorectal cancer (n=1), non-small cell lung cancer (n=1) and ovarian cancer (n=1).We identified 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with cancer risk: NPAS2 rs10165970 (mixed and breast cancer shiftworkers), rs895520 (mixed), rs17024869 (breast) and rs7581886 (breast); CLOCK rs3749474 (breast) and rs11943456 (breast); RORA rs7164773 (breast and breast cancer postmenopausal), rs10519097 (breast); RORB rs7867494 (breast cancer postmenopausal), PER3 rs1012477 (breast cancer subgroups) and assessed the level of quality evidence to be intermediate. We also identified polymorphisms with lower quality statistically significant associations (n=30). CONCLUSIONS: Our work supports the hypothesis that genetic variation of clock genes might affect cancer risk. These findings also highlight the need for more efforts in this research field in order to fully establish the contribution of clock gene variants to the risk of developing cancer. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence on the association between clock genes' germline variants and the risk of developing cancer. To assess result credibility, summary evidence was graded according to the Venice criteria and false positive report probability (FPRP) was calculated to further validate result noteworthiness. Subgroup meta-analysis was also performed based on participant features and tumor type. The breast cancer subgroup was further stratified by work conditions, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status and menopausal status, conditions associated with the risk of breast cancer in different studies.",,"['Benna, Clara', 'Helfrich-Forster, Charlotte', 'Rajendran, Senthilkumar', 'Monticelli, Halenya', 'Pilati, Pierluigi', 'Nitti, Donato', 'Mocellin, Simone']","['Benna C', 'Helfrich-Forster C', 'Rajendran S', 'Monticelli H', 'Pilati P', 'Nitti D', 'Mocellin S']",,"['Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Neurobiology and Genetics, Theodor-Boveri Institute, Biocenter, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Clinica Chirurgica I, Azienda Ospedaliera Padova, Padova, Italy.', ""Sant'Antonio Hospital, Padova, Italy."", 'Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Clinica Chirurgica I, Azienda Ospedaliera Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto, IOV-IRCSS, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,IM,"['Adult', 'Circadian Clocks/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Risk Factors']",PMC5410358,['NOTNLM'],"['SNP', 'cancer risk', 'circadian rhythms', 'clock genes', 'meta-analysis']",,2017/02/09 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/02/09 06:00'],"['2016/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['15074 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.15074 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 4;8(14):23978-23995. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.15074.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Death receptor signaling is modulated by nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), a family of transcription factors which are constitutively active in B-cell malignancies. We and others have shown that pevonedistat, an investigational inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme, abrogates NFkappaB activity in B-cell neoplasia. Here we demonstrate that diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, particularly activated B-cell type, and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells are re-sensitized to extrinsic apoptosis by pevonedistat. Pevonedistat enhanced caspase-8 processing following death receptor ligation, and downmodulated cFLIP, a NFkappaB-regulated protease-deficient caspase homolog. However, treatment with pevonedistat did not modulate death-inducing signaling complex in neoplastic B-cells, suggesting that they were sensitized to death ligands through the mitochondrial pathway.

Ten derivatives were synthesized and tested for antileukemic effects on 2 human acute leukemia cell lines, K562 and Jurkat. The most cytotoxic of these derivatives, compound 21, was chosen for investigation of cytotoxicity mechanisms. The results obtained with selectivity calculations revealed that compound 21 is more selective for acute leukemia (K562 and Jurkat cell lines) than for other tumor cell lines. Moreover, compound 21 was not cytotoxic to normal cell lines, indicating a potential use in clinical tests. Compound 21 caused a significant cell cycle arrest in the S-phase in Jurkat cells and increased the proportion of cells in the sub G0/G1 phase in both cell lines. Cells treated with compound 21 demonstrated morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis in the EB/AO assay, confirmed by externalization of phosphatidylserine by the annexin V - fluorescein isothiocyanate method and by DNA fragmentation.

However, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for children with leukaemia remains unknown due to early termination of the Phase I trial. The aim of this study was to develop a population model of AT9283 to describe the pharmacokinetics in adults and children and to estimate the MTD in children with leukaemia. METHODS: Data from Phase I dose-escalation studies in adults and children were used to build a population pharmacokinetic model (NONMEM v7.3). Potential covariates investigated included body weight, body surface area (BSA), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), age and sex. Model-derived area under the concentration-time curve was used to investigate the relationship between dose and exposure in adults and children. RESULTS: The plasma concentrations of AT9283 (n = 1770) from 92 patients (53 adults, 39 children) were used to build a two-compartment model with all pharmacokinetic parameters scaled using body weight. Renal function (GFR), but not BSA, was a significant covariate for the clearance of AT9283. In children with leukaemia (median weight 16 kg), a flat dose of 500 mg 72 h(-1) provided similar drug exposures at the MTD as the adult population. The estimated MTD for children with leukaemia, therefore, is 30 mg kg(-1) 72 h(-1) . CONCLUSION: For adults, GFR was a significant predictor of clearance, whilst body-weight based dosing was more useful than BSA in determining the drug exposure in children. The MTD was estimated to be 30 mg kg(-1) 72 h(-1) children with leukaemia.",['(c) 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Duong, Janna K', 'Griffin, Melanie J', 'Hargrave, Darren', 'Vormoor, Josef', 'Edwards, David', 'Boddy, Alan V']","['Duong JK', 'Griffin MJ', 'Hargrave D', 'Vormoor J', 'Edwards D', 'Boddy AV']",,"['Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', ""Great North Children's Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."", 'Cancer Research UK, London, UK.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0', '(1-cyclopropyl-3-(3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-y', 'l)urea)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Body Surface Area', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Urea/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC5510070,['NOTNLM'],"['*aurora kinase inhibitor', '*maximum tolerated dose', '*paediatric', '*pharmacokinetics', '*phase I oncology trial']",,2017/02/09 06:00,2018/04/13 06:00,['2017/02/09 06:00'],"['2016/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.13260 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2017 Aug;83(8):1713-1722. doi: 10.1111/bcp.13260.

In this study, we investigated the antileukemic effects of ATR inhibition alone or combined with cytarabine in AML cells. Treatment with the ATR-selective inhibitor AZ20 caused proliferation inhibition in AML cell lines and primary patient samples. It partially abolished the G2 cell cycle checkpoint and caused DNA replication stress and damage, accompanied by CDK1-independent apoptosis and downregulation of RRM1 and RRM2. AZ20 synergistically enhanced cytarabine-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis, abolished cytarabine-induced S and G2/M cell cycle arrest, and cooperated with cytarabine in inducing DNA replication stress and damage in AML cell lines. These key findings were confirmed with another ATR-selective inhibitor AZD6738. Therefore, the cooperative induction of DNA replication stress and damage by ATR inhibition and cytarabine, and the ability of ATR inhibition to abrogate the G2 cell cycle checkpoint both contributed to the synergistic induction of apoptosis and proliferation inhibition in AML cell lines.

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched Medline (Mainly Pubmed), Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure), Chinese Biomedical Literature (Chinese) and Wanfang (Chinese) Databases to collect articles that evaluated the polymorphism of GSTs gene in child patients with ALL. We also reviewed reference lists from retrieved articles. Two researchers evaluated study eligibility and extracted the data independently, and disagreements were resolved by discussion. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of each study. The principal outcome measure was the odds ratio (OR) with 95% con fi dence interval (CI) for the risk of child ALL associated with GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 Ile105Val. The data were analyzed using Stata (Version 12.0) software. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: This meta-analysis included 30 studies for GSTM1 polymorphism, 27 studies for GSTM1 polymorphism and 10 studies for GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism. The combined results based on all studies showed that GSTM1 (OR= 1.297, 95% CI= 1.105-1.523, P=0.001) and GSTT1 polymorphism (OR=1.213, 95% CI=1.031-1.427, P= 020) contributes to the development of childhood ALL, while no association was found in all comparison models of GSTP1 Ile105Val variants (homozygote model: OR=1.234, 95% CI=0.966-1.578, P=0.093, heterozygote model: OR=1.072, 95% CI=0.931-1.235, P=0.331, dominant model: OR=1.104, 95% CI=0.965-1.262, P=0.149, recessive model: OR=1.184, 95% CI=0.934-1.499, P=0.162, and allele comparison model: OR=1.096, 95% CI=0.988-1.216, P=0.083).

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematological malignancy that results from the acquisition of multiple genetic alterations, which in some instances are associated with deregulated protein-phosphotyrosine (pY) mediated signaling networks. However, although individual PTKs and PTPs have been linked to AML and other malignancies, analysis of protein-pY networks as a function of activated PTKs and PTPs has not been done. In this study, MS was used to characterize AML proteomes, and phospho-proteome-subsets including pY proteins, PTKs, and PTPs. AML proteomes resolved into two groups related to high or low degrees of maturation according to French-American-British classification, and reflecting differential expression of cell surface antigens. AML pY proteomes reflect canonical, spatially organized signaling networks, unrelated to maturation, with heterogeneous expression of activated receptor and nonreceptor PTKs. We present the first integrated analysis of the pY-proteome, activated PTKs, and PTPs. Every PTP and most PTKs have both positive and negative associations with the pY-proteome. pY proteins resolve into groups with shared PTK and PTP correlations.

The presented data come from 16 open-ended face-to-face interviews with palliative paediatric patients, their parents and physicians. The interviews were carried out in eight paediatric oncology centres in Switzerland. Data analysis followed Arthur Frank's dialogical narrative analysis. Quest narratives were relatively rare compared to both chaos and restitution stories. All participants welcomed chaos stories as a liminal haven between quest and restitution. The possibility that the child could die was either ignored or briefly contemplated, but then immediately pushed away. Except for one patient, children never directly addressed the topic of death. The way in which death was presented raises important questions about how the social discourse on dying is framed in terms of choice, autonomy and individuality.

Immunohistochemistry analysis and western blot analysis were used to detect the levels of SRF and Bcl-2 in rats exposed to hypoxia. Furthermore, the regulatory relationship between SRF and Bcl-2 was investigated in PASMCs using real-time PCR and western-blot analysis. We found that mPAP (mean pulmonary arterial pressure) and WA (the ratio of vascular wall area to external diameter) were increased after exposure to hypoxia, while LA (the ratio of vascular lumen area to total area) decreased after exposure to hypoxia. The immunohistochemistry analysis displayed a substantial increase in SRF and Bcl-2 in pulmonary arterial walls after 14 days of hypoxia. And the western blotting showed that SRF and Bcl-2 protein levels were much higher after 7 days of hypoxia and then remained at a high level. And then the levels of SRF and Bcl-2 in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) exposed to hypoxia were substantially suppressed following introduction of SRF siRNA, and the level of Bcl-2 was remarkably inhibited by Bcl-2 siRNA, while Bcl-2 siRNA had no effect on SRF level. Finally, SRF siRNA, and Bcl-2 siRNA significantly reduced viability of PASMCs exposed to hypoxia, and enhanced apoptosis of PASMCs exposed to hypoxia. These data validated that SRF responded to hypoxia, which subsequently was involved in pulmonary hypertension by abnormally promoting viability of PASMCs via modulating expression of Bcl-2. J. Cell.

SHP-2 regulates many cellular functions including growth, differentiation, migration, and survival. Genetic and biochemical evidence show that SHP-2 is required for rat sarcoma viral oncogene/extracellular signal-regulated kinases mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation by most tyrosine kinase receptors, as well as by G-protein-coupled and cytokine receptors. In addition, SHP-2 can regulate the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription, nuclear factor-kappaB, phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase/Akt, RhoA, Hippo, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways. Emerging evidence has shown that SHP-2 dysfunction represents a key factor in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases, in particular in chronic inflammation and cancer. Variations within the gene locus encoding SHP-2 have been associated with increased susceptibility to develop ulcerative colitis and gastric atrophy. Furthermore, mice with conditional deletion of SHP-2 in intestinal epithelial cells rapidly develop severe colitis. Similarly, hepatocyte-specific deletion of SHP-2 induces hepatic inflammation, resulting in regenerative hyperplasia and development of tumors in aged mice. However, the SHP-2 gene initially was suggested to be a proto-oncogene because activating mutations of this gene were found in pediatric leukemias and certain forms of liver and colon cancers. Moreover, SHP-2 expression is up-regulated in gastric and hepatocellular cancers. Notably, SHP-2 functions downstream of cytotoxin-associated antigen A (CagA), the major virulence factor of Helicobacter pylori, and is associated with increased risks of gastric cancer. Further compounding this complexity, most recent findings suggest that SHP-2 also coordinates carbohydrate, lipid, and bile acid synthesis in the liver and pancreas.

The frequency of symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement is unknown but thought to be a rare phenomenon. Currently there are no known risk factors for CNS involvement. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a clinically staged low-risk CLL case that presented with symptomatic CNS involvement and progressed rapidly to death. Evaluation of the surface adhesion molecules identified a markedly altered expression pattern of the integrin, CD49d, and the tetraspanin, CD82, in the index case when compared to similar low-risk CLL cases. We found that the early Rai clinical stage CLL patients showed linear correlation for the co-expression of CD82 and CD49d. In contrast, this unique index case with CNS involvement, which has the same Rai clinical stage, had a significantly lower expression of CD82 and higher expression of CD49d. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the expression profile of CD49d and CD82 may represent potential biomarkers for patients with increased propensity of CNS involvement. Moreover, this study illustrates the critical need for a better mechanistic understanding of how specific adhesion proteins regulate the interactions between CLL cells and various tissue sites.",,"['Rojas-Hernandez, Cristhiam M', 'Nemunaitis, Jacklyn', 'Marjon, Kristopher D', 'Bustamante, Daniel', 'Zhang, Qian-Yun', 'Gillette, Jennifer M']","['Rojas-Hernandez CM', 'Nemunaitis J', 'Marjon KD', 'Bustamante D', 'Zhang QY', 'Gillette JM']",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM USA.0000 0001 2188 8502grid.266832.b', 'Department of Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM USA.0000 0001 2188 8502grid.266832.b', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM USA.0000 0001 2188 8502grid.266832.b', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM USA.0000 0001 2188 8502grid.266832.b', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM USA.0000 0001 2188 8502grid.266832.b', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM USA.0000 0001 2188 8502grid.266832.b']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],England,BMC Hematol,BMC hematology,101609487,,,,PMC5290634,['NOTNLM'],"['CD49d', 'CD82', 'Central nervous system', 'Leukemia']",,2017/02/09 06:00,2017/02/09 06:01,['2017/02/09 06:00'],"['2015/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12878-017-0073-0 [doi]', '73 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Hematol. 2017 Feb 2;17:3. doi: 10.1186/s12878-017-0073-0. eCollection 2017.,20170202,,"['P20 GM103451/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA118100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNA sequencing of fourteen pediatric cases previously identified novel fusion transcripts that are predicted to be pathological including CBFA2T3-GLIS2, GATA2-HOXA9, MN1-FLI and NIPBL-HOXB9. In contrast to CBFA2T3-GLIS2, which is insufficient to induce leukemia, we demonstrate that the introduction of GATA2-HOXA9, MN1-FLI1 or NIPBL-HOXB9 into murine bone marrow induces overt disease in syngeneic transplant models. With the exception of MN1, full penetrance was not achieved through the introduction of fusion partner genes alone, suggesting that the chimeric transcripts possess a unique gain-of-function phenotype.

The hybrid schedule was devised to be pharmacologically superior in chronic leukemia based on unbound exposure.Experimental Design: Data from 129 patients in three FLAM studies were used for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling. Newly diagnosed (62%) or relapsed/refractory (38%) patients were treated by bolus (43%) or hybrid schedule (57%). Total and unbound flavopiridol concentrations were fit using nonlinear mixed-effect population pharmacokinetic methodologies. Exposure-response relationships using unbound flavopiridol AUC were explored using recursive partitioning.Results: Flavopiridol pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a two-compartment model. No pharmacokinetic covariates were identified. Flavopiridol fraction unbound was 10.9% and not different between schedules. Partitioning found no association between dosing schedule and clinical response. Clinical response was associated with AUC >/= 780 h*ng/mL for newly diagnosed patients and AUC >/= 1,690 h*ng/mL for relapsed/refractory patients. Higher exposures were not associated with increases in severe adverse events (>/= grade 3).Conclusions: Pharmacokinetic modeling showed no difference in flavopiridol plasma protein binding for bolus versus hybrid dosing. Further trials in newly diagnosed patients with acute leukemia should utilize the bolus FLAM regimen at the MTD of 50 mg/m(2)/day. Trials in relapsed/refractory patients should use the hybrid dosing schedule at the MTD (30/60 mg/m(2)/day) to achieve the higher exposures required for maximal efficacy in this population.

Current treatment for AML requires intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy and results in significant morbidity and mortality, especially in older patients. Effective and better-tolerated treatment is urgently needed. Studies have shown that 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3, active VD3) or vitamin D analogs (VDAs) can potently differentiate AML cells in vitro and ex vivo, which led to early clinical trials in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome patients. However, one major limiting factor in the clinical application of active VD3 or VDAs is the supraphysiologic dose required, which results in systemic hypercalcemia. Several important questions (i.e., dosage, method of delivery, metabolism of 1,25-D3 in situ, systemic hypercalcemia, and mechanisms of action of combination treatment) have to be addressed before vitamin D treatment can be applied to the clinical setting.

Here, we found that MLF1IP is abundantly expressed in human erythroid progenitor cells and that MLF1IP-deficiency reduces cell proliferation resulting from cell cycle arrest. Moreover, MLF1IP expression is exclusively elevated in CFU-E cells from polycythemia vera (PV) patients, and MLF1IP transgenic mice develop a PV-like disorder. Further analyses revealed that the erythroid progenitors and early-stage erythroblasts from these transgenic mice expand by up-regulating cyclin D2 and down-regulating p27 and p21. Thus, our data demonstrate that MLF1IP promotes erythroid proliferation and is involved in the pathogenesis of PV, suggesting that it might be a novel molecular target for erythropoietic disorders.",['(c) 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],"['Feng, Gege', 'Zhang, Tianjiao', 'Liu, Jinqin', 'Ma, Xiaotang', 'Li, Bing', 'Yang, Lin', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Xu, Zefeng', 'Qin, Tiejun', 'Zhou, Jiaxi', 'Huang, Gang', 'Shi, Lihong', 'Xiao, Zhijian']","['Feng G', 'Zhang T', 'Liu J', 'Ma X', 'Li B', 'Yang L', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Z', 'Qin T', 'Zhou J', 'Huang G', 'Shi L', 'Xiao Z']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', ""Division of Pathology & Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH, USA."", 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', ""Division of Pathology & Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH, USA."", 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Letter'],England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (CENPU protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polycythemia Vera/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transgenes']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*MLF1IP', '*cell cycle', '*erythroid cells', '*polycythemia vera', '*proliferation', '*transgenic mice']",,2017/02/09 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2017/02/08 06:00'],"['2016/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1873-3468.12587 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2017 Mar;591(5):760-773. doi: 10.1002/1873-3468.12587.

Recent studies have shown how interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment can protect ALL cells from chemotherapy and allow for the persistence of the disease. Epigenetic drugs have been used for the treatment of ALL, but there are no reports on whether these drugs can overcome bone marrow-induced chemoprotection. Our study investigates the ability of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat to overcome chemoprotective effects mediated by osteoblasts. We show that the combination of azacitidine and panobinostat has a synergistic killing effect and that this combination is more effective than cytarabine in inducing ALL cell death in co-culture with osteoblasts. We also show that this combination can be used to sensitize ALL cells to chemotherapeutics in the presence of osteoblasts. Finally, we demonstrate that these effects can be replicated ex vivo in a number of mouse passaged xenograft lines from both B-ALL and T-ALL patients with varying cytogenetics. Thus, our data provides evidence that azacitidine and panobinostat can successfully overcome osteoblast-induced chemoprotection in vitro and ex vivo in both B-ALL and T-ALL cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to explore the synergistic effect and molecular mechanisms of CS055 combination with Doxorubicin in PTCL cells. We found that CS055 showed dose- and time-dependent inhibition effects on PTCL cell. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect was significantly observed after combination treatment with lower drug-concentration of CS055 and Doxorubicin. Lower drug-concentration of CS055 induced weak apoptosis in PTCL cells, but combination treatment with CS055 and Doxorubicin promoted more significant apoptosis. Combination treatment with CS055 and Doxorubicin significantly changed mitochondrial membrane potential and H3 acetylated level, resulting in up-regulating DNA damage protein p-gammaH2AX and apoptosis proteins including cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-9 and cleaved-PARP, and down-regulating anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2.

The authors previously reported poor outcomes for patients who discontinued ibrutinib; however, long-term outcomes were not reported. METHODS: Data from 320 patients who received ibrutinib on clinical studies between 2010 and 2015 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Long-term outcomes among patients with CLL after they discontinued ibrutinib were analyzed. Ninety of 320 patients (28%) who were treated on ibrutinib-based regimens discontinued ibrutinib. Of these, 80 had relapsed/refractory disease, and 10 were treatment-naive. The median time to discontinuation was 15 months (range, 1.2-54 months). After a median follow-up of 38 months after starting ibrutinib, 40 patients (44%) remained alive. Major reasons for ibrutinib discontinuation were intolerance (n = 29; 32%), miscellaneous (n = 28; 31%), progression (n = 19; 21%), and Richter transformation (RT) (n = 9; 10%). The median survival according to the reason for discontinuation was 33 months for ibrutinib intolerance, 11 months for miscellaneous causes, 16 months for progressive CLL, and 2 months for RT. Among the 19 patients who had progressive CLL, 42% responded to subsequent therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib discontinuation was observed during therapy. Patients with CLL who had disease transformation had especially poor outcomes, whereas those who developed progressive disease during ibrutinib therapy had a median survival of <1.5 years. Survival was associated with the reason for discontinuation; patients who had progressive CLL had better survival compared with those who had disease transformation. Effective salvage strategies for patients with CLL who progress on ibrutinib therapy is of critical importance. Cancer 2017;123:2268-2273.

This is the largest multi-institutional study to date investigating the effect of immune status on disease outcomes in patients with cSCC-HN who underwent surgery and received postoperative radiation therapy (RT). METHODS: Patients from 3 institutions who underwent surgery and also received postoperative RT for primary or recurrent, stage I through IV cSCC-HN between 1995 and 2015 were included in this institutional review board-approved study. Patients categorized as immunosuppressed had chronic hematologic malignancy, human immunodeficiency/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or had received immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplantation >/=6 months before diagnosis. Overall survival, locoregional recurrence-free survival, and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional-hazards regression. RESULTS: Of 205 patients, 138 (67.3%) were immunocompetent, and 67 (32.7%) were immunosuppressed. Locoregional recurrence-free survival (47.3% vs 86.1%; P < .0001) and progression-free survival (38.7% vs 71.6%; P = .002) were significantly lower in immunosuppressed patients at 2 years. The 2-year OS rate in immunosuppressed patients demonstrated a similar trend (60.9% vs 78.1%; P = .135) but did not meet significance. On multivariate analysis, immunosuppressed status (hazard ratio [HR], 3.79; P < .0001), recurrent disease (HR, 2.67; P = .001), poor differentiation (HR, 2.08; P = .006), and perineural invasion (HR, 2.05; P = .009) were significantly associated with locoregional recurrence.

However, some recent reports indicated that LMO2 is widely expressed in many tissues and tumors, predominantly in cytoplasm, and revealed complicated functions on tumor behaviors in a variety of cancer types. As an adaptor molecule, binding partners and function details of LMO2 in these solid tumors need to be further investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we used yeast two-hybrid method to screen potential LMO2 interacting partners, MBP-pulldown, and co-immunoprecipitation assay to confirm protein-protein interactions, and confocal microscopy to reveal the subcellular localization of relevant proteins and actin cytoskeleton changes in relevant cells. RESULTS We found that ARP3 and profilin1 were 2 binding partners of LMO2, primarily in cytoplasm. LMO2. Functionally, LMO2 mediated the assembly of a complex including ARP3, profilin1, and actin monomer, increased actin monomer binding to profilin1, and promoted lamellipodia/filopodia formation in basal-type breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate a novel functional mechanism of LMO2 in facilitating the delivery of actin monomers to the branched microfilament and increasing lamellipodia/filopodia formation in basal-type breast cancer cells, suggesting a cancer-promoting role of LMO2 in a subtype-dependent manner and its potential as a subtype-specific biomarker for clinical treatment of breast cancers.",,"['Liu, Ye', 'Wu, Chao', 'Zhu, Tianhui', 'Sun, Wei']","['Liu Y', 'Wu C', 'Zhu T', 'Sun W']",,"['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China (mainland).', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China (mainland).', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China (mainland).', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (ACTR3 protein, human)', '0 (Actin-Related Protein 3)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (PFN1 protein, human)', '0 (Profilins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Actin-Related Protein 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Actins/metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Basal Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Profilins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pseudopodia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",PMC5310228,,,,2017/02/09 06:00,2017/06/13 06:00,['2017/02/08 06:00'],"['2017/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['903261 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.903261 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2017 Feb 7;23:695-703. doi: 10.12659/msm.903261.,20170207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1997 to 2002, 563 patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia aged 1 to 15 years were enrolled. The patients were assigned into 4 risk groups (standard, intermediate, high, or extremely high risk) and treated with regimens intensified according to the risk. Two randomized trials were conducted to compare 2 regimens with and without a 3-week reinduction therapy in the standard-risk group, and to compare the efficacy of pirarubicin with daunorubicin in the intermediate-risk and high-risk groups. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was restricted in patients with high or extremely high risk. RESULTS: The event-free survival (EFS) rate at 10 years for all patients was 77.0%. Those in the standard-risk to extremely high-risk groups were 79.3%, 72.5%, 71.7%, and 66.3%, respectively. The 15-week induction/consolidation not followed by reinduction produced 76.4% of the EFS at 10 years comparable with the regimen with reinduction therapy. Pirarubicin at 25 mg/m administered 11 times throughout the treatment produced the EFS comparable with daunorubicin at 30 mg/m. CONCLUSION: The trial produced high survival rates in NCI-HR patients, although the outcomes in NCI-SR patients were not satisfactory possibly due to less intensive central nervous system-directed therapy.",,"['Horibe, Keizo', 'Yumura-Yagi, Keiko', 'Kudoh, Tooru', 'Nishimura, Shinichiro', 'Oda, Megumi', 'Yoshida, Makoto', 'Komada, Yoshihiro', 'Hara, Junichi', 'Tawa, Akio', 'Usami, Ikuya', 'Tanizawa, Akihiko', 'Kato, Koji', 'Kobayashi, Ryoji', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Hori, Hiroki']","['Horibe K', 'Yumura-Yagi K', 'Kudoh T', 'Nishimura S', 'Oda M', 'Yoshida M', 'Komada Y', 'Hara J', 'Tawa A', 'Usami I', 'Tanizawa A', 'Kato K', 'Kobayashi R', 'Matsuo K', 'Hori H']",,"[""*Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center parallel parallelDepartment of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital ##Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya daggerDepartment of Pediatrics, Osaka General Medical Center **Department of Pediatric, Osaka City General Hospital daggerdaggerDepartment of Pediatric Hematolgy/Oncology, National Hospital Organization Osaka Medical Center, Osaka double daggerDepartment of Pediatrics, Hokkaido Medical Center for Child Health and Rehabilitation paragraph sign paragraph signDepartment of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo section signHiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima parallelDepartment of Pediatrics, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama paragraph signDepartment of Pediatrics, Asahikawa Medical College Hospital, Asahikawa #Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Hospital, Tsu double daggerdouble daggerDepartment of Pediatrics, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe section sign section signDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,,,2017/02/09 06:00,2017/09/13 06:00,['2017/02/08 06:00'],"['2017/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000760 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2017 Mar;39(2):81-89. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000760.,,,,,,,,,,,"['Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study (JACLS), Japan']",,,,,

In spite of advances in sciences to recognize the number of effective agents for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), this leukemia is thought as incurable one. Introducing a new therapy that has a direct effect on B-CLL lymphocytes and no cytotoxic effects on the other cells is a great wish. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with B-CLL were enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from patients' blood samples and were further treated with all-tans retinoic acid (ATRA), interleukin (IL-21), and rituximab at concentrations of 30 ng/ml, 25 ng/ml, and 4 mug/ml, respectively. ATRA, IL21, and rituximab were used alone or in various combinations and their effects on apoptosis were measured using annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit. RESULT: Treatment of the patients' cells with IL21 and rituximab showed a synergistic effect on the induction of apoptosis, in comparison with untreated CLL cells (P < 0.05). The induction of apoptosis by ATRA in combination with IL21 and rituximab were significantly increased compared to untreated CLL cells as a negative control (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Treatment of patients' PBMCs by ATRA in combination with IL21 and rituximab and also IL21 in combination with rituximab showed synergistic induction of apoptosis compared to untreated CLL cells as a negative control (P < 0.01). It seems that ATRA in combination with IL21 and rituximab activate different pathways of apoptosis (extrinsic pathway, intrinsic pathway, and granzyme B pathway).",,"['Abbaszadeh-Goudarzi, Kazem', 'Shokri, Fazel', 'Hosseini, Mostafa', 'Jadidi-Niaragh, Farhad', 'Ghalamfarsa, Ghasem', 'Saboor-Yaraghi, Ali Akbar']","['Abbaszadeh-Goudarzi K', 'Shokri F', 'Hosseini M', 'Jadidi-Niaragh F', 'Ghalamfarsa G', 'Saboor-Yaraghi AA']",,"['Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Department of Cellular and Molecular Nutrition, School of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Rituximab/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,2017/02/09 06:00,2017/03/17 06:00,['2017/02/08 06:00'],"['2017/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2016_12_4_1278_184522 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.184522 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2016 Oct-Dec;12(4):1278-1283. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.184522.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The water-soluble prodrug of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl guanine (Ara-G) is phosphorylated within leukemic cells to form ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP), which terminates DNA chain elongation, resulting in cell death. The drug received accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 2005 based on the induction of complete remissions in 2 phase II trials. In these trials, neurologic toxicity was mainly presented as peripheral neuropathy and, since, is a commonly reported side effect of the drug. However, cases of severe grade III, IV, or even fatal neurotoxicity as well as cases of ascending myelopathy have also been reported with most of these cases being irreversible. In this article, we report a reversible grade IV Guillain-Barre-like case of a patient with primary refractory T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma treated with nelarabine. Guillain-Barre-like syndrome in this patient coexisted with toxic myelopathy which affected the whole spine. The pathogenetic mechanisms and genetic predisposition for nelarabine-associated neurotoxicity is still unknown. The role of the immune system and the patient's genetic background are under investigation along with considerations on the right treatment of the syndrome. Gaining a better understanding in the contributing mechanisms will help us to recognize individuals in danger for neurotoxicity and will lead to the prompt treatment of this complication. Yet, it can be concluded from the present case and literature review that high-dose cytarabine regimens and intrathecal installations should be avoided in close time proximity with nelarabine treatment, as they could enhance neurotoxicity.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

CDK4 and 6 are therefore important drug targets in various cancers. The selective CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib is approved for the treatment of breast cancer and has shown activity in a cellular model of mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL)-rearranged acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We studied the interactions of palbociclib and CDK6 using molecular dynamics simulations. Analysis of the simulations suggested several interactions that stabilized the drug in its binding site and that were not observed in the crystal structure of the protein-drug complex. These included a hydrogen bond to His 100 that was hitherto not reported and several hydrophobic contacts. Evolutionary-based bioinformatic analysis was used to suggest two mutants, D163G and H100L that would potentially yield drug resistance, as they lead to loss of important protein-drug interactions without hindering the viability of the protein. One of the mutants involved a change in the glycine of the well-conserved DFG motif of the kinase. Interestingly, CDK6-dependent human AML cells stably expressing either mutant retained sensitivity to palbociclib, indicating that the protein-drug interactions are not affected by these. Furthermore, the cells were proliferative in the absence of palbociclib, indicating that the Asp to Gly mutation in the DFG motif did not interfere with the catalytic activity of the protein.","['(c) 2017 The Authors Protein Science published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on', 'behalf of The Protein Society.']","['Hernandez Maganhi, Stella', 'Jensen, Patrizia', 'Caracelli, Ignez', 'Zukerman Schpector, Julio', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Friedman, Ran']","['Hernandez Maganhi S', 'Jensen P', 'Caracelli I', 'Zukerman Schpector J', 'Frohling S', 'Friedman R']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8696-3104'],"['Department of Physics, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Brazil.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Physics, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Brazil.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Section for Personalized Oncology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Linnaeus University, Kalmar, Sweden.', 'Centre of Excellence ""Biomaterials Chemistry"", Linnaeus University, 391 82 Kalmar, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'G9ZF61LE7G (palbociclib)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', '*Molecular Dynamics Simulation', '*Mutation, Missense', '*Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Piperazines/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Pyridines/chemistry/pharmacology']",PMC5368058,['NOTNLM'],"['*DFG motif', '*molecular dynamics', '*protein-drug interactions', '*resistance mutations']",,2017/02/09 06:00,2017/07/18 06:00,['2017/02/08 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pro.3135 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Sci. 2017 Apr;26(4):870-879. doi: 10.1002/pro.3135.

We retrospectively analyzed 42 patients with acute leukemia and 32 patients who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation. Thirty-one patients before September 2009 received GRNX, and subsequent 43 patients received LVFX. We compared the cumulative incidences of positive blood and stool cultures. There was no significant difference in the incidence of bacteremia between the GRNX and LVFX groups. However, while gram-negative bacteria were detected in 80% of the patients with bacteremia in the GRNX group, they were detected in only 33% of the patients with bacteremia in the LVFX group. Patients in the GRNX group more frequently experienced positive stool cultures than those in the LVFX group, and this was confirmed by a multivariate analysis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 100 and 67% of the stool culture results in the GRNX and LVFX groups, respectively.

(1,2) Accurate laparoscopic lymph node staging is dependent on a systematic approach to sampling N1 and N2 lymph node stations. (3) Stations with the highest risk of involvement are 12a, b, p and c, 13 and 16, as well as 8 and 9. (4) PATIENT: A 59-year-old man underwent stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia. Thirty-nine days later he developed acute cholecystitis, which was managed with a cholecystostomy tube. Two months later, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed where a T2 well- to moderately-differentiated gallbladder cancer was detected, along with an uninvolved lymph node in station 12c, and cystic duct stump negative for cancer. TECHNIQUE: With the patient in the French position, wide kocherization allowed for sampling of lymph node stations 13 (retropancreatic) and 16 (aortocaval). Thereafter, a portal lymphadenectomy of stations 12a, b, c and p was performed. A partial resection of segments 4b and 5, as well as sampling of the cystic duct stump, completed the procedure. CONCLUSION: Accurate prognostication is one of the major goals of oncologic re-resection of incidentally discovered gallbladder cancer. This can be achieved via a systematic and complete dissection of portal, aortocaval and retropancreatic lymph node stations. Targeting of stations 16 and 13 requires wide kocherization, and complete portal lymphadenectomy of stations 12a, c, p, and b necessitates safe, minimally invasive dissection of the hepatoduodenal ligament.",,"['Vega, Eduardo A', 'Yamashita, Suguru', 'Chun, Yun Shin', 'Kim, Michael', 'Fleming, Jason B', 'Katz, Matthew H', 'Tzeng, Ching-Wei', 'Raghav, Kanwal P', 'Vauthey, Jean-Nicolas', 'Lee, Jeffrey E', 'Conrad, Claudius']","['Vega EA', 'Yamashita S', 'Chun YS', 'Kim M', 'Fleming JB', 'Katz MH', 'Tzeng CW', 'Raghav KP', 'Vauthey JN', 'Lee JE', 'Conrad C']",,"['Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. cconrad1@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,,IM,"['Disease Management', 'Gallbladder Neoplasms/pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy/*methods', '*Lymph Node Excision', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",,,,,2017/02/09 06:00,2018/04/14 06:00,['2017/02/08 06:00'],"['2016/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1245/s10434-017-5773-y [doi]', '10.1245/s10434-017-5773-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 2017 Jul;24(7):1852. doi: 10.1245/s10434-017-5773-y.

The main complications are graft-versus-host disease and infections. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with NHL, who received an allo-SCT between January 1995 and December 2014. The parameters that had an impact on overall survival were age </=60 years old, chemosensitive disease pre-allo-SCT, and indolent NHL histology. The parameters that had an impact on progression-free survival were age </=60 years old and chemosensitive disease pre-allo-SCT.

Discovery of mutated driver pathways or gene sets is becoming an important step to understand molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. However, systematically investigating commonalities and specificities of driver gene sets among multiple cancer types is still a great challenge, but this investigation will undoubtedly benefit deciphering cancers and will be helpful for personalized therapy and precision medicine in cancer treatment. In this study, we propose two optimization models to de novo discover common driver gene sets among multiple cancer types (ComMDP) and specific driver gene sets of one certain or multiple cancer types to other cancers (SpeMDP), respectively. We first apply ComMDP and SpeMDP to simulated data to validate their efficiency. Then, we further apply these methods to 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and obtain several biologically meaningful driver pathways. As examples, we construct a common cancer pathway model for BRCA and OV, infer a complex driver pathway model for BRCA carcinogenesis based on common driver gene sets of BRCA with eight cancer types, and investigate specific driver pathways of the liquid cancer lymphoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) versus other solid cancer types. In these processes more candidate cancer genes are also found.","['(c) The Author(s) 2017.

Several AML risk classification models based on somatic mutations or gene-expression profiling have been proposed. However, systematic and independent validation of these models is required for future clinical implementation. We performed whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing and panel-based deep DNA sequencing of 23 genes in 274 intensively treated AML patients (Clinseq-AML). We also utilized the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-AML study (N=142) as a second validation cohort. We evaluated six previously proposed molecular-based models for AML risk stratification and two revised risk classification systems combining molecular- and clinical data. Risk groups stratified by five out of six models showed different overall survival in cytogenetic normal-AML patients in the Clinseq-AML cohort (P-value<0.05; concordance index >0.5). Risk classification systems integrating mutational or gene-expression data were found to add prognostic value to the current European Leukemia Net (ELN) risk classification. The prognostic value varied between models and across cohorts, highlighting the importance of independent validation to establish evidence of efficacy and general applicability. All but one model replicated in the Clinseq-AML cohort, indicating the potential for molecular-based AML risk models.

Bosutinib is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 as the primary clearance mechanism. The main objectives of this study were to 1) develop physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models of bosutinib; 2) verify and refine the PBPK models based on clinical study results of bosutinib single-dose drug-drug interaction (DDI) with ketoconazole and rifampin, as well as single-dose drug-disease interaction (DDZI) in patients with renal and hepatic impairment; 3) apply the PBPK models to predict DDI outcomes in patients with weak and moderate CYP3A inhibitors; and 4) apply the PBPK models to predict DDZI outcomes in renally and hepatically impaired patients after multiple-dose administration. Results showed that the PBPK models adequately predicted bosutinib oral exposures in patients after single- and multiple-dose administrations. The PBPK models also reasonably predicted changes in bosutinib exposures in the single-dose DDI and DDZI results, suggesting that the PBPK models were sufficiently developed and verified based on the currently available data. Finally, the PBPK models predicted 2- to 4-fold increases in bosutinib exposures by moderate CYP3A inhibitors, as well as comparable increases in bosutinib exposures in renally and hepatically impaired patients between single- and multiple-dose administrations.

Meanwhile, 40 healthy people were taken as the control group. Flow Cytometry Method (FCM) was used to detect the level of Th17 cells and CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) cells in peripheral blood of the two groups, and enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) method was used to test the level of IL17 and TGF-beta in peripheral blood of two groups; reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was adopted to analyze the mRNA levels of RORgammaT and Foxp3 in peripheral blood. In addition, we examined the levels of Th17 and CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) cells and associated factor levels in patients with remission after AL chemotherapy. the Th17 cells (CD3(+) CD4(+) IL-17(+)) in acute leukemia patients accounted for (1.51+/-0.27)%, which was significantly higher than that of control group (0.36+/-0.23)%, with statistical significance (t=20.51, P<0.001); the percentage of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) cells in AL patients was (3.37+/-0.48)%, which was significantly higher than that of control group of (1.26+/-0.27)%, with statistical significance (t=24.23, P<0.001); the serum levels of IL-17 and TGF-beta in AL patients were (28.12+/-6.33) pg/ml and (38.41+/-8.44) pg/ml respectively, which were all significantly higher than that of control group of (14.41+/-6.21) pg/ml and (24.49+/-7.42) pg/ml, with statistical significance (t=7.83, P<0.001; t=7.83, P<0.001); the RORgammaT mRNA and Foxp3 mRNA levels in AL patients were all significantly higher than that of control group, with statistical significance (t=12.27, P<0.001; t=7.89, P<0.001). In addition, compared with before chemotherapy, the levels of Th17 cells and CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) cells, and the serum levels of IL-17 and TGF-beta in acute leukemia patients all decreased significantly after 6 months of chemotherapy, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). Th17 cells, CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3(+) cells and their secretory proteins IL-17, TGF-beta and transcription factors were significantly increased in AL patients.

In a discovery cohort (n=99), TET2 exon 2 skipping (TET2E2S) was found positively associated with a significant reduction in the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). Age, cytogenetics, and TET2E2S were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS), and favorable effects on outcomes predominated in cytogenetic normal (CN)-AML and younger patients. Using the same cutoff in a validation cohort of 86 CN-AML patients, TET2E2S(high) patients were found to be younger than TET2(low) patients without a difference in the rate of complete remission. However, TET2E2S(high) patients exhibited a significantly lower CIR (p<10(-4)). TET2E2S and FLT3-ITD, but not age or NPM1 mutation status were independent prognostic factors for DFS and event-free survival (EFS), while TET2E2S was the sole prognostic factor that we identified for overall survival (OS). In both the intermediate-1 and favorable ELN genetic categories, TET2E2S remained significantly associated with prolonged survival. There was no correlation between TET2E2S status and outcomes in 34 additional AML patients who were unfit for IC. Therefore our results suggest that assessments of TET2 exon 2 splicing status might improve risk stratification in CN-AML patients treated with IC.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, measures of statistical association do not adequately assess the performance of a prognostic biomarker, which is best characterized by its sensitivity and specificity for the chosen outcome. We analyzed donor T cell chimerism results at day 100 (D100chim) after myeloablative alloSCT for AML or MDS in 103 patients and determined its sensitivity and specificity for relapse-free survival at 6 months (RFS6) and 12 months (RFS12) post-alloSCT. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for RFS6 was .68, demonstrating only modest utility as a predictive biomarker, although this was greater than RFS12 at .62. Using a D100chim threshold of 65%, the specificity for RFS6 was 96.6%; however, sensitivity was poor at 26.7%. This equated to a negative predictive value of 88.5% and positive predictive value of 57.1%. Changing the threshold for D100chim to 75% or 85% modestly improved the sensitivity of D100chim for RFS6; however, this was at the expense of specificity. D100chim is specific but lacks sensitivity as a prognostic biomarker of early RFS after myeloablative alloSCT for AML or MDS. Caution is required when using D100chim to guide treatment decisions including immunologic manipulation, which may expose patients to unwarranted graft-versus-host disease.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

METHODS: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels were measured in bone marrow samples collected from 208 patients at scheduled time points after transplantation (1530 samples in total). RESULTS: A total of 92.3% of the requested samples were collected, and 74.0% of patients had complete sample collection. The 1-, 3-, and 6-month RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels could significantly discriminate between continuous complete remission and a hematologic relapse at 1.5-3, 4-6, and 7-12 months but not at >3, >6, and >12 months, respectively. Over 90% of the 175 patients who were in continuous complete remission had a >/=3-log reduction in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels from the time of diagnosis at each time point after transplantation and a >/=4-log reduction at >/=12 months. A <3-log reduction within 12 months and/or a <4-log reduction at >/=12 months was significantly related to a higher 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rate in both the entire cohort and the patients with no intervention after HSCT (58.4 vs. 2.2%, 76.5 vs. 2.0%; all P < 0.0001). Patients who had received a preemptive donor lymphocyte infusion when the increase in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts was </=1-log according to the above dual cutoff values had significantly lower 1-year CIR rate after intervention than the patients who had received an infusion when the increase was >1-log (0 vs. 55.0%, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts with a <3-log reduction from diagnosis within 12 months and/or a <4-log reduction at >/=12 months after allo-HSCT could accurately predict relapse and may prompt a timely intervention in patients with t(8;21) AML.",,"['Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Wang, Yu', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Chen, Huan', 'Han, Wei', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Wang, Feng-Rong', 'Wang, Jing-Zhi',

To optimize the immunization outcome we evaluated vaccination strategies using combinations of these vaccines. RESULTS: While the vaccines on their own confer strong protection from a subsequent Friend virus challenge, the simple combination of the vaccines for the establishment of an optimized immunization protocol did not result in a further improvement of vaccine effectivity. We demonstrate that the co-immunization with GagL85-93/leader-gag encoding vectors together with envelope-encoding vectors abrogates the induction of GagL85-93-specific CD8(+) T cells, and in successive immunization protocols the immunization with the GagL85-93/leader-gag encoding vector had to precede the immunization with an envelope encoding vector for the efficient induction of GagL85-93-specific CD8(+) T cells. Importantly, the antibody response to envelope was in fact enhanced when the mice were adenovirus-experienced from a prior immunization, highlighting the expedience of this approach. CONCLUSIONS: To circumvent the immunosuppressive effect of envelope on immune responses to simultaneously or subsequently administered immunogens, we developed a two immunizations-based vaccination protocol that induces strong immune responses and confers robust protection of highly Friend virus-susceptible mice from a lethal Friend virus challenge.",,"['Kaulfuss, Meike', 'Wensing, Ina', 'Windmann, Sonja', 'Hrycak, Camilla Patrizia', 'Bayer, Wibke']","['Kaulfuss M', 'Wensing I', 'Windmann S', 'Hrycak CP', 'Bayer W']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5885-5592'],"['Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstr. 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstr. 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstr. 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstr. 179, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstr. 179, 45147, Essen, Germany. wibke.bayer@uni-due.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Vaccines, Combined)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Vaccination/*methods', 'Vaccines, Combined/administration & dosage/genetics/immunology', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology']",PMC5294899,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adenovirus based immunization', '*Attenuated retrovirus', '*Friend retrovirus', '*Friend virus', '*Human adenovirus', '*Retrovirus', '*Vaccine']",,2017/02/09 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2017/02/08 06:00'],"['2017/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-017-0336-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-017-0336-7 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2017 Feb 6;14(1):8. doi: 10.1186/s12977-017-0336-7.,20170206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify all these patients, it is essential to screen for both forms of TP53 defects, including both 17p deletions and TP53 mutations. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of TP53 mutations and their association with 17p deletions in a large Hungarian cohort of 196 patients suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. METHOD: We performed mutation analysis of TP53 (exons 3-10) using Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: TP53 mutations were present in 15.8% of patients, half of which were associated with 17p deletion. By analysing both forms, TP53 defect was identified in 25.4% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that by performing a TP53 mutation analysis, an additional 10% of high-risk patients can be detected. Orv.

The induction of apoptosis in tumors by cytotoxic agents produced by pathogenic microorganisms is an example of such an approach. Nevertheless, even the most effective drug should be delivered directly to targeted sites to reduce any negative impact on other cells. Accordingly, the stabilized nanosystem (SNS) for active agent delivery to cancer cells was designed for further application in local anti-tumor therapy. A product of genetically modified Escherichia coli, listeriolysin O (LLO), was immobilized within the polyelectrolyte membrane (poly(ethylenimine)|hyaluronic acid) shells of 'LLO nanocarriers' coupled with the stabilizing element of natural origin. METHODS AND RESULTS: The impact of LLO was evaluated in human leukemia cell lines in vitro. Correspondingly, the influence of the SNS and its elements was assessed in vitro. The viability of targeted cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Visualization of the system structure was performed using confocal microscopy. The membrane shell applied to the nanocarriers was analyzed using atomic force microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Furthermore, the presence of a polyelectrolyte layer on the nanocarrier surface and/or in the cell was confirmed by flow cytometry. Finally, the structural integrity of the SNS and the corresponding release of the fluorescent solute listeriolysin were investigated. CONCLUSION: The construction of a stabilized system offers LLO release with a lethal impact on model eukaryotic cells. The applied platform design may be recommended for local anti-tumor treatment purposes.",,"['Kwiatkowska, Angelika', 'Granicka, Ludomira H', 'Grzeczkowicz, Anna', 'Stachowiak, Radoslaw', 'Kaminski, Michal', 'Grubek, Zuzanna', 'Bielecki, Jacek', 'Strawski, Marcin', 'Szklarczyk, Marek']","['Kwiatkowska A', 'Granicka LH', 'Grzeczkowicz A', 'Stachowiak R', 'Kaminski M', 'Grubek Z', 'Bielecki J', 'Strawski M', 'Szklarczyk M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7890-0883'],"['Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Applied Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Applied Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Applied Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Applied Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Electrochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Electrochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Coated Materials, Biocompatible)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Ligands)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Biological Factors/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coated Materials, Biocompatible', '*Drug Carriers/chemistry', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Stability', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mice', '*Nanomedicine', '*Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Spectrum Analysis']",PMC5293241,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2017/02/07 06:00,2017/08/26 06:00,['2017/02/07 06:00'],"['2016/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0170925 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-30072 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Feb 6;12(2):e0170925. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0170925. eCollection 2017.,20170206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to examine how reduced PTPROt expression affects CLL in vivo we induced CLL in PTPROt-targeted mice. Unexpectedly, loss of both Ptprot alleles delayed disease detection and progression and lengthened survival relative to mice carrying two intact alleles, indicating that PTPROt fulfills a novel tumor-promoting role in CLL. Tumor cells from mice lacking PTPROt exhibited reduced B-cell receptor (BCR)-induced signaling, as well as increased apoptosis and autophagy. Inhibition of BCR/Src signaling in CLL cells induced their apoptosis, indicating that these findings are linked causally. These results suggest a cell-autonomous mechanism for the weakened CLL phenotype of PTPROt-deficient mice and uncover non-redundant roles for PTPROt in support of BCR signaling and survival of CLL cells. In contrast, loss of only one Ptprot allele induced earlier detection and progression of CLL and reduced survival, consistent with a tumor-suppressing role for PTPROt. Tumor cells from mice lacking one or both Ptprot allele exhibited increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression and signaling, factors known to support CLL; cells lacking one Ptprot alleles exhibited normal BCR signaling and cell death rates. We conclude that loss of one Ptprot allele promotes CLL, most likely by activating IL-10 signaling. Loss of both Ptprot alleles also reduces BCR signaling and increases cell death rates, offsetting the IL-10 effects and reducing the severity of the disease. PTPROt thus functions as an obligate haploinsufficient TS in CLL, where its expression levels determine its role as a promoter or inhibitor of the tumorigenic process in mice. Partial loss of PTPROt generates the strongest disease phenotype, suggesting that its intermediate expression levels in CLL are selected for.",,"['Wakim, J', 'Arman, E', 'Becker-Herman, S', 'Kramer, M P', 'Bakos, E', 'Shachar, I', 'Elson, A']","['Wakim J', 'Arman E', 'Becker-Herman S', 'Kramer MP', 'Bakos E', 'Shachar I', 'Elson A']",,"['Department of Molecular Genetics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpro protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Haploinsufficiency', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,2017/02/07 06:00,2017/10/13 06:00,['2017/02/07 06:00'],"['2016/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016523 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.523 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Jun 29;36(26):3686-3694. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.523.

Much effort has been dedicated toward discovering novel scaffold DOT1L inhibitors using different strategies. Here, we report the development and application of a target-specific scoring function, the SAM score, for (S)-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases, for the discovery of novel DOT1L inhibitors. On the basis of the SAM score, we successfully identified a novel class of DOT1L inhibitors with a scaffold of [1,2,4]-triazolo-[3,4-b][1,3,4]-thiadiazole, in which compound 6 exhibits an IC50 value of 8.3 muM with selectivity versus other tested SAM-dependent methyltransferases. In cellular studies, 6 selectively targets DOT1L, blocks the proliferation of mixed lineage leukemia cell lines, and causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we analyzed the putative binding modes of 6 and its analogues obtained by molecular docking, which may assist with the future development of DOT1L inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity profiles.",,"['Wang, Yulan', 'Li, Linjuan', 'Zhang, Bidong', 'Xing, Jing', 'Chen, Shijie', 'Wan, Wei', 'Song, Yakai', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Jiang, Hualiang', 'Luo, Cheng', 'Zheng, Mingyue']","['Wang Y', 'Li L', 'Zhang B', 'Xing J', 'Chen S', 'Wan W', 'Song Y', 'Jiang H', 'Jiang H', 'Luo C', 'Zheng M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3323-3092'],"['State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University , Beijing 100191, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, Shanghai Tech University , Shanghai 200031, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Nano Science and Technology Institute, University of Science and Technology of China , Suzhou 215123, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, Shanghai Tech University , Shanghai 200031, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , No. 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Telomere']",,,,,2017/02/07 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2017/02/07 06:00'],"['2017/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01785 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2017 Mar 9;60(5):2026-2036. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01785.

It is important to recognize normal thymocyte precursors by flow cytometry to differentiate them from T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: A 3-year-old boy status 2 years post-allogenic cardiac transplant underwent adenoidectomy to exclude post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Microscopic, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometry analyses of the adenoid were performed. RESULTS: By flow cytometry, a population of CD45+(dim)/CD7+(bright)/CD3- cells were observed at 1.0% of lymphocytes. These cells expressed CD10, partial CD34, and exhibited acquisition of CD4 followed by CD8. Within the brighter CD45+ lymphocytes, a population of CD3-/CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes and a similarly sized population of CD4+/CD8+ cells exhibiting acquisition of low-density CD3 were identified. By immunostaining, clusters of TdT+/CD1a+/CD4+/CD8+ T-cells were identified in the interfollicular areas. Compared to normal thymus, thymocytes in the adenoid tissue lacked the classic CD4xCD8 winged differentiation profile but showed a normal early precursor pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Thymocytes in adenoid show a similar differentiation pattern to thymus and thymoma. However, the classic winged pattern of common thymocyte differentiation may not be readily apparent in thymocytes differentiating outside of the thymus. Recognition of the early thymocyte precursor antigen acquisition profile can be crucial to correct interpretation.

The authors compared psychosexual outcomes between survivors and healthy controls, and tested whether at-risk survivors can be identified by 1) treatment neurotoxicity or 2) diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 144 young adult survivors of childhood cancer and 144 matched controls completed questionnaires regarding psychosexual development, sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with relationship status. Survivors were aged 20 to 40 years and were 5 to 34 years after diagnosis. Using medical chart data, survivors were divided into non-neurotoxic (48 survivors), low-dose (36 survivors), and high-dose (58 survivors) neurotoxic treatment groups. RESULTS: Apart from having fewer lifetime sex partners, survivors did not appear to differ from controls. However, survivors of brain tumors and any survivor who received high-dose neurotoxic treatment reported the lowest rates of achieving milestones of psychosexual development, whereas sexual and relationship status satisfaction were found to be related to relationship status. Neurotoxic treatment intensity further distinguished between survivors of brain tumors with and without psychosexual impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of neurotoxic treatment may be a valuable indicator of risk for psychosexual impairment relative to diagnosis alone. Health care providers should assess romantic/sexual problems among survivors at risk and make referrals if needed. Cancer 2017;123:1869-1876.

However, treatment of solid tumors using CAR T cells has been largely unsuccessful to date, partly because of tumor-induced immunosuppressive mechanisms, including adenosine production. Previous studies have shown that adenosine generated by tumor cells potently inhibits endogenous antitumor T cell responses through activation of adenosine 2A receptors (A2ARs). Herein, we have observed that CAR activation resulted in increased A2AR expression and suppression of both murine and human CAR T cells. This was reversible using either A2AR antagonists or genetic targeting of A2AR using shRNA. In 2 syngeneic HER2+ self-antigen tumor models, we found that either genetic or pharmacological targeting of the A2AR profoundly increased CAR T cell efficacy, particularly when combined with PD-1 blockade. Mechanistically, this was associated with increased cytokine production of CD8+ CAR T cells and increased activation of both CD8+ and CD4+ CAR T cells. Given the known clinical relevance of the CD73/adenosine pathway in several solid tumor types, and the initiation of phase I trials for A2AR antagonists in oncology, this approach has high translational potential to enhance CAR T cell efficacy in several cancer types.",,"['Beavis, Paul A', 'Henderson, Melissa A', 'Giuffrida, Lauren', 'Mills, Jane K', 'Sek, Kevin', 'Cross, Ryan S', 'Davenport, Alexander J', 'John, Liza B', 'Mardiana, Sherly', 'Slaney, Clare Y', 'Johnstone, Ricky W', 'Trapani, Joseph A', 'Stagg, John', 'Loi, Sherene', 'Kats, Lev', 'Gyorki, David', 'Kershaw, Michael H', 'Darcy, Phillip K']","['Beavis PA', 'Henderson MA', 'Giuffrida L', 'Mills JK', 'Sek K', 'Cross RS', 'Davenport AJ', 'John LB', 'Mardiana S', 'Slaney CY', 'Johnstone RW', 'Trapani JA', 'Stagg J', 'Loi S', 'Kats L', 'Gyorki D', 'Kershaw MH', 'Darcy PK']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Receptor, Adenosine A2A)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Erbb2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Receptor, Adenosine A2A/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*immunology']",PMC5330718,,,,2017/02/07 06:00,2017/09/09 06:00,['2017/02/07 06:00'],"['2016/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['89455 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI89455 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2017 Mar 1;127(3):929-941. doi: 10.1172/JCI89455.

Peptides derived from the cationic region of LF possess cytotoxic activity against cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Bovine lactoferricin (LFcinB), a peptide derived from bovine LF (bLF), exhibits broad-spectrum anticancer activity, while a similar peptide derived from human LF (hLF) is not as active. In this work, several peptides derived from the N-terminal regions of bLF and hLF were studied for their anticancer activities against leukemia and breast-cancer cells, as well as normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The cyclized LFcinB-CLICK peptide, which possesses a stable triazole linkage, showed improved anticancer activity, while short peptides hLF11 and bLF10 were not cytotoxic to cancer cells. Interestingly, hLF11 can act as a cell-penetrating peptide; when combined with the antimicrobial core sequence of LFcinB (RRWQWR) through either a Pro or Gly-Gly linker, toxicity to Jurkat cells increased. Together, our work extends the library of LF-derived peptides tested for anticancer activity, and identified new chimeric peptides with high cytotoxicity towards cancerous cells.

METHODS: 124 patients were diagnosed with CLL. CD38 and ZAP-70 expression levels were measured with four color flowcytometry. Time from diagnosis to initial therapy was calculated for all patients. CD38 expression was studied for a second time during follow-up in 50 patients. RESULTS: For cutoff levels of 7%, 20%, and 30%, CD38 expressions were 61.3%, 25%, and 24.2%, respectively. At all three cutoff levels there were significant correlations with all parameters except age between CD38+ vs. CD38- groups (p < 0.001). The comparative rates of starting therapy for cutoff levels of 7%, 20%, and 30% in CD38+ and CD38- groups were 77.5% vs. 6.25%; 100% vs. 30.7%, and 100% vs. 31.5%, respectively (p < 0.001).

Up until now, few animal models that fully recapitulate clinical features of this disease have been available. METHODS: This study aimed to establish a new MDS xenograft model utilizing a human MDS-derived cell line with heterozygous Y641C mutation of EZH2 (SKM-1). 1 x 107 SKM-1 cells were inoculated into anti-mouse CD122 monoantibody conditioned nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice by intravenous injection. Decitabine was injected intraperitoneally for evaluation of epigenetic drugs in vivo. RESULTS: It is shown that the heterozygous Y641C mutation in the EZH2 gene mutation, which may destabilize the protein (G = 1.46 kcal/mol), can be found in SKM-1 cells. Most mice presented anemia and leukopenia at three to four weeks after inoculation. The peripheral blood and bone marrow smear showed prominent dysplasia on erythrocytes and granulocytes as well as monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that intravenous inoculation of cells from the human MDS-derived cell line prior to targeted depletion of CD122+ cells could provide a novel MDS-like xenotransplant mouse model.

However, the characteristics of FLT3/ ITDs in Chinese AML patients have rarely been reported. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency and characteristics of FLT3/ITDs in Chinese AML patients. METHODS: In the selected 152 cases of Chinese AML patients, capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used to analyze the frequency and characteristics of FLT3/ITDs. Next-generation sequencing was used to analyze the sequences of FLT3/ITDs positive patients. The differences of clinical features between FLT3/ITD positive group and FLT3/ITD negative group were estimated by statistical analysis. RESULTS: 42 cases (27.6%) were FLT3/ITDs-positive, in which 34 cases (81%) had a single duplication, and the remaining 8 cases (19%) had 2 or more ITDs. Median ITD size was 42 bp and median ITD allelic ratio was 0.25. Using next-generation sequencing, ITDs integrating in non-juxtamembrane (JM) domains were detected in 12 ITDs (24%) and in JM domains were detected in 38 ITDs (76%). Furthermore, duplication of at least one residue between Y591 and Y599 was detected in 48 (96%) of all 50 ITDs, and the insertion site was strongly correlated with ITD size: more C-terminal located inserted fragments were significantly longer. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide further evidence of the heterogeneity of FLT3/ITDs among different subgroups in Chinese AML patients. ITDs varied widely, but hotspots were concentrated.

The prognostic importance of codon 835 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutation (exon 20), which occurs relatively frequently in adult AML, is often debated. We aimed to study the FLT3 gene mutation profile and prognosis in 139 adult Iranian patients with newly diagnosed AML. METHODS: We determined the status of ITD and TKD mutations using fragment analysis and the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment polymorphism method, respectively. In addition, we used direct sequencing to confirm the results of TKD mutation analysis. RESULTS: Twenty five percent of the patients had an ITD mutation. The mean size of the inserted fragment was 63.5 base pairs. Twenty percent of the ITD-positive patients showed more than one mutated population upon polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analyses showed that the ITD mutation was associated with a decreased overall survival among patients in the intermediate cytogenetic risk group (p-value = 0.013). The size of the ITD was not correlated with overall survival. Eight out of 139 patients (5.7%) had the codon 835 mutation. One new mutation of the insertion/deletion type was discovered. Analyses did not show any relationship between the TKD mutation and overall survival. Two patients (1.4%) showed concurrent TKD and ITD mutations. The TKD and ITD mutation rates of the FLT3 gene were consistent with previous studies on AML patients.

This study investigated the relationship between BCL11A expression levels and adult acute myeloid leukemia patient characteristics as well as clinical outcomes. METHODS: RT-PCR was employed to detect BCL11A gene expression levels in 80 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: Median BCL11A expression levels of 80 AML bone marrow samples were found to be higher than the control group (0.039 vs. 0.014, p < 0.005). Patients with low BCL11A expression levels had a significantly higher CR (complete remission) rate compared with patients with high BCL11A expression levels (90% vs. 53%, p < 0.005). Moreover, the median OS (overall survival) in patients with low BCL11A expression (268 d) was also longer than that in patients with high BCL11A expression (101.5 d) (p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the high and low BCL11A groups with respect to white blood cells, haemoglobin, platelet count, French-American-Britain (FAB) subtypes, percentage of blasts in bone marrow, peripheral blood, cytogenetic risk groups, and CD34 expression.

A constant need exists to introduce new molecular markers for more precise risk stratification and for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative assessment of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) gene transcripts was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The bone marrow samples were collected at the diagnosis from 104 AML-NK patients and from 34 of these patients during follow-up or disease relapse. RESULTS: We found that overexpression of the WT1 gene (WT1(high) status), present in 25.5% of patients, was an independent unfavorable factor for achieving complete remission. WT1(high) status was also associated with resistance to therapy and shorter disease-free survival and overall survival. Assessment of the log reduction value of WT1 expression, measured in paired diagnosis/complete remission samples, revealed that patients with a log reduction of < 2 had a tendency toward shorter disease-free survival and overall survival and a greater incidence of disease relapse. Combining WT1 gene expression status with NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutational status, we found that the tumor behavior of intermediate patients (FLT3-ITD(-)/NPM1(-) double negative) with WT1(high) status is almost the same as the tumor behavior of the adverse risk group. CONCLUSION: WT1 expression status represents a good molecular marker of prognosis, response to treatment, and MRD monitoring. Above all, the usage of the WT1 expression level as an additional marker for more precise risk stratification of AML-NK patients could lead to more adapted, personalized treatment protocols.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We tested whether eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, might be effective in improving thrombocytopenia in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and severe thrombocytopenia. METHODS: EQoL-MDS was a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2 superiority trial of adult patients with low-risk or International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and severe thrombocytopenia. Patients with a stable platelet count of lower than 30 x 10(9) platelets per L, aged at least 18 years, with refractoriness, ineligibility to receive treatment with alternative medications, or relapse while receiving treatment with alternative medications were included in this trial. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive eltrombopag (50 mg to 300 mg) or placebo for at least 24 weeks and until disease progression and were masked to treatment allocation. Here, we report the results in the intention-to-treat population of the first phase of the trial, for which the primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving a platelet response within 24 weeks and safety. The interim analysis presented here was protocol-specified and used a two-sided significance level of 0.001 and a p value at or below this limit for both primary endpoints to indicate the need for early trial termination. Duration of platelet transfusion independence, duration of response, overall survival, leukaemia-free survival, and pharmacokinetics will be reported at the end of the phase 2 portion of the trial. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2010-022890-33. FINDINGS: Between June 13, 2011, and June 17, 2016, we enrolled 90 participants for the first phase of the trial. The median follow-up time to assess platelet responses was 11 weeks (IQR 4-24). Platelet responses occurred in 28 (47%) of 59 patients in the eltrombopag group versus one (3%) of 31 patients in the placebo group (odds ratio 27.1 [95% CI 3.5-211.9], p=0.0017). During the follow-up, 21 patients had at least one severe bleeding event (WHO bleeding score >/=2). There were a higher number of bleeders in the placebo (13 [42%] of 31 patients) than in the eltrombopag arm (eight [14%] of 59 patients; p=0.0025). 52 grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 27 (46%) of 59 patients in the eltrombopag group versus nine events in five (16%) of 31 patients in the placebo group (chi(2)=7.8, p=0.0053, stopping rule not reached). The outcome acute myeloid leukaemia evolution or disease progression occurred in seven (12%) of 59 patients in the eltrombopag group versus five (16%) of 31 patients in the placebo group (chi(2)=0.06, p=0.81). INTERPRETATION: Eltrombopag is well-tolerated in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and severe thrombocytopenia and is clinically effective in raising platelet counts and reducing bleeding events. The assessment of long-term safety and efficacy of eltrombopag and its effect on survival (phase 2 part of study) is still ongoing. FUNDING: Associazione QOL-ONE.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we catalog this heterogeneity and use it to identify functional gene interactions and genotype-dependent liabilities in cancer. By using genome-wide CRISPR-based screens, we generate a gene essentiality dataset across 14 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Sets of genes with correlated patterns of essentiality across the lines reveal new gene relationships, the essential substrates of enzymes, and the molecular functions of uncharacterized proteins. Comparisons of differentially essential genes between Ras-dependent and -independent lines uncover synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic Ras. Screens in both human AML and engineered mouse pro-B cells converge on a surprisingly small number of genes in the Ras processing and MAPK pathways and pinpoint PREX1 as an AML-specific activator of MAPK signaling.

Deep mycoses are also recognized as an important emerging problem. Here, we estimate the annual incidence and prevalence of serious fungal infections in Bangladesh. Demographic data were obtained from world population reports and the data on TB and HIV extracted from the online publications on tuberculosis in Bangladesh and Asia Pacific research statistical data information resources AIDS Data HUB. All the published papers on fungal infections in Bangladesh were identified through extensive search of literature. We estimated the number of affected people from populations at risk and local epidemiological data. Bangladesh has a population of approximately 162.6 million, 31% children and only 6% over the age of 60 years. The pulmonary TB caseload reported in 2014 was 119,520, and we estimate a prevalence of 30,178 people with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, 80% attributable to TB. An anticipated 90,262 and 119,146 patients have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or severe asthma with fungal sensitization. Only 8,000 people are estimated to be HIV-infected, of whom 2900 are not on ART with a CD4 count <350 muL, Pneumocystis pneumonia and cryptococcal meningitis being rare. Superficial mycoses are very common with Trichophyton rubrum as the predominant etiological agent (80.6%). Numerous cases of mycotic keratitis have been reported from several parts of Bangladesh. Candida bloodstream infection was estimated based on a 5 per 100,000 rate (8100 cases) and invasive aspergillosis based primarily on leukemia and COPD rates, at 5166 cases. Histoplasmosis was documented in 16 cases mostly with disseminated disease and presumed in 21 with HIV infection.

In this study we aimed to estimate the burden of serious fungal diseases in Thailand based on the size of the populations at risk and available epidemiological databases. Data derived from The Bureau of Epidemiology, Department of Disease Control, Thai Ministry of Public Health, World Health Organisation, international and local reports, and some unreported data were used. When no data existed, risk populations were used to estimate frequencies of fungal infections, using previously described methodology by LIFE. Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (>4 episodes per year) is estimated to occur in 3,310 per 100,000 population. Using a previously described rate that 14/10,000 admissions are with fungaemia and 94% of those are Candida, we estimated 8,650 patients with candidaemia. The prevalence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is relatively high with a total of 19,044, approximately half subsequent to pulmonary tuberculosis. Invasive aspergillosis is estimated to affect 941 patients following leukaemia therapy, transplantations, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, approximately 1.4/100,000. In addition, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation were estimated at approximately 58.4/100,000 and 77/100,000, respectively. Given approximately 8,134 new cases of AIDS annually, cryptococcal meningitis, Pneumocystis pneumonia, and Talaromyces marneffei infection are estimated at 1.9/100,000, 2.6/100,000, and 0.3/100,000, respectively.

Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database, we evaluated outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in patients with ANKL. Twenty-one patients with a centrally confirmed diagnosis of ANKL were included. Median patient age was 42 years and 15 patients (71%) were Caucasian. Fourteen patients (67%) were in complete remission (CR) at the time of alloHCT, and 5 patients had active disease. Median follow-up of survivors was 25 months (range, 12 to 116). The 2-year estimates of nonrelapse mortality, relapse/progression, progression-free (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 21%, 59%, 20%, and 24%, respectively. The 2-year PFS of patients in CR at the time of alloHCT was significantly better than that of patients with active disease at transplantation (30% versus 0%; P = .001). The 2-year OS in similar order was 38% versus 0% (P < .001). In conclusion, this registry analysis that included majority non-Asian patient population shows that alloHCT can provide durable disease control in a subset of ANKL patients. Achieving CR before transplantation appears to be a prerequisite for successful transplantation outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30607 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study that enrolled patients without progression after four cycles of first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Bevacizumab was allowed only during the four cycles of chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive sunitinib, 37.5 mg/d, or placebo and were treated until unacceptable adverse event(s), progression, or death. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were enrolled, randomized, and included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Ten patients did not receive maintenance therapy (four who received placebo and six who received sunitinib). Grade 3/4 adverse events affecting more than 5% of the patients were fatigue (25%), thrombocytopenia (12%), hypertension (12%), rash (11%), mucositis (11%), neutropenia (7%), and anemia (6%) for sunitinib and none for placebo. There were three grade 5 events in patients receiving sunitinib (one pulmonary hemorrhage, one other pulmonary event, and one death not associated with a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events term) and two grade 5 events in patients receiving placebo (one other pulmonary event and one thromboembolism). Median PFS was 4.3 months for sunitinib and 2.6 months for placebo (hazard ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.47-0.82, p = 0.0006). Median overall survival was 11.7 months for sunitinib versus 12.1 months for placebo (hazard ratio = 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.73-1.31, p = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance sunitinib was safe and improved PFS as maintenance therapy in stage IIIB/IV NSCLC but had no impact on overall survival. There is no room for future investigations of sunitinib in this setting.","['Copyright (c) 2017 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we evaluate the antitumor effects of canthin-6-one in human myeloid leukemia lineages. METHODS: Kasumi-1 lineage was used as a model for acute myeloid leukemia. Cells were treated with canthin-6-one and cell death, cell cycle and differentiation were evaluated in both total cells (Lin(+)) and leukemia stem cell population (CD34(+)CD38(-)Lin(-/low)). RESULTS: Among the human lineages tested, Kasumi-1 was the most sensitive to canthin-6-one. Canthin-6-one induced cell death with apoptotic (caspase activation, decrease of mitochondrial potential) and necrotic (lysosomal permeabilization, double labeling of annexin V/propidium iodide) characteristics. Moreover, canthin-6-one induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 (7muM) and G2 (45muM) evidenced by DNA content, BrdU incorporation and cyclin B1/histone 3 quantification. Canthin-6-one also promoted differentiation of Kasumi-1, evidenced by an increase in the expression of myeloid markers (CD11b and CD15) and the transcription factor PU.1. Furthermore, a reduction of the leukemic stem cell population and clonogenic capability of stem cells were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that canthin-6-one can affect Kasumi-1 cells by promoting cell death, cell cycle arrest and cell differentiation depending on concentration used. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Canthin-6-one presents an interesting cytotoxic activity against leukemic cells and represents a promising scaffold for the development of molecules for anti-leukemic applications, especially by its anti-leukemic stem cell activity.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Twelve patients received 20- to 200-mg ramp-up treatment with oral venetoclax and 20 mg/m(2) of intravenous decitabine on days 1 through 5, followed by 400 mg of venetoclax alone on days 6 through 20. On days 21 through 28, patients received 300 mg of posaconazole plus reduced doses of venetoclax (50 or 100 mg) to account for expected increases in venetoclax plasma concentrations. Blood samples were collected before dosing and up to 24 hours after the venetoclax dose on days 20 and 28. FINDINGS: Compared with a venetoclax dose of 400 mg when administered alone (day 20), coadministration of venetoclax at a 50-mg dose with multiple doses of posaconazole increased mean venetoclax Cmax and AUC0-24 by 53% and 76%, respectively, whereas coadministration of venetoclax at a 100-mg dose with posaconazole increased mean venetoclax Cmax and AUC0-24 by 93% and 155%, respectively. When adjusted for different doses and nonlinearity, posaconazole was estimated to increase venetoclax Cmax and AUC0-24 by 7.1- and 8.8-fold, respectively. Both the 50- and 100-mg venetoclax doses administered with posaconazole were well tolerated. IMPLICATIONS: The results are consistent with inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism of venetoclax. Posaconazole can be used for antifungal prophylaxis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving venetoclax after reducing the venetoclax dose by at least 75%.

The European Union PL (EUPL) has been in force since 2007. Both PLs facilitate additional pediatric research on primarily adult drugs. The EUPL declares that the forces of the market are not sufficient for children. Without a pediatric investigation plan, new drugs can no longer be registered with the European Union. New ways on how to facilitate drug development for rare pediatric diseases are being proposed. METHODS: US PL, EUPL, and implications of modern labels for medical decision making are discussed. FINDINGS: Modern drug labels constituted a step from eminence-based towards data-based medical decision making. However, approval by regulatory authorities did not replace knowledge transfer in medicine, which continued in university education, through conferences, consensus papers, and so on. Children were successfully treated with off-label drugs in pediatric oncology and in many other diseases. Describing children as ""therapeutic orphans"" reflected an overestimation of drug labels and an underestimation of nonregulatory systematic clinical testing. Therapeutic breakthroughs have occurred, for example, in acute myelogenous leukemia and cystic fibrosis. Rare diseases need new innovative drugs and therapeutic concepts for further breakthroughs. IMPLICATIONS: The focus of PL on additional pediatric measures for predominantly adult new drugs reflects a tunnel view. Similar to the introduction of modern pharmaceutical legislation that triggered comparable laws in most countries worldwide after 1962, we currently need new worldwide steps to reward innovative treatment concepts for rare diseases-not against, but through the market. Created by philanthropy, parents, and other supporters, new therapeutic concepts should be rewarded upon meeting regulatory milestones. This market is limited today. It needs not only a boost by pioneers, but also acceptance, welcome, and re-thinking about drug development in academia, politics, and by the general public.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

It remains the most common leukemia in the Western world. Within the recent years, major breakthroughs have been made to prolong the survival and improve the health of patients. Despite these advances, CLL is still recognized as a disease without definitive cure. New treatment approaches, based on unique targets and novel drugs, are highly desired for CLL therapy. The Identification and subsequent targeting of molecules that are overexpressed uniquely in malignant cells not normal ones play critical roles in the success of anticancer therapeutic strategies. In this regard, ROR family proteins are known as a subgroup of protein kinases which have gained huge popularity in the scientific community for the diagnosis and treatment of different cancer types. ROR1 as an antigen exclusively expressed on the surface of tumor cells can be a target for immunotherapy. ROR-1 targeting using different approaches such as siRNA, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cell therapy and antibody induces tumor growth suppression in cancer cells. In the current review, we aim to present an overview of the efforts and scientific achievements in targeting ROR family, particularly ROR-1, for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Here, we report the effects of the two arms of bRNA on branchpoint-directed RNA cleavage and mutation produced by Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) RT during DNA polymerization. We constructed a long-chained bRNA template by splinted-ligation. The bRNA oligonucleotide is chimeric and contains DNA to identify RNA cleavage products by probe hybridization. Unique sequences surrounding the branchpoint facilitate monitoring of bRNA purification by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. We evaluate the M-MLV RT-generated cleavage and mutational patterns. We find that cleavage of bRNA and misprocessing of the branched nucleotide proceed arm-specifically. Bypass of the branchpoint from the 2-arm causes single-mismatch errors, whereas bypass from the 3-arm leads to deletion mutations. The non-template arm is cleaved when reverse transcription is primed from the 3-arm but not from the 2-arm. This suggests that RTs flip approximately 180 degrees at branchpoints and RNases H cleave the non-template arm depending on its accessibility. Our observed interplay between M-MLV RT and bRNA would be compatible with a bRNA-mediated control of retroviral and related retrotransposon replication.","['(c) The Author(s) 2017.

We showed that BMSCs secrete soluble factors that protect AML cells from Ara-C induced cytotoxicity. This leukemia chemoresistance is associated with a decrease in the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT1) activity by inducing removal of ENT1 from the cell surface. Reduction of cell proliferation was also observed with activation of AKT and mTOR-dependent cell survival pathways, which may also contribute to the tumor chemoprotection.

PD-L1/PD-1 plays a role in inhibition of antitumor immunity by inducing T cell apoptosis and tolerance. Thus, it is crucial to elucidate mechanisms of PD-L1 expression on cancer cells. ERO1-alpha is an oxidase located in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is overexpressed in a variety of tumor types and it plays a role in disulfide bond formation in collaboration with PDI. Here, we investigated the influence of ERO1-alpha on expression of PD-L1 and immune escape. We demonstrated that ERO1-alpha augmented the expression of PD-L1 via facilitation of oxidative protein folding within PD-L1. In addition, we showed that overexpression of ERO1-alpha increased HIF-1alpha protein expression, resulting in an increase of PD-L1 mRNA as well as protein. In clinical cases, we observed that the expression of ERO1-alpha in triple negative breast cancer was related to the expression of PD-L1. Moreover, apoptosis of Jurkat leukemia T cells, which express PD-1, induced by tumor PD-L1 was inhibited when ERO1-alpha was depleted. The results suggest that targeting ERO1-alpha in tumor cells can be a novel approach for cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, the role of ERO1-alpha in tumor-mediated immunosuppression should be further explored.",,"['Tanaka, Tsutomu', 'Kutomi, Goro', 'Kajiwara, Toshimitsu', 'Kukita, Kazuharu', 'Kochin, Vitaly', 'Kanaseki, Takayuki', 'Tsukahara, Tomohide', 'Hirohashi, Yoshihiko', 'Torigoe, Toshihiko', 'Okamoto, Yoshiharu', 'Hirata, Koichi', 'Sato, Noriyuki', 'Tamura, Yasuaki']","['Tanaka T', 'Kutomi G', 'Kajiwara T', 'Kukita K', 'Kochin V', 'Kanaseki T', 'Tsukahara T', 'Hirohashi Y', 'Torigoe T', 'Okamoto Y', 'Hirata K', 'Sato N', 'Tamura Y']",,"['Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, The United Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Joint Department of Veterinary Medicine, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Therapeutics, Institute for the Business-Regional Collaboration, Center for Food & Medical Innovation, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.- (ERO1A protein, human)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/immunology', 'B7-H1 Antigen/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Protein Folding', 'Transfection', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/enzymology/immunology', 'Tumor Escape', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology']",PMC5421881,['NOTNLM'],"['ERO1-alpha', 'PD-L1', 'disulfide bond', 'oxidoreductase', 'triple negative breast cancer']",,2017/02/06 06:00,2018/03/24 06:00,['2017/02/05 06:00'],"['2016/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['14960 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.14960 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Apr 11;8(15):24706-24718. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.14960.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the aim of assessing the presence of common targets shared among different HM which may enable addressing a larger patient collective we conducted a meta-analysis of 83 mass spectrometry-based HLA peptidome datasets (comprising 40,361 unique peptide identifications) across four major HM (19 AML, 16 CML, 35 CLL, and 13 MM/MCL samples) and investigated similarities and differences within the HLA presented antigenic landscape. We found the cancer HLA peptidome datasets to cluster specifically along entity and lineage lines, suggesting that the immunopeptidome directly reflects the differences in the underlying (tumor-)biology.

Recent studies suggested serum/plasma microRNAs (miRs) may predict aGVHD onset. However, little is known about the functional role of circulating miRs in aGVHD. In this article, we show in two independent cohorts that miR-29a expression is significantly upregulated in the serum of allogeneic HSCT patients at aGVHD onset compared with non-aGVHD patients. Serum miR-29a is also elevated as early as 2 wk before time of diagnosis of aGVHD compared with time-matched control subjects. We demonstrate novel functional significance of serum miR-29a by showing that miR-29a binds and activates dendritic cells via TLR7 and TLR8, resulting in the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6. Treatment with locked nucleic acid anti-miR-29a significantly improved survival in a mouse model of aGVHD while retaining graft-versus-leukemia effects, unveiling a novel therapeutic target in aGVHD treatment or prevention.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Ranganathan, Parvathi', 'Ngankeu, Apollinaire', 'Zitzer, Nina C', 'Leoncini, PierPaolo', 'Yu, Xueyan', 'Casadei, Lucia', 'Challagundla, Kishore', 'Reichenbach, Dawn K', 'Garman, Sabrina', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Hofstetter, Jessica', 'Efebera, Yvonne A', 'Devine, Steven M', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Fabbri, Muller', 'Garzon, Ramiro']","['Ranganathan P', 'Ngankeu A', 'Zitzer NC', 'Leoncini P', 'Yu X', 'Casadei L', 'Challagundla K', 'Reichenbach DK', 'Garman S', 'Ruppert AS', 'Volinia S', 'Hofstetter J', 'Efebera YA', 'Devine SM', 'Blazar BR', 'Fabbri M', 'Garzon R']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9098-635X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1708-7291', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6441-5879']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', ""Department of Oncohematology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome 00165, Italy."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California-Keck School of Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027."", 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Anatomy, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara 44121, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455; and.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California-Keck School of Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; ramiro.garzon@osumc.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (TLR8 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 8)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dendritic Cells/*physiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 8/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC5340605,,,,2017/02/06 06:00,2017/09/16 06:00,['2017/02/05 06:00'],"['2016/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1601778 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1601778 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2017 Mar 15;198(6):2500-2512. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1601778.

This cancer stem cell model offers an explanation for chemotherapy resistance and disease relapse and implies that approaches to treatment must eradicate LSCs for cure. More recently, a number of studies have both refined and expanded our understanding of LSCs and intrapatient heterogeneity in AML using improved xenotransplant models, genome-scale analyses, and experimental manipulation of primary patient cells.

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the kinase activity of BCR-ABL1 have transformed CML from a once-fatal disease to a manageable one for the vast majority of patients, only approximately 10% of those who present in chronic phase (CP) can discontinue TKI treatment and maintain a therapy-free remission. Strong evidence now shows that CML LSCs are resistant to the effects of TKIs and persist in all patients on long-term therapy, where they may promote acquired TKI resistance, drive relapse or disease progression, and inevitably represent a bottleneck to cure. Since their discovery in patients almost 2 decades ago, CML LSCs have become a well-recognized exemplar of the cancer stem cell and have been characterized extensively, with the aim of developing new curative therapeutic approaches based on LSC eradication. This review summarizes our current understanding of many of the pathways and mechanisms that promote the survival of the CP CML LSCs and how they can be a source of new gene coding mutations that impact in the clinic.

Exciting new insights into the fundamental underpinnings of LSCs are now being made in an era in which drug development pipelines offer the potential to specifically target pathways of significance. Therefore, the focus in this new era, characterized by the confluence of understanding LSCs and the ability to target them, is shifting from ""if it can be done"" to ""how it will be done."" Moving from a theoretical stage to this hopeful era of possibilities, new challenges expectedly arise, and our focus now must shift to determining the best strategy by which to target LSCs, with their well-documented heterogeneity and readily evident intra- and interpatient variability.

This environment provides key regulatory signals for and tightly controls cardinal features of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), including self-renewal, quiescence, differentiation, and migration. These features are essential to maintaining cellular homeostasis and blood regeneration throughout life. A large number of studies have extensively addressed the composition of the bone marrow niche in mouse models, as well as the cellular and molecular communication modalities at play under both normal and pathogenic situations. Although instrumental to interrogating the complex composition of the HSC niche and dissecting the niche remodeling processes that appear to actively contribute to leukemogenesis, these models may not fully recapitulate the human system due to immunophenotypic, architectural, and functional inter-species variability. This review summarizes several aspects related to the human hematopoietic niche: (1) its anatomical structure, composition, and function in normal hematopoiesis; (2) its alteration and functional relevance in the context of chronic and acute myeloid malignancies; (3) age-related niche changes and their suspected impact on hematopoiesis; (4) ongoing efforts to develop new models to study niche-leukemic cell interaction in human myeloid malignancies; and finally, (5) how the knowledge gained into leukemic stem cell (LSC) niche dependencies might be exploited to devise novel therapeutic strategies that aim at disrupting essential niche-LSC interactions or improve the regenerative ability of the disease-associated hematopoietic niche.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Medyouf, Hind']",['Medyouf H'],['ORCID: 0000-0003-4652-9455'],"['Georg-Speyer-Haus Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany; and Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/*pathology', '*Stem Cell Niche']",,,,,2017/02/06 06:00,2017/08/24 06:00,['2017/02/05 06:00'],"['2016/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33563-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-11-696070 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Mar 23;129(12):1617-1626. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-11-696070.

Like in other leukemia types, alterations of the PI3K/mTOR pathway are predominant in ALL which is also responsible for treatment failure and relapse. In this study, we show that relapsed T-ALL patients display an enrichment of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Using a panel of inhibitors targeting multiple components of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, we observed that the dual-specific PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PKI-587 was the most selective inhibitor for T-ALL cells dependent on the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, we observed that PKI-587 blocked proliferation and colony formation of T-ALL cell lines. Additionally, PKI-587 selectively abrogated PI3K/mTOR signaling without affecting MAPK signaling both in in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway using PKI-587 delayed tumor progression, reduced tumor load and enhanced the survival rate in immune-deficient mouse xenograft models without inducing weight loss in the inhibitor treated mice. This preclinical study shows beneficial effects of PKI-587 on T-ALL that warrants further investigation in the clinical setting.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This persistent viral infection results in arthritis in adult goats and encephalitis in lambs. The prognosis for the encephalitic form is normally poor, and this form of the disease has caused substantial economic losses for goat farmers. Hence, a more efficient detection platform based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) was developed in the present study for detecting the proviral DNA of caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV). Under the optimal incubation conditions, specifically, 30min at 37 degrees C for RPA followed by 5min at room temperature for LFD, the assay was found to be sensitive to a lower limit of 80pg of total DNA and 10 copies of plasmid DNA. Furthermore, there was no cross-reaction with other tested viruses, including goat pox virus and bovine leukemia virus. Given its simplicity and portability, this RPA-LFD protocol can serve as an alternative tool to ELISA for the primary screening of CAEV, one that is suitable for both laboratory and field application. When the RPA-LFD was applied in parallel with serological ELISA for the detection of CAEV in field samples, the RPA-LFD assay exhibited a higher sensitivity than the traditional method, and 82% of the 200 samples collected in Taiwan were found to be positive. To our knowledge, this is the first report providing evidence to support the use of an RPA-LFD assay as a specific and sensitive platform for detecting CAEV proviral DNA in goats in a faster manner, one that is also applicable for on-site utilization at farms and that should be useful in both eradication programs and epidemiological studies.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is increasingly clear that not all cytological CRs (cCRs) are the same and that minimal residual disease (MRD) before allo-SCT could have an impact on AML outcome. Unfortunately, FLT3, due its instability of expression, is still not considered a good molecular MRD marker. We analyzed the outcome of allo-SCT in a population of FLT3-positive AML patients according to molecular MRD at the pretransplantation workup, assessed by the quantitative expression evaluation of the panleukemic marker Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene. Sixty-two consecutive AML FLT3-positive patients received allo-SCT between 2005 and 2016 in our center. The median age at transplantation was 55 years. The quantitative analysis of the WT1 gene expression (bone marrow samples) was available in 54 out of 62 (87%) cases, both at diagnosis (100% overexpressing WT1 with a mean of 9747 +/- 8064 copies) and before allo-SCT (33 WT1-negative and 21 WT1-positive cases at the pretransplantation workup). Of these cases, 33/54 (61%) were both in cCR and molecular remission (WT1-negative) at the time of transplantation, 13/54 (24%) were in cCR but not in molecular remission (WT1-positive), and 8/54 (15%) showed a cytological evidence of disease (relapsed or refractory). Both post-allo-SCT overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were significantly better in patients who were WT1-negative (WT1 <250 copies) at the time of transplantation compared with those who were WT1-positive (WT1 >250 copies), with a median OS and DFS not reached in the WT1-negative group and 10.2 and 5.5 months, respectively, in the WT1-positive group (OS log-rank p = 0.0005; hazard ratio [HR] = 3.7, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.5-9; DFS log-rank p = 0.0001; HR = 4.38, 95% CI = 1.9-10). Patients with cCR who were WT1-positive had the same negative outcome as those with a cytological evidence of disease. The relapse rate after allo-SCT was 9% (3/33) in pre-allo-SCT WT1-negative cases and 54% (7/13) in WT1-positive cases (p = 0.002). At multivariate analysis, WT1 negativity before allo-SCT and grade <2 acute graft versus host disease were the only independent prognostic factors for improved OS and DFS. These data show that pre-allo-SCT molecular MRD evaluation through WT1 expression is a powerful predictor of posttransplantation outcomes (OS, DFS, relapse rate). Patients with both cCR and a WT1-negative marker before allo-SCT have a very good outcome with very low relapse rate; conversely, patients with positive molecular MRD and refractory/relapsed patients have a negative outcome. The WT1 MRD stratification in FLT3-positive AML is a valuable tool with which to identify patients who are at high risk of relapse and that could be considered from post-allo-SCT prophylaxis with FLT3 inhibitors or other strategies (donor lymphocyte infusion, tapering of immunosuppression, azacitidine).","['Copyright (c) 2017 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The cornerstone of control is identification and segregation of infected cats. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To compare test performance with well-characterized clinical samples of currently available FeLV antigen/FIV antibody combination test kits. ANIMALS: Surplus serum and plasma from diagnostic samples submitted by animal shelters, diagnostic laboratories, veterinary clinics, and cat research colonies. None of the cats had been vaccinated against FIV. The final sample set included 146 FeLV+, 154 FeLV-, 94 FIV+, and 97 FIV- samples. METHODS: Prospective, blind comparison to a gold standard: Samples were evaluated in 4 different point-of-care tests by ELISA antigen plate tests (FeLV) and virus isolation (FIV) as the reference standards. All test results were visually read by 2 blinded observers. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity, respectively, for FeLV were SNAP((R)) (100%/100%), WITNESS((R)) (89.0%/95.5%), Anigen((R)) (91.8%/95.5%), and VetScan((R)) (85.6%/85.7%). Sensitivity and specificity for FIV were SNAP((R)) (97.9%/99.0%), WITNESS((R)) (94.7%/100%), Anigen((R)) (96.8%/99.0%), and VetScan((R)) (91.5%/99.0%). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The SNAP((R)) test had the best performance for FeLV, but there were no significant differences for FIV. In typical cat populations with seroprevalence of 1-5%, a majority of positive results reported by most point-of-care test devices would be false-positives. This could result in unnecessary segregation or even euthanasia.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

We identified and replicated common and rare germ-line variants at FLT3 (a gene often somatically mutated in leukemia) associated with monocyte count. The common FLT3 variant rs76428106 has a large allele frequency differential between African and non-African populations. We also identified several novel genetic loci involving or regulating hematopoietic transcription factors (CEBPE-SLC7A7, CEBPA and CRBN-TRNT1) associated with basophil count. The minor allele of the CEBPE variant associated with lower basophil count has been previously associated with Amerindian ancestry and higher risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Hispanics. Together, these data suggest that germline genetic variation affecting transcriptional and signaling pathways that underlie WBC development and lineage specification can contribute to inter-individual as well as ethnic differences in peripheral blood cell counts (normal hematopoiesis) in addition to susceptibility to leukemia (malignant hematopoiesis).","['(c) The Author 2017.

METHODS: Eligible studies from Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from database inception through April 2016. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of overall survival (OS) were pooled to calculate the prognostic significance of SETBP1 mutation in patients. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies with 2321 patients were included in this meta-analysis; 4 studies for MDS, 5 studies for CMML, and 3 studies for CNL. Pooled results suggested that MDS and CMML patients with SETBP1 mutations had a significantly poorer prognosis when compared with patients with wild-type SETBP1 (MDS: HR = 1.808, 95% CI (1.218-2.685), P = 0.001; CMML: HR = 2.223, 95% CI (1.493-3.308), P<0.001). SETBP1 mutations in CNL patients however, showed no significant effect on the overall survival (HR = 1.773, 95% CI (0.877-3.582), P = 0.111). The Begg's and Egger's tests did not show significant publication bias in any groups.

Aberrant methylation of histone lysine sidechains have been often found in cancer. Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which can demethylate histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and other proteins, has recently been found to be a drug target for acute myeloid leukemia. To understand structure activity/selectivity relationships of LSD1 inhibitors, several series of cyclopropylamine and related compounds were synthesized and tested for their activities against LSD1 and related monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B. Several cyclopropylamine containing compounds were found to be highly potent and selective inhibitors of LSD1. A novel series cyclopropylimine compounds also exhibited strong inhibitory activity against LSD1. Structure activity relationships (SAR) of these compounds are discussed. Docking studies were performed to provide possible binding models of a representative compound in LSD1 and MAO-A.

The majority of patients received fludarabine-rituximab (FR) in front-line. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, fludarabine-based first-line therapy predicted longer time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) (HR 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.87, P=0.012) but no difference in overall survival (OS) compared to alkylator-based therapy. Deletion 17p was an independent predictor of worse TTNT and OS. The most common second-line treatments were cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone-rituximab and FR. There was no difference in OS between patients retreated in second-line with the same first-line regimen (n=33) versus different regimen (n=113). In conclusion, front-line treatment with fludarabine leads to a longer time until need for next treatment than alkylator-based therapy; however, fludarabine or alkylator therapy produces no difference in OS.

Here, we show that in addition to implementing H3K4me3 at promoters of bivalent genes, Mll2 (KMT2B)/COMPASS can also implement H3K4me3 at a subset of non-TSS regulatory elements, a subset of which shares epigenetic signatures of active enhancers. Our mechanistic studies reveal that association of Mll2's CXXC domain with CpG-rich regions plays an instrumental role for chromatin targeting and subsequent implementation of H3K4me3. Although Mll2/COMPASS is required for H3K4me3 implementation on thousands of loci, generation of catalytically mutant MLL2/COMPASS demonstrated that H3K4me3 implemented by this enzyme was essential for expression of a subset of genes, including those functioning in the control of transcriptional programs during embryonic development.

When the effector cells are natural-killer cells, both antibody-dependent and antibody-independent mechanisms could be exploited. When the effectors are T cells, direct tumor cytotoxicity can be engaged followed by a potential vaccination effect.

As relapse-specific genetic events, we identified activating mutations in NT5C2 (P=0.0001, Fisher's exact test), inactivation of TP53 (P=0.0007, Fisher's exact test) and duplication of chr17:q11.2-24.3 (P=0.0068, Fisher's exact test) in 32/67 of T-ALL relapse samples. Alterations of TP53 were frequently homozygous events, which significantly correlated with higher rates of copy number alterations in other genes compared with wild-type TP53 (P=0.0004, Mann-Whitney's test). We subsequently focused on mutations with prognostic impact and identified genes governing DNA integrity (TP53, n=8; USP7, n=4; MSH6, n=4), having key roles in the RAS signaling pathway (KRAS, NRAS, n=8), as well as IL7R (n=4) and CNOT3 (n=4) to be exclusively mutated in fatal relapses. These markers recognize 24/49 patients with a second event.

We discovered that few-layer graphene (FLG) dispersions have a specific killer action on monocytes, showing neither toxic nor activation effects on other immune cells. We confirmed the therapeutic application of graphene on an aggressive type of cancer that is myelomonocytic leukemia, where the monocytes are in their malignant form. We demonstrated that graphene has the unique ability to target and boost specifically the necrosis of monocytic cancer cells. Moreover, the comparison between FLG and a common chemotherapeutic drug, etoposide, confirmed the higher specificity and toxicity of FLG.

The objectives of the analysis were to evaluate the effect of baseline covariates and co-administration of topotecan plus carboplatin (T + C) on pharmacokinetics of veliparib in patients with refractory acute leukaemia, and compare veliparib concentration in various biological matrices. METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model was developed and effect of age, body size indices, sex, creatinine clearance (CrCL) and co-administration of T + C on the pharmacokinetics of veliparib were evaluated. The final model was qualified using bootstrap and quantitative predictive check. Linear regression was conducted to correlate concentrations of veliparib in various biological matrices. RESULTS: A two compartment model with first-order absorption with Tlag described veliparib pharmacokinetics. The apparent clearance (CL/F) and volume (Vc /F) were 16.5 l h(-1) and 122.7 l, respectively. The concomitant administration of T + C was not found to affect veliparib CL/F. CrCL and lean body mass (LBM) were significant covariates on CL/F and Vc/F, respectively. While a strong positive relationship was observed between veliparib concentrations in plasma and bone marrow supernatant, no correlation was observed between plasma and peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with veliparib's physiochemical properties and its elimination mechanism, LBM and CrCL were found to affect pharmacokinetics of veliparib while concomitant administration of T + C did not affect veliparib's CL/F. Plasma concentrations were found to be a reasonable surrogate for veliparib concentrations in peripheral blood and bone marrow supernatant but not blasts.

One of the obvious advantages of these agents is the decreased rate of infectious complications occurring during the course of therapy, compared to the use of standard immuno-chemotherapy regimens. Here, we describe 3 patients with CLL and 1 with mantle cell lymphoma who developed severe life-threatening pneumonias, during monotherapy with ibrutinib. The first case was a 70-year-old woman with relapsed CLL who developed bilateral pneumonia with hypoxia 1 week after starting ibrutinib. She did not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics and was treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and improved. In the second case, we describe a 76-year-old woman with relapsed CLL who developed recurrent pneumonia after 3 years of treatment with ibrutinib. Presuming that ibrutinib was the cause of pneumonitis with secondary infection, it was stopped with subsequent improvement. The third patient a 67 year-old man died because of severe bilateral necrotizing pneumonia due to invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis with pulmonary hemorrhage. The fourth patient with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma died because of severe bilateral pneumonia, caused by pseudomonas and candida, despite receiving appropriate antibiotics. From this experience, we hypothesize that the etiology of severe pneumonia associated with ibrutinib treatment is probably multifactorial, involving factors like preexisting immune-suppression, drug induced pneumonitis and infections. We suggest that patients with CLL or other lymphoproliferative disorders with suspected pneumonia during monotherapy with ibrutinib should be very carefully evaluated and need to undergo complete diagnostic workup to establish an exact diagnosis. Understanding which patients with CLL or lymphoma treated with kinase inhibitors are at a higher risk for developing pulmonary complications could be one of the important future challenges, when selecting the best available therapy for these patients.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Kreiniz, Natalia', 'Bejar, Jacob', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Tadmor, Tamar']","['Kreiniz N', 'Bejar J', 'Polliack A', 'Tadmor T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3435-8612'],"['Hematology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Pathology Department, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology Department, Hadassah University Hospital and Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Hematology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Pneumonia/*etiology', 'Pyrazoles/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib', 'immunosuppression', 'infection', 'pneumonia']",,2017/02/06 06:00,2018/03/13 06:00,['2017/02/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2387 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2018 Feb;36(1):349-354. doi: 10.1002/hon.2387.

Biochemistry, full-blood counts, thoracic radiographs, feline pancreatic-specific lipase, abdominal ultrasonography and feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukaemia virus (FIV/FeLV) SNAP tests had been performed. Mild hypochloraemia and moderate hypokalaemia were evident on initial presentation. Abdominal ultrasonography initially revealed unilateral renal nodules on the left side. These were subjected to fine-needle aspiration and cytological evaluation. A neuroendocrine tumour was suspected, and biopsies via midline coeliotomy were taken to confirm the diagnosis. Initial histopathology diagnosed primary renal carcinomas or neuroendocrine neoplasia; however, the definitive diagnosis became renal paragangliomas after immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy were performed. The cat was regularly monitored with serum biochemistry parameters, blood pressure determinations, thoracic radiographs and subsequent abdominal ultrasonography. Biochemistry, radiography and blood pressures remained normal over a 24-week follow-up period, while subsequent ultrasonography revealed tumour progression in both number and size in both kidneys. Primary neuroendocrine tumours of the kidney are frequently incorrectly diagnosed as other renal tumours such as renal cell carcinoma, mesonephric tumours or undifferentiated carcinomas.

This study investigated factors affecting IR/FP documentation and assessed the effect of implementation of an Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) program on documentation rates. METHODS: A retrospective review of charts of patients receiving gonadotoxic therapy was undertaken for documentation of IR/FP pre- and post-implementation of an AYA program. Change in documentation rates was assessed using univariate and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 173 charts were reviewed. On univariate analysis, IR/FP documentation was less likely if patients had metastatic disease (P < 0.01, P < 0.01), by tumor type (P < 0.01, P < 0.01), received less intensive chemotherapy (P = 0.03, P = 0.06), were older (P = 0.14, P < 0.01), had more children (P < 0.01, P < 0.01), or lacked AYA program involvement (P < 0.01, P < 0.01). FP discussion was more common in males (P = 0.02). On multivariable analysis, more children (P = 0.01, P = 0.03), older age (P < 0.01, P < 0.01), tumor type (P < 0.01, P = 0.01), stage (P = 0.02, NS), relationship (P = 0.03, NS), and lack of AYA involvement (P < 0.01, P < 0.01) were associated with lower rates of IR/FP documentation. Following AYA program implementation, IR/FP rates increased from 56% (CI 46-65%) to 85% (CI 74-92%, P < 0.01) and 54% (CI 45-64%) to 86% (CI 75-93%, P < 0.01), respectively. The effect of AYA program implementation on IR/FP documentation was most noticeable in leukemia, lymphoma, and breast groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Implementing an AYA consultation service at an adult cancer institution had a positive effect on the rates of IR/FP documentation. Specific programming can improve service delivery to AYA cancer patients, and fertility counseling should be integrated for patients undergoing gonadotoxic therapy.",,"['Lewin, Jeremy', 'Ma, Justin Ming Zheng', 'Mitchell, Laura', 'Tam, Seline', 'Puri, Natasha', 'Stephens, Derek', 'Srikanthan, Amirrtha', 'Bedard, Philippe', 'Razak, Albiruni', 'Crump, Michael', 'Warr, David', 'Giuliani, Meredith', 'Gupta, Abha']","['Lewin J', 'Ma JMZ', 'Mitchell L', 'Tam S', 'Puri N', 'Stephens D', 'Srikanthan A', 'Bedard P', 'Razak A', 'Crump M', 'Warr D', 'Giuliani M', 'Gupta A']",,"['Adolescent and Young Adult Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.

Based on available evidence, 90 mg/m(2) of daunorubicin given for three consecutive days (cumulative dose 270 mg/m(2)) as a part of the ""7 + 3"" induction regimen along with cytarabine is the most effective dose to achieve a complete remission as well as improve survival in patients who can tolerate it. This should be considered strongly in younger patients (less than 65 years of age and especially in those less than 50 years) irrespective of cytogenetic risk (likely more beneficial for favorable and intermediate risk) or molecular mutations (definitely in those with NPM1 or FLT3-ITD mutations). Among older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (>65 years), using a higher dose of daunorubicin may not improve survival. It is unclear if daunorubicin at 60 mg/m(2) for 3 days is as efficacious as the 90 mg/m(2) dose but may be used when there are concerns about tolerability of the higher dose. Although 90 mg/m(2) has no more adverse effects compared to 45 mg/m(2) of daunorubicin, increasing dosage beyond a cumulative dose of 330 mg/m(2) is detrimental due to increase in early mortality. Idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) for 3 days is an alternative with the possibility of better long-term outcomes. Elderly patients with AML and those with unfavorable cytogenetics, secondary, or treatment-related disease remain challenging to treat. All patients should be treated on clinical trials when available.",,"['Pophali, Priyanka', 'Litzow, Mark']","['Pophali P', 'Litzow M']",,"['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. litzow.mark@mayo.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Remission Induction', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML induction', '*Daunorubicin']",,2017/02/06 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/02/04 06:00'],"['2017/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-017-0446-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-017-0446-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2017 Jan;18(1):3. doi: 10.1007/s11864-017-0446-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this study were to determine the relationships between gingivitis and dental calculus thickness (DCT), or dental calculus coverage (DCC); determine the association of gingivitis scores and types of oral bacteria; and to evaluate bacterial co-infection in cats with periodontal disease. Twelve cats that were not infected with feline leukemia or feline immunodeficiency viruses were enrolled in the study. Gingivitis, DCT, and DCC were scored and recorded. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare scores among canine, 2nd premolar, 3rd premolar, 4th premolar, and 1st molar teeth. The relationship between gingivitis and DCT or DCC scores was determined using the Spearman rank sum test (rho). Subgingival bacteria were cultured and the association between bacterial species and gingivitis score was evaluated using a Fisher's exact test. The average gingivitis, DCT, and DCC scores for the caudal maxillary teeth were higher for the caudal mandibular teeth and more severe for the 3rd premolar, 4th premolar, and 1st molar teeth than for the canine teeth.

PA level was measured using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C). Motor performance was measured using the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition, Short Form (BOT-2 SF), and physical function was measured using the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Results: Thirteen children completed testing. PAQ-C scores were not associated with BOT-2 SF or 6MWT performance. Eleven children (85%) performed below the norm for the 6MWT. Children with elevated body mass index had poorer 6MWT but similar PAQ-C scores. Conclusion: PA was not found to be associated with motor performance and physical function.

Recently, MDR was found to be involved in various signal pathways, so the inhibition of signal molecules by molecular targeting drugs may help overcome MDR. In addition, the acquisition of MDR is shown to be associated with the overexpression of drug efflux pumps such as P-glycoprotein (MDR1), which in turn affects the regulation of the expression of cell survival factors, B-cell leukemia protein 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins, etc. We analyzed the mechanisms of MDR in hematopoietic malignancies, and showed that the activation of signaling molecules regulated the expression of drug efflux pumps and cell survival factors, thus suggesting that molecular targeting drugs are potentially useful as anti-MDR agents. In this review, I focus on recent advancements in understanding the mechanisms of MDR with respect to hematopoietic malignancies: (1) exploration of molecular targets for overcoming MDR in anti-cancer drug-resistant cell lines, (2) the mechanism of drug resistance through the cytokine autocrine loop, and (3) cell-cell interaction with bone marrow stromal cells, along with the application of molecular targeting drugs for overcoming MDR.",,"['Nishida, Shozo', 'Tsubaki, Masanobu']","['Nishida S', 'Tsubaki M']",,"['Laboratory of Pharmacotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Kindai University.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/physiology', 'Autocrine Communication/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics/physiology', '*Drug Discovery', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy/trends', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,2017/02/06 06:00,2017/05/06 06:00,['2017/02/04 06:00'],"['2017/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1248/yakushi.16-00229-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2017;137(2):145-149. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.16-00229-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of RCC, has been shown to sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, in particular by down-regulation of the Bak-inhibitory Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1. Here we demonstrate that sorafenib overcomes TRAIL resistance in RCC by a mechanism that does not rely on Mcl-1 down-regulation. Instead, sorafenib induces rapid dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) that is accompanied by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Loss of DeltaPsim and ROS production induced by sorafenib are independent of caspase activities and do not depend on the presence of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bax or Bak, indicating that both events are functionally upstream of the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling cascade. More intriguingly, we find that it is sorafenib-induced ROS accumulation that enables TRAIL to activate caspase-8 in RCC. This leads to apoptosis that involves activation of an amplification loop via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Thus, our mechanistic data indicate that sorafenib bypasses central resistance mechanisms through a direct induction of DeltaPsim breakdown and ROS production. Activation of this pathway might represent a useful strategy to overcome the cell-inherent resistance to cancer therapeutics, including TRAIL, in multiresistant cancers such as RCC.","['(c) 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Gillissen, Bernhard', 'Richter, Anja', 'Richter, Antje', 'Preissner, Robert', 'Schulze-Osthoff, Klaus', 'Essmann, Frank', 'Daniel, Peter T']","['Gillissen B', 'Richter A', 'Richter A', 'Preissner R', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Essmann F', 'Daniel PT']",,"['From the Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, University Medical Center Charite, Campus Berlin-Buch, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.', 'the German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'From the Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, University Medical Center Charite, Campus Berlin-Buch, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.', 'the German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'From the Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, University Medical Center Charite, Campus Berlin-Buch, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.', 'the Institute of Physiology and Experimental Clinical Research Center, University Medical Center Charite, 13125 Berlin, Germany.', 'the German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'the Interfaculty Institute for Biochemistry, University of Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Strasse 4, 72076 Tubingen, Germany, and.', 'the German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'the Interfaculty Institute for Biochemistry, University of Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Strasse 4, 72076 Tubingen, Germany, and.', 'From the Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, University Medical Center Charite, Campus Berlin-Buch, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany, pdaniel@mdc-berlin.de.', 'the German Cancer Consortium and German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical and Molecular Oncology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, 13125 Berlin-Buch, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorafenib', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC5399102,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family', '*Bak', '*Bax', '*Trail', '*apoptosis', '*cancer', '*drug resistance', '*reactive oxygen species (ROS)', '*sorafenib']",,2017/02/06 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2017/02/04 06:00'],"['2016/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)36568-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.754184 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2017 Apr 21;292(16):6478-6492. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.754184.

Herein we report that, in diagnostic chronic myeloid leukemia mononuclear cells and BCR-ABL1(+) cell lines, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists (GW1929, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) significantly decrease OCT-1 activity; conversely, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma antagonists (GW9662, T0070907) increase OCT-1 activity. Importantly, these effects can lead to corresponding changes in sensitivity to BCR-ABL kinase inhibition. Results were confirmed in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-transduced K562 cells. Furthermore, we identified a strong negative correlation between OCT-1 activity and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma transcriptional activity in diagnostic chronic myeloid leukemia patients (n=84; P<0.0001), suggesting that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activation has a negative impact on the intracellular uptake of imatinib and consequent BCR-ABL kinase inhibition. The inter-patient variability of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma activation likely accounts for the heterogeneity observed in patient OCT-1 activity at diagnosis. Recently, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist pioglitazone was reported to act synergistically with imatinib, targeting the residual chronic myeloid leukemia stem cell pool. Our findings suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligands have differential effects on circulating mononuclear cells compared to stem cells.

Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) is an immune checkpoint receptor expressed on activated/exhausted T cells. When engaged by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, LAG3 negatively regulates T-cell function, thereby contributing to tumor escape. Intriguingly, a soluble LAG3 variant activates both immune and malignant MHC class II-presenting cells. In the study herein, we examined the role of LAG3 in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, an MHC class II-presenting malignancy, and show that chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells express and secrete LAG3. High levels of surface and soluble LAG3 were associated with the unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy chain leukemic subtype and a shorter median time from diagnosis to first treatment. Utilizing a mechanism mediated through MHC class II engagement, recombinant soluble LAG3-Ig fusion protein, LAG3-Fc, activated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, induced anti-apoptotic pathways and protected the cells from spontaneous apoptosis, effects mediated by SYK, BTK and MAPK signaling. Moreover, LAG3 blocking antibody enhanced in vitro T-cell activation. Our data suggest that soluble LAG3 promotes leukemic cell activation and anti-apoptotic effects through its engagement with MHC class II. Furthermore, MHC class II-presenting chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells may affect LAG3-presenting T cells and impose immune exhaustion on their microenvironment; hence, blocking LAG3-MHC class II interactions is a potential therapeutic target in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Shapiro, Mika', 'Herishanu, Yair', 'Katz, Ben-Zion', 'Dezorella, Nili', 'Sun, Clare', 'Kay, Sigi', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Avivi, Irit', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Perry, Chava']","['Shapiro M', 'Herishanu Y', 'Katz BZ', 'Dezorella N', 'Sun C', 'Kay S', 'Polliack A', 'Avivi I', 'Wiestner A', 'Perry C']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel yairh@tlvmc.gov.il.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel.', 'Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD223 antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Blocking/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism']",PMC5477606,,,,2017/02/06 06:00,2018/01/19 06:00,['2017/02/04 06:00'],"['2016/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.148965 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.148965 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 May;102(5):874-882. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.148965.

We aimed to directly compare self-report to electronic monitoring (Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS]) and identify predictors of overreporting in a cohort of 416 children with ALL in first remission over 4 study months (1344 patient-months for the cohort) during maintenance therapy. Patients were classified as ""perfect reporters"" (self-report agreed with MEMS), ""overreporters"" (self-report was higher than MEMS by >/=5 days/month for >/=50% of study months), and ""others"" (not meeting criteria for perfect reporter or overreporter). Multivariable logistic regression examined sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, 6MP dose intensity, TPMT genotype, thioguanine nucleotide levels, and 6MP nonadherence (MEMS-based adherence <95%) associated with the overreporter phenotype; generalized estimating equations compared 6MP intake by self-report and MEMS. Self-reported 6MP intake exceeded MEMS at least some of the time in 84% of patients. Fifty patients (12%) were classified as perfect reporters, 98 (23.6%) as overreporters, 2 (0.5%) as underreporters, and 266 (63.9%) as others. In multivariable analysis, the following variables were associated with the overreporter phenotype: non-white race: Hispanic, odds ratio (OR), 2.4, P = .02; Asian, OR, 3.1, P = .02; African American, P < .001; paternal education less than college (OR, 1.4, P = .05); and 6MP nonadherence (OR, 9.4, P < .001).

A previous study showed that miR-138 is involved in the multidrug resistance of leukemia cells through down-regulation of the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the protein encoded by the human multidrug-resistant ABCB1/MDR1 gene. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms responsible remain to be elucidated. To deepen the description of the mechanism of transcriptional gene silencing on the MDR1 promoter, we initially performed a bioinformatics search for potential miR-138 binding sites in the MDR1 gene promoter sequence. Interestingly, we did not find miR-138 binding sites in this region, suggesting an indirect regulation. From six representative transcriptional factors involved in MDR1 gene regulation, an in silico analysis revealed that NF-kappaB/p65 has a specific binding site for miR-138. The results of luciferase reporter assay, western blot and flow cytometry shown here suggest that miR-138 might modulate the human MDR1 expression by inhibiting NF-kappaB/p65 as an indirect mechanism of MDR1 regulation. Furthermore, employing the human macrophage-like cell line U937 we observed comparable results with NF-kappaB/p65 down-regulation and we also observed a significant reduction in the IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA, as well as in their secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines following miR-138 expression, suggesting that canonical NF-kappaB target genes might also be potential targets for miR-138 in leukemia cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Their potential effect on the risk of developing different types of malignancies has been largely investigated, but studies on leukaemia in adults are scarce. METHODS: The present investigation is aimed at evaluating the potential role of regular coffee and tea intake on the risk of adult leukaemia by reanalysing a large population based case-control study carried out in Italy, a country with a high coffee consumption and a low use of green tea. Interviewed subjects, recruited between 1990 and 1993 in 11 Italian areas, included 1771 controls and 651 leukaemia cases. Association between Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML), Acute Lymphoid Leukaemia, Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia, Chronic Lymphoid Leukaemia, and use of coffee and tea was evaluated by standard logistic regression. Odds Ratios (OR) were estimated adjusting for the following potential confounders: gender, age, residence area, smoking habit, educational level, previous chemotherapy treatment, alcohol consumption and exposure to electromagnetic fields, radiation, pesticides and aromatic hydrocarbons. RESULTS: No association was observed between regular use of coffee and any type of leukaemia. A small protective effect of tea intake was found among myeloid malignancies, which was more evident among AML (OR=0.68, 95%CI: 0.49-0.94). However, no clear dose-response relation was found. CONCLUSION: The lower risk of leukaemia among regular coffee consumers, reported by a few of previous small studies, was not confirmed. The protective effect of tea on the AML risk is only partly consistent with results from other investigations.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the effects of sublethal levels of HHQ on the concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) in rat thymic lymphocytes by using a flow cytometric technique with fluorescent probes. HHQ at 10 muM or more significantly elevated intracellular Ca(2+) levels by increasing the membrane permeability of divalent cations, resulting in hyperpolarization via the activation of Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels.

It is mainly expressed as the cell-associated form and not actively secreted in healthy tissues. The intracellular IL-1alpha has been shown to be a chromatin-associated cytokine and can affect transcription. There are spontaneous expressions of IL-1alpha in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) blasts. However, the role of nuclear-localized IL-1alpha in ALL is not clear. Here we showed that overexpression of the nuclear form of IL-1alpha (propiece IL-1alpha) could promote proliferation and reduce apoptosis of T-ALL cells. It also increased the ALL cells' resistance to low serum concentration and cisplatin treatment. In vivo growth of the T-ALL cells overexpressing the propiece IL-1alpha were also enhanced compared to the control cells. Microarray analysis revealed many changes in gene expressions related to cell growth and stress, including a group of metallothionein genes. Moreover, the expressions of transcription factors, NFkappaB and specific protein 1 (SP1), were up-regulated by propiece IL-1alpha. Propiece IL-1alpha could bind to the promoter of SP1 and a binding sequence logo was identified.

The frequency of these mutations varies from approximately 30% overall up to 50% in patients with a normal karyotype. Several recent studies have exploited advances in massively parallel sequencing technology to shed light on the complex genomic landscape of AML. We hypothesize that variant allele fraction (VAF) data derived from massively parallel sequencing studies may provide further insights into the clonal architecture and pathogenesis of NPM1-driven leukemogenesis. Diagnostic peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from NPM1-mutated AML patients (n=120) were subjected to targeted sequencing using a panel of fifty-seven genes known to be commonly mutated in myeloid malignancies. NPM1 mutations were always accompanied by additional mutations and NPM1 had the highest VAF in only one case. Nearly all NPM1-mutated AML patients showed concurrent mutations in genes involved in regulation of DNA methylation (DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1, IDH2), RNA splicing (SRSF2, SF3B1), or in the cohesin complex (RAD21, SMC1A, SMC3, STAG2). Mutations in these genes had higher median VAFs that were higher (40% or greater) than the co-existing NPM1 mutations (median VAF 16.8%). Mutations associated with cell signaling pathways (FLT3, NRAS, and PTPN11) are also frequently encountered in NPM1-mutated AML cases, but had relatively low VAFs (7.0-11.9%). No cases of NPM1-mutated AML with a concurrent IDH2(R172) mutation were observed, suggesting that these variants are mutually exclusive. Overall, these data suggest that NPM1 mutations are a secondary or late event in the pathogenesis of AML and are preceded by founder mutations in genes that may be associated with recently described preclinical states such as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential or clonal cytopenias of undetermined significance.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

RESULTS: Of the 3179 cytogenetically informative AMLs diagnosed January 1997-May 2015, 246 (7.7%) had isolated trisomies. The frequency increased by age (2.4% at age 18-60 years vs. 23% at >60 years; P<.0001); the median age was 69 years. The five most common were +8 (4.0%), +13 (0.9%), +11 (0.8%), +21 (0.7%), and +4 (0.5%). Age and gender, types of AML and treatment, and complete remission and early death rates did not differ between the single trisomy and the intermediate risk (IR) groups or among cases with isolated gains of chromosomes 4, 8, 11, 13, or 21. The overall survival (OS) was similar in the single trisomy (median 1.6 years) and IR groups (1.7 years; P=.251).

Compared with patients in clinical trials, however, most patients in real-life settings have demonstrated worse outcomes. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed 96 patients with relapsed/refractory ATLL who received mogamulizumab treatment. RESULTS: Relapsed/refractory ATLL patients with a median age of 70 years received a median of five courses of mogamulizumab. Hematologic toxicity and skin rash were the most common adverse events, and both were manageable. Of 96 patients, 87 were evaluable for efficacy. The overall response rate was 36%, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from the start of mogamulizumab therapy were 1.8 and 4.0 months, respectively. Of the original 96 patients, only 25 fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the phase 2 study. Those who met the criteria demonstrated longer median PFS and OS durations of 2.7 and 8.5 months, respectively. The median OS from diagnosis in relapsed/refractory ATLL patients receiving mogamulizumab was 12 months, longer than the 5.8 months in a historical cohort without mogamulizumab. CONCLUSION: In clinical practice, mogamulizumab exhibited antitumor activity in patients with relapsed/refractory ATLL, with an acceptable toxicity profile.

DESIGN: The study involved descriptive qualitative research based on in-depth interviews that were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and thematically analyzed. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five hematology patients purposively selected from the client database of the Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland were interviewed for the study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that there is a critical period at the initial point of diagnosis and start of treatment when patients are experiencing shock, confusion, and a sense of being overwhelmed by stress, fear, and uncertainty about the future. The stress can be exacerbated by the loss of work and a period of waiting to access income (e.g., from superannuation or approval to receive a pension). For some patients, this is a critical period when individuals need support and advice to avoid long-term financial problems. However, at this point in time, many individuals do not know how to access financial advice or assistance from leading cancer supportive care organizations. The findings have practical implications to inform the work by many nurses who provide psychosocial care to hematology patients.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['McGrath, Pam']",['McGrath P'],,"['Pam McGrath, BSocWk, MA, PhD, is, Associate Professor and Senior Research Fellow, Centre for Community Science, Griffith University, Meadowbrook Qld, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nurs Forum,Nursing forum,0401006,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility/*standards', 'Hematology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/economics/nursing/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Qualitative Research', 'Queensland', 'Specialization/*trends', 'Transportation of Patients/*methods', 'Workforce', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'financial assistance', 'hematology', 'nursing supportive care', 'qualitative research', 'relocation']",,2017/02/06 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2017/02/03 06:00'],"['2015/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2016/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/nuf.12167 [doi]'],ppublish,Nurs Forum. 2017 Jan;52(1):55-61. doi: 10.1111/nuf.12167.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: To query the association of cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulating agents to treat patients with AID with the risk for developing myeloid neoplasm. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case-control study and medical record review included 40011 patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, coded diagnosis of primary AID who were seen at 2 centers from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2014; of these, 311 patients had a concomitant coded diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Eighty-six cases met strict inclusion criteria. A case-control match was performed at a 2:1 ratio. Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds ratio (OR) assessment for AID-directed therapies. Results: Among the 86 patients who met inclusion criteria (49 men [57%]; 37 women [43%]; mean [SD] age, 72.3 [15.6] years), 55 (64.0%) had MDS, 21 (24.4%) had de novo AML, and 10 (11.6%) had AML and a history of MDS. Rheumatoid arthritis (23 [26.7%]), psoriasis (18 [20.9%]), and systemic lupus erythematosus (12 [14.0%]) were the most common autoimmune profiles. Median time from onset of AID to diagnosis of myeloid neoplasm was 8 (interquartile range, 4-15) years. A total of 57 of 86 cases (66.3%) received a cytotoxic or an immunomodulating agent. In the comparison group of 172 controls (98 men [57.0%]; 74 women [43.0%]; mean [SD] age, 72.7 [13.8] years), 105 (61.0%) received either agent (P = .50). Azathioprine sodium use was observed more frequently in cases (odds ratio [OR], 7.05; 95% CI, 2.35- 21.13; P < .001). Notable but insignificant case cohort use among cytotoxic agents was found for exposure to cyclophosphamide (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 0.91-14.11) followed by mitoxantrone hydrochloride (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 0.23-33.0). Methotrexate sodium (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.29-1.22), mercaptopurine (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.15-2.53), and mycophenolate mofetil hydrochloride (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.21-2.03) had favorable ORs that were not statistically significant. No significant association between a specific length of time of exposure to an agent and the drug's category was observed. Conclusions and Relevance: In a large population with primary AID, azathioprine exposure was associated with a 7-fold risk for myeloid neoplasm. The control and case cohorts had similar systemic exposures by agent category. No association was found for anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. Finally, no timeline was found for the association of drug exposure with the incidence in development of myeloid neoplasm.",,"['Ertz-Archambault, Natalie', 'Kosiorek, Heidi', 'Taylor, Gretchen E', 'Kelemen, Katalin', 'Dueck, Amylou', 'Castro, Janna', 'Marino, Robert', 'Gauthier, Susanne', 'Finn, Laura', 'Sproat, Lisa Z', 'Palmer, Jeanne', 'Mesa, Ruben A', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Foran, James', 'Tibes, Raoul']","['Ertz-Archambault N', 'Kosiorek H', 'Taylor GE', 'Kelemen K', 'Dueck A', 'Castro J', 'Marino R', 'Gauthier S', 'Finn L', 'Sproat LZ', 'Palmer J', 'Mesa RA', 'Al-Kali A', 'Foran J', 'Tibes R']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Division of Health Sciences Research, Section of Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Division of Health Sciences Research, Section of Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Department of Information Technology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Division of Planning and Practice Analysis, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Division of Planning and Practice Analysis, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Azathioprine/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Mycophenolic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Psoriasis/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC5547922,,,,2017/02/06 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2017/02/03 06:00'],"['2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['2599993 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.6435 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2017 Jul 1;3(7):936-943. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.6435.,,,['P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['JAMA Oncol. 2018 Mar 1;4(3):420-421.

Here, we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of all 48 members of the NKL homeobox gene subclass in CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and during lymphopoiesis, identifying activities of nine particular genes. Four of these were expressed in HSPCs (HHEX, HLX1, NKX2-3 and NKX3-1) and three in common lymphoid progenitors (HHEX, HLX1 and MSX1). Interestingly, our data indicated downregulation of NKL homeobox gene transcripts in late progenitors and mature T-cells, a phenomenon which might explain the oncogenic impact of this group of genes in T-ALL. Using MSX1-expressing T-ALL cell lines as models, we showed that HHEX activates while HLX1, NKX2-3 and NKX3-1 repress MSX1 transcription, demonstrating the mutual regulation and differential activities of these homeobox genes. Analysis of a public T-ALL expression profiling data set comprising 117 patient samples identified 20 aberrantly activated members of the NKL subclass, extending the number of known NKL homeobox oncogene candidates. While 7/20 genes were also active during hematopoiesis, the remaining 13 showed ectopic expression. Finally, comparative analyses of T-ALL patient and cell line profiling data of NKL-positive and NKL-negative samples indicated absence of shared target genes but instead highlighted deregulation of apoptosis as common oncogenic effect. Taken together, we present a comprehensive survey of NKL homeobox genes in early hematopoiesis, T-cell development and T-ALL, showing that these genes generate an NKL-code for the diverse stages of lymphoid development which might be fundamental for regular differentiation.",,"['Nagel, Stefan', 'Pommerenke, Claudia', 'Scherr, Michaela', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'Kaufmann, Maren', 'Battmer, Karin', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Nagel S', 'Pommerenke C', 'Scherr M', 'Meyer C', 'Kaufmann M', 'Battmer K', 'MacLeod RA', 'Drexler HG']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4431-8988'],"['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (HHEX protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MSX1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (MSX1 protein, human)', '0 (NKX2-3 protein, human)', '0 (NKX3-1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics', 'MSX1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",PMC5289504,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2017/02/06 06:00,2017/08/22 06:00,['2017/02/03 06:00'],"['2016/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0171164 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-45832 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Feb 2;12(2):e0171164. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0171164. eCollection 2017.,20170202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclin D3 (CCND3) and CDK6 are highly expressed in T-ALL and have been effectively targeted in mutant NOTCH1-driven mouse models of this disease with a CDK4/6 small-molecule inhibitor. Combination therapy, however, will be needed for the successful treatment of human disease.Experimental Design: We performed preclinical drug testing using a panel of T-ALL cell lines first with LEE011, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and next with the combination of LEE011 with a panel of drugs relevant to T-ALL treatment. We then tested the combination of LEE011 with dexamethasone or everolimus in three orthotopic mouse models and measured on-target drug activity.Results: We first determined that both NOTCH1-mutant and wild-type T-ALL are highly sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of CDK4/6 when wild-type RB is expressed. Next, we determined that CDK4/6 inhibitors are antagonistic when used either concurrently or in sequence with many of the drugs used to treat relapsed T-ALL (methotrexate, mercaptopurine, asparaginase, and doxorubicin) but are synergistic with glucocorticoids, an mTOR inhibitor, and gamma secretase inhibitor. The combinations of LEE011 with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone or the mTOR inhibitor everolimus were tested in vivo and prolonged survival in three orthotopic mouse models of T-ALL. On-target activity was measured in peripheral blood and tissue of treated mice.Conclusions: We conclude that LEE011 is active in T-ALL and that combination therapy with corticosteroids and/or mTOR inhibitors warrants further investigation.

Stromal cells in the bone marrow secrete a variety of cytokines that promote plasma cell survival by regulating antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family including Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2. Although the antiapoptotic protein on which a cell depends is typically consistent among normal cells of a particular phenotype, Bcl-2 family dependence is highly heterogeneous in multiple myeloma. Although normal plasma cells and most multiple myeloma cells require Mcl-1 for survival, a subset of myeloma is codependent on Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL We investigated the role of the bone marrow microenvironment in determining Bcl-2 family dependence in multiple myeloma. We used the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-737 to study the factors regulating whether myeloma is Mcl-1 dependent, and thus resistant to ABT-737-induced apoptosis, or Bcl-2/Bcl-xL codependent, and thus sensitive to ABT-737. We demonstrate that bone marrow stroma is capable of inducing Mcl-1 dependence through the production of the plasma cell survival cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 upregulates Mcl-1 transcription in a STAT3-dependent manner, although this occurred in a minority of the cells tested. In all cells, IL-6 treatment results in posttranslational modification of the proapoptotic protein Bim. Phosphorylation of Bim shifts its binding from Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to Mcl-1, an effect reversed by MEK inhibition.

This is a population-based study in Asian patients with lymphoid disease and L-asp-related VTE. The overall incidence of L-asp-associated VTE was similar to reports on Caucasians. This first and largest study in Asians shows that mainly adult patients are at risk of thrombosis. SUMMARY: Background L-asparaginase (L-asp)-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious adverse complication associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma treatment. The incidence rate of L-asp-related VTE in Asian cancer patients is not well known. Methods We performed a population-based study between 2009 and 2013 using claim databases, including both diagnostic and medication codes, such as anti-cancer treatment with L-asp and VTE diagnoses from the starting date until 3 months after cessation of L-asp. Results A total of 3286 patients were prescribed L-asp treatment for any type of lymphoid malignancy including ALL and lymphoma; 116 patients (3.5%) experienced VTE. The most common site of thrombosis was the upper extremities (34.5%). Cerebral vein thrombosis (1.7%) occurred in two pediatric patients; 2.4% (43/1795) of pediatric patients and 4.9% (72/1486) of adult patients suffered from VTE, respectively; 2.7% (56/2064) of ALL and 4.9% (59/1217) of lymphoma patients were diagnosed with VTE after L-asp exposure. After univariate analysis, both the diagnosis of lymphoma (vs. ALL) and being an adult patient (vs. pediatric patient) were risk factors for VTE occurrence. However, after multivariate analysis, only age > 18 remained a risk factor for VTE (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.81). Conclusions This is the first and largest population-based study in Asian patients with lymphoid malignancies treated with L-asp demonstrating that adult patients are at elevated risk of thrombosis after L-asp exposure. The overall incidence of L-asp-related VTE amongst these patients was similar to that in Caucasian populations.",['(c) 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.'],"['Lee, J H', 'Lee, J', 'Yhim, H-Y', 'Oh, D', 'Bang, S-M']","['Lee JH', 'Lee J', 'Yhim HY', 'Oh D', 'Bang SM']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, CHA University, Seongnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Republic of Korea', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombosis', 'Venous Thromboembolism/*chemically induced/*complications', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Asian', '*L-asparaginase', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*venous thromboembolism']",,2017/02/06 06:00,2018/02/02 06:00,['2017/02/03 06:00'],"['2016/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jth.13636 [doi]'],ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2017 Apr;15(4):655-661. doi: 10.1111/jth.13636.

Wogonin had strong reversal potency via reduction of Nrf2 mRNA in Adriamycin (ADR)-induced resistant human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562/A02, but the mechanism of reduction of Nrf2 mRNA was still unclear. In this study, we aimed to delineate the mechanism by which Wogonin suppressed transcription of Nrf2 in resistant CML cells and further evaluate the reversal effects of Wogonin on the established animal models. Data indicated that Wogonin suppressed transcription of Nrf2 by NF-kappaB inactivation. Wogonin inhibited the binding of p65 to Nrf2 by suppression of the kappaB-binding activity. Further research revealed the kappaB2 site was responsible for the decreased Nrf2 by Wogonin in resistant K562 cells. Furthermore, reduction of pY705-Stat3 was involved in inhibition of the binding of p65 to Nrf2 by Wogonin. In vivo, Wogonin potentiated the inhibitory effect of ADR on leukemia development by suppressing pY705-Stat3 and Nrf2 signaling. In summary, these results demonstrated Wogonin could combat chemoresistance effectively through inhibiting Nrf2 via Stat3/NF-kappaB signaling, and supported that Wogonin can be developed into an efficient natural sensitizer for resistant human myelogenous leukemia.",,"['Xu, Xuefen', 'Zhang, Xiaobo', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Yang, Lin', 'Liu, Yicheng', 'Huang, Shaoliang', 'Lu, Lu', 'Kong, Lingyi', 'Li, Zhiyu', 'Guo, Qinglong', 'Zhao, Li']","['Xu X', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang L', 'Liu Y', 'Huang S', 'Lu L', 'Kong L', 'Li Z', 'Guo Q', 'Zhao L']",,"[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Department of Natural Medicinal Chemistry, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Department of Natural Medicinal Chemistry, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Flavanones)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'POK93PO28W (wogonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcription Factor RelA/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",PMC5288730,,,['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],2017/02/06 06:00,2018/10/05 06:00,['2017/02/03 06:00'],"['2016/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [medline]']","['srep39950 [pii]', '10.1038/srep39950 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Feb 2;7:39950. doi: 10.1038/srep39950.,20170202,,,,,,,,,,,,['Sci Rep. 2021 Jun 11;11(1):12746.

Such an HTLV-1 infection during childhood is believed to be a risk factor for ATL development. Although it has been suggested that an increased proviral load (PVL), a higher titre of antibody (Ab) in the infected mother and prolonged breastfeeding are associated with an increased risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), the mechanisms underlying MTCT of HTLV-1 remain largely unknown. In this study, we developed an MTCT model using orally HTLV-1-infected rats that have no Ab responses against viral antigens, such as Gag and Env. In this model, HTLV-1 could be transmitted from the infected mother rats to their offspring at a high rate (50-100 %), and the rate of MTCT tended to be correlated with the PVL of the infected mother rats. Furthermore, passive immunization of uninfected adult rats and an infected mother rat with a rat anti-HTLV-1 Env gp46-neutralizing mAb was unable to suppress primary oral HTLV-1 infection to the adult rats and vertical HTLV-1 transmission to the offspring, respectively. Our findings indicate that this MTCT model would be useful to investigate not only the mechanisms of MTCT but also the role of anti-HTLV-1 Ab in MTCT of HTLV-1. They also provide some information on the role of maternal Abs in MTCT, which should be considered when designing a strategy for prevention of MTCT of HTLV-1.",,"['Murakami, Yuji', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Ando, Satomi', 'Tanaka, Reiko', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Murakami Y', 'Hasegawa A', 'Ando S', 'Tanaka R', 'Masuda T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Kannagi M']",,"['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'HTLV-I Infections/*transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', '*Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Rats']",,,,,2017/02/06 06:00,2017/06/27 06:00,['2017/02/03 06:00'],"['2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/jgv.0.000733 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2017 Apr;98(4):835-846. doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.000733.

The periodicity of somitogenesis is regulated by a molecular oscillator, the segmentation clock, driving cyclic gene expression in the unsegmented paraxial mesoderm, from which somites derive. Three signaling pathways underlie the molecular mechanism of the oscillator: Wnt, FGF, and Notch. In particular, Notch has been demonstrated to be an essential piece in the intricate somitogenesis regulation puzzle. Notch is required to synchronize oscillations between neighboring cells, and is moreover necessary for somite formation and clock gene oscillations. Following ligand activation, the Notch receptor is cleaved to liberate the active intracellular domain (NICD) and during somitogenesis NICD itself is produced and degraded in a cyclical manner, requiring tightly regulated, and coordinated turnover. It was recently shown that the pace of the segmentation clock is exquisitely sensitive to levels/stability of NICD. In this review, we focus on what is known about the mechanisms regulating NICD turnover, crucial to the activity of the pathway in all developmental contexts. To date, the regulation of NICD stability has been attributed to phosphorylation of the PEST domain which serves to recruit the SCF/Sel10/FBXW7 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involved in NICD turnover.

The invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is known as isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid, pleural fluid, or peritoneal fluid). The aim of this study is to survey the clinical manifestations and laboratory results of IPD and identify the prognostic factors of mortality. From January 2001 to December 2006, a retrospective review of chart was performed in a teaching hospital in Taipei. The hospitalized pediatric patients with the diagnosis of pneumonia, arthritis, infectious endocarditis, meningitis or sepsis were recruited. Among them, 50 patients were pneumococcal infections proved by positive culture results or antigen tests. Clinical manifestations, laboratory data and hospitalization courses were analyzed. The median age was 3.5-year-old and there were 30 male patients (60%). Eight patients (16%) had underlying disease such as leukemia or congenital heart disease. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was observed in ten patients and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was performed in three patients. Leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein and AST level were noted in most of the patients. The overall mortality rate was 10%. We found that leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and high CRP level were significant predictors for mortality. In conclusion, S. pneumoniae remains an important health threat worldwide and IPD is life-threatening with high mortality rate. We found leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and high CRP levels to be associated with mortality in pediatric IPD, and these factors are worthy of special attention at admission. Although we failed to identify a statistically significant prognostic factor in multivariate analysis due to relatively small sample size, we suggest an aggressive antibiotic treatment in patients with these factors at admission. Further large-scale studies are warranted.",,"['Chiu, Nan-Chang', 'Chi, Hsin', 'Peng, Chun-Chih', 'Chang, Hung-Yang', 'Huang, Daniel Tsung-Ning', 'Chang, Lung', 'Lei, Wei-Te', 'Lin, Chien-Yu']","['Chiu NC', 'Chi H', 'Peng CC', 'Chang HY', 'Huang DT', 'Chang L', 'Lei WT', 'Lin CY']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, MacKay Children's Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan."", 'MacKay Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'MacKay Medical College, New Taipei, Taiwan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, MacKay Children's Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan."", 'MacKay Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'MacKay Medical College, New Taipei, Taiwan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, MacKay Children's Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan."", 'MacKay Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'MacKay Medical College, New Taipei, Taiwan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, MacKay Children's Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan."", 'Department of Medical Technology, Jen-Teh Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management, Miaoli, Taiwan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, MacKay Children's Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan."", 'MacKay Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management, Taipei, Taiwan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, MacKay Children's Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan."", 'MacKay Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Hsinchu MacKay Memorial Hospital, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Hsinchu MacKay Memorial Hospital, Hsinchu, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,,,PMC5270593,['NOTNLM'],"['Invasive pneumococcal disease', 'Pneumococcus', 'Pneumonia', 'Prognostic factor', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae']",['The authors declare there are no competing interests.'],2017/02/06 06:00,2017/02/06 06:01,['2017/02/03 06:00'],"['2016/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.2941 [doi]', '2941 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2017 Jan 25;5:e2941. doi: 10.7717/peerj.2941. eCollection 2017.,20170125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known that leukemia stem cells (LSCs), a very small subpopulation of the total number of leukemic cells, maintain the leukemia phenotype ( approximately 80-90% of AML remain the same as at first diagnosis), display chemotherapy resistance, and contribute to disease regeneration. Therefore, targeting LSCs could control the relapse of AML. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), an effector of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, can selectively downregulate any gene implicated in the pathology of disease, presenting great potential for treatment of AML. In this study an antibody targeted cyclodextrin-based nanoparticle (NP) (CD.DSPE-PEG-Fab) was developed for siRNA delivery specifically to AML LSCs. The targeted CD.siRNA.DSPE-PEG-Fab formulation, where Fab specifically targets the IL-3 receptor alpha-chain (IL-3Ralpha, also known as CD123, a cell surface antigen for human AML LSCs), achieved antigen-mediated cellular uptake in KG1 cells (an AML leukemia stem and progenitor cell line). Efficient delivery of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) siRNA using the targeted formulation resulted in downregulation of the corresponding mRNA and protein in KG1 cells and in ex vivo primary AML patient derived samples. The resulting silencing of BRD4 induced myeloid differentiation and triggered leukemia apoptosis. In addition, a synergistic therapeutic effect was detected when administered in combination with the chemotherapeutic, cytarabine (Ara-C). These results indicate the clinical potential of the antibody-tagged cyclodextrin NP for targeted delivery of therapeutic siRNA in the treatment of AML.",,"['Guo, Jianfeng', 'Russell, Eileen G', 'Darcy, Raphael', 'Cotter, Thomas G', 'McKenna, Sharon L', 'Cahill, Mary R', ""O'Driscoll, Caitriona M""]","['Guo J', 'Russell EG', 'Darcy R', 'Cotter TG', 'McKenna SL', 'Cahill MR', ""O'Driscoll CM""]",,"['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University , Changchun 130021, China.', 'Pharmacodelivery Group, School of Pharmacy, University College Cork , Cork, Ireland.', 'Tumour Biology Laboratory, School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University College Cork , Cork, Ireland.', 'Pharmacodelivery Group, School of Pharmacy, University College Cork , Cork, Ireland.', 'Tumour Biology Laboratory, School of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, University College Cork , Cork, Ireland.', 'Cork Cancer Research Centre, University College Cork , Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Cork University Hospital , Cork, Ireland.', 'Pharmacodelivery Group, School of Pharmacy, University College Cork , Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cyclodextrins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Antibodies/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclodextrins/*administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*RNAi therapeutics', '*cancer epigenetic gene therapy', '*leukemia stem cells', '*nonviral nanoparticles', '*personalized medicine']",,2017/02/02 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/02/02 06:00'],"['2017/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b01150 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2017 Mar 6;14(3):940-952. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b01150.

Macrophage-cancer cell fusion as a cause of metastasis was proposed more than a century ago by German pathologist Prof. Otto Aichel. Since then this theory has been confirmed in numerous animal studies and recently in a patient with metastatic melanoma. METHODS: Here we analyzed tumor DNA from a 51-year-old man who, 8 years following an allogeneic BMT from his brother for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), developed a nodular malignant melanoma on the upper back with spread to an axillary sentinal lymph node. We used laser microdissection to isolate FFPE tumor cells free of leucocytes. They were genotyped using forensic short tandem repeat (STR) length-polymorphisms to distinguish donor and patient genomes. Tumor and pre-transplant blood lymphocyte DNAs were analyzed for donor and patient alleles at 15 autosomal STR loci and the sex chromosomes. RESULTS: DNA analysis of the primary melanoma and the nodal metastasis exhibit alleles at each STR locus that are consistent with both the patient and donor. The doses vary between these samples indicative of the relative amounts of genomic DNA derived from the patient and donor. CONCLUSION: The evidence supports fusion and hybridization between donor and patient cells as the initiator of metastasis in this patient. That this phenomenon has now been seen in a second case suggests that fusion is likely to play a significant role for melanoma and other solid tumor metastasis, perhaps leading to new avenues of treatment for this most problematic disease.",,"['LaBerge, Greggory S', 'Duvall, Eric', 'Grasmick, Zachary', 'Haedicke, Kay', 'Pawelek, John']","['LaBerge GS', 'Duvall E', 'Grasmick Z', 'Haedicke K', 'Pawelek J']",,"['Human Medical Genetics and Genomics Program, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States of America.', 'Denver Police Crime Lab-Forensics and Evidence Division, Denver, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Denver Police Crime Lab-Forensics and Evidence Division, Denver, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Colorado AMC, Denver, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Department of Internal Medicine Section of Medical Oncology and the Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.', 'Department of Dermatology and The Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (S100 Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'S100 Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics']",PMC5287451,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2017/02/02 06:00,2017/08/09 06:00,['2017/02/02 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0168581 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-20108 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Feb 1;12(2):e0168581. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0168581. eCollection 2017.,20170201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 9-month old, female, common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) had increased respiratory effort. METHODS: A complete necropsy with histology and immunohistochemistry was performed. RESULTS: The thymus was replaced by a firm, gray-tan mass with a faint green tint, filling over 50% of the thoracic cavity. Sheets of granulocytes, lymphoid cells, nucleated erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, and hematopoietic precursors of indeterminate cell lineage replaced the thymus, perithymic connective tissue, mediastinal adipose tissues, epicardium, and much of the myocardium. The cells demonstrated diffuse strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for lysozyme, and strong, multifocal membranous immunoreactivity for CD117. CONCLUSION: We report the first case of a myeloid sarcoma in a common marmoset (C. jacchus), similar to reported human cases of mediastinal myeloid sarcoma, and present a review of myeloproliferative diseases from the veterinary literature.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasia patients have an increased thrombotic risk. This is assessed using various scoring systems but these are far from ideal and individual risk. The currend trend to personalised medicine requires finding the most useful thrombotic risk biomarker in these patients. Routine tests for coagulation do not take account of both pro- and anti-coagulant factors which is why these tests are not useful in patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. Thrombin generation reflects more accurately the balance between pro- and anti-coagulant factors. Some parameters of thrombin generation such as the endogenous thrombin potential are higher in Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm patients, especially in JAK2 V617F carriers than in healthy controls. They are even higher in those with reactive thrombocytosis. The JAK2 V617F allele burden correlates more with a higher thrombin generation potential in patients who are not treated with hydroxycarbamidum. Instead, JAK2 V617F-positive patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms were the most sensitive to hydroxycarbamidum, as was reflected in lower values of platelet thrombin generation potential.

AML in older patients remains an area of significant unmet need necessitating novel therapeutic strategies. In older patients with normal cytogenetics, molecular variables can be helpful in refining risk. This molecular revolution has promoted a shift in the treatment paradigm of AML. Open new questions concern the necessity of an individualized therapy that may take into account not only an increase in survival but also the maintenance or improvement in terms of quality of life, the management of symptoms, and a maximization of time outside of hospital care. Molecular abnormalities provide the genomic footprint for the development of targeted therapies.

There is limited evidence for the relationship between breastfeeding and the incidence of leukemia. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluate the correlation of childhood leukemia and lymphoma with breastfeeding duration in children in southern Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Through this case control study, we compared 123 patients with leukemia and lymphoma to a control group of 137 healthy children. Statistical analysis was done using the Chi-square test and t-test as well as logistic regression methods. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Our findings showed that breastfeeding duration had no significant difference between cases and controls. However, the rural living percentage in patients with leukemia and lymphoma was higher than in the control group (39.8% versus 14.6% [P < 0.001 and OR = 3.87]) and parents' exposure to chemical materials during the war between Iran and Iraq was higher in sick patients (6.5% versus 0% [OR = 20.2%]). CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that breastfeeding duration has no protective effect against childhood leukemia and lymphoma. In addition, we suggest that some factors such as living in a rural area, smoking during pregnancy, parents' exposure to chemical materials and low socioeconomic status can increase the incidence rate of childhood leukemia and lymphoma.",,"['Karimi, Mehran', 'Haghighat, Mahmoud', 'Dialameh, Zahra', 'Tahmasbi, Leila', 'Parand, Shirin', 'Bardestani, Marzieh']","['Karimi M', 'Haghighat M', 'Dialameh Z', 'Tahmasbi L', 'Parand S', 'Bardestani M']",,"['Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, IR Iran.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, IR Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, IR Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, IR Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, IR Iran.', 'Department of Library and Information Science, College of Humanities, Khouzestan Science and research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ahvaz, IR Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran Red Crescent Med J,Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,101319850,,,,PMC5253205,['NOTNLM'],"['Breastfeeding', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma']",,2017/02/02 06:00,2017/02/02 06:01,['2017/02/02 06:00'],"['2015/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2015/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5812/ircmj.29771 [doi]'],epublish,Iran Red Crescent Med J. 2016 Feb 13;18(9):e29771. doi: 10.5812/ircmj.29771. eCollection 2016 Sep.,20160213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2001 classified AEL into two types: (1) erythroid/myeloid leukaemia which required >/=50% erythroid precursors with >/=20% of the non-erythroid cells to be myeloid blasts and (2) pure erythroleukemia (pEL) with >/=80% erythroblasts. The WHO 2008 classification kept these subcategories, but made erythroleukemia a diagnosis of exclusion. There are very few studies on the clinico haematological and cytogenetic profile of this disease, considering the rarity of its occurrence and poor prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was done by retrospective analysis of data from 32 case files of patients diagnosed with AEL. Clinical details noted down were the demographic profile, peripheral blood smear details and bone marrow examination details: (1) blasts-erythroblasts and myeloblasts, (2) dysplasia in the cell lineages and (3) cytogenetic abnormalities. RESULTS: The most common presenting symptom was fever. Pancytopenia at presentation was seen in 81.25% of patients. Dysplasia was observed in bone marrow in 100% of erythroblasts and in 40% of myeloblasts in erythroid/myeloid subtype. In pure myeloid subtype, myeloid and megakaryocytic dysplasias were not obvious. Complex karyotype was noticed only in patients of pEL. CONCLUSION: AEL is a rare group of heterogeneous diseases with many neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions mimicking the diagnosis.

In this prospective multi-center phase II study, we sought to establish whether treatment intensification with R-ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) chemotherapy followed by 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan-BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) for high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients who are positive on interim PET scan after 4 cycles of R-CHOP-14 (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone) can improve 2-year progression-free survival from a historically unfavorable rate of 40% to a rate of 65%. Patients received 4 cycles of R-CHOP-14, followed by a centrally-reviewed PET performed at day 17-20 of cycle 4 and assessed according to International Harmonisation Project criteria. Median age of the 151 evaluable patients was 57 years, with 79% stages 3-4, 54% bulk, and 54% International Prognostic Index 3-5. Among the 143 patients undergoing interim PET, 101 (71%) were PET-negative (96 of whom completed R-CHOP), 42 (29%) were PET-positive (32 of whom completed R-ICE and 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan-BEAM). At a median follow up of 35 months, the 2-year progression-free survival for PET-positive patients was 67%, a rate similar to that for PET-negative patients treated with R-CHOP-14 (74%, P=0.11); overall survival was 78% and 88% (P=0.11), respectively. In an exploratory analysis, progression-free and overall survival were markedly superior for PET-positive Deauville score 4 versus score 5 (P=0.0002 and P=0.001, respectively). Therefore, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients who are PET-positive after 4 cycles of R-CHOP-14 and who switched to R-ICE and 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan-BEAM achieved favorable survival outcomes similar to those for PET-negative R-CHOP-14-treated patients.

FZR1 has been implicated as both a tumor suppressor and oncoprotein, and its precise contribution to carcinogenesis remains unclear. Here, we examined the role of FZR1 in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy by analyzing tumor models and patient specimens. In an Fzr1 gene-trap mouse model of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), mice with Fzr1-deficient B-ALL survived longer than those with Fzr1-intact disease, and sensitivity of Fzr1-deficient B-ALL cells to DNA damage appeared increased. Consistently, conditional knockdown of FZR1 sensitized human B-ALL cell lines to DNA damage-induced cell death. Moreover, multivariate analyses of reverse-phase protein array of B-ALL specimens from newly diagnosed B-ALL patients determined that a low FZR1 protein expression level was an independent predictor of a longer remission duration. The clinical benefit of a low FZR1 expression level at diagnosis was no longer apparent in patients with relapsed B-ALL. Consistent with this result, secondary and tertiary mouse recipients of Fzr1-deficient B-ALL cells developed more progressive and radiation-resistant disease than those receiving Fzr1-intact B-ALL cells, indicating that prolonged inactivation of Fzr1 promotes the development of resistant clones. Our results suggest that reduction of FZR1 increases therapeutic sensitivity of B-ALL and that transient rather than tonic inhibition of FZR1 may be a therapeutic strategy.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Ishizawa, Jo', 'Sugihara, Eiji', 'Kuninaka, Shinji', 'Mogushi, Kaoru', 'Kojima, Kensuke', 'Benton, Christopher B', 'Zhao, Ran', 'Chachad, Dhruv', 'Hashimoto, Norisato', 'Jacamo, Rodrigo O', 'Qiu, Yihua', 'Yoo, Suk Young', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Saya, Hideyuki']","['Ishizawa J', 'Sugihara E', 'Kuninaka S', 'Mogushi K', 'Kojima K', 'Benton CB', 'Zhao R', 'Chachad D', 'Hashimoto N', 'Jacamo RO', 'Qiu Y', 'Yoo SY', 'Okamoto S', 'Andreeff M', 'Kornblau SM', 'Saya H']",,"['Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, and.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, and.', 'Intractable Disease Research Center, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Hematology, Respiratory Medicine, and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan; and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cdh1 Proteins)', '0 (FZR1 protein, human)', '0 (Fzr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cdh1 Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Death', '*DNA Damage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism/therapy']",PMC5383867,,,,2017/02/02 06:00,2017/08/11 06:00,['2017/02/02 06:00'],"['2016/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33518-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-07-726216 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Apr 6;129(14):1958-1968. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-07-726216.

Despite tremendous advances in our understanding of Notch1 transcriptional programs, the mechanisms by which Notch1 stability and turnover are regulated remain obscure. The goal of the current study is to identify intracellular Notch1 (ICN1, the activated form of Notch1) binding partner(s) regulating its stability and activity. Experimental Design: We employed immunoaffinity purification to identify ICN1-associating partner(s) and used coimmunoprecipitation to verify the endogenous protein interaction. Pharmacologic or short hairpin RNA-mediated inhibition was applied in loss-of-function assays to assess the role of tentative binding partner(s) in modulating ICN1 protein stability as well as affecting T-ALL cell expansion in vitro and in vivo Mechanistic analysis involved protein degradation and polyubiquitination assays. Results: We identify the Hsp90 chaperone as a direct ICN1-binding partner essential for its stabilization and transcriptional activity. T-ALL cells exhibit constitutive endogenous ICN1-Hsp90 interaction and Hsp90 depletion markedly decreases ICN1 levels. The Hsp90-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase Stub1 mediates the ensuring proteasome-dependent ICN1 degradation. Administration of 17-AAG or PU-H71, two distinct Hsp90 inhibitors, depletes ICN1, inhibits T-ALL cell proliferation, and triggers dramatic apoptotic cell death. Systemic treatment with PU-H71 reduces ICN1 expression and profoundly inhibits murine T-ALL allografts as well as human T-ALL xenografts. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate Hsp90 blockade leads to ICN1 destabilization, providing an alternative strategy to antagonize oncogenic Notch1 signaling with Hsp90-selective inhibitors.

However, the possibility of PML being involved in cardiac disease has not been examined. In mice undergoing transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) injection, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) was upregulated along with dynamic alteration of PML SUMOylation. In cultured neonatal mouse cardiac fibroblasts (NMCFs), ATO, angiotensin II (Ang II), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) significantly triggered PML SUMOylation and the assembly of PML-NBs. Inhibition of SUMOylated PML by silencing UBC9, the unique SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme, reduced the development of cardiac fibrosis and partially improved cardiac function in TAC mice. In contrast, enhancing SUMOylated PML accumulation, by silencing RNF4, a poly-SUMO-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, accelerated the induction of cardiac fibrosis and promoted cardiac function injury. PML colocalized with Pin1 (a positive regulator for TGF-beta1 mRNA expression in PML-NBs) and increased TGF-beta1 activity. These findings suggest that the UBC9/PML/RNF4 axis plays a critical role as an important SUMO pathway in cardiac fibrosis. Modulating the protein levels of the pathway provides an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis and heart failure.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

In the second part of the study, 15 samples were cultured for 6 days on alginate scaffolds or CollPlant matrices with basic culture medium. Follicular development was assessed by follicular counts and classification, Ki67 immunohistochemistry and 17beta-oestradiol and anti-Mullerian hormone measurements in spent media samples. Primordial follicular growth was not enhanced by LIF. Despite some significant differences among the four matrices, none appeared to have a clear advantage, apart from significantly more Ki67-stained follicles on alginate and CollPlant matrices.

Refractory/relapsed disease has very poor outcome, and patients would benefit from novel, less toxic, therapeutic strategies that overcome resistance. Relapse/resistance are linked to cancer stem cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. The purpose of the present work was to study less toxic alternative therapeutic agents for relapsed/refractory DS-AMKL. METHODS: Fourteen AML cell lines including the DS-AMKL CMY and CMK from relapsed/refractory AML were used. Cytarabine (Ara-C), bortezomib (BTZ), disulfiram/copper (DSF/Cu(2+)) were evaluated for cytotoxicity, depletion of ALDH-positive cells, and resistance. BTZ-resistant CMY and CMK variants were generated by continuous BTZ treatment. Cell viability was assessed using CellTiter-Glo(R), ALDH activity by ALDELUOR(TM), and proteasome inhibition by western blot of ubiquitinated proteins and the Proteasome-Glo Chymotrypsin-Like (CT-like) assay, apoptosis by Annexin V Fluos/Propidium iodide staining, and mutations were detected using PCR, cloning and sequencing. RESULTS: Ara-C-resistant AML cell lines were sensitive to BTZ and DSF/Cu(2+). The Ara-C-resistant DS-AMKL CMY cells had a high percentage of ALDH(bright) ""stem-like"" populations that may underlie Ara-C resistance. One percent of these cells were still resistant to BTZ but sensitive to DSF/Cu(2+). To understand the mechanism of BTZ resistance, BTZ resistant (CMY-BR) and (CMK-BR) were generated. A novel mutation PSMB5 Q62P underlied BTZ resistance, and was associated with an overexpression of the beta5 proteasome subunit. BTZ-resistance conferred increased resistance to Ara-C due to G1 arrest in the CMY-BR cells, which protected the cells from S-phase damage by Ara-C. CMY-BR and CMK-BR cells were cross-resistant to CFZ and MG-132 but sensitive to DSF/Cu(2+). In this setting, DSF/Cu(2+) induced apoptosis and proteasome inhibition independent of CT-like activity inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that DSF/Cu(2+) overcomes Ara-C and BTZ resistance in cell lines from DS-AMKL patients. A novel mutation underlying BTZ resistance was detected that may identify BTZ-resistant patients, who may not benefit from treatment with CFZ or Ara-C, but may be responsive to DSF/Cu(2+). Our findings support the clinical development of DSF/Cu(2+) as a less toxic efficacious treatment approach in patients with relapsed/refractory DS-AMKL.",,"['Bista, Ranjan', 'Lee, David W', 'Pepper, Oliver B', 'Azorsa, David O', 'Arceci, Robert J', 'Aleem, Eiman']","['Bista R', 'Lee DW', 'Pepper OB', 'Azorsa DO', 'Arceci RJ', 'Aleem E']",,"[""Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, USA."", ""Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, USA."", 'Department of Child Health, University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, Biosciences Partnership Building (BSPB), 5th floor, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', 'Department of Child Health, University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, Biosciences Partnership Building (BSPB), 5th floor, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', 'Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, UK.', ""Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, USA."", 'Department of Child Health, University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, Biosciences Partnership Building (BSPB), 5th floor, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', ""Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, USA."", 'Department of Child Health, University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, Biosciences Partnership Building (BSPB), 5th floor, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA.', ""Institute of Molecular Medicine at Phoenix Children's Hospital, Phoenix, AZ, USA. ealeem@email.arizona.edu."", 'Department of Child Health, University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, Biosciences Partnership Building (BSPB), 5th floor, 475 N 5th Street, Phoenix, AZ, 85004, USA. ealeem@email.arizona.edu.', 'Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt. ealeem@email.arizona.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (PSMB5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'TR3MLJ1UAI (Disulfiram)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Bortezomib/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Disulfiram/*pharmacology', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC5286849,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALDH', '*Bortezomib', '*Chemoresistance', '*Cytarabine', '*Disulfiram', '*Down syndrome-associated AML', '*Relapsed acute myeloid leukemia']",,2017/02/02 06:00,2017/12/14 06:00,['2017/02/02 06:00'],"['2016/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-017-0493-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-017-0493-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2017 Feb 1;36(1):22. doi: 10.1186/s13046-017-0493-5.,20170201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aim to describe the clinical spectrum and the frequencies of paediatric rheumatic diseases (PRDs) in Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients with PRDs seen over a five year period (March 2010 to February 2016) at the rheumatology clinic and children ward of LASUTH. We reviewed the folders of 57 patients from our records. The demographics, baseline laboratory features, clinical diagnosis, treatment patterns and patient outcomes were extracted and analyzed. Clinical and laboratory characteristics between patients with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and patients with juvenile connective tissue diseases (JCTD) were compared using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Fifty seven patients were studied with a female to male ratio of 3 to 1 (Female: 43; M: 14). The mean age at presentation in years was 14 +/- 4.4 years (range: 1.5-22 years). The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 18.4 +/- .9 months (range: 2-60 months). The diagnostic types of PRDs included 28(49.1%) cases of JIA. These were made up of 14 cases of polyarticular JIA, nine cases of oligoarticular JIA and 5 cases of systemic onset JIA. Others were 18 (24.6%) cases of juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE), 3 (5.3%) cases of joint hypermobility syndrome, 2 (3.5%) cases of juvenile systemic sclerosis, 2 (3.5%) cases of fibromyalgia, 2 (3.5%) cases of plantar fasciitis, 1 (1.6%) case of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), 1 (1.6%) case of juvenile polymyositis-systemic lupus erythematosus (PM-SLE) overlap, 1 (1.6%) case of secondary bilateral knee osteoarthritis from Blount disease, 1 (1.6%) case of secondary osteoporosis from childhood leukemia and 1 (1.6%) case of Osgood-Schlatter's disease. Constitutional symptoms and extra-articular diseases were significantly more frequent among JCTD cases than among the JIA cases (Constitutional symptoms: 100% vs 83.3%, p = 0.003; extra-articular disease: 100% vs 10.7%, p = 0.001). The percentage mortality in this study was 10.5% while 20 (35.1%) of the patients were lost to clinic follow up. CONCLUSION: The pattern of PRDs observed in this study is similar to that described in South African and North American series but it differs from patterns reported in Asian series. Although hitherto largely unrecognized, PRDs may constitute a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in black Africans.",,"['Olaosebikan, Babatunde Hakeem', 'Adelowo, Olufemi Oladipo', 'Animashaun, Barakat Adeola', 'Akintayo, Richard Oluyinka']","['Olaosebikan BH', 'Adelowo OO', 'Animashaun BA', 'Akintayo RO']",,"['Department of Medicine, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Lagos State, Nigeria.', 'Department of Medicine, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Lagos State, Nigeria.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Lagos State, Nigeria.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria. richocounlimited@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,Pediatric rheumatology online journal,101248897,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Biological Factors/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Teaching/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rheumatic Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC5282742,['NOTNLM'],"['Juvenile idiopathic arthritis', 'Juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus', 'Nigeria', 'Paediatric rheumatic disease']",,2017/02/02 06:00,2017/06/27 06:00,['2017/02/02 06:00'],"['2016/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12969-017-0139-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12969-017-0139-3 [pii]']",epublish,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J. 2017 Jan 31;15(1):7. doi: 10.1186/s12969-017-0139-3.,20170131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcr-Abl is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that is responsible for the malignant transformation. Targeting the Bcr-Abl kinase is an attractive treatment strategy for CML. First and second generation Bcr-Abl inhibitors have focused on targeting the ATP-binding domain of the kinase. Mutations in that region are relatively resistant to drug manipulation. Therefore, non-ATP-competitive agents have been recently developed and tested. In the present study, in an attempt to aid the design of new chemotypes with enhanced cytotoxicity against K562 cells, 3D pharmacophore models were generated and 3D-QSAR CoMFA and CoMSIA studies were carried out on the 33 novel Abl kinase inhibitors (E)-&#945;-benzylthio chalcones synthesized by Reddy et al. A five-point pharmacophore with a hydrogen bond acceptor, two hydrophobic groups and two aromatic rings as pharmacophore features, and a statistically significant 3D-QSAR model with excellent predictive power were developed. The pharmacophore model was also used for alignment of the 33 compounds in a CoMFA/CoMSIA analysis. The contour maps of the fields of CoMFA and CoMSIA models were utilized to provide structural insight into how these molecules promote their toxicity.

However, it may not be appropriate for all patients, as failure of NIV and delayed endotracheal intubation (ETI) may increase mortality. We report our center's experience and outcomes for patients with active hematologic malignancy (HM) treated with NIV. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of consecutive patients with HM who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Mount Sinai Hospital for acute respiratory failure between January 1, 2010, and May 31, 2015, and were initially treated with NIV. We compared the characteristics of patients who were successfully treated with NIV and avoided intubation and those who failed NIV. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (mean age 56 +/- 14 years, mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 27 +/- 5) with HM were treated with NIV for acute respiratory failure. The etiology of respiratory failure was multifactorial in 31 (39%) patients, with features of pneumonia in 61 (77%) patients, severe sepsis or septic shock in 33 (42%) patients, and pulmonary edema in 24 (30%) patients. The majority of patients were admitted with acute leukemia (n = 60, 76%), 8 (10%) with lymphoma, and 11 (14%) with chronic leukemia, multiple myeloma, or myelodysplastic syndrome. Of the 79 patients treated with NIV, 44 (56%) failed NIV and required ETI, 7 (9%) had a do-not-intubate (DNI) order and died, and 28 (35%) avoided ETI. Compared with patients who avoided ETI, those who failed NIV or had a DNI order and died were more likely to have acute leukemia (84% vs 61%; P = .02) and at baseline had higher Paco2 (39 vs 30; P = .038), higher fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) requirements (0.6 vs 0.4; P = .002), and more vasopressor use (31% vs 11%; P = .059). The ICU mortality was 42%; 3-month mortality was 57% overall and was significantly lower in the NIV success patients compared with the NIV failure group (21% vs 74%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of patients with HM and respiratory failure failed NIV and required ETI, and had high subsequent mortality.

Quantitative expression analyses of FBXO11, FOXN2, and FOXN3 confirmed reduced transcript levels in the identified cell lines. Moreover, reduced expression of these genes was also observed in about 7% of T-ALL patients, showing their clinical relevance in this malignancy. Bioinformatic analyses revealed concurrent reduction of FOXN2 and/or FOXN3 together with homeobox gene ZHX1.

Here, we describe the development of a flexible thin-film sensor for label free gene expression analysis. A charge modulated ISFET based sensor was integrated with real-time DNA/RNA isothermal nucleic acid amplification: Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) techniques for c-MYC and BCR-ABL1 genes, allowing for the real-time quantification of template. Also, RCA allowed the direct quantification of RNA targets at room temperature, eliminating the requirement for external temperature controllers and overall complexity of the molecular diagnostic approach.

However, resistance to BCL-2 inhibitor monotherapy may rapidly ensue. Several studies have shown that the other two major anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, BCL-XL and MCL-1, are the main determinants of resistance to venetoclax. This opens up possibilities for rationally combining venetoclax with other targeted agents to circumvent resistance. Here, we summarize the most promising combinations, and highlight those already in clinical trials.

While prompt cytoreductive chemotherapy is essential, treatment with leukapheresis is controversial. This study investigated the outcomes of patients with hyperleukocytosis who received leukapheresis. From 5596 encounters of patients with leukemia seen at Houston Methodist Hospital, we identified 26 patients who had newly diagnosed AML, WBC >50,000/muL, and received leukapheresis. We matched 26 patients who had similar baseline characteristics but did not receive leukapheresis. The primary endpoint was to compare the 28-day mortality rates between the treatment and the control groups. Secondary endpoints were 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year mortality rates.

The findings showed that LLL-3, at doses of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mug/plate, did not induce mutagenic activity in the Salmonella strains used under the conditions tested, and nor did it present genotoxicity in RAW 264.7 cells, at 10.0, 100.0 and 1000.0 mug/mL doses. Moreover, it is important to point out that the mitotic index of the cells decreased after exposure to LLL-3 under the same conditions tested, which may suggest some cytostatic effect, since this compound acts by inhibiting STAT3. Since most drugs used in the treatment of cancer present mutagenic activity as an adverse effect, these results suggest that LLL-3 is a promising drug for cancer therapy.",,"['Ferraz, E R A', 'Fernandes, A S', 'Salviano, I', 'Felzenszwalb, I', 'Mencalha, A L']","['Ferraz ER', 'Fernandes AS', 'Salviano I', 'Felzenszwalb I', 'Mencalha AL']",,"['a Environmental Mutagenesis Laboratory, Department of Biophysics and Biometry, Roberto Alcantra Gomes Biology Institute, University of the State of Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , RJ , Brazil.', 'b School of Pharmacy, Fluminense Federal University , Niteroi , RJ , Brazil , and.', 'a Environmental Mutagenesis Laboratory, Department of Biophysics and Biometry, Roberto Alcantra Gomes Biology Institute, University of the State of Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , RJ , Brazil.', 'c Laboratory of Cancer Biology , Department of Biophysics and Biometry, Roberto Alcantra Gomes Biology Institute, University of the State of Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , RJ , Brazil.', 'a Environmental Mutagenesis Laboratory, Department of Biophysics and Biometry, Roberto Alcantra Gomes Biology Institute, University of the State of Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , RJ , Brazil.', 'c Laboratory of Cancer Biology , Department of Biophysics and Biometry, Roberto Alcantra Gomes Biology Institute, University of the State of Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , RJ , Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Drug Chem Toxicol,Drug and chemical toxicology,7801723,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (LLL-3 compound)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Macrophages/drug effects/pathology', 'Mice', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/*chemically induced', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Salmonella typhimurium/*drug effects/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['LLL-3', 'RAW 264.7', 'STAT3', 'cancer', 'mutagenic']",,2017/02/01 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2017/02/01 06:00'],"['2017/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01480545.2016.1167901 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Chem Toxicol. 2017 Jan;40(1):30-35. doi: 10.3109/01480545.2016.1167901.

The focus of this report is a phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of single-agent rituximab as first-line therapy in patients with indolent lymphoma and scheduled maintenance treatment in prolonging duration of remission. Patients received a 4-week course of standard rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly x 4). Those achieving objective response or stable disease then received maintenance courses of standard rituximab every 6 months, for a maximum of four rituximab courses. Of 62 patients entered in the trial, 61% had follicular lymphoma while 39% had small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). At 6 weeks, 28 of 60 evaluable patients (47%) had an objective response. The response rate improved to 73% (37% complete response) following maintenance rituximab therapy and was similar in patients with follicular lymphoma and SLL (76% v 70%, respectively). Median progression-free survival for the entire group was 34 months. Single-agent therapy was well tolerated and maintenance rituximab was administered without grade 3/4 toxicity. Because of the higher activity of rituximab in this study compared with previous results in patients with relapsed or refractory SLL, a second phase II trial of identical design but limited to patients with SLL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia was initiated. Forty-four patients entered this second trial and, at present, 27 continue to receive maintenance courses of rituximab. The current response rate is 56% (8% complete responses). In summary, rituximab appears highly active as first-line single-agent therapy for indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and responses may be improved with maintenance courses of rituximab. Results suggest a higher response rate to rituximab when used as first-line compared with second/third-line treatment, particularly in the subset of patients with SLL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Further follow-up will provide important information regarding the impact of first-line and maintenance rituximab on progression-free survival in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

However, the standard dose and schedule (375 mg/m(2) once-weekly for 4 weeks) may not be optimal for patients with previously treated small lymphocytic lymphoma, the lymphomatous equivalent of CLL. Nevertheless, good response rates have been achieved in untreated CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma using the standard dose and schedule and also using higher or more frequent dosing, indicating that rituximab is an active agent in this setting. More recently, the combination of rituximab and fludarabine or fludarabine-containing regimens has yielded overall response rates of 95%, with complete response rates up to 66% in previously untreated CLL. These response rates are among the highest achieved by any regimen in CLL. These studies indicate that immunochemotherapy with rituximab may offer improved outcomes for patients with CLL.

Some patients survive for long periods without requiring definitive therapy, while others die rapidly despite intensive treatment. Because most patients with CLL express CD20 on their malignant cells, the chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been incorporated into treatment regimens in efforts to improve outcome. Rituximab monotherapy has limited activity in previously untreated and refractory/relapsed CLL patients with response rates that are generally lower than those seen in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Although increased dosing intensity and frequency leads to higher response rates than seen in patients treated with standard dose rituximab, responses are almost always partial remissions and the doses used are not feasible in routine clinical practice. On the other hand, combining rituximab with chemotherapy has proved to be feasible and appears to be synergistic with fludarabine-based chemotherapy in the treatment of CLL on the basis of recent phase II trials. In these studies, response rates (including complete remissions) to rituximab in combination with fludarabine-containing regimens are higher than those reported in similar phase II studies with any other treatment regime. The highest response rates reported are for the combination of rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide. A randomized phase III trial has been initiated to evaluate the addition of rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed CLL.

The overall response rate improved from 47% (7% complete response) after initial treatment to 73% (37% complete response) after maintenance treatment; median progression-free survival was 37 months. A similar study in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) also showed some improvement in response rates after maintenance therapy and a median progression-free survival of 19 months.

Median event-free survival was longer in patients who received maintenance therapy (23 v 12 months; P = .02). The toxicity of maintenance rituximab has been minimal in all trials to date. Although prolongation of progression-free survival has been shown in all completed trials, multiple other questions regarding maintenance rituximab are being addressed in ongoing trials.

B-cell neoplastic diseases may be classified more accurately according to the differentiation stages of presumed normal B-cell counterparts. These advances have challenged the notion that chronic lymphocytic leukemia represents a malignancy of naive CD5 B cells. Analyses of immunoglobulin genes and gene expression patterns through microarray have defined at least two types of chronic lymphocytic leukemia that differ in their tendency toward disease progression. Nevertheless, these types still share more in common than they do with other lymphoid malignancies, and both may be derived from memory-type B cells. Advances in immune therapy are revolutionizing the approach to therapy. B-cell surface differentiation antigens constitute tissue-specific targets for passive immune therapy. Since the US Food and Drug Administration approval of rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, and IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA) for use in the treatment of follicular lymphoma, monoclonal antibody therapy is being considered for all types of B-cell malignancies. The ability to transform leukemia and lymphoma B cells into effective antigen-presenting cells through CD40 ligation allows for autologous immune recognition of neoplastic cells.

The safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibodies make these compounds attractive and easy to administer, even in elderly, heavily pretreated patients. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is an incurable disease with few therapeutic options once patients fail purine analogue-based therapy. Two monoclonal antibodies have shown activity in this disease. The first is rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, and IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA), a chimeric human-mouse anti-CD20 antibody. The second is Campath-1H, a humanized form of a rat antibody active against CD52. We hypothesize that combining both antibodies in patients who have failed conventional therapies and express both CD20 and CD52 might have enhanced efficacy and therapeutic benefit.

While rituximab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of recurrent B-cell lymphoma, initial studies suggested that it had less activity in small lymphocytic lymphoma, the nodal counterpart of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Two studies have now investigated the activity of higher-dose and more intensive therapy with rituximab in CLL. They have shown a dose-response relationship and a higher response rate than previously seen in the lower-dose studies. This is presumably caused by the overcoming of lower antigen density on CLL cells compared with lymphoma cells, and the shorter half-life of rituximab in small lymphocytic lymphoma. There is now evidence that CD20 is shed into the plasma in patients with CLL, which may explain the shorter half-life of the antibody in small lymphocytic lymphoma/CLL. The higher dose may then be effective in overcoming this so-called ""antigen sink."" Toxicity was uncommon except in previously untreated patients and those with atypical forms of CLL such as mantle cell lymphoma and prolymphocytic leukemia. There is now evidence in vitro of additive or synergistic activity of rituximab with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents including fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Combinations of fludarabine with rituximab or these two drugs combined with cyclophosphamide have given very high complete response rates in series of patients with both previously untreated and treated CLL. It is apparent that rituximab is playing a significant role in the management of patients with CLL as salvage therapy and is a potential potentiating agent for combined chemoimmunotherapy strategies for front-line or relapsed patients with CLL.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and FL represent quintessential examples of human malignancies that are caused primarily by defects in programmed cell death (apoptosis). During the early stages of disease, the mature B lymphocytes that comprise most CLLs and FLs are largely quiescent G0 phase cells, which accumulate not because they are dividing more rapidly than normal but because they survive longer than their normal counterparts because of defects in the normal pathways for apoptosis. Defects in apoptosis pathways contribute to chemoresistance, rendering tumor cells less sensitive to the cytotoxic actions of currently available anticancer drugs, and can also promote resistance to cellular immune responses. Several biological agents or their synthetic derivatives show promise as apoptosis modulators, having the potential to place neoplastic cells into a more susceptible state or activating latent programs for cell suicide. These biological response modifiers include monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, and IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA) that alter signal transduction pathways, cytokines such as TRAIL (Apo2 ligand), ligands for retinoid/steroid family nuclear receptors, and small-molecule compounds that bind and inhibit protein kinases. Knowledge about the mechanisms by which these agents influence apoptosis pathways in neoplastic diseases may suggest strategies for more effective and less toxic therapies for patients suffering from CLL, FL, and other malignancies.

However, clinical trial evidence of benefit is still awaited. The position is clearer in the case of neoadjuvant therapy because long-term follow up of two trials now shows that patients randomized to chemotherapy before surgery were significantly more likely to survive to 5 years than patients treated with surgery alone. Early data suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on docetaxel (Taxotere; Aventis, Antony, France) (possibly used sequentially with other agents) may be as effective as older regimens and better tolerated. Because p53 status influences the expression of microtubule-associated proteins and hence the sensitivity of a tumor to taxanes, it is possible that molecular markers could be used to customize chemotherapy to individual patients. Generally, it is becoming clearer that molecular staging is a more sensitive means of demonstrating tumor dissemination than light microscopy. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B is undertaking a prospective study using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to detect MUC-I RNA in bone marrow and hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes removed at resection with the aim of distinguishing between stage I patients likely to remain disease-free for long periods and those at high risk of relapse. A study of small cell lung cancer is using automated fluorescence microscopy to detect keratin-positive cells in the marrow and blood of patients who have a complete response to initial therapy but are nevertheless at high overall risk of relapse.

The dominant toxicity was esophagitis. Preliminary survival data are encouraging. Other trials in progress or planned will elucidate the relative contributions of induction and concurrent therapy to outcome. A phase I study has shown that it is feasible to combine docetaxel (Taxotere: Aventis, Antony, France) with concomitant radiotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung or esophageal cancer. Giving the drug once every 3 weeks during standard radiotherapy, the maximum tolerated dose is 40 mg/m(2) per cycle. The dose-limiting toxicities are neutropenia and esophagitis. However, it is possible to escalate the total docetaxel dose to 60 mg/m(2) per cycle by weekly administration of 20 mg/m(2). Beyond this point, esophagitis is dose limiting. In the palliative-intent treatment setting, the weekly administration of docetaxel is also likely to be a helpful new approach to administering the drug in subgroups of patients such as the elderly and those with concomitant disease. Weekly docetaxel (36 mg/m(2)/wk) was administered to patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who were elderly (median age, 71 years) or had poor performance status. In this unfavorable group, weekly docetaxel produced a 19% objective response rate and with further follow-up, 1-year survival is 28%.

The aim of this study is to investigate the etiologies of pericardial effusions and to establish the relationship between cytopathologic interpretations and outcome patterns among patients with pericardial effusions. METHODS: We identified 116 patients with pericardial effusions at a single institution over a 4-year period and carefully analyzed all available clinical documents, including clinical diagnoses, cytopathologic findings, and outcome patterns. RESULTS: The cohort was made up of 74 patients with malignancies, 39 with non-malignancy diseases, and 3 without available clinical diagnosis. Lung cancer was the most common malignancy (58 cases), followed by breast cancer (4 cases) and lymphoma/leukemia (4 cases). Among the 116 fluid samples, 43 cases were diagnosed as malignant, 66 were diagnosed as benign, and seven were diagnosed as ambiguous. The nature of the hemorrhage was an important feature of cytopathology-positive effusions. Patients with detectable malignant cells in pericardial effusions have a significantly poorer prognosis than those without malignant cells. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer is the most common cause of large quantities of pericardial effusions. The present findings suggest that cytopathologic evaluation is valuable to predict the prognosis of cancer patients with pericardial effusions. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2017;45:287-293.

We studied the activity and subcellular distribution of ABO gene-encoded A glycosyltransferases with N-terminal truncation. We hypothesized that truncated enzymes starting at internal methionines drove the synthesis of oligosaccharide A antigen in those already described alleles that lack a proper translation initiation codon. Not only we tested the functionality of the mutant transferases by expressing them and assessing their capacity to drive the appearance of A antigen on the cell surface, but we also analyzed their subcellullar localization, which has not been described before. The results highlight the importance of the transmembrane domain because proteins deprived of it are not able to localize properly and deliver substantial amounts of antigen on the cell surface. Truncated proteins with their first amino acid well within the luminal domain are not properly localized and lose their enzymatic activity. Most importantly, we demonstrated that other codons than AUG might be used to start the protein synthesis rather than internal methionines in translation-initiation mutants, explaining the molecular mechanism by which transferases lacking a classical start codon are able to synthesize A/B antigens.",,"['Cid, Emili', 'Yamamoto, Miyako', 'Yamamoto, Fumiichiro']","['Cid E', 'Yamamoto M', 'Yamamoto F']",,"['Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (PMPPC), Institut d'Investigacio Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Campus Can Ruti, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Codon, Initiator)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.69 (galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', '*Alleles', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/metabolism', '*Codon, Initiator', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fucosyltransferases/genetics/immunology', 'Genetic Background', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Transport', 'Sequence Deletion']",PMC5282485,,,['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],2017/02/01 06:00,2018/10/26 06:00,['2017/02/01 06:00'],"['2016/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['srep41720 [pii]', '10.1038/srep41720 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Jan 31;7:41720. doi: 10.1038/srep41720.,20170131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: to investigate endometrial morphological and immunophenotypic features in patients with primary infertility in the presence of uCTD and HT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The pipelle endometrial biopsy specimens taken in the implantation window were examined in 81 patients, including 13 women with a clinical diagnosis of uCTD, 40 with HT, 19 with uCTD concurrent with HT, and in a control group of 9 heathy surrogate mothers. Morphological, immunohistochemical, and morphometric examinations were done to study the paraffin-embedded endometrial biopsy sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, pikrofuksin by van Gieson, and with toluidine blue. Immunohistochemical tests were carried out using primary antibodies against ER, PgR, LIF, PAI-1, VEGF, Collagen I, Collagen III, fibronectin, laminin, MMP-2, and MMP-9. RESULTS: The uCTD, HT, and uCTD + HT groups were found to have signs of decreased endometrial receptivity as dramatically lower counts of mature pinopodes, slower endometrial maturation, reduced expression of the receptivity marker LIF, and deviations of the stromal progesterone-estrogen index from the normal value. Sclerotic foci with type III collagen accumulation were detected in the endometrial stroma. CONCLUSION: uCTD and HT and especially their concurrence are commonly a concomitant disease and risk factors for infertility in women due to impaired endometrial receptivity. In uCTD, connective tissue remodeling processes are substantially retarded, which ultimately leads to increased processes of endometrial stromal sclerosis, reduced endometrial receptivity, and infertility. The most pronounced morphological and immunophenotypical changes have been ascertained to develop in the uCTD + NT group.

However, the mechanisms underlying SP are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that the Pim-1 kinase played a key role in SP-induced cardioprotection by regulating dynamics-related protein 1 (Drp1). METHODS: A Langendorff model was used in this study. Seventy-two rats were randomly assigned into six groups as follows: CON group, ischemia reperfusion (I/R) group, SP group , SP+proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (Pim-1) inhibitor II group, SP+dimethylsufoxide group, and Pim-1 inhibitor II group (n = 12, each). Hemodynamic parameters and infarct size were measured to reflect the extent of myocardial I/R injury. The expressions of Pim-1, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and cytochrome C (Cyt C) in cytoplasm and mitochondria, the Drp1 in mitochondria, and the total Drp1 and p-Drp1ser637 were measured by Western blotting. In addition, transmission electron microscope was used to observe mitochondrial morphology. The experiment began in October 2014 and continued until July 2016. RESULTS: SP improved myocardial I/R injury-induced hemodynamic parametric changes, cardiac function, and preserved mitochondrial phenotype and decreased myocardial infarct size (24.49 +/- 1.72% in Sev group compared with 41.98 +/- 4.37% in I/R group; P< 0.05). However, Pim-1 inhibitor II significantly (P < 0.05) abolished the protective effect of SP. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that, compared with I/R group, the expression of Pim-1 and Bcl-2 in cytoplasm and mitochondria as well as the total p-Drp1ser637 in Sev group (P < 0.05) were upregulated. Meanwhile, SP inhibited Drp1 compartmentalization to the mitochondria followed by a reduction in the release of Cyt C. Pretreatment with Pim-1 inhibitor II significantly (P < 0.05) abolished SP-induced Pim-1/p-Drp1ser637 signaling activation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that SP could attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing the expression of the Pim-1 kinase.

New therapies are needed to improve clinically relevant outcomes in these patients. We assessed the efficacy and safety of adding idelalisib, a first-in-class targeted phosphoinositide-3-kinase delta inhibitor, to bendamustine plus rituximab in this population. METHODS: For this international, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients (>/=18 years) with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia requiring treatment who had measurable lymphadenopathy by CT or MRI and disease progression within 36 months since their last previous therapy were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a central interactive web response system to receive bendamustine plus rituximab for a maximum of six cycles (bendamustine: 70 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 2 for six 28-day cycles; rituximab: 375 mg/m(2) on day 1 of cycle 1, and 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of cycles 2-6) in addition to either twice-daily oral idelalisib (150 mg) or placebo until disease progression or intolerable study drug-related toxicity. Randomisation was stratified by high-risk features (IGHV, del[17p], or TP53 mutation) and refractory versus relapsed disease. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by an independent review committee in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01569295. FINDINGS: Between June 26, 2012, and Aug 21, 2014, 416 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the idelalisib (n=207) and placebo (n=209) groups. At a median follow-up of 14 months (IQR 7-18), median progression-free survival was 20.8 months (95% CI 16.6-26.4) in the idelalisib group and 11.1 months (8.9-11.1) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.33, 95% CI 0.25-0.44; p<0.0001). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events in the idelalisib group were neutropenia (124 [60%] of 207 patients) and febrile neutropenia (48 [23%]), whereas in the placebo group they were neutropenia (99 [47%] of 209) and thrombocytopenia (27 [13%]). An increased risk of infection was reported in the idelalisib group compared with the placebo group (grade >/=3 infections and infestations: 80 [39%] of 207 vs 52 [25%] of 209). Serious adverse events, including febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and pyrexia, were more common in the idelalisib group (140 [68%] of 207 patients) than in the placebo group (92 [44%] of 209). Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to death occurred in 23 (11%) patients in the idelalisib group and 15 (7%) in the placebo group, including six deaths from infections in the idelalisib group and three from infections in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: Idelalisib in combination with bendamustine plus rituximab improved progression-free survival compared with bendamustine plus rituximab alone in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Despite the high response rate and relatively long period of remission, most patients relapse again. The immunologic mechanism of the response and limited efficacy remain unknown. CASE REPORT: Aza + DLI therapy was performed for a patient with therapy-related MDS (t-MDS), who had relapsed after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. We observed a powerful graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect accompanied by an evident Wilms tumor antigen 1 (WT1)-specific CD8 T-cell response. Remission continued for 15 months, but finally the patient relapsed. The kinetics of the WT1-specific CD8 T cells were inversely associated with WT1 messenger RNA (mRNA), suggesting a WT1-driven GVL effect. DISCUSSION: A difference of T-cell phenotype between the whole T cells and the WT1-specific CD8 T cells was observed. It is of note that the memory phenotype of the WT1-specific T cell was limited and decreased early. The immunoescape mechanism was partly supported by loss of the memory phenotype due to failure of expansion and differentiation. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that a WT1-specific T-cell response at least partly contributes to the GVL effect induced by Aza + DLI. A strategy for maximizing and maintaining the memory phenotype of the CTL may be required for durable remission.","['Copyright (c) 2017 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) among Malaysian childhood ALL survivors and its impact on motor function and quality of life. PROCEDURE: Survivors of childhood ALL aged 4-18 years who had completed chemotherapy for 2 years or more were evaluated for VIPN using both the clinical Total Neuropathy Score (cTNS) and nerve conduction studies. Motor function and quality of life of the survivors were assessed via the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency Brief Form, Second Edition (BOT-2 Brief Form) and the Paediatric Quality of Life version 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL4.0) questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: One hundred and one survivors with a duration of follow-up ranging from 2.0 to 10.3 years were recruited. Twenty-seven (26.7%) had abnormal cTNS scores and 69 (68.3%) had electrophysiological evidence of neuropathy. Of these, 16 (15.8%) had combined clinical and electrophysiological neuropathy (VIPN). Those previously treated on the intermediate- or high-risk treatment stratification arms had a higher risk of developing VIPN (67.3 vs. 32.7%; odds ratio [OR]: 9.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-71.86; P = 0.014). Survivors with VIPN had significantly lower quality of life scores in the physical (P = 0.024) and social domains (P = 0.039) compared with peers without VIPN, but no association with poorer motor function was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Sixteen percent of ALL survivors had VIPN. VIPN should be increasingly recognised as a late effect of chemotherapy, as it significantly affects physical and social function quality of life.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Tay, Chee Geap', 'Lee, Vanessa Wan Mun', 'Ong, Lai Choo', 'Goh, Khean Jin', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Fong, Choong Yi']","['Tay CG', 'Lee VWM', 'Ong LC', 'Goh KJ', 'Ariffin H', 'Fong CY']",,"['Division of Paediatric Neurology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Malaya, Kuala Lampur, Malaysia.', 'Division of Paediatric Neurology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Malaya, Kuala Lampur, Malaysia.', 'Division of Paediatric Neurology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Malaya, Kuala Lampur, Malaysia.', 'Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lampur, Malaysia.', 'Division of Paediatric Haematology Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Malaya, Kuala Lampur, Malaysia.', 'Division of Paediatric Neurology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Malaya, Kuala Lampur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Malaysia', 'Male', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Survivors', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'nerve conduction study', 'quality of life', 'vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy']",,2017/02/01 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2017/02/01 06:00'],"['2016/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26471 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Aug;64(8). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26471.

A retrospective analysis of 132 patients treated according the BFM - ALLIC 2002 protocol was performed in a single institution. A possible association between ALC values and Overall Survival (OS) or Event-Free Survival (EFS) was evaluated at multiple time points during induction chemotherapy. ALC higher than 350 cells/muL measured on the 33th day of induction was associated with better Overall- and Event-Free Survival in both Kaplan-Meier (OS 88.6% vs. 40%; p < 0.001 / EFS 81.6% vs. 30%; p < 0.001) and Cox regression (OS HR 8.77 (3.31-23.28); p < 0.001) and EFS HR 6.61 (2.79-15.63); p < 0.001) analyses. There was no association between survival and measured ALC values from earlier time points (day of diagnosis, days 8 and 15) of induction therapy. Patients with low ALC values tend to have higher risk (MR or HR groups) and a higher age at diagnosis (>10 years). With help of day 33 ALC values of 350 cells/muL cutoff it was possible to refine day 33 flow cytometry (FC) Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) results within the negative cohort: higher ALC values were significantly associated with better survival. ALC on day 33 (350 cells/muL) remained prognostic for OS and EFS in multivariate analysis after adjusting it for age, cytogenetics, immunophenotype and FC MRD of induction day 33.

The primary objective of this study was to quantitatively determine the pharmacokinetics of vosaroxin and its metabolites in patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods This mass balance study investigated the pharmacokinetics (distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of vosaroxin in cancer patients after a single dose of 60 mg/m(2 14)C-vosaroxin, administered as short intravenous injection. Blood, urine and feces were collected over 168 h after injection or until recovered radioactivity over 24 h was less than 1% of the administered dose (whichever was earlier). Total radioactivity (TRA), vosaroxin and metabolites were studied in all matrices. Results Unchanged vosaroxin was the major species identified in plasma, urine, and feces. N-desmethylvosaroxin was the only circulating metabolite detected in plasma, accounting for <3% of the administered dose. However, in plasma, the combined vosaroxin + N-desmethylvosaroxin AUC0-infinity was 21% lower than the TRA AUC0-infinity , suggesting the possible formation of protein bound metabolites after 48 h when the concentration-time profiles diverged.

Ibrutinib is an effective targeted therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that inhibits Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a kinase involved in B cell receptor signaling. METHODS. We used stable isotopic labeling with deuterated water ((2)H2O) to measure directly the effects of ibrutinib on leukemia cell proliferation and death in 30 patients with CLL. RESULTS. The measured average CLL cell proliferation (""birth"") rate before ibrutinib therapy was 0.39% of the clone per day (range 0.17%-1.04%); this decreased to 0.05% per day (range 0%-0.36%) with treatment. Death rates of blood CLL cells increased from 0.18% per day (average, range 0%-0.7%) prior to treatment to 1.5% per day (range 0%-3.0%) during ibrutinib therapy, and they were even higher in tissue compartments. CONCLUSIONS. This study provides the first direct in vivo measurements to our knowledge of ibrutinib's antileukemia actions, demonstrating profound and immediate inhibition of CLL cell proliferation and promotion of high rates of CLL cell death.

These features support the hypothesis that this new member of the innate T cell family in humans, hereafter referred to as innate CD8(+) T cells, has a role in cancer immune surveillance analogous to invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells. Here, we report the first quantitative and functional analysis of innate CD8(+) T cells in a physiopathological context in humans, namely chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a well-characterized myeloproliferative disorder. We have chosen CML based on our previous report that IL-4 production by iNKT cells was deficient in CML patients at diagnosis and considering the recent evidence in mice that IL-4 promotes the generation/differentiation of innate CD8(+) T cells. We found that the pool of innate CD8(+) T cells was severely reduced in the blood of CML patients at diagnosis. Moreover, like iNKT and NK cells, innate CD8(+) T cells were functionally impaired, as attested by their loss of antigen-independent cytotoxic activity and IFN-gamma production in response to innate-like stimulation with IL-12 + IL-18. Remarkably, as previously reported for IL-4 production by iNKT cells, both quantitative and functional deficiencies of innate CD8(+) T cells were at least partially corrected in patients having achieved complete cytogenetic remission following tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Finally, direct correlation between the functional potential of innate CD8(+) T and iNKT cells was found when considering all healthy donors and CML patients in diagnosis and remission, in accordance with the iNKT cell-dependent generation of innate CD8(+) T cells reported in mice. All in all, our data demonstrate that CML is associated with deficiencies of innate CD8(+) T cells that are restored upon remission, thereby suggesting their possible contribution to disease control. More generally, our study strongly supports the existence of an innate iNKT/innate CD8(+) T-cell axis in humans and reveals its potential contribution to the restoration of tumor immune surveillance.",,"['Jacomet, Florence', 'Cayssials, Emilie', 'Barbarin, Alice', 'Desmier, Deborah', 'Basbous, Sara', 'Lefevre, Lucie', 'Levescot, Anais', 'Robin, Aurelie', 'Piccirilli, Nathalie', 'Giraud, Christine', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Roy, Lydia', 'Herbelin, Andre', 'Gombert, Jean-Marc']","['Jacomet F', 'Cayssials E', 'Barbarin A', 'Desmier D', 'Basbous S', 'Lefevre L', 'Levescot A', 'Robin A', 'Piccirilli N', 'Giraud C', 'Guilhot F', 'Roy L', 'Herbelin A', 'Gombert JM']",,"[""INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; Service d'Immunologie et Inflammation, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", ""INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Service d'Hematologie et d'Oncologie Biologique, Poitiers, France."", 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Service d'Hematologie et d'Oncologie Biologique, Poitiers, France."", 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM 1082 , Poitiers , France.', 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Etablissement Francais du Sang Centre-Atlantique, Site de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; INSERM CIC-1402, Poitiers, France.', ""INSERM CIC-1402, Poitiers, France; Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France; Universite Paris-Est, Creteil, France."", 'INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""INSERM 1082, Poitiers, France; Service d'Immunologie et Inflammation, Poitiers, France; CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC5237805,['NOTNLM'],"['NK-like CD8(+) T cells', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'iNKT cells', 'innate CD8(+) T cells', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,2017/02/01 06:00,2017/02/01 06:01,['2017/02/01 06:00'],"['2016/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2016.00688 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Jan 16;7:688. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2016.00688. eCollection 2016.,20170116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 1993 and 2009, 3324 patients with newly diagnosed AML were enrolled in 5 prospective treatment trials of the German-Austrian AML Study Group. After first induction therapy with idarubicin, cytarabine and etoposide (ICE), 845 patients had refractory disease. In addition, 180 patients, although responding to first induction, relapsed after second induction therapy. Of the 1025 patients with induction failure, 875 (median age 55 years) received intensive salvage therapy: 7+3-based (n=59), high-dose cytarabine combined with mitoxantrone (HAM; n=150), with all-trans retinoic acid (A; A-HAM) (n=247), with gemtuzumab ozogamicin and A (GO; GO-A-HAM) (n=140), other intensive regimens (n=165), experimental treatment (n=27) and direct allo-HCT (n=87).

Hypoxia is associated with insufficient response to standard therapy, resulting in disease progression and curtailed patients' survival through maintenance of noncycling cancer stem-like cells. A better understanding of the mechanisms and signaling pathways induced by hypoxia is essential to overcoming these effects. Recent findings demonstrate that bone marrow in the setting of hematologic malignancies is highly hypoxic, and that progression of the disease is associated with expansion of hypoxic niches and stabilization of the oncogenic hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha). Solid tumors have also been shown to harbor hypoxic areas, maintaining survival of cancer cells via the HIF1alpha pathway. Developing new strategies for targeting hypoxia has become a crucial approach in modern cancer therapy.

Recently, both proteins were found to promote tumor progression through the establishment of premetastatic niches and inhibit antitumor immune responses. Although S100A8 and S100A9 have been studied in solid cancers, their functions in hematological malignancies remain poorly understood. However, S100A8 and S100A9 are highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and S100A8 expression has been linked to poor prognosis in AML. We identified a small subpopulation of cells expressing S100A8 and S100A9 in AML mouse models and primary human AML samples. In vitro and in vivo analyses revealed that S100A9 induces AML cell differentiation, whereas S100A8 prevents differentiation induced by S100A9 activity and maintains AML immature phenotype. Treatment with recombinant S100A9 proteins increased AML cell maturation, induced growth arrest, and prolonged survival in an AML mouse model. Interestingly, anti-S100A8 antibody treatment had effects similar to those of S100A9 therapy in vivo, suggesting that high ratios of S100A9 over S100A8 are required to induce differentiation. Our in vitro studies on the mechanisms/pathways involved in leukemic cell differentiation revealed that binding of S100A9 to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) promotes activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, and Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways, leading to myelomonocytic and monocytic AML cell differentiation. These findings indicate that S100A8 and S100A9 are regulators of myeloid differentiation in leukemia and have therapeutic potential in myelomonocytic and monocytic AMLs.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Laouedj, Malika', 'Tardif, Melanie R', 'Gil, Laurine', 'Raquil, Marie-Astrid', 'Lachhab, Asmaa', 'Pelletier, Martin', 'Tessier, Philippe A', 'Barabe, Frederic']","['Laouedj M', 'Tardif MR', 'Gil L', 'Raquil MA', 'Lachhab A', 'Pelletier M', 'Tessier PA', 'Barabe F']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5033-4947', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7177-7763', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0024-3611']","['Infectious and Immune Diseases Research Axis, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Medecine, and.', 'Infectious and Immune Diseases Research Axis, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie-Infectiologie et Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada; and.', 'Infectious and Immune Diseases Research Axis, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Medecine, and.', 'Infectious and Immune Diseases Research Axis, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie-Infectiologie et Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada; and.', 'Infectious and Immune Diseases Research Axis, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie-Infectiologie et Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada; and.', 'Infectious and Immune Diseases Research Axis, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie-Infectiologie et Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada; and.', 'Infectious and Immune Diseases Research Axis, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie-Infectiologie et Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada; and.', 'Infectious and Immune Diseases Research Axis, Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Medecine, and.', 'CHU de Quebec Hopital Enfant-Jesus, Quebec City, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Calgranulin B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (S100A9 protein, mouse)', '0 (S100a8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tlr4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calgranulin A/genetics/metabolism', 'Calgranulin B/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,2017/02/01 06:00,2017/08/11 06:00,['2017/02/01 06:00'],"['2016/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33520-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-09-738005 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Apr 6;129(14):1980-1990. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-09-738005.

Here we report the negative regulation of the HOP complex by human leukemia-associated myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1). We demonstrate that MLF1 physically and functionally associates with HAX1 and HtrA2. Increased interaction of MLF1 with HAX1 and HtrA2 displaces HtrA2 from the HOP complex and inhibits HtrA2 cleavage and activation, resulting in the apoptotic cell death. Conversely, over-expressed HAX1 neutralizes MLF1's effect and inhibits MLF1-induced apoptosis. Importantly, Mlf1 deletion reverses B- and T-cell lymphopenia and significantly ameliorates the progressive striatal and cerebellar neurodegeneration observed in Hax1(-/-) mice, with a doubling of the lifespan of Mlf1(-/-)/Hax1(-/-) animals compared to Hax1(-/-) animals.

It is a genetically heterogeneous aggressive disease characterized by the accumulation of somatically acquired genetic changes, altering self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, resulting in uncontrolled clonal proliferation of malignant progenitor myeloid cells in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and occasionally in other body tissues. Treatment with modern chemotherapy regimen (cytarabine and daunorubicin) usually achieves high remission rates, still majority of patients are found to relapse, resulting in only 40-45% overall 5 year survival in young patients and less than 10% in the elderly AML patients. The leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are characterized by their unlimited self-renewal, repopulating potential and long residence in a quiescent state of G0/G1 phase. LSCs are considered to have a pivotal role in the relapse and refractory of AML. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies to target LSCs with limited toxicity towards the normal hematopoietic population is critical for the ultimate curing of AML. Ongoing research works with natural products like parthenolide (a natural plant extract derived compound) and its derivatives, that have the ability to target multiple pathways that regulate the self-renewal, growth and survival of LSCs point to ways for a possible complete remission in AML.

Infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is the direct cause of ATL onset, and integration of HTLV-1 into the human genome is essential for clonal expansion of leukemic cells. Therefore, monitoring clonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells via isolation of integration sites assists in analyzing infected individuals from early infection to the final stage of ATL development. However, because of the complex nature of clonal expansion, the underlying mechanisms have yet to be clarified. Combining computational/mathematical modeling with experimental and clinical data of integration site-based clonality analysis derived from next generation sequencing technologies provides an appropriate strategy to achieve a better understanding of ATL development. METHODS: As a comprehensively interdisciplinary project, this study combined three main aspects: wet laboratory experiments, in silico analysis and empirical modeling. RESULTS: We analyzed clinical samples from HTLV-1-infected individuals with a broad range of proviral loads using a high-throughput methodology that enables isolation of HTLV-1 integration sites and accurate measurement of the size of infected clones. We categorized clones into four size groups, ""very small"", ""small"", ""big"", and ""very big"", based on the patterns of clonal growth and observed clone sizes. We propose an empirical formal model based on deterministic finite state automata (DFA) analysis of real clinical samples to illustrate patterns of clonal expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Through the developed model, we have translated biological data of clonal expansion into the formal language of mathematics and represented the observed clonality data with DFA. Our data suggest that combining experimental data (absolute size of clones) with DFA can describe the clonality status of patients. This kind of modeling provides a basic understanding as well as a unique perspective for clarifying the mechanisms of clonal expansion in ATL.",,"['Farmanbar, Amir', 'Firouzi, Sanaz', 'Park, Sung-Joon', 'Nakai, Kenta', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Watanabe, Toshiki']","['Farmanbar A', 'Firouzi S', 'Park SJ', 'Nakai K', 'Uchimaru K', 'Watanabe T']",,"['Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Functional Analysis in silico, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. firouzisanaz1@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Functional Analysis in silico, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Functional Analysis in silico, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, Institute of Medical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. tnabe@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Innovation, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan. tnabe@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Proliferation', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*pathology/*virology', '*Models, Biological']",PMC5282739,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult T-cell leukemia', '*Clonal expansion', '*Deterministic finite state automata (DFA)', '*Human T-cell leukemia virus ype-1', '*Integration site', '*Mathematical computational modeling', '*Next-generation sequencing', '*State-transition diagram']",,2017/02/01 06:00,2017/10/28 06:00,['2017/02/01 06:00'],"['2016/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-016-0241-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-016-0241-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2017 Jan 31;10(1):4. doi: 10.1186/s12920-016-0241-2.,20170131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have sequenced the exomes of 4,293 families containing individuals with developmental disorders, and meta-analysed these data with data from another 3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the most important factors influencing the diagnostic yield of DNMs are the sex of the affected individual, the relatedness of their parents, whether close relatives are affected and the parental ages. We identified 94 genes enriched in damaging DNMs, including 14 that previously lacked compelling evidence of involvement in developmental disorders. We have also characterized the phenotypic diversity among these disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs in coding sequences; approximately half of these DNMs disrupt gene function and the remainder result in altered protein function. We estimate that developmental disorders caused by DNMs have an average prevalence of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448 births, depending on parental age. Given current global demographics, this equates to almost 400,000 children born per year.",,,,,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (ADNP protein, human)', '0 (ANKRD11 protein, human)', '0 (ARID1B protein, human)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CHD4 protein, human)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MSL3 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SYNGAP1 protein, human)', '0 (TCF20 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB18 protein, human)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CSNK2A1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK13 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPM1D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2C)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX3X protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Autoantigens/genetics', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/genetics', 'Casein Kinase II/genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Cohort Studies', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Developmental Disabilities/*genetics', 'Exome/genetics', 'Female', 'Heredity/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Phosphatase 2C/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Young Adult', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics']",PMC6016744,,,,2017/01/31 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2017/01/31 06:00'],"['2016/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['nature21062 [pii]', '10.1038/nature21062 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2017 Feb 23;542(7642):433-438. doi: 10.1038/nature21062.

The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as a therapeutic option has profoundly changed patient experience and outcome. The availability of multiple new highly effective therapies has increasingly underscored the importance of a good understanding of the underlying pathophysiological basis in CML, as well as patient-specific factors in choosing the right treatment for every individual. The treatment of CML has migrated in many jurisdictions from the office of a highly specialized malignant hematologist to the general hematologist or even a general practitioner. The goal of this review is to offer an overview of the modern approach to the treatment of CML, with an emphasis on chronic phase (CP) CML, including both TKI-based therapies such as imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and ponatinib, and non-TKI medications, such as omacetaxine. We discuss evidence behind each drug, most common and material adverse reactions and outline how this information can be used in selecting the right drug for the right patient. We also discuss evidence as it relates to other therapies, including stem cell transplant (SCT), and patients in accelerated (AP) and blastic phase (BP).",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the feasibility of using reductions in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels after 1 month of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment to predict therapy response. Fifty-two first-line TKI-treated CML patients were included (imatinib n = 26, dasatinib n = 21, nilotinib n = 5), and BCR-ABL1 transcript levels were measured at diagnosis (dg) and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. The fold change of the BCR-ABL1 transcripts at 1 month compared to initial BCR-ABL1 transcript levels was used to indicate early therapy response. In our cohort, 21% of patients had no decrease in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels after 1 month and were classified as poor responders. Surprisingly, these patients had lower BCR-ABL1 transcript levels at dg compared to responders (31% vs. 48%, p = 0.0083). Poor responders also significantly more often had enlarged spleen (55% vs. 15%; p<0.01) and a higher percentage of Ph+ CD34+CD38- cells in the bone marrow (91% vs. 75%, p<0.05). The major molecular response rates were inferior in the poor responders (at 12m 18% vs. 64%, p<0.01; 18m 27% vs. 75%, p<0.01; 24m 55% vs. 87%, p<0.01).

Previously, we reported that T cell leukemia homeobox 1 (Tlx1)+ stem cells in the spleen effectively regenerated into insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of non-obese diabetic mice with end-stage disease. Thus, we investigated the spleen as a potential alternative islet transplantation site. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice received syngeneic islets into the portal vein (PV), beneath the kidney capsule (KC), or into the spleen (SP). The marginal number of islets by PV, KC, or SP was 200, 100, and 50, respectively. Some plasma inflammatory cytokine levels in the SP group were significantly lower than those of the PV group after receiving a marginal number of islets, indicating reduced inflammation in the SP group.

In this study, we isolated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from mice transplanted with wild-type thrombopoietin receptor (MPLWT) and MPLW515L retroviral-transduced bone marrow. Using MSCs derived from MPLW515-transplant recipients, excessive collagen deposition was maintained in the absence of the virus and neoplastic hematopoietic cells suggested that the MSCs were reprogrammed in vivo. TGFbeta production by malignant megakaryocytes plays a definitive role promoting myelofibrosis in MPNs. However, TGFbeta was equally expressed by MSCs derived from MPLWT and MPLW515L expressing mice and the addition of neutralizing anti-TGFbeta antibody only partially reduced collagen secretion in vitro. Interestingly, profibrotic MSCs displayed increased levels of pSmad3 and pSTAT3 suggesting that inflammatory mediators cooperating with the TGFbeta-receptor signaling may maintain the aberrant phenotype ex vivo. FGFb is a known suppressor of TGFbeta signaling. Reduced collagen deposition by FGFb-treated MSCs derived from MPLW515L mice suggests that the activating pathway is vulnerable to this suppressive mediator.

The methods used to calculate these doses and corresponding uncertainty have been reported in detail by Till et al. in an earlier publication. In this current article we report the final results of those calculations. These doses are being used in a case-cohort design epidemiological investigation of leukemia and male breast cancer. This cohort of atomic veterans is one component in a broader-scope study of approximately one million U.S. persons designed to investigate risk from chronic low-dose radiation exposure. Doses to the atomic veterans in this sub-cohort were relatively low, with approximately two-thirds receiving red bone marrow doses <5 mGy and only four individuals receiving a red bone marrow dose >50 mGy. The average red bone marrow dose for members of the sub-cohort was 5.9 mGy. Doses to male breast were approximately 20% higher than red bone marrow doses. The uncertainty in the estimated doses was relatively low, considering relevant personnel dosimetry was available for only about 25% of the subjects, and most of the doses were reconstructed from film badges worn by co-workers or from the individual's military record and military unit activities. The average coefficient of variation for the individual dose estimates was approximately 0.5, comparable to the uncertainty in doses estimated for the Japanese A-bomb survivors. Although the reconstructed red bone marrow doses were about 36% lower on average than the conservative doses previously estimated by the military for compensation, the overall correlation was quite good, suggesting that the estimates of doses from external exposure by the military for all approximately 115,000 cohort members could be adjusted appropriately and used in further epidemiological analyses.",,"['Beck, Harold L', 'Till, John E', 'Grogan, Helen A', 'Aanenson, Jill W', 'Mohler, H Justin', 'Mohler, S Shawn', 'Voilleque, Paul G']","['Beck HL', 'Till JE', 'Grogan HA', 'Aanenson JW', 'Mohler HJ', 'Mohler SS', 'Voilleque PG']",,"['a New York, New York 10014.', 'b Risk Assessment Corporation, South Carolina 29107.', 'c Cascade Scientific, Inc., Bend, Oregon 97703.', 'd Scientific Consulting, Inc., Freeman, South Dakota 57029.', 'e Bridger Scientific, Inc., Belgrade, Montana 59714.', 'f Oak Creek, Colorado 80467; and.', 'g MJP Risk Assessment, Inc., Denver, Colorado 80220.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Breast/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Military Personnel', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*analysis', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry']",,,,,2017/01/31 06:00,2017/05/26 06:00,['2017/01/31 06:00'],"['2017/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1667/RR14458.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2017 Feb;187(2):221-228. doi: 10.1667/RR14458.1.

The reported significance and frequency of these markers is inconclusive. We assessed the frequency and impact of aberrant markers in patients with acute leukemia in a referral institution in Mexico City. METHODS: We included 433 patients, diagnosed and treated between 2005 and 2015 in our institution. RESULTS: Aberrant markers were expressed in 128 patients (29.6%); CD13 and CD33 were the most frequent aberrant markers in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, while CD7 and CD19 were the most frequent in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. In the univariate analysis, the group with aberrant markers had a lower disease-free survival when compared with the aberrant-free group (8 vs. 13 months) (p = 0.03). Aberrant expression of CD10, CD20, and CD33 correlated with a worse outcome in a statistically significant manner. In the multivariate analysis, male gender, lymphoid lineage, secondary leukemia, high risk at diagnosis, and the presence of aberrant markers had a significantly negative impact on disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: The use of more aggressive treatment strategies could be considered in patients with acute leukemia and an aberrant expression of CD10, CD20, and CD33.",,"['Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Sergio', 'Pomerantz, Alan', 'Demichelis-Gomez, Roberta', 'Barrera-Lumbreras, Georgina', 'Barrales-Benitez, Olga V', 'Lopez-Karpovitch, Xavier', 'Aguayo, Alvaro']","['Rodriguez-Rodriguez S', 'Pomerantz A', 'Demichelis-Gomez R', 'Barrera-Lumbreras G', 'Barrales-Benitez OV', 'Lopez-Karpovitch X', 'Aguayo A']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Anahuac Mexico Norte, Huixquilucan, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Anahuac Mexico Norte, Huixquilucan, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2017/01/31 06:00,2017/07/18 06:00,['2017/01/31 06:00'],"['2017/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2016 Nov-Dec;68(6):305-313.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GBGT1 gene encodes Forssman glycolipid synthase (FS), another glycosyltransferase that produces Forssman antigen (FORS1). Humans are considered to be Forssman antigen-negative species without functional FS. However, rare individuals exhibiting Apae phenotype carry a dominant active GBGT1 gene and express Forssman antigen on RBCs. Accordingly, FORS system was recognized as the 31st blood group system. Mouse ABO gene encodes a cis-AB transferase capable of producing both A and B antigens. This murine enzyme contains the same GlyGlyAla tripeptide sequence as FSs at the position important for the determination of sugar specificity. We, therefore, transfected the expression construct into appropriate recipient cells and examined whether mouse cis-AB transferase may also exhibit FS activity. The result was positive, confirming the crosstalk between the ABO and FORS systems.

METHODS: Here, we report a retrospective study detailing our analysis of 130 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with flow cytometry immunophenotypic evaluation of major lymphocyte subsets including B cells, T cells, and NK cells. RESULTS: Our study identifies differential signatures of lymphocyte subsets pertaining to distinct subcategories of AML, and prognostic correlations in patients. In multivariate analysis, NK cells (specifically CD56+/CD16+ NK cells at a cutoff of >/=5%) were found to be an independent indicator of improved overall and disease-free survival; cytogenetic risk was also shown to be critical in stratifying patients with AML. CONCLUSIONS: In total, we demonstrate that in AML, the subset distribution of immune system lymphocytes is nonrandom, and suggest an important role for distinct lymphocyte subsets, particularly NK cells, in this disease.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Alcasid, M', 'Ma, L', 'Gotlib, J R', 'Arber, D A', 'Ohgami, R S']","['Alcasid M', 'Ma L', 'Gotlib JR', 'Arber DA', 'Ohgami RS']",,"['Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Immune system', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunosurveillance']",,2017/01/31 06:00,2017/03/23 06:00,['2017/01/31 06:00'],"['2016/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12594 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 Apr;39(2):129-136. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12594.

Conventional nested reverse transcription PCR is labor intensive and time-consuming. METHODS: We have developed a novel dual-color TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR method for the simultaneous screening of 45 fusion transcripts in 12 parallel reactions. The method was tested and validated with cell lines carrying known fusion transcripts and patient samples. RESULTS: A multiplex real-time PCR method was successfully developed for rapid detection of 45 fusion genes and validated for 15 of the more commonly detected fusion genes. Intra-assay reproducibility assessed for the most frequent rearrangements ranged from 0.41% to 0.74% for the coefficient of variation (CV) of cycle threshold (Ct) and the interassay reproducibility ranged from 1.62% to 2.83% in five separate experiments. The lowest detection limit for the translocations tested ranged between 1 : 16 000 and 1 : 32 000. Validation of the method with 213 patient samples showed 100% specificity and excellent consistence with conventional nested RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Overall, we believe that this method is easily applicable, cost-effective, and clinically useful for a rapid screening of fusion genes in the initial diagnostic phase of leukemia. Its use can also be extended to the monitoring of minimal residual disease.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Zheng, Z', 'Zhang, P', 'He, G', 'Liao, K', 'Wang, Z', 'Pan, J', 'Du, K', 'Du, J', 'Li, B-A']","['Zheng Z', 'Zhang P', 'He G', 'Liao K', 'Wang Z', 'Pan J', 'Du K', 'Du J', 'Li BA']",,"['School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Shanghai Tissuebank Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Tissuebank Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Tissuebank Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Tissuebank Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Tissuebank Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Tissuebank Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Tissuebank Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Limit of Detection', 'Mass Screening', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/economics/*methods/standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Fusion gene', '*chromosomal abnormalities', '*leukemia', '*molecular diagnosis', '*real-time PCR']",,2017/01/31 06:00,2017/03/23 06:00,['2017/01/31 06:00'],"['2016/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12600 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 Apr;39(2):175-184. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12600.

Here we evaluated clinical and biological associations and the prognostic impact of a high diagnostic CD34+/CD38- cell burden in 169 AML patients receiving an allogeneic stem cell transplantation in complete remission. Here, the therapeutic approach is mainly based on immunological graft-versus-leukemia effects. Percentage of bone marrow CD34+/CD38- cell burden at diagnosis was measured using flow cytometry and was highly variable (median 0.5%, range 0%-89% of all mononuclear cells). A high CD34+/CD38- cell burden at diagnosis associated with worse genetic risk and secondary AML. Patients with a high CD34+/CD38- cell burden had shorter relapse-free and overall survival which may be mediated by residual leukemia-initiating cells in the CD34+/CD38- cell population, escaping the graft-versus-leukemia effect after allogeneic transplantation.

Active marrow, however, is in reality a surrogate tissue region for specific cell populations, namely the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Present models of active marrow dosimetry implicitly assume that these cells are uniformly localized throughout the marrow spaces of trabecular spongiosa. Data from Watchman et al. and Bourke et al., however, clearly indicate that there is a substantial spatial concentration gradient of these cells with the highest concentrations localized near the bone trabeculae surfaces. The purpose of the present study was thus to explore the dosimetric implications of these spatial gradients on active marrow dosimetry. METHODS: Images of several bone sites from a 45-yr female were retagged to group active marrow voxels into 50 mum increments of marrow depth, after which electron and alpha-particle depth-dependent specific absorbed fractions were computed for four source tissues - active marrow, inactive marrow, bone trabeculae volumes, and bone trabeculae surfaces. Corresponding depth-dependent S values (dose to a target tissue per decay in a source tissue) were computed and further weighted by the relative target cell concentration. These depth-weighted radionuclide S values were systematically compared to the more traditional volume-averaged radionuclide S values of the MIRD schema for both individual bones of the skeleton and their skeletal-averaged quantities. RESULTS: For both beta-emitters and alpha-emitters localized in the active and inactive marrow, depth-weighted S values were shown to differ from volume-averaged S values by only a few percent, as dose gradients across the marrow tissues are nonexistent. For bone volume and bone surface sources of alpha-emitters and lower energy beta-emitters, when marrow dose gradients are expected, explicit consideration of target cell spatial concentration gradients are shown to significantly impact marrow dosimetry. CONCLUSIONS: For medical isotopes currently utilized for treatment of skeletal metastases, namely (153) Sm and (223) Ra, accounting for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell concentration gradients resulted in maximum percent differences to reference skeletal-averaged S values of ~21% and 55%, respectively.",['(c) 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.'],"['Geyer, Amy M', 'Schwarz, Bryan C', ""O'Reilly, Shannon E"", 'Hobbs, Robert F', 'Sgouros, George', 'Bolch, Wesley E']","['Geyer AM', 'Schwarz BC', ""O'Reilly SE"", 'Hobbs RF', 'Sgouros G', 'Bolch WE']",,"['J Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6131, USA.', 'J Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6131, USA.', 'J Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6131, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21231, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21231, USA.', 'J Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6131, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Phys,Medical physics,0425746,,IM,"['Absorption, Radiation', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', '*Bone and Bones', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Radiometry/*methods']",PMC6385882,['NOTNLM'],"['hematopoietic stem cell', 'marrow dosimetry', 'molecular radiotherapy']",,2017/01/31 06:00,2017/03/21 06:00,['2017/01/31 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mp.12056 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Phys. 2017 Feb;44(2):747-761. doi: 10.1002/mp.12056.

Jellyfish extracts have several biological functions, such as cytotoxic, anti-microbial, and antioxidant activities in cells and organisms. However, the anti-cancer effect of Jellyfish extract has not yet been examined. We used chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells to evaluate the mechanisms of anti-cancer activity of hexane extracts from Nomura's jellyfish in vitro. In this study, jellyfish are subjected to hexane extraction, and the extract is shown to have an anticancer effect on chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. Interestingly, the present results show that jellyfish hexane extract (Jellyfish-HE) induces apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To identify the mechanism(s) underlying Jellyfish-HE-induced apoptosis in K562 cells, we examined the effects of Jellyfish-HE on activation of caspase and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are responsible for cell cycle progression. Induction of apoptosis by Jellyfish-HE occurred through the activation of caspases-3,-8 and -9 and phosphorylation of p38. Jellyfish-HE-induced apoptosis was blocked by a caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD. Moreover, during apoptosis in K562 cells, p38 MAPK was inhibited by pretreatment with SB203580, an inhibitor of p38. SB203580 blocked jellyfish-HE-induced apoptosis. Additionally, Jellyfish-HE markedly arrests the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. Therefore, taken together, the results imply that the anti-cancer activity of Jellyfish-HE may be mediated apoptosis by induction of caspases and activation of MAPK, especially phosphorylation of p38, and cell cycle arrest at the Go/G1 phase in K562 cells.",,"['Ha, Sun-Hyung', 'Jin, Fansi', 'Kwak, Choong-Hwan', 'Abekura, Fukushi', 'Park, Jun-Young', 'Park, Nam Gyu', 'Chang, Young-Chae', 'Lee, Young-Choon', 'Chung, Tae-Wook', 'Ha, Ki-Tae', 'Son, Jong-Keun', 'Chang, Hyeun Wook', 'Kim, Cheorl-Ho']","['Ha SH', 'Jin F', 'Kwak CH', 'Abekura F', 'Park JY', 'Park NG', 'Chang YC', 'Lee YC', 'Chung TW', 'Ha KT', 'Son JK', 'Chang HW', 'Kim CH']",,"['Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon City, Kyunggi-Do, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsang, Republic of Korea.', 'Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon City, Kyunggi-Do, Republic of Korea.', 'Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon City, Kyunggi-Do, Republic of Korea.', 'Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon City, Kyunggi-Do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Fisheries Sciences, Pukyung National University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Medicine, Catholic University of Daegu, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Medicinal Biotechnology, College of Health Science, Dong-A University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Medicine, School of Korean Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan City, Gyeongsangnam-Do, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Medicine, School of Korean Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan City, Gyeongsangnam-Do, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsang, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsang, Republic of Korea.', 'Molecular and Cellular Glycobiology Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon City, Kyunggi-Do, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,,,PMC5251936,['NOTNLM'],"['Jellyfish', 'Jellyfish species', 'Myelogenousleukemia k562 cells']",['Cheorl-Ho Kim is an Academic Editor for PeerJ.'],2017/01/31 06:00,2017/01/31 06:01,['2017/01/31 06:00'],"['2016/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.2895 [doi]', '2895 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2017 Jan 19;5:e2895. doi: 10.7717/peerj.2895. eCollection 2017.,20170119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imbalances in leukotriene B4 synthesis are related to several pathologic conditions. Currently there are no available drugs capable to modulate the synthesis of leukotriene B4 or to block its receptors. Here we show the inhibitory profile of alpha lipoic acid on the activity of leukotriene A4 Hydrolase. Alpha lipoic acid inhibited both activities of the enzyme at concentrations lower than 10muM. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton, or the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein inhibitor MK-886, were unable to inhibit the activity of the enzyme. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cells were differentiated to leukotriene A4 hydrolase expressing neutrophil-like cells. Alpha lipoic acid inhibited the aminopeptidase activity of the cytosolic fraction from neutrophil-like cells but had no effect on the cytosolic fraction from undifferentiated cells. Docking and molecular dynamic approximations revealed that alpha lipoic acid participates in electrostatic interactions with K-565 and R-563, which are key residues for the carboxylate group recognition of endogenous substrates by the enzyme. Alpha lipoic acid is a compound widely used in clinical practice, most of its therapeutic effects are associated with its antioxidants properties, however, antioxidant effect alone is unable to explain all clinical effects observed with alpha lipoic acid. Our results invite to evaluate the significance of the inhibitory effect of alpha lipoic acid on the catalytic activity of leukotriene A4 hydrolase using in vivo models.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

What confers pancreatic cancer resistance to checkpoint immunotherapy is unknown. The aim of this study is to elucidate the underlying mechanism of PD-L1 expression regulation in the context of pancreatic cancer immune evasion. METHODS: Pancreatic cancer mouse models and human specimens were used to determine PD-L1 and PD-1 expression and cancer immune evasion. Histone methyltransferase inhibitors, RNAi, and overexpression were used to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of PD-L1 expression regulation. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: PD-L1 is expressed in 60% to 90% of tumor cells in human pancreatic carcinomas and in nine of 10 human pancreatic cancer cell lines. PD-1 is expressed in 51.2% to 52.1% of pancreatic tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Tumors grow statistically significantly faster in FasL-deficient mice than in wild-type mice (P = .03-.001) and when CTLs are neutralized (P = .03-<.001). H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is enriched in the cd274 promoter in pancreatic tumor cells. MLL1 directly binds to the cd274 promoter to catalyze H3K4me3 to activate PD-L1 transcription in tumor cells. Inhibition or silencing of MLL1 decreases the H3K4me3 level in the cd274 promoter and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells. Accordingly, inhibition of MLL1 in combination with anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 antibody immunotherapy effectively suppresses pancreatic tumor growth in a FasL- and CTL-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: The Fas-FasL/CTLs and the MLL1-H3K4me3-PD-L1 axis play contrasting roles in pancreatic cancer immune surveillance and evasion. Targeting the MLL1-H3K4me3 axis is an effective approach to enhance the efficacy of checkpoint immunotherapy against pancreatic cancer.","['(c) The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

Biomarkers for IA aim for earlier and more accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment. However, data on the cost-effectiveness of a biomarker-based diagnostic strategy (BDS) are limited. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of BDS using results from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and individual patient costing data. Data inputs derived from a published RCT were used to construct a decision-analytic model to compare BDS (Aspergillus galactomannan and PCR on blood) with standard diagnostic strategy (SDS) of culture and histology in terms of total costs, length of stay, IA incidence, mortality, and years of life saved. Costs were estimated for each patient using hospital costing data to day 180 and follow-up for survival was modeled to five years using a Gompertz survival model. Treatment costs were determined for 137 adults undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant or receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia in four Australian centers (2005-2009). Median total costs at 180 days were similar between groups (US$78,774 for SDS [IQR US$50,808-123,476] and US$81,279 for BDS [IQR US$59,221-123,242], P = .49). All-cause mortality was 14.7% (10/68) for SDS and 10.1% (7/69) for BDS, (P = .573). The costs per life-year saved were US$325,448, US$81,966, and US$3,670 at 180 days, one year and five years, respectively. BDS is not cost-sparing but is cost-effective if a survival benefit is maintained over several years. An individualized institutional approach to diagnostic strategies may maximize utility and cost-effectiveness.","['(c) The Author 2017.

We evaluated the feasibility of using 5-azacytidine (AZA) in this setting. METHODS: All patients referred to Gustave Roussy between 2010 and 2015 for TRMN diagnosis (less than 30% blast) and eligible for AZA treatment were included. Patients with CAND proposed for BSC were also described. Patient's outcomes were analyzed based on the presence or not of a CAND. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients with TRMN were analyzed, including 19 patients with CAND (14 eligible for AZA) and 33 without CAND eligible for AZA. The 5 patients with CAND ineligible for AZA had a worst performance status (p=0.016) at diagnosis and a shorter overall survival (OS) (0.62 months). Baseline characteristics of patients eligible for AZA were similar in the 2 groups except a trend for best performance status in patients with CAND (p=0.06). Overall response rate (71.4% vs 60.3%), transfusion independence (50.0% vs 45.5%) and OS (12.7 months vs 10.8 months) were similar between patients with and without CAND respectively (p=ns).

Stable isotope labeled HU-(13)C1,(15)N2 was used as internal standard. Plasma samples were treated with acetonitrile to precipitate protein. The supernatant was injected directly without derivatization and separated on a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column. HU was quantitatively analyzed with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-1.5mM ammonium formate (90:10, V:V) within 3min. The proposed method provided a linearity range of 1-200mug/mL. The coefficients of variation for intra- and inter-day precision were less than 2.07% and 4.28%, respectively, while the accuracy (bias) was in the range of -3.77 to 2.96%.

An early and rapid surge of mature NK cells as well as CD4(+) T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) was noted compared with the control group. KIR of donor phenotype reconstituted as early as day 30 with expression of CD56(dim)CD16(+)NKG2A(-)KIR(+) phenotype. None experienced viral or fungal infections, and non-relapse mortality was 10% only. The incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD was 50% in the control group with none in the CD56 group (P = 0.01). Only two had de novo chronic GVHD in each group. Relapse occurred in five patients in CD56 group with a median follow-up of 12 months, similar to the control group.

This national survey aimed to achieve better understanding of end-of life care in specialized medical pediatrics departments for children facing the end-of-life, identify the available resources, put forward the difficulties encountered by professionals and describe end-of-life paths of children who died in these departments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study is based on a nationwide survey conducted among all existing specialized medical pediatrics departments (onco-haematology, neurology, reanimation) in France in 2015. RESULTS: Among 94 specialized medical pediatrics departments in France, 53 participated in our survey (response rate=56%). At the time of the survey, 13% of inpatients were facing the end-of-life. Regarding training, 13% of departments did not have personnel trained in palliative care and 21% did not set up any professional support. However, when taking care of a child's end of life in 2014, 77% of these departments solicited a regional resource team of pediatric palliative care. This survey helps describe 225 end-of-life paths of children decease of a terminal illness in the specialized pediatrics departments. Seventy-two percent suffered from refractory symptoms before their death, 64% were concerned by a terminal sedation and 75% by a limitation of life-sustaining treatment decision. CONCLUSION: End-of-life care is a reality for specialized pediatrics departments. The frequency of major and refractory symptoms often requires the completion of sedation. The resources of service are acceptable but some deficiencies have been noted especially concerning training and support for caregivers, adaptation of premises or family support.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Infertility and cancer are increasingly being linked by epidemiologists and basic scientists. We sought to identify semen parameters associated with an increased childhood cancer risk in the family members of subfertile men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in men from the SHARE (Subfertility Heath and Assisted Reproduction) study who underwent semen analysis between 1994 and 2011. We used fertile population controls from the Utah Population Data Base. Our primary outcome was the risk of any childhood (18 years or younger) cancer in the siblings and cousins of men who underwent semen analysis compared to fertile, age matched controls. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to test the association between semen quality and childhood cancer incidence. RESULTS: We selected 10,511 men with complete semen analysis and an equal number of fertile controls. These men had a total of 63,891 siblings and 327,753 cousins. A total of 170 and 958 childhood cancers were identified in siblings and cousins, respectively. The 3 most common cancers diagnosed in siblings were acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 37, brain cancer in 35 and Hodgkin lymphoma in 15. Oligozoospermia was associated with a twofold increased risk of any childhood cancer and a threefold increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the siblings of subfertile men compared to fertile controls (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.18-3.69 vs HR 3.07, 95% CI 1.11-8.46). CONCLUSIONS: Siblings of men with oligozoospermia are at increased risk for any-site cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This suggests a shared genetic/epigenetic insult or an environmental exposure that merits further investigation.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study compared the accuracy of three point-of-care (PoC) FeLV p27 antigen test kits commonly used in Australia and available commercially worldwide (SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo, Witness FeLV/FIV and Anigen Rapid FIV/FeLV), using detection of FeLV provirus by an in-house real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay as the diagnostic gold standard. Blood (n=563) and saliva (n=419) specimens were collected from a population of cats determined to include 491 FeLV-uninfected and 72 FeLV-infected individuals (45 progressive infections [p27 and qPCR positive], 27 regressive infections [p27 negative, qPCR positive]). Sensitivity and specificity using whole blood was 63% and 94% for SNAP Combo, 57% and 98% for Witness, and 57% and 98% for Anigen Rapid, respectively. SNAP Combo had a significantly lower specificity using blood compared to the other two kits (P=0.004 compared to Witness, P=0.007 compared to Anigen Rapid). False-positive test results occurred with all three kits using blood, and although using any two kits in parallel increased specificity, no combination of kits completely eliminated the occurrence of false-positive results. We therefore recommend FeLV proviral PCR testing for any cat that tests positive with a PoC FeLV antigen kit, as well as for any cat that has been potentially exposed to FeLV but tests negative with a FeLV antigen kit, before final assignment of FeLV status can be made with confidence. For saliva testing, sensitivity and specificity was 54% and 100%, respectively, for all three test kits.

We opted to quantitatively synthesize published data on the association of maternal/child diet with leukemia risk. METHODS: Medline was searched until June 30th, 2016 for eligible articles on the association of childhood leukemia with consumption of (i) food groups, excluding alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and (ii) specific dietary supplements before/during index pregnancy and childhood. RESULTS: Eighteen studies of case-control design (N=11,720 cases/18,721 controls) were included, of which nine assessed maternal dietary components, five index child's and four both, mainly focusing on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Statistically significant inverse estimates for ALL were found (2 studies, 413 cases, 490 controls) for fruit (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67, 0.99); vegetables (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.94); legumes (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.94); fish (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.53, among the 0-4year old; 2 studies 215 cases, 215 controls); preconception folic acid supplementation (OR: 0.69, 95%CI: 0.50-0.95; published meta analysis plus 2 studies, 3511 cases, 6816 controls); and use of vitamins during pregnancy (OR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.74-0.88; published meta analysis plus one study, 5967 cases, 8876 controls). The associations (2 studies) of the remaining food groups and maternal dietary supplements consumption during pregnancy as well as of childhood diet and supplements intake (2-4 studies) were non significant. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal consumption of specific food groups comprising""healthy"" items of the Mediterranean diet, preconception use of folic acid and intake of vitamins during pregnancy were associated with decreased ALL risk.

These anomalies are associated with a lower risk of developing myelodysplasia (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia. The chromosome anomalies may be due to an SDS-specific karyotype instability, reflected also by anomalies that are not clonal, but found in single cells in the BM or in peripheral blood (PB). PROCEDURE: Starting in 1999, we have monitored the cytogenetic picture of a cohort of 91 Italian patients with SDS by all suitable cytogenetic and molecular methods. RESULTS: Here, we report clonal chromosome anomalies that are different from the aforementioned, as well as changes found in single cells in BM/PB of the same patients. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the newly recognized clonal anomalies in BM reported here are recurrent, especially unbalanced structural anomalies of chromosome 7, a further complex rearrangement of the del(20)(q) with duplicated and deleted portions, and an unbalanced translocation t(3;6), with partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 3 and partial monosomy of the long arm of chromosome 6. Firm conclusions on the possible prognostic relevance of these anomalies would require further study with larger patient cohorts, but our data are sufficient to suggest that these patients necessitate more frequent cytogenetic monitoring. The results on anomalies found in single cells confirm the presence of an SDS-specific karyotype instability.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Valli, Roberto', 'De Paoli, Elena', 'Nacci, Lucia', 'Frattini, Annalisa', 'Pasquali, Francesco', 'Maserati, Emanuela']","['Valli R', 'De Paoli E', 'Nacci L', 'Frattini A', 'Pasquali F', 'Maserati E']",,"['Human and Medical Genetics, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Human and Medical Genetics, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S.

Accordingly, the main objectives of this study were to determine the incidence and risk factors for treatment-related seizures among children with ALL, and the neurocognitive outcomes associated with treatment-related seizures. PROCEDURE: Prospective neuropsychological assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were planned for all 498 patients with newly diagnosed ALL enrolled on the St. Jude Total Therapy XV (TOTXV) protocol at three time points. The study database was reviewed retrospectively to identify those with treatment-related seizure. To assess neurocognitive changes associated with seizure, each patient with treatment-related seizure was matched with two cohort patients without seizure for age at treatment, gender, race, and treatment intensity. RESULTS: Nineteen patients developed seizure, with a 2-year cumulative risk of 3.82 +/- 0.86% (SE). No risk factors were identified to be associated with the development of seizure, with a possible exception of intensive chemotherapy used on the standard/high-risk arm as compared to the low-risk arm. Neuropsychological performance of the seizure group, as compared to normative scores and nonseizure control cohort, indicated problems in attention, working memory, and processing speed. Cognitive deficits persisted 2 years after therapy, with additional declines in intellectual function observed. MRI indicated early neurotoxicity among the seizure group, as evidenced by greater leukoencephalopathy on initial examinations. CONCLUSION: Treatment-related seizures were associated with leukoencephalopathy and decreased neuropsychological performance. Prospective studies are needed to detect changes in neurocognitive status associated with long-term functional impairment.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Nassar, Stephanie L', 'Conklin, Heather M', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Ashford, Jason M', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Glass, John O', 'Laningham, Fred H', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Nassar SL', 'Conklin HM', 'Zhou Y', 'Ashford JM', 'Reddick WE', 'Glass JO', 'Laningham FH', 'Jeha S', 'Cheng C', 'Pui CH']",,"[""Mental Health and Behavioral Science Services, James A.

However, prevalence in cats in Southern Germany is still unknown. Therefore, prevalence of Bartonella species DNA in blood of 479 Southern German cats was determined using a previously published conventional PCR targeting a fragment of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region. Associations between Bartonella bacteraemia, housing conditions, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) status, including progressive, regressive and abortive FeLV infection, were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Prevalence of Bartonella species bacteraemia was 2.5 per cent (12/479; CI 0.01-0.04 per cent). Bartonella henselae DNA was amplified in 11 of the 12 cats. One cat was positive for Bartonella clarridgeiae DNA. Of the infected cats, 2/12 cats were ill; 6/12 cats had thrombocytopenia. There was a significantly higher risk of Bartonella species infection in young and shelter cats, but not in FIV-infected or FeLV-infected cats.

However, what induces constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 is currently unknown. Mass spectrometry was used to identify casein kinase 2 (CK2), a serine/threonine kinase that coimmunoprecipitated with serine phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3). Furthermore, activated CK2 incubated with recombinant STAT3 induced phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine 727. Although STAT3 and CK2 are present in normal B- and T cells, STAT3 is not constitutively phosphorylated in these cells. Further study found that CD5 and BLNK coexpressed in CLL, but not in normal B- or T cells, are required for STAT3 phosphorylation. To elucidate the relationship of CD5 and BLNK to CK2 and STAT3, STAT3 was immunoprecipitated from CLL cells, and CK2, CD5, and BLNK were detected in the immunoprecipitate. Conversely, STAT3, CD5, and BLNK were in the immunoprecipitate of CLL cells immunoprecipitated with CK2 antibodies. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of CD5 or BLNK, or treatment with CD5-neutralizing antibodies significantly reduced the levels of serine pSTAT3 in CLL cells. Finally, confocal microscopy determined that CD5 is cell membrane bound, and fractionation studies revealed that the CK2/CD5/BLNK/STAT3 complex remains in the cytoplasm, whereas serine pSTAT3 is shuttled to the nucleus.Implications: These data show that the cellular proteins CK2, CD5, and BLNK are required for constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 in CLL. Whether this protein complex phosphorylates other proteins or inhibiting its activity would have clinical benefit in patients has yet to be determined. Mol Cancer Res; 15(5); 610-8.

Predictors of weight trajectories of Israeli PCS were examined from diagnosis and end of active cancer treatment to 3 years posttreatment. Methods: World Health Organization-derived body mass index (z-BMI) values were calculated at each time point from medical records of 135 Israeli PCS ( M diagnosis age = 11.4). A three-section piecewise multilevel model including age, ethnicity, gender, treatment length, and diagnosis as predictors was used to estimate z-BMI trajectories. Results: Most participants remained at a healthy weight at all time points. Differing weight trajectories emerged for PCS diagnosed with lymphoma/leukemia versus other cancer diagnoses from diagnosis to end of treatment, but similar weight change patterns were observed posttreatment. Conclusion: Replication of U.S. PCS weight trajectories was not observed in Israeli PCS, suggesting the importance of exploring environmental risk factors contributing to obesity among PCS.","['(c) The Author 2017.

However, clinical application of ATRA has limitations. Our previous studies suggested that 4-Amino-2-Trifluoromethyl-Phenyl Retinate (ATPR), a novel all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) derivative designed and synthesized by our team, could induce differentiation of APL cells in vivo and in vitro. To explore the underlying mechanism of ATPR, the effect of ATPR on autophagy of APL cells was observed in the present study. The results showed that the differentiation effect of ATPR on APL cells was accompanied with autophagy induction and PML-RARalpha degradation via activating Notch1 signaling pathway. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) that targets essential autophagy gene ATG5 abrogated the ATPR-induced cell differentiation. Furthermore, when pretreated with DAPT, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, the Notch1 signaling pathway was blocked in APL cells, followed by the reduction of ATPR-induced autophagy and differentiation. Taken together, these results suggested that autophagy play an important role in ATPR-induced cell differentiation, which may provide a novel approach to cure APL patients.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

In particular, the high conservation between human and zebrafish hematopoiesis (Jing & Zon, 2011) has stimulated the development of zebrafish models for human hematopoietic malignancies to elucidate molecular pathogenesis and to expedite the preclinical investigation of novel therapies. While T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the first transgenic cancer model in zebrafish (Langenau et al., 2003), a wide spectrum of zebrafish models of human hematopoietic malignancies has been established since 2003, largely through transgenesis and genome-editing approaches.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of intramuscular injection of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) on the cardiac function of a DCM rat model. METHODS: A DCM model was established by intraperitoneal injections of doxorubicin in Sprague-Dawley rats. hUCMSCs at different concentrations or cultured medium were injected via limb skeletal muscles, with blank medium injected as the control. The rats were monitored for 4 weeks, meanwhile BNP, cTNI, VEGF, HGF, GM-CSF, and LIF in the peripheral blood were examined by ELISA, and cardiac function was monitored by echocardiography (Echo-CG). Finally, the expression of IGF-1, HGF, and VEGF in the myocardium was examined by histoimmunochemistry and real-time PCR, and the ultrastructure of the myocardium was examined by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Injection of hUCMSCs markedly improved cardiac function in the DCM rats by significantly elevating left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS). The BNP and cTNI levels in the peripheral blood were reduced by hUCMSCs, while HGF, LIF, GM-CSF, and VEGF were increased by hUCMSCs. Expression of IGF-1, HGF, and VEGF in the myocardium from the DCM rats was significantly increased by hUCMSC injection. Furthermore, hUCMSCs protected the ultrastructure of cardiomyocytes by attenuating mitochondrial swelling and maintaining sarcolemma integrity.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide cure most patients by directly targeting PML-RARalpha. However, major issues including the resistance of ATRA and arsenic therapy still remain in APL clinical management. Here we showed that compound Z-10, a nitro-ligand of retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), strongly promoted the cAMP-independent apoptosis of both ATRA- sensitive and resistant NB4 cells via the induction of caspase-mediated PML-RARalpha degradation. RXRalpha was vital for the stability of both PML-RARalpha and RARalpha likely through the interactions. The binding of Z-10 to RXRalpha dramatically inhibited the interaction of RXRalpha with PML-RARalpha but not with RARalpha, leading to Z-10's selective induction of PML-RARalpha but not RARalpha degradation. Z-36 and Z-38, two derivatives of Z-10, had improved potency of inducing PML-RARalpha reduction and NB4 cell apoptosis. Hence, RXRalpha ligand Z-10 and its derivatives could target both ATRA- sensitive and resistant APL cells through their distinct acting mechanism, and are potential drug leads for APL treatment.",,"['Xu, Lin', 'Zeng, Zhiping', 'Zhang, Weidong', 'Ren, Gaoang', 'Ling, Xiaobin', 'Huang, Fengyu', 'Xie, Peizhen', 'Su, Ying', 'Zhang, Xiao-Kun', 'Zhou, Hu']","['Xu L', 'Zeng Z', 'Zhang W', 'Ren G', 'Ling X', 'Huang F', 'Xie P', 'Su Y', 'Zhang XK', 'Zhou H']",,"['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Cancer Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Innovative Drug Target Research, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Nitro Compounds)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptor alpha)', '0 (Styrenes)', '0 (Z-10 nitro compound)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5287E3OUAV (beta-nitrostyrene)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Naphthalenes/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Nitro Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Retinoid X Receptor alpha/*metabolism', 'Styrenes/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",PMC5355346,['NOTNLM'],"['PML-RARalpha', 'RXRalpha', 'Z-10', 'cleavage', 'interaction']",,2017/01/28 06:00,2017/08/12 06:00,['2017/01/28 06:00'],"['2016/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['14812 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.14812 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Feb 14;8(7):12311-12322. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.14812.,,,"['R01 CA140980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM089927/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and their isolated nuclei were exposed to various chromatin altering treatments. These included 10 different ionic environments, DNA cleaving and unfolding agents, as well as DNA condensing agents. Raw radiofrequency (RF) data was used to generate quantitative ultrasound parameters from spectral and form factor analyses. Chromatin structure was evaluated using electron microscopy. Results indicated that trends in quantitative ultrasound parameters mirrored trends in biophysical chromatin structure parameters. In general, higher ordered states of chromatin compaction resulted in increases to ultrasound paramaters of midband fit, spectral intercept, and estimated scatterer concentration, while samples with decondensed forms of chromatin followed an opposite trend. Experiments with isolated nuclei demonstrated that chromatin changes alone were sufficient to account for these observations. Experiments with ex vivo samples indicated similar effects of chromatin structure changes.

Androgens, used in the treatment of aplastic anemia, have been reported to block proliferation of and initiate differentiation in AML cells. We report the results of a multicenter, phase III, randomized open-label trial exploring the benefit of adding androgens to maintenance therapy in patients 60 years of age or older. Patients and Methods A total of 330 patients with AML de novo or secondary to chemotherapy or radiotherapy were enrolled in the study. Induction therapy included idarubicin 8 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5, cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 7, and lomustine 200 mg/m(2) on day 1. Patients in complete remission or partial remission received six reinduction courses, alternating idarubicin 8 mg/m(2) on day 1, cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5, and a regimen of methotrexate and mercaptopurine. Patients were randomly assigned to receive norethandrolone 10 or 20 mg/day, according to body weight, or no norethandrolone for a 2-year maintenance therapy regimen. The primary end point was disease-free survival by intention to treat. Secondary end points were event-free survival, overall survival, and safety. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00700544. Results Random assignment allotted 165 patients to each arm; arm A received norethandrolone, and arm B did not receive norethandrolone. Complete remission or partial remission was achieved in 247 patients (76%). The Schoenfeld time-dependent model showed that norethandrolone significantly improved survival for patients still in remission at 1 year after induction. In arms A and B, respectively, 5-year disease-free survival was 31.2% and 16.2%, event-free survival was 21.5% and 12.9%, and overall survival was 26.3% and 17.2%. Norethandrolone improved outcomes irrelevant to all prognosis factors. Only patients with baseline leukocytes > 30 x 10(9)/L did not benefit from norethandrolone. Conclusion This study demonstrates that maintenance therapy with norethandrolone significantly improves survival in elderly patients with AML without increasing toxicity.",,"['Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Bene, Marie C', 'Guardiola, Philippe', 'Recher, Christian', 'Hamel, Jean-Francois', 'Sauvezie, Mathieu', 'Harousseau, Jean-Luc', 'Tournilhac, Olivier', 'Witz, Francis', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Escoffre-Barbe, Martine', 'Guyotat, Denis', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Himberlin, Chantal', 'Hunault, Mathilde', 'Delain, Martine', 'Lioure, Bruno', 'Jourdan, Eric', 'Bauduer, Frederic', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Sotto, Jean-Jacques', 'Ifrah, Norbert']","['Pigneux A', 'Bene MC', 'Guardiola P', 'Recher C', 'Hamel JF', 'Sauvezie M', 'Harousseau JL', 'Tournilhac O', 'Witz F', 'Berthou C', 'Escoffre-Barbe M', 'Guyotat D', 'Fegueux N', 'Himberlin C', 'Hunault M', 'Delain M', 'Lioure B', 'Jourdan E', 'Bauduer F', 'Dreyfus F', 'Cahn JY', 'Sotto JJ', 'Ifrah N']",,"['Arnaud Pigneux and Mathieu Sauvezie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Bordeaux, Universite Bordeaux, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) 1035, Bordeaux; Marie C.

We analyzed promoter methylation and mutation of tumor suppressor genes on 1p36 in CML. METHODS: We performed methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) analysis of the PRDM2, RUNX3, and TP73 genes in 61 patients with CML (43 chronic phase, CP; two accelerated phase; and 16 blast crisis, BC). Oxidative MS-PCR, PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism, and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR were also analyzed. K-562 cells were grown in the presence of 5-Aza-dC and trichostatin A. RESULTS: Methylation of the PRDM2, RUNX3, and TP73 genes was detected in 24/60 (40%), 21/61 (34%), and 28/60 (47%) patients, respectively. Methylation of all three genes was detected in 19/59 (32%) patients. Methylation was more frequent in BC than in CP. Oxidative MS-PCR analysis detected 5-mC in the PRDM2, RUNX3, and TP73 genes in 10/22 (45%), 15/21 (71%), and 16/26 (62%) samples with methylation detected by MS-PCR, respectively. Decreased expression was observed in several samples with methylation, while no mutations were found in the genes. Treatment of K-562 cells induced growth suppression, demethylation, and reexpression of the PRDM2 and RUNX3 genes. CONCLUSION: Multiple tumor suppressor genes on 1p were inactivated in CML by methylation.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) is also a highly aggressive lymphoma. These two diseases can often be confused with each other; therefore, we aimed to determine the clinical and pathological differences between T-PLL and PTCL-NOS. METHODS: We analyzed 15 T-PLL and 91 PTCL-NOS patients and also compared clinical features between T-PLL and PTCL-NOS with leukemic presentation. Peripheral blood images and biopsy specimens were analyzed, and treatment responses were determined via imaging modalities. The clinicopathological characteristics were statistically compared. RESULTS: T-PLL cells were smaller in size than those of PTCL-NOS with leukemic presentation (P=.0068); moreover, PTCL-NOS cells with leukemic presentation were smaller than those of PTCL-NOS without leukemic presentation (P=.0017). Immunophenotypic patterns in T-PLL and PTCL-NOS were similar. Five-year overall survival rates of T-PLL and all PTCL-NOS patients were 57.5% and 36.8%, respectively.

We recently reported space-time clustering of CL around birth, and now aim to generate etiological hypotheses by comparing clustered and nonclustered cases. We also investigated whether the clustering resulted from many small aggregations of cases or from a few larger clusters. METHODS: We identified cases of persons born and diagnosed between 1985 and 2014 at age 0-15 years from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We determined spatial and temporal lags that maximized evidence of clustering based on the Knox test and classified cases born within these lags from another case as clustered. Using logistic regression adjusted for child population density, we determined whether clustering status was associated with age at diagnosis, immunophenotype, cytogenetic subtype, perinatal and socioeconomic characteristics, and pollution sources. RESULTS: Analyses included 1,282 cases of which 242 were clustered (born within 1 km and 2 years from another case). Of all investigated characteristics only the t(12;21)(p13;q22) translocation (resulting in ETV6-RUNX1 fusion) differed significantly in prevalence between clustered and nonclustered cases (40% and 25%, respectively; adjusted OR 2.54 [1.52-4.23]; p = 0.003). Spatio-temporal clustering was driven by an excess of aggregations of two or three children rather than by a few large clusters. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest ETV6-RUNX1 is associated with space-time clustering of CL and are consistent with an infection interacting with that oncogene in early life leading to clinical leukemia.",,"['Kreis, Christian', 'Lupatsch, Judith E', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Egger, Matthias', 'Kuehni, Claudia E', 'Spycher, Ben D']","['Kreis C', 'Lupatsch JE', 'Niggli F', 'Egger M', 'Kuehni CE', 'Spycher BD']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5273-1954'],"['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', ""University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Space-Time Clustering', '*Translocation, Genetic']",PMC5271308,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2017/01/28 06:00,2017/08/11 06:00,['2017/01/28 06:00'],"['2016/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0170020 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-36884 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jan 27;12(1):e0170020. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0170020. eCollection 2017.,20170127,,,,,,,,,,['Swiss Paediatric Oncology Group and the Swiss National Cohort Study Group'],,,,,

AIM: To describe the age and sex frequencies of the major subtypes of leukemias in two hospitals of reference in the metropolitan area of Mexico City. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a descriptive and retrospective study, based on medical records of two hematology services during January 2007 to October 2014; all cases diagnosed with leukemia were included. RESULTS: A total of 1,432 cases were included with a median age of 38 years (range, two months to 115 years). There were significant age differences between subtypes of leukemia (ANOVA test, p = 0.000): chronic lymphocytic with a mean age of 64.8 years, higher than chronic myeloid (43.4 years) and all acute leukemias (lymphoblastic: 32.6 years, myeloblastic 43.5 years). Of the patients, 51.8% (n = 742) were women, although males predominated in chronic myeloid (57.8%) and lymphocytic (60%) leukemia. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the more common variety, FABL2 subtype, followed by myeloid leukemia M4, M2, and chronic myeloid.

The diagnosis and management of these patients is challenging due to the limited information from prospective studies. Guidelines for front-line therapy have not been established. The prognosis is favourable with median overall survivals greater than 10 years. Areas covered: This manuscript is a review of the clinical features, diagnosis, pathogenesis and, in particular, the various available therapeutic options for this rare lymphoid leukemia. A systematic literature search using electronic PubMed database has been carried out. Expert commentary: A watch and wait strategy without therapeutic intervention is recommended in asymptomatic patients. The immunomodulators methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin are the most commonly used drugs in the routine practice with responses ranging from 50 to 65% and without evidence of cross-resistance among them. Purine analogs such as 2 deoxycoformycin and fludarabine alone or in combination may be indicated in patients with bulky and/or widespread disease.

As IM is widely used in CML, in combination with other drugs, the effects of IM on drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) are crucial to the design of rational drug administration. Carboxylesterases (CESs) are enzymes catalysing the hydrolytic biotransformation of several clinically useful drugs. Although IM is known to inhibit cytochromes P450 (CYPs), its effects on DMEs, and CESs in particular, are still largely undefined. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and Huh7) and primary mouse hepatocytes were used. mRNA and protein expression were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Reporter luciferase activity was determined by transient co-transfection experiment. Pregnane X receptor (PXR) expression was regulated by overexpression and RNA interference. The activity of CESs was determined by enzymic and toxicological assays. Mice were treated with a range of doses of IM to analyse expression of CESs in mouse liver. KEY RESULTS: The expression and activity of CESs were markedly repressed by IM, along with the down-regulation of PXR and inhibited expression and activity of CYP3A4 and P-gp. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Down-regulation of PXR mediates IM-induced suppression of CESs. IM may inhibit expression of other genes targeted by PXR, thus inducing a wide range of potential drug-drug interactions during treatment of CML. The data deserve further elucidation including clinical trials.",['(c) 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Luo, Wenjing', 'Xin, Yu', 'Zhao, Xia', 'Zhang, Feng', 'Liu, Changqing', 'Fan, Hongwei', 'Xi, Tao', 'Xiong, Jing']","['Luo W', 'Xin Y', 'Zhao X', 'Zhang F', 'Liu C', 'Fan H', 'Xi T', 'Xiong J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9712-6771'],"['Department of Pharmacology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Research Center of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Research Center of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University Affiliated Wuxi Second Hospital, Wuxi, China.', 'Research Center of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory, Nanjing First Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory, Nanjing First Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Research Center of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pregnane X Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Pregnane X Receptor', 'Receptors, Steroid/*biosynthesis/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC5368049,,,,2017/01/28 06:00,2017/10/28 06:00,['2017/01/28 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bph.13731 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2017 Apr;174(8):700-717. doi: 10.1111/bph.13731.

Different strategies have been developed for RBC transfusions. A restrictive transfusion strategy seeks to maintain a lower haemoglobin level (usually between 70 g/L to 90 g/L) with a trigger for transfusion when the haemoglobin drops below 70 g/L), whereas a liberal transfusion strategy aims to maintain a higher haemoglobin (usually between 100 g/L to 120 g/L, with a threshold for transfusion when haemoglobin drops below 100 g/L). In people undergoing surgery or who have been admitted to intensive care a restrictive transfusion strategy has been shown to be safe and in some cases safer than a liberal transfusion strategy. However, it is not known whether it is safe in people with haematological malignancies. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategies for people diagnosed with haematological malignancies treated with intensive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, with or without a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). SEARCH METHODS: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised trials (NRS) in MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1982), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 6), and 10 other databases (including four trial registries) to 15 June 2016. We also searched grey literature and contacted experts in transfusion for additional trials. There was no restriction on language, date or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs and prospective NRS that evaluated a restrictive compared with a liberal RBC transfusion strategy in children or adults with malignant haematological disorders or undergoing HSCT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We identified six studies eligible for inclusion in this review; five RCTs and one NRS. Three completed RCTs (156 participants), one completed NRS (84 participants), and two ongoing RCTs. We identified one additional RCT awaiting classification. The completed studies were conducted between 1997 and 2015 and had a mean follow-up from 31 days to 2 years. One study included children receiving a HSCT (six participants), the other three studies only included adults: 218 participants with acute leukaemia receiving chemotherapy, and 16 with a haematological malignancy receiving a HSCT. The restrictive strategies varied from 70 g/L to 90 g/L. The liberal strategies also varied from 80 g/L to 120 g/L.Based on the GRADE rating methodology the overall quality of the included studies was very low to low across different outcomes. None of the included studies were free from bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains. One of the three RCTs was discontinued early for safety concerns after recruiting only six children, all three participants in the liberal group developed veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Evidence from RCTsA restrictive RBC transfusion policy may make little or no difference to: the number of participants who died within 100 days (two trials, 95 participants (RR: 0.25, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.69, low-quality evidence); the number of participants who experienced any bleeding (two studies, 149 participants; RR:0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18, low-quality evidence), or clinically significant bleeding (two studies, 149 participants, RR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.43, low-quality evidence); the number of participants who required RBC transfusions (three trials; 155 participants: RR: 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05, low-quality evidence); or the length of hospital stay (restrictive median 35.5 days (interquartile range (IQR): 31.2 to 43.8); liberal 36 days (IQR: 29.2 to 44), low-quality evidence).We are uncertain whether the restrictive RBC transfusion strategy: decreases quality of life (one trial, 89 participants, fatigue score: restrictive median 4.8 (IQR 4 to 5.2); liberal median 4.5 (IQR 3.6 to 5) (very low-quality evidence); or reduces the risk of developing any serious infection (one study, 89 participants, RR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.04, very low-quality evidence).A restrictive RBC transfusion policy may reduce the number of RBC transfusions per participant (two trials; 95 participants; mean difference (MD) -3.58, 95% CI -5.66 to -1.49, low-quality evidence). Evidence from NRSWe are uncertain whether the restrictive RBC transfusion strategy: reduces the risk of death within 100 days (one study, 84 participants, restrictive 1 death; liberal 1 death; very low-quality evidence); decreases the risk of clinically significant bleeding (one study, 84 participants, restrictive 3; liberal 8; very low-quality evidence); or decreases the number of RBC transfusions (adjusted for age, sex and acute myeloid leukaemia type geometric mean 1.25; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.47 - data analysis performed by the study authors)No NRS were found that looked at: quality of life; number of participants with any bleeding; serious infection; or length of hospital stay.No studies were found that looked at: adverse transfusion reactions; arterial or venous thromboembolic events; length of intensive care admission; or readmission to hospital. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this review were based on four studies and 240 participants.There is low-quality evidence that a restrictive RBC transfusion policy reduces the number of RBC transfusions per participant. There is low-quality evidence that a restrictive RBC transfusion policy has little or no effect on: mortality at 30 to 100 days, bleeding, or hospital stay. This evidence is mainly based on adults with acute leukaemia who are having chemotherapy. Although, the two ongoing studies (530 participants) are due to be completed by January 2018 and will provide additional information for adults with haematological malignancies, we will not be able to answer this review's primary outcome. If we assume a mortality rate of 3% within 100 days we would need 1492 participants to have a 80% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, an increase in all-cause mortality from 3% to 6%. Further RCTs are required in children.",,"['Estcourt, Lise J', 'Malouf, Reem', 'Trivella, Marialena', 'Fergusson, Dean A', 'Hopewell, Sally', 'Murphy, Michael F']","['Estcourt LJ', 'Malouf R', 'Trivella M', 'Fergusson DA', 'Hopewell S', 'Murphy MF']",,"['Haematology/Transfusion Medicine, NHS Blood and Transplant, Level 2, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, UK, OX3 9BQ.', 'National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU), University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Oxford, UK, OX3 7LF.', 'Centre for Statistics in Medicine, University of Oxford, Botnar Research Centre, Windmill Road, Oxford, UK, OX3 7LD.', 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 501 Smyth Road, Ottawa, ON, Canada, K1H 8L6.', 'Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit, University of Oxford, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Windmill Road, Oxford, Oxfordshire, UK, OX3 7LD.', 'NHS Blood and Transplant; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,['9034-51-9 (Hemoglobin A)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Anemia/blood/etiology/*therapy', 'Child', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/adverse effects/*methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hemoglobin A/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",PMC5298168,,,"['Declarations of Interest Lise Estcourt is partly funded by NIHR Cochrane', 'Programme Grant - Safe and Appropriate Use of Blood Components.

Oridonin is a natural compound with promising antitumor efficacy that can trigger the degradation of oncoproteins; however, the direct cellular targets and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report that oridonin depletes BCR-ABL through chaperon-mediated proteasomal degradation in leukemia. Mechanistically, oridonin poses oxidative stress in cancer cells and directly binds to cysteines of HSF1, leading to the activation of this master regulator of the chaperone system. The resulting induction of HSP70 and ubiquitin proteins and the enhanced binding to CHIP E3 ligase hence target BCR-ABL for ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. Both wild-type and mutant forms of BCR-ABL can be efficiently degraded by oridonin, supporting its efficacy observed in cultured cells as well as mouse tumor xenograft assays with either imatinib-sensitive or -resistant cells. Collectively, our results identify a novel mechanism by which oridonin induces rapid degradation of BCR-ABL as well as a novel pharmaceutical activator of HSF1 that represents a promising treatment for leukemia.",,"['Huang, Huilin', 'Weng, Hengyou', 'Dong, Bowen', 'Zhao, Panpan', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Qu, Lianghu']","['Huang H', 'Weng H', 'Dong B', 'Zhao P', 'Zhou H', 'Qu L']",,"['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0APJ98UCLQ (oridonin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Chaperones/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",PMC5270248,,,['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],2017/01/28 06:00,2018/10/23 06:00,['2017/01/28 06:00'],"['2016/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['srep41525 [pii]', '10.1038/srep41525 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Jan 27;7:41525. doi: 10.1038/srep41525.,20170127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study reveals the selection of antiviral resistance mutations in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in an immunocompromised patient during a 6-month period. The patient was treated with two courses of oseltamivir (5 days and 2 months, respectively), with the first course starting at symptom onset, and subsequently zanamivir (2 months and 10 days, respectively). Respiratory samples were investigated by Sanger and next generation sequencing (NGS) and, for NGS data, low-frequency-variant-detection analysis was performed. Neuraminidase-inhibition tests were conducted for samples isolated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In a sample collected 15 days after the end of the first treatment with oseltamivir (Day 20 post-symptom onset), oseltamivir resistance was detected (mutation H275Y with 60.3% frequency by NGS). Day 149 when the patient had almost completed the second zanamivir treatment, mixes of the following resistance mutations were detected; H275Y(65.1%), I223R(9.2%), and E119G(89.6%), accompanied by additional mutations, showing a more complex viral population in the long-term treated patient. Two samples obtained on Day 151 from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and nasopharyngeal swab, respectively, showed different mutation profiles, with a higher frequency of antiviral resistance mutations in BAL. The results emphasise the importance of timely antiviral resistance testing both for treatment of individual patients as well as for preventive measures to control the development and transmission of antiviral resistant viruses.","['This article is copyright of The Authors, 2017.']","['Trebbien, Ramona', 'Pedersen, Svend Stenvang', 'Vorborg, Kristine', 'Franck, Kristina Traeholt', 'Fischer, Thea Kolsen']","['Trebbien R', 'Pedersen SS', 'Vorborg K', 'Franck KT', 'Fischer TK']",,"['National Influenza Center, Virological Surveillance and Research, Department of Microbiological Diagnostics and Virology, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Odense University hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'National Influenza Center, Virological Surveillance and Research, Department of Microbiological Diagnostics and Virology, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark.', 'Department of Microbiological Diagnostics and Virology, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'National Influenza Center, Virological Surveillance and Research, Department of Microbiological Diagnostics and Virology, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Sweden,Euro Surveill,Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,100887452,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '20O93L6F9H (Oseltamivir)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'L6O3XI777I (Zanamivir)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Denmark', 'Drug Resistance, Viral/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/*drug effects/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Influenza, Human/diagnosis/*drug therapy/virology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Neuraminidase/*genetics', 'Oseltamivir/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Zanamivir/*pharmacology']",PMC5322288,,,,2017/01/28 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2017/01/28 06:00'],"['2016/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.3.30445 [doi]', '30445 [pii]']",ppublish,Euro Surveill. 2017 Jan 19;22(3). pii: 30445. doi: 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.3.30445.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AKR1B1-catalyzed reduction of aldehydes is part of the intracellular inflammatory pathway leading to the activation of NF-kappaB and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. The present study is aimed at determining the inhibition of AKR1B1 brought about by an extract of artichoke leaves (bracts), and the effects of this extract and three participating compounds on the expression of AKR1B1, COX-2, and MMP-2 proteins in THP-1 cells. It seeks to identify the ability of the test substances to modulate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of NF-kappaB in cells and the intracellular oxidant effect of test substances after incubation with LPS. Low concentrations of the extract inhibit the enzyme AKR1B1. After stimulation by LPS, the extract attenuated the activity of NF-kappaB in THP-1 cells, but no changes in the expression of AKR1B1 were recorded. The extract diminished the expression of the inflammation-related enzymes COX-2 and MMP-2, probably by inhibiting the activity of NF-kappaB.

Instead, we studied the use of donor Epstein-Barr virus-specific T-cells (EBV CTL) transduced with a first generation CD19CAR, relying on the endogenous T-cell receptor for proliferation. We conducted a multi-center phase I/II study of donor CD19CAR transduced EBV CTL in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Patients were eligible pre-emptively if they developed molecular relapse (>5 x 10(-4)) post first stem cell transplant (SCT), or prophylactically post second SCT. An initial cohort showed poor expansion/persistence. We therefore investigated EBV-directed vaccination to enhance expansion/persistence. Eleven patients were treated. No CRS, neurotoxicity or graft versus host disease (GVHD) was observed. At 1 month, 5 patients were in CR (4 continuing, 1 de novo), 1 PR, 3 had stable disease and 3 no response. At a median follow-up of 12 months, 10 of 11 have relapsed, 2 are alive with disease and 1 alive in CR 3 years. Although CD19CAR CTL expansion was poor, persistence was enhanced by vaccination. Median persistence was 0 (range: 0-28) days without vaccination compared to 56 (range: 0-221) days with vaccination (P=0.06).

Herein, we demonstrate that CD244, which was initially reported as a key regulator for natural killer cells, is highly expressed on both mouse and human leukemia initiating cells. Upon CD244 knockdown, human leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells have markedly impaired proliferation abilities both in vitro and in vivo Interestingly, the repopulation ability of both mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells is not impaired upon CD244 knockdown. Using an MLL-AF9-induced murine acute myeloid leukemia model, we show that leukemogenesis is dramatically delayed upon CD244 deletion, together with remarkably reduced Mac1(+)/c-Kit(+) leukemia cells (enriched for leukemia initiating cells). Mechanistically, we reveal that CD244 is associated with c-Kit and p27 except for SHP-2 as previously reported. CD244 co-operates with c-Kit to activate SHP-2 signaling to dephosphorylate p27 and maintain its stability to promote leukemia development. Collectively, we provide intriguing evidence that the surface immune molecule CD244 plays an important role in the maintenance of stemness of leukemia initiating cells, but not in hematopoietic stem cells.

HLA-match considered low resolution matching at HLA-A and -B loci and allele-level at HLA-DRB1, the accepted standard for selecting units for double cord blood transplants. Patients', disease, and transplant characteristics were similar in the two groups.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the prognostic role of minimal residual disease detected by polymerase chain reaction or multiparametric flow cytometry before transplant. We identified 19 articles published between January 2005 and June 2016 and extracted hazard ratios for leukemia-free survival, overall survival, and cumulative incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality. Pre-transplant minimal residual disease was associated with worse leukemia-free survival (hazard ratio=2.76 [1.90-4.00]), overall survival (hazard ratio=2.36 [1.73-3.22]), and cumulative incidence of relapse (hazard ratio=3.65 [2.53-5.27]), but not non-relapse mortality (hazard ratio=1.12 [0.81-1.55]). These associations held regardless of detection method, conditioning intensity, and patient age. Adverse cytogenetics was not an independent risk factor for death or relapse. There was more heterogeneity among studies using flow cytometry-based than WT1 polymerase chain reaction-based detection (I(2)=75.1% vs. <0.1% for leukemia-free survival, 67.8% vs. <0.1% for overall survival, and 22.1% vs. <0.1% for cumulative incidence of relapse).

Abexinostat is an orally available hydroxamate-containing histone deacetylase inhibitor that differs from approved inhibitors; its unique pharmacokinetic profile and oral dosing schedule, twice daily four hours apart, allows for continuous exposure at concentrations required to efficiently kill tumor cells. In this phase II study, patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia received oral abexinostat at 80 mg BID for 14 days of a 21-day cycle and continued until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. A total of 100 patients with B-cell malignancies and T-cell lymphomas were enrolled between October 2011 and July 2014. All patients received at least one dose of study drug. Primary reasons for discontinuation included progressive disease (56%) and adverse events (25%). Grade 3 or over adverse events and any serious adverse events were reported in 88% and 73% of patients, respectively. The most frequently reported grade 3 or over treatment-emergent related adverse events were thrombocytopenia (80%), neutropenia (27%), and anemia (12%). Among the 87 patients evaluable for efficacy, overall response rate was 28% (complete response 5%), with highest responses observed in patients with follicular lymphoma (overall response rate 56%), T-cell lymphoma (overall response rate 40%), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (overall response rate 31%). Further investigation of the safety and efficacy of abexinostat in follicular lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma implementing a less dose-intense week-on-week-off schedule is warranted.

A French Innovative Leukemia Organization study.,746-754,10.3324/haematol.2016.153189 [doi],"The underlying in vivo mechanisms of rituximab action remain incompletely understood in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Recent data suggest that circulating micro-ribonucleic acids correlate with chronic lymphocytic leukemia progression and response to rituximab. Our study aimed at identifying circulating micro-ribonucleic acids that predict response to rituximab monotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Using a hierarchical clustering of micro-ribonucleic acid expression profiles discriminating 10 untreated patients with low or high lymphocyte counts, we found 26 micro-ribonucleic acids significantly deregulated. Using individual real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, the expression levels of micro-ribonucleic acids representative of these two clusters were further validated in a larger cohort (n=61). MiR-125b and miR-532-3p were inversely correlated with rituximab-induced lymphodepletion (P=0.020 and P=0.001, respectively) and with the CD20 expression on CD19(+) cells (P=0.0007 and P<0.0001, respectively). In silico analyses of genes putatively targeted by both micro-ribonucleic acids revealed a central role of the interleukin-10 pathway and CD20 (MS4A1) family members. Interestingly, both micro-ribonucleic acids were negatively correlated with MS4A1 expression, while they were positively correlated with MS4A3 and MSA47 Our results identify novel circulating predictive biomarkers for rituximab-mediated lymphodepletion efficacy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and suggest a novel molecular mechanism responsible for the rituximab mode of action that bridges miR-125b and miR-532-3p and CD20 family members.

The mechanism by which tumor cells evoke the expansion of MDSCs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been well described. We have demonstrated that patients with AML exhibit increased presence of MDSCs in their peripheral blood, in comparison with normal controls. Cytogenetic studies demonstrated that MDSCs in patients with AML may be derived from leukemic or apparently normal progenitors. Engraftment of C57BL/6 mice with TIB-49 AML led to an expansion of CD11b(+) Gr1(+) MDSCs in bone marrow and spleen. Coculture of the AML cell lines MOLM-4, THP-1 or primary AML cells with donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells elicited a cell contact-dependent expansion of MDSCs. MDSCs were suppressive of autologous T-cell responses as evidenced by reduced T-cell proliferation and a switch from a Th1 to a Th2 phenotype. We hypothesized that the expansion of MDSCs in AML is accomplished by tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Using tracking studies, we demonstrated that AML EVs are taken-up myeloid progenitor cells, resulting in the selective proliferation of MDSCs in comparison with functionally competent antigen-presenting cells. The MUC1 oncoprotein was subsequently identified as the critical driver of EV-mediated MDSC expansion. MUC1 induces increased expression of c-myc in EVs that induces proliferation in the target MDSC population via downstream effects on cell cycle proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the microRNA miR34a acts as the regulatory mechanism by which MUC1 drives c-myc expression in AML cells and EVs.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Pyzer, Athalia Rachel', 'Stroopinsky, Dina', 'Rajabi, Hasan', 'Washington, Abigail', 'Tagde, Ashujit', 'Coll, Maxwell', 'Fung, Jacqueline', 'Bryant, Mary Paty', 'Cole, Leandra', 'Palmer, Kristen', 'Somaiya, Poorvi', 'Karp Leaf, Rebecca', 'Nahas, Myrna', 'Apel, Arie', 'Jain, Salvia', 'McMasters, Malgorzata', 'Mendez, Lourdes', 'Levine, James', 'Joyce, Robin', 'Arnason, Jon', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Kufe, Donald', 'Rosenblatt, Jacalyn', 'Avigan, David']","['Pyzer AR', 'Stroopinsky D', 'Rajabi H', 'Washington A', 'Tagde A', 'Coll M', 'Fung J', 'Bryant MP', 'Cole L', 'Palmer K', 'Somaiya P', 'Karp Leaf R', 'Nahas M', 'Apel A', 'Jain S', 'McMasters M', 'Mendez L', 'Levine J', 'Joyce R', 'Arnason J', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Kufe D', 'Rosenblatt J', 'Avigan D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0506-1887'],"['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Cancer Genetics Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Cancer Genetics Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Extracellular Vesicles/pathology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/physiology', 'Mucin-1/*physiology', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis']",PMC5813734,,,,2017/01/28 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/01/28 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33538-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-07-730614 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Mar 30;129(13):1791-1801. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-07-730614.

It has been hypothesized that pluripotent or multipotent stem cells might result in increased SCNT efficacy as these cells are closer than somatic cells to the epigenetic state found in the blastomeres and therefore need less reprogramming. Our group has worked with porcine SCNT during the last 20 years and here we describe our experience with SCNT of 3 different stem cell lines. The porcine stem cells used were: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) created by lentiviral doxycycline-dependent reprogramming and cultered with a GSK3beta- and MEK-inhibitor (2i) and leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) (2i LIF DOX-iPSCs), iPSCs created by a plasmid-based reprogramming and cultured with 2i and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (2i FGF Pl-iPSCs) and embryonic germ cells (EGCs), which have earlier been characterized as being multipotent. The SCNT efficiencies of these stem cell lines were compared with that of the two fibroblast cell lines from which the iPSC lines were derived. The blastocyst rates for the 2i LIF DOX-iPSCs were 14.7%, for the 2i FGF Pl-iPSC 10.1%, and for the EGCs 34.5% compared with the fibroblast lines yielding 36.7% and 25.2%. The fibroblast- and EGC-derived embryos were used for embryo transfer and produced live offspring at similar low rates of efficiency (3.2 and 4.0%, respectively) and with several instances of malformations. In conclusion, potentially pluripotent porcine stem cells resulted in lower rates of embryonic development upon SCNT than multipotent stem cells and differentiated somatic cells.",['Copyright A(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency and prognostic significance of copy number alterations (CNA) in genes involved in lymphoid differentiation, cell cycle and tumor suppression in adult patients with B-ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification the genetic material from bone marrow at diagnosis from 25 adult B-ALL patients treated with rituximab and specific chemotherapy. RESULTS: The most frequent CNA were alterations in the 14q32.33 region (11 cases, 44%) followed by alterations in the cell cycle regulator genes CDKN2A/B and RB1 (16%). No correlation between the presence of specific CNA and the clinical-biologic features or the response to therapy was found. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of CNA in the 14q32.33 region, CDKN2A/B and RB1 found in our study could contribute to the aggressiveness and invasiveness of mature B-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Most of patients presenting with inoperable gastric cancers rely on systemic chemotherapy for prolongation of survival. Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the important agents against gastric cancer. Acquired DOX-resistance severely impedes the chemotherapeutic effect, invariably leading to poor prognosis. Resveratrol (RES) as a kind of phytoalexin has demonstrated anti-tumor functions in breast cancer and myeloid leukemia, but its function and mechanism are still unknown in gastric cancer treatment. METHODS: CCK8 assay was used to detect the cytotoxicity of DOX and RES to gastric cancer cells. DOX-resistant subclone cell line (SGC7901/DOX) was derived from SGC7901 cells exposed to stepwise increasing concentrations of DOX treatment. We measured the migratory capabilities of SGC7901/DOX cells by Cell scratch test and Transwell assay. SGC7901/DOX cells were treated with DOX, RES, neither or both. Then we analyzed cell survival by CCK8 assay, colony formation by Colony-forming assay, cell apoptosis by Annexin-V-FITC and PI dual staining assay and cell migration by Cell scratch test and Transwell assay. Western blotting was conducted to detect the protein expressions of PTEN/Akt signaling pathway and EMT-related markers. Immunofluorescence was performed to confirm the EMT-related markers expressions. The xenograft model was used to assess the effect of DOX and RES in vivo. The key molecules associated with proliferation, apoptosis and EMT were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tumor specimens. RESULTS: SGC7901/DOX cells acquired drug resistance and enhancive migratory capability. RES enabled SGC7901/DOX cells to regain DOX sensitivity, mitigated the aggressive biological features, promoted cell apoptosis in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that SGC7901/DOX cells underwent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which was induced by Akt activation, and through activating PTEN, RES inhibited the Akt pathway, and then achieved the reversion of EMT. CONCLUSION: RES serves as a novel solution to reverse the DOX-resistance of gastric cancer via preventing EMT by modulating PTEN/Akt signaling pathway. DOX-RES combined treatment provides a promising future for gastric cancer patients to postpone drug resistance and prolong survival.",,"['Xu, Jiahui', 'Liu, Deying', 'Niu, Huilin', 'Zhu, Guifang', 'Xu, Yangwei', 'Ye, Danli', 'Li, Jian', 'Zhang, Qingling']","['Xu J', 'Liu D', 'Niu H', 'Zhu G', 'Xu Y', 'Ye D', 'Li J', 'Zhang Q']",,"['Nanfang Hospital/First Clinical Medical School, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Nanfang Hospital/First Clinical Medical School, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China. zqllc8@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China. zqllc8@126.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stilbenes/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5270306,['NOTNLM'],"['*Doxorubicin', '*Drug resistance', '*EMT', '*PTEN/Akt', '*Resveratrol']",,2017/01/28 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2017/01/28 06:00'],"['2016/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-016-0487-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-016-0487-8 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2017 Jan 26;36(1):19. doi: 10.1186/s13046-016-0487-8.,20170126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and Methods: A total of 80 de novo NHL patients, 64 with B-cell lymphomas 80% , (follicular cell lymphoma (FCL) in 32, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) in 12, and diffuse large cell lymphoma in 20) and 16 with T-cell lymphomas (20%) all diagnosed as T-Lymphoblastic lymphomas, were evaluated before and after therapy. For comparison, 25 age and sex matched BM donors, were included as a control group. BMTB material and BM aspirates were taken for morphological assessment of stromal cells, the plasma of these samples being examined for TNFalpha and L-selectin by ELISA, and fibronectin by radial immunodiffusion (RID). Results: BM stromal cells comprising reticular macrophages and fibroblasts were elevated in 53.3% of NHL cases at diagnosis, while BM fibronectin levels were decreased and BM TNFalpha and L-selectin were higher than in controls (p<0.05). In NHL cases, elevated values of BM TNFalpha and BM L-selectin were associated with signs of aggressive disease, including >1 extra nodal sites, detectable B symptoms, high grade, BM and CNS invasion, and a high International prognostic index (IPI) (p<0.05).

Categorization of patients into risk stratified groups (favorable, intermediate and adverse) according to cytogenetic findings can serve as a valuable independent prognostic factor. Method and Material: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted based on the patient records of newly diagnosed non-M3 AML young adult cases undergoing standard 3+7 i.e, Daunorubicin and Ara-C (DA) as remission induction chemotherapy. Diagnostic cytogenetic analysis reports were analyzed to classify the patients into risk stratified groups according to South West Oncology Group criteria and prognostic significance was measured with reference to achievement of haematological remission after 1st induction chemotherapy. Results: A normal karyotype was commonly expressed, found in 47.2% of patients, while 65% (n=39) appeared to have intermediate risk cytogenetics, and 13.3% (n=8) adverse or unclassified findings. Favourable cytogenetics was least frequent in the patient cohort, accounting for only 8.3 % (n=5).The impact of cytogenetic risk groups on achievement of haematological remission was evaluated by applying Pearson Chi-square, and was found to be non-significant (df=12, p=0.256) but when the outcomes of favourable risk groups with intermediate, adverse and unclassified findings compared, results were highly significant (df=6, p=0.000) for each comparison. In patients of the favourable cytogenetic risk group, HR?? was reported in 40% (n=2/5), as compared to 62.2% (n=23/37) in the intermediate cytogenetic risk group, 57.1% (n=4/7) in the adverse cytogenetic risk group and 28.6% (n=2/7) in hte unclassified cytogenetic risk group. Conclusion: Cytogenetic risk stratification for AML cases following criteria provided by international guidelines did not produce conclusive results in our Pakistani patients. However, we cannot preclude an importance as the literature clearly supports the use of pretreatment karyotyping analysis as a significant predictive marker for clinical outcomes. The apparent differences between Pakistani and Western studies indicate an urgent need to develop risk stratification guidelines according to the specific cytogenetic makeup of South Asian populations.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],"['Zehra, Samreen', 'Najam, Rahela', 'Farzana, Tasneem', 'Shamsi, Tahir']","['Zehra S', 'Najam R', 'Farzana T', 'Shamsi T']",,"['National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, |Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy,University of Karachi, Pakistan.

AID has previously been shown to preferentially deaminate WRC (W = A/T, R = A/G) hotspots. WGCW sites, which contain an overlapping WRC hotspot on both DNA strands, mutate at much higher frequency than single hotspots. Human Ig heavy chain (IGHV) genes differ in terms of WGCW numbers, ranging from 4 for IGHV3-48*03 to as many as 12 in IGHV1-69*01. An absence of V-region mutations in CLL patients (""IGHV unmutated"", or U-CLL) is associated with a poorer prognosis compared to ""IGHV mutated"" (M-CLL) patients. The reasons for this difference are still unclear, but it has been noted that particular IGHV genes associate with U-CLL vs M-CLL. For example, patients with IGHV1-69 clones tend to be U-CLL with a poor prognosis, whereas patients with IGHV3-30 tend to be M-CLL and have a better prognosis. Another distinctive feature of CLL is that ~30% of (mostly poor prognosis) patients can be classified into ""stereotyped"" subsets, each defined by HCDR3 similarity, suggesting selection, possibly for a self-antigen. We analyzed >1000 IGHV genes from CLL patients and found a highly significant statistical relationship between the number of WGCW hotspots in the germline V-region and the observed mutation frequency in patients. However, paradoxically, this correlation was inverse, with V-regions with more WGCW hotspots being less likely to be mutated, i.e., more likely to be U-CLL. The number of WGCW hotspots in particular, are more strongly correlated with mutation frequency than either non-overlapping (WRC) hotspots or more general models of mutability derived from somatic hypermutation data. Furthermore, this correlation is not observed in sequences from the B cell repertoires of normal individuals and those with autoimmune diseases.",,"['Yuan, Chaohui', 'Chu, Charles C', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Bagnara, Davide', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'MacCarthy, Thomas']","['Yuan C', 'Chu CC', 'Yan XJ', 'Bagnara D', 'Chiorazzi N', 'MacCarthy T']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0025-9285'],"['Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Stony Brook University, NY, United States of America.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, United States of America.', 'Departments of Medicine and Molecular Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, United States of America.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, United States of America.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, United States of America.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, United States of America.', 'Departments of Medicine and Molecular Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, United States of America.', 'Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Stony Brook University, NY, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Autoimmune Diseases/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Loci', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation Rate', 'Prognosis']",PMC5268644,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2017/01/27 06:00,2017/08/09 06:00,['2017/01/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0167602 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-34141 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jan 26;12(1):e0167602. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0167602. eCollection 2017.,20170126,,['R01 GM111741/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed that the growth-suppressive effect is mediated, at least partially, by G1 arrest as a result of upregulated p21.

OBJECTIVES: To (a) estimate the effect of more frequent qPCR tests on health care resource utilization (HRU) and associated costs, including direct (effect of qPCR test frequency on HRU) and indirect (through TKI adherence) effects, and (b) develop an economic model applicable to multiple clinical practice scenarios. METHODS: Adult patients newly diagnosed with CML who started TKI firstline therapy were identified from U.S. administrative claims data (2010-2015). TKI adherence (medication possession ratio [MPR]), number of inpatient days, emergency room (ER) visits, outpatient service days, and mean costs per HRU event were measured during the first year of CML treatment. Direct and indirect effects of qPCR test frequency were estimated using multivariate regression models. Subsequently, an economic model was developed to assess the overall effect of varying qPCR test frequency on HRU and associated costs during the first year of CML treatment under different clinical practice scenarios; the scenario reported is the increase from 1 to 2 qPCR tests. RESULTS: Of the 1,431 patients included, 36% had no qPCR tests, the average qPCR test frequency was 1.6, and the average MPR was 0.86 during the first year of CML treatment. The direct effect of increasing qPCR test frequency by 1 was associated with 13.0% fewer inpatient days (adjusted incidence rate ratio [adjusted IRR] = 0.87; P = 0.010); 8.3% fewer ER visits (adjusted IRR = 0.92; P = 0.043); and 3.0% more outpatient service days (adjusted IRR = 1.03; P = 0.002). Each increase of 1 test was associated with an increase in TKI adherence by 2.2 percentage points (adjusted MPR difference = 0.022; P < 0.001). When considering the indirect effect of qPCR test frequency through TKI adherence, an increase of 1 qPCR test combined with an increase in TKI adherence by 2.2 percentage points was associated with a greater reduction of inpatient days from 13.0% to 15.2%, ER visits from 8.3% to 8.6%, and a smaller increase of outpatient service days from 3.0% to 2.6%. Based on the economic model, an increase from 1 to 2 qPCR tests, considering the increase in TKI adherence, was associated with a reduction of 0.87 (95% CI = -1.49, -0.18) inpatient days and 0.06 (95% CI = -0.12, 0.05) ER visits, an increase of 0.98 (95% CI = 0.25, 1.60) outpatient service days and a cost savings of $2,918 (95% CI = -5,213, -349) per patient per year. CONCLUSIONS: Closer alignment with the monitoring guidelines' recommended qPCR test frequency and better adherence to TKIs were associated with lower HRU and medical service costs. Managed care initiatives to increase qPCR test frequency and TKI adherence might benefit from an enhanced reduction because of the interaction between both factors.

However, it has been reported that As(2)O(3) resistant patients are frequently found in relapsed APL after consolidation therapy, which is due to the point mutations in B-box type 2 motifs of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene. In the present study, we for the first time establish whether organic arsenic species phenylarsine oxide (PAO) could induce the mutant PML-IV (A216V) protein solubility changes and degradation. Here, three different PML protein variants (i.e., PML-IV, PML-V and mutant PML-A216V) were overexpressed in HEK293T cells and then exposed to PAO in time- and dose-dependent manners. Interestingly, PAO is found to have potential effect on induction of mutant PML-IV (A216V) protein solubility changes and degradation, but no appreciable effects were found following exposure to high concentrations of iAs(III), dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)) and adriamycin (doxorubicin), even though they cause cell death.

This agent can be colonized in skin, lungs and intestines, and it can cause major opportunistic infections. Invasive systemic infections due to S.capitata have been reported in immunosuppressed patients. In this report, two patients with invasive S.capitata infections detected during the course of persistent neutropenic fever in acute leukemia, were presented. In both cases empirical caspofungin was added to the treatment, as no response was obtained by board-spectrum antibacterial therapy in neutropenic fever. In the first patient, there were no significant findings except the chronic inflammation observed in the biopsies which was performed for the symptoms of lymphadenitis, myositis, and hepatosplenic candidiasis. While persistent fever was on going, S.capitata was isolated from the blood and catheter cultures. There was no response after catheter removing and the introduction of amphotericin B and voriconazole therapy, therefore allogeneic stem cell transplantation plan for the second time for bone marrow aplasia was taken an earlier time. However, the patient died due to progressive pericardial and pleural effusion and multiorgan failure, although an afebrile process after stem cell transplantation could be obtained. Similarly the second patient had persistent fever despite empirical caspofungin treatment. The additional symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain and subileus have indicated an intraabdominal infection. During the follow up, S.capitata was isolated from the blood and catheter cultures. Catheter was removed and amphotericin B was initiated. No response was obtained, and voriconazole was added to treatment. Despite of an afebrile and culture-negative period, the patient died as a result of Acinetobacter sepsis and multiorgan failure. Minimal inhibitory concentration values for both of the Saprochete strains were found as 0.25 microg/ml for amfoterisin B, 1 microg/ml for flukonazol, 0.125 microg/ml for vorikonazol and 0.25 microg/ml for itrakonazol. Virulence model was created by injecting the isolates to the Galleria mellonella larvae, and the life cycle of the larvae were determined. The observation revealed that the infected larvae began to die on the second day and there was no live larvae remained on the eleventh day. In conclusion, S.capitata should be considered as an infection agent with high mortality risk in the neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies, especially in the presence of persistent fever during the use of caspofungin.",,"['Aydin Kaynar, Lale', 'Ozkurt, Zubeyde Nur', 'Ulkuden, Burcu', 'Guzel Tunccan, Ozlem', 'Aygencel, Gulbin', 'Akyurek, Nalan', 'Kalkanci, Ayse']","['Aydin Kaynar L', 'Ozkurt ZN', 'Ulkuden B', 'Guzel Tunccan O', 'Aygencel G', 'Akyurek N', 'Kalkanci A']",,"['Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey. zubeydenurozkurt@yahoo.com.']",['tur'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Turkey,Mikrobiyol Bul,Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,7503830,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Caspofungin', 'Catheter-Related Infections/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Echinocandins/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fungemia/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lipopeptides/therapeutic use', 'Moths/microbiology', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Saccharomycetales/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Voriconazole/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2017/01/27 06:00,2017/09/01 06:00,['2017/01/27 06:00'],"['2017/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mikrobiyol Bul. 2016 Oct;50(4):613-620.,,,,Hematolojik maligniteli hastalarda nadir ve mortal bir enfeksiyon etkeni: Saprochaete capitata.,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to recognize normal thymocyte precursors by flow cytometry to differentiate them from T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: A 3-year-old boy status 2 years postallogenic cardiac transplant underwent adenoidectomy to exclude post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Microscopic, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometry analyses of the adenoid were performed. RESULTS: By flow cytometry, a population of CD45+(dim)/CD7+(bright)/CD3- cells were observed at 1.0% of lymphocytes. These cells expressed CD10, partial CD34 and exhibited acquisition of CD4 followed by CD8. Within the brighter CD45+ lymphocytes, a population of CD3-/CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes and a similarly sized population of CD4+/CD8+ cells exhibiting acquisition of low-density CD3 were identified. By immunostaining, clusters of TdT+/CD1a+/CD4+/CD8+ T-cells were identified in the interfollicular areas. Compared to normal thymus, thymocytes in the adenoid tissue lacked the classic CD4xCD8 winged differentiation profile but showed a normal early precursor pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Thymocytes in adenoid show a similar differentiation pattern to thymus and thymoma. However, the classic winged pattern of common thymocyte differentiation may not be readily apparent in thymocytes differentiating outside of the thymus. Recognition of the early thymocyte precursor antigen acquisition profile can be crucial to correct interpretation.

The extraordinary invasion of human GBM into adjacent normal brain tissues contributes to treatment failure. However, the mechanisms that control this process remain poorly understood. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs are strongly implicated in the migration and invasion of GBM. In this study, we found that microRNA-98 (miR-98) was markedly downregulated in human glioma tissues and cell lines. Functional experiments indicated that restored expression of miR-98 attenuated glioma cell invasion and migration, whereas depletion of miR-98 promoted glioma cell invasion and migration. Subsequent investigation showed that pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3), an important transcription factor that controls tumor invasion, was a direct and functional target of miR-98 in GBM cells. Consistently, an orthotopic mouse model also demonstrated the suppressive effects of miR-98 overexpression on tumor invasion and PBX3 expression. Silencing of PBX3 using small interfering RNA inhibited the migratory and invasive capacities of glioma cells, whereas reintroduction of PBX3 into glioma cells reversed the anti-invasive function of miR-98. Furthermore, depletion of PBX3 phenocopied the effects of miR-98 overexpression in vivo. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results showed that miR-98 was negatively correlated with PBX3 expression in 24 glioma tissues. Thus, we propose that PBX3 modulation by miR-98 has an important role in regulating GBM invasion and may serve as therapeutic target for GBM.",,"['Xu, Xiupeng', 'Bao, Zhongyuan', 'Liu, Yinlong', 'Ji, Jing', 'Liu, Ning']","['Xu X', 'Bao Z', 'Liu Y', 'Ji J', 'Liu N']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5206-6501'],"['Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. jijing@njmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. neurosurgery1958@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Mol Neurobiol,Cellular and molecular neurobiology,8200709,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MIRN98 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Targeting/*methods', 'Glioma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Glioma', 'Invasion', 'Migration', 'PBX3', 'miR-98']",,2017/01/27 06:00,2018/07/14 06:00,['2017/01/27 06:00'],"['2016/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10571-017-0466-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s10571-017-0466-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Neurobiol. 2017 Nov;37(8):1359-1371. doi: 10.1007/s10571-017-0466-4.

These mutations result in a neomorphic enzyme specificity which leads to a dramatic increase of intracellular D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in tumor cells. Therefore, mutant IDH1 protein is a highly attractive target for inhibitory drugs. Here, we describe the development and properties of BAY 1436032, a pan-inhibitor of IDH1 protein with different codon 132 mutations. BAY 1436032 strongly reduces 2-HG levels in cells carrying IDH1-R132H, -R132C, -R132G, -R132S and -R132L mutations. Cells not carrying IDH mutations were unaffected. BAY 1436032 did not exhibit toxicity in vitro or in vivo. The pharmacokinetic properties of BAY 1436032 allow for oral administration. In two independent experiments, BAY 1436032 has been shown to significantly prolong survival of mice intracerebrally transplanted with human astrocytoma carrying the IDH1R132H mutation.

This model describes the proliferation and differentiation of leukemic stem cells in the bone marrow and the effect of the drug Imatinib on these cells. We first simplify the PDE model by noting that most of the dynamics occurs in a subspace of the original 2D state space. Then we determine the dominant eigenvalue of the corresponding linearized system that controls the long-term behavior of solutions. We mathematically show a non-monotonous dependence of the dominant eigenvalue with respect to treatment dose, with the existence of a unique minimal negative eigenvalue. In terms of CML treatment, this shows that there is a unique dose that maximizes the decay rate of the CML tumor load over long time scales. Moreover this unique dose is lower than the dose that maximizes the initial tumor load decay. Numerical simulations of the full model confirm that this phenomenon is not an artifact of the simplification. Therefore, while optimal asymptotic dosage might not be the best one at short time scales, our results raise interesting perspectives in terms of strategies for achieving and improving long-term deep response.",,"['Besse, Apollos', 'Lepoutre, Thomas', 'Bernard, Samuel']","['Besse A', 'Lepoutre T', 'Bernard S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3143-304X'],"['Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5208, Institut Camille Jordan, 43 blvd. du 11 novembre 1918, F-69622, Villeurbanne cedex, France. apollos.besse@inria.fr.', 'INRIA, Villeurbanne, France. apollos.besse@inria.fr.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5208, Institut Camille Jordan, 43 blvd. du 11 novembre 1918, F-69622, Villeurbanne cedex, France.', 'INRIA, Villeurbanne, France.', 'Univ Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5208, Institut Camille Jordan, 43 blvd. du 11 novembre 1918, F-69622, Villeurbanne cedex, France.', 'INRIA, Villeurbanne, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Math Biol,Journal of mathematical biology,7502105,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', '*Models, Biological', 'Time']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Dominant eigenvalue', '*Renewal model', '*Structured population dynamic']",,2017/01/27 06:00,2017/12/08 06:00,['2017/01/27 06:00'],"['2015/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00285-017-1098-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00285-017-1098-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Math Biol. 2017 Sep;75(3):733-758. doi: 10.1007/s00285-017-1098-5.

Resistance to leptin in the ARC is an important component of the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Recently, we showed that Endospanin1 (Endo1) is a negative regulator of the leptin receptor (OBR) that interacts with OBR and retains the receptor inside the cell, leading to a decreased activation of the anorectic STAT3 pathway. Endo1 is up-regulated in the ARC of high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, and its silencing in the ARC of lean and obese mice prevents and reverses the development of obesity. OBJECTIVE: Herein we investigated whether decreased Endo1 expression in the hypothalamic ARC, associated with reduced obesity, could also ameliorate glucose homeostasis accordingly. METHODS: We studied glucose homeostasis in lean or obese mice silenced for Endo1 in the ARC via stereotactic injection of shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors. RESULTS: We observed that despite being leaner, Endo1-silenced mice showed impaired glucose homeostasis on HFD. Mechanistically, we show that Endo1 interacts with p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, and mediates leptin-induced PI3K activation.

The numbers and activity of natural killer (NK) and T-regulatory cells can be increased post-transplantation by exposure to interleukin-2 (IL-2). We tested whether administering low-dose IL-2 would decrease leukemia relapse while reducing cGVHD after allotransplantation. This controlled, open-label randomized trial included 90 recipients of allotransplants. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive or not receive low-dose IL-2 during the early post-transplantation period. Patients in the IL-2 arm received a subcutaneous injection of low-dose IL-2 (1x10(6) U/d) on day 60 after allo-HSCT. IL-2 was administered daily for 14 d followed by a 14-d hiatus. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of leukemia relapse (CIR). Three-year CIRs for the IL-2 arm and control arm were 23% (range 16-30%) and 11% (range 6-15%; p = 0.20), respectively. Minimal residual disease-positive (MRD+) tests were more common in the IL-2 arm compared to the control arm (36% [range 29-44%] vs. 15% [range 10-20%], p = 0.03). The cumulative incidence of moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was lower in the IL-2 arm compared to the control arm (33% [range 26-39%] vs. 57% [range 49-64%), p = 0.02). Therefore, the 3-y GVHD-free and GVHD progression-free survival (GPFS) rates were significantly higher in the IL-2 arm compared to the control arm (47% [range 39-55%] vs. 31% [range 25-38%], p = 0.048). Blood Tregs, NK cells, and NK-cell cytotoxicity were increased in subjects in the IL-2 arm between 3 mo and 6 mo post-transplantation.

The refractory state of monocytes and T-cell exhaustion in patients with CLL could explain the morbidity and mortality reported in these patients. We studied the effect of ibrutinib on the immune response of four relapsed patients with CLL during the first treatment cycle. We observed the ability to recover the standard response against bacterial stimulus in CD14(+) cells, improving levels of phospho-Erk1/2 and antigen presentation. Meanwhile, ibrutinib drove Th1-selective pressure in T lymphocytes, thus, reducing the PD-1 and PDL-1 expression. Our data suggest the impact of BTK inhibition along with immunomodulation on the innate immune response and a switch to the specific adaptive immune response, which might help to decrease infectious complications.

The aim of the study was to examine the association between the scavenged activity of AsA and the biological anticancer effect of hydroxyl (OH) radicals generated by X-ray irradiation. Cell survival, DNA fragmentation of human leukemia HL60 cells and the amount of OH radicals were investigated following X-ray irradiation and AsA treatment. The number of living cells decreased, and DNA fragmentation increased at AsA concentrations >1 mM. Electron spin resonance spectra revealed that X-ray irradiation generated OH radicals, which were scavenged by AsA at concentrations >75 microM.

Deregulations of lysine methyltransferases and demethylases have been frequently observed in human cancers. The SET and MYND domain containing protein 3 (SMYD3) is a novel histone lysine methyltransferase and it functions by regulating chromatin during the development of myocardial and skeletal muscle. It has been recently unveiled to play significant roles in human cancer genesis and progression via regulating various key cancer-associated genes and pathways and promoting cell proliferation and migration. Upregulation of SMYD3 expression is present in multiple cancer types, suggesting it as a potential prognostic marker. Herein the structure, substrates and targets of SMYD3, and its effects on initiation, invasion and metastasis of diverse tumors (e.g., esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia) are systematically reviewed, providing clues for the development of novel SMYD3-specific personalized anti-cancer therapy.

The antiproliferative activity of isoimperatorin against SGC-7901 cells was evaluated using an MTT assay, and the mechanisms were investigated using flow cytometry and western blot assays, which were used to determine the apoptotic rate and expression levels of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis-associated proteins, including Survivin, myeloid leukemia cell-1 (Mcl-1), B cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl), B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac), Bcl-2-associated X factor (Bax), cleaved (c)-caspase-3 and c-caspase-9 in SGC-7901 cells. Additionally, a xenograft assay was used to confirm whether isoimperatorin had an inhibitory effect on SGC-7901 cell-induced tumors in vivo. The results of the MTT assay suggested that isoimperatorin significantly inhibited the proliferation of SGC-7901 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the half maximal inhibitory concentration was 18.75 microg/ml. The results of the flow cytometric analysis indicated that, following treatment with isoimperatorin, the apoptotic rate of SGC-7901 cells was significantly increased, compared with that of cells in the control group. The results of the western blot analysis indicated that, following treatment with isoimperatorin, the expression levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax, c-caspase-3 and c-caspase-9, were significantly increased and the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Survivin and Bcl-2, were significantly reduced, compared with the control group. No alterations in expression were found in the other apoptosis-associated proteins, including Mcl-1, Bcl-xl and Smac. The results of the xenograft assay indicated that isoimperatorin significantly inhibited the growth of SGC-7901 cell-induced tumor in vivo by increasing the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, c-caspase-3 and c-caspase-9) and reducing the expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (Survivin and Bcl-2) without adverse effects on the increasing body weight of nude mice.

The expression levels of IL-7Ralpha and YB-1 were higher in relapsed vs. diagnostic samples of primary BCP ALL; however, co-expression was also observed in a minor BCP cell population in samples from healthy donors. Functional crosstalk between YB-1 and IL-7R was detected: Overexpression of YB-1 increased surface levels of IL-7R in B cells, and the stimulation of BCP ALL cell lines and primary samples by IL-7 activated YB-1 by phosphorylation at S102 in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent and MEK1/2-dependent manner. Targeted knockdown of YB-1 reduced IL-7-mediated protection against rapamycin, and an inhibitor of MEK1/2 potentiated rapamycin-mediated killing in the presence of IL-7.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors play important roles in the regulation of angiogenesis during physiological and pathological processes. It is thought that AML cells have an autocrine VEGF pathway that contributes to the development and progression of AML. In addition, growing evidence has suggested that numerous microRNAs are involved in AML. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between VEGF dysregulation and microRNA profiles in AML cells and patients. VEGF-overexpressing and VEGF-knockdown leukemia cells were constructed and changes in the patterns of microRNA expression were analyzed using a microRNA array. Subsequently, mononuclear cells from the blood of patients with AML showing high or low expression levels of VEGF were obtained and were used to assess the patterns of microRNA expression by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results of the present study suggested that downregulation of VEGF markedly altered the profile of microRNAs in AML cells, while upregulation of VEGF did not. Examination of clinical samples from patients with AML showed that several microRNAs were closely associated with the expression level of VEGF, including miR-20a, miR-93, miR-16-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-124-5p and miR-17-3p.

In this descriptive/cross-sectional study, the prevalence, sero-prevalence, and risk factors for bloodborne tumor viruses including HTLV-I, HBV, HCV, and KSHV were evaluated among inmates of two central prisons in the northeast of Iran. METHODS: Blood samples of 1114 inmates were analyzed for the presence of anti HTLV-I, KSHV, and HCV antibodies and HBsAg by ELISA. PCR tests were performed to confirm the presence of these viruses in plasma and identify the current infections. RESULTS: The sero-prevalence of HCV, HBV, HTLV-I, and KSHV was 24.5%, 4.2%, 3.4%, and 3.2% and the prevalence of HCV, HBV, HTLV-I, and KSHV was 19.1%, 2.1%, 2%, and 3%, respectively. HCV infection was significantly associated with history of imprisonment, tobacco consumption, alcohol consumption, intravenous drug use, length of imprisonment, and type of crime committed. Thirty one (2.8%) prisoners had HCV-KSHV co-infection, 16 (1.5%) had HCV-HTLV-I co-infection, and 14 (1.3%) had HBV-HCV co-infection. Triple co-infection was observed in seven cases and one case had four infections concomitantly. CONCLUSIONS: This epidemiological study indicated different rates and transmission risks for these viruses. HCV was the most contagious viral infection and HTLV-I was the weakest in the prisoners. Apart from KSHV infection which its prevalence was as twice as in the general population, the prevalence of HBV and HTLV-I in prisoners was nearly in ranges of the general population.",,"['Khajedaluee, Mohammad', 'Babaei, Ali', 'Vakili, Rosita', 'Valizade, Narges', 'Homaei Shandiz, Fateme', 'Alavian, Seyed Moayed', 'Seyed Nozadi, Mohsen', 'Jazayeri, Seyed Mohammad', 'Hassannia, Tahereh']","['Khajedaluee M', 'Babaei A', 'Vakili R', 'Valizade N', 'Homaei Shandiz F', 'Alavian SM', 'Seyed Nozadi M', 'Jazayeri SM', 'Hassannia T']",,"['Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, IR Iran.', 'University of Applied Science and Technology, Mashhad Branch Region 6, (Prison Organization), Mashhad, IR Iran.', 'Center of Pathological and Medical Diagnostic Services, Iranian Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (ACECR), Mashhad Branch, Mashhad, IR Iran.', 'Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, IR Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, IR Iran.', 'Baqiyatallah Research Center for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases (BRCGL), Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IR Iran; Middle East Liver Diseases (MELD) Center, Tehran, IR Iran.', 'Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, IR Iran.', 'Hepatitis B Molecular Laboratory, Department of Virology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IR Iran.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Arash Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IR Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Hepat Mon,Hepatitis monthly,101277874,,,,PMC5237471,['NOTNLM'],"['Epidemiology', 'Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)', 'Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)', 'Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type I (HTLV-I)', ""Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpes Virus (KSHV)"", 'Prison']",,2017/01/27 06:00,2017/01/27 06:01,['2017/01/27 06:00'],"['2015/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5812/hepatmon.31541 [doi]'],epublish,Hepat Mon. 2016 Dec 3;16(12):e31541. doi: 10.5812/hepatmon.31541. eCollection 2016 Dec.,20161203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MRD ""lite"" panel uses only three antibodies, namely CD19, CD10, and CD34 for MRD detection in cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) expressing CD19, CD10, and/or CD34 by flow cytometry. METHODS: Fifteen cases of B-ALL were studied for MRD at Day 19 of remission-induction therapy by employing a simplified MRD detection protocol using a 3-color fluorochrome conjugated antibody panel (CD19, CD10, and CD34) on bone marrow aspirate samples. RESULTS: All cases at diagnosis expressed CD19, CD10, and CD34. Of fifteen patients, five (33.33%) were MRD negative with less than 0.01% of mononuclear cells and remaining ten cases (66.66%) were MRD positive, with the level of 0.01% to less than 0.1% cells. CONCLUSION: The MRD assay used in this study is a simplified method for detecting MRD at Day 19 of remission-induction therapy for B-lineage ALL.

Typically, it presents in early childhood with progressive cerebellar dysfunction along with immunodeficiency and oculocutaneous telangiectasia. An increased risk of malignancy is also associated with the syndrome and, rarely, may be the presenting feature in small children. We describe a 17-year-old boy with slurred speech, mild motor delays and learning disability diagnosed with atypical A-T in the setting of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Suspicion for A-T was raised after review of a peripheral blood karyotype demonstrating rearrangements involving chromosomes 7 and/or 14. The diagnosis was confirmed after molecular testing identified a novel homozygous missense variant in ATM (c.5585T>A; p.Leu1862His) that resulted in protein instability and abolished serine/threonine protein kinase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of concurrent A-T and lymphoid malignancy diagnoses in an older child or adult with only mild neurological disease.

After the first description of the effective cytarabine + antracycline (3+7) induction regimen, in the last 3 decades, no effective targeted drug has been included in the standard treatment of AML. Many efforts of modifying 3+7 adding a third drug or increasing the dose of anthracycline, cytarabine or both did not lead to substantial improvements, mainly due to increased toxicity. Many in vitro and in vivo evidences suggested that fludarabine may increase efficacy of cytarabine through a synergistic effect. Considering the continuous improvements in supportive care and management of infectious complications the feasibility of more intensive induction strategies have increased and a renewed interest in fludarabine-containing induction strategies arose. The recent MRC AML 15 trial has shown that a fludarabine-containing induction, FLAG-Ida, resulted superior to conventional 3+7 in terms of complete remission rates, relapse incidence and survival, although only a minority of patients could complete the whole planned consolidation program due to an excessive hematological toxicity. Our group recently published a 10-year experience with a fludarabine-containing induction that slightly differed from the MRC one and resulted in good efficacy and higher feasibility.

We identified CD99 as a cell surface protein frequently overexpressed on AML and MDS stem cells. Expression of CD99 allows for prospective separation of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) from functionally normal hematopoietic stem cells in AML, and high CD99 expression on AML blasts enriches for functional LSCs as demonstrated by limiting dilution xenotransplant studies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting CD99 induce the death of AML and MDS cells in a SARC family kinase-dependent manner in the absence of immune effector cells or complement, and anti-CD99 mAbs exhibit antileukemic activity in AML xenografts. These data establish CD99 as a marker of AML and MDS stem cells, as well as a promising therapeutic target in these disorders.","['Copyright (c) 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Chung, Stephen S', 'Eng, William S', 'Hu, Wenhuo', 'Khalaj, Mona', 'Garrett-Bakelman, Francine E', 'Tavakkoli, Montreh', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Klimek, Virginia M', 'Melnick, Ari M', 'Park, Christopher Y']","['Chung SS', 'Eng WS', 'Hu W', 'Khalaj M', 'Garrett-Bakelman FE', 'Tavakkoli M', 'Levine RL', 'Carroll M', 'Klimek VM', 'Melnick AM', 'Park CY']",,"['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell School of Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell School of Medicine, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA. christopher.park@nyumc.org.', 'Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)']",IM,"['12E7 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Research Design', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5624309,,,,2017/01/27 06:00,2018/02/02 06:00,['2017/01/27 06:00'],"['2015/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['9/374/eaaj2025 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.aaj2025 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2017 Jan 25;9(374). pii: 9/374/eaaj2025. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaj2025.,,,"['K08 CA169055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA194275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS908165'],,,,,,,,,

Cellular proteins regulating and targeting lentiviral and gammaretroviral integration in infected cells have been discovered, but the factors that mediate alpharetroviral avian leukosis virus (ALV) integration are unknown. In this study, we have identified the FACT protein complex, which consists of SSRP1 and Spt16, as a principal cellular binding partner of ALV integrase (IN). Biochemical experiments with purified recombinant proteins show that SSRP1 and Spt16 are able to individually bind ALV IN, but only the FACT complex effectively stimulates ALV integration activity in vitro Likewise, in infected cells, the FACT complex promotes ALV integration activity, with proviral integration frequency varying directly with cellular expression levels of the FACT complex. An increase in 2-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circles in the depleted FACT complex cell line indicates that this complex regulates the ALV life cycle at the level of integration. This regulation is shown to be specific to ALV, as disruption of the FACT complex did not inhibit either lentiviral or gammaretroviral integration in infected cells.IMPORTANCE The majority of human gene therapy approaches utilize HIV-1- or murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vectors, which preferentially integrate near genes and regulatory regions; thus, insertional mutagenesis is a substantial risk. In contrast, ALV integrates more randomly throughout the genome, which decreases the risks of deleterious integration. Understanding how ALV integration is regulated could facilitate the development of ALV-based vectors for use in human gene therapy. Here we show that the FACT complex directly binds and regulates ALV integration efficiency in vitro and in infected cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Winans, Shelby', 'Larue, Ross C', 'Abraham, Carly M', 'Shkriabai, Nikolozi', 'Skopp, Amelie', 'Winkler, Duane', 'Kvaratskhelia, Mamuka', 'Beemon, Karen L']","['Winans S', 'Larue RC', 'Abraham CM', 'Shkriabai N', 'Skopp A', 'Winkler D', 'Kvaratskhelia M', 'Beemon KL']",,"['Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research and Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA KLB@jhu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (SSRP1 protein, human)', '0 (SUPT16H protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/enzymology/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*physiology', 'Chick Embryo', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrases/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*physiology', 'Virus Integration']",PMC5355599,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALV', '*FACT', '*integration']",,2017/01/27 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2017/01/27 06:00'],"['2017/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00082-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00082-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Mar 13;91(7). pii: JVI.00082-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00082-17.

Despite having attracted much attention, hype, and investments, the search to find a cure for cancer remains an uphill battle. Recent discoveries that challenged the central dogma of molecular biology not only further increase the complexity but also demonstrate how various types of noncoding RNAs such as microRNA and long noncoding RNA, as well as their related processes such as RNA editing, are important in regulating gene expression. Parallel to this aspect, an increasing number of reports have focused on a family of proteins known as DEAD/H-box helicases involved in RNA metabolism, regulation of long and short noncoding RNAs, and novel roles as ""editing helicases"" and their association with cancers. This review summarizes recent findings on the roles of RNA helicases in various cancers, which are broadly classified into adult solid tumors, childhood solid tumors, leukemia, and cancer stem cells. The potential small molecule inhibitors of helicases and their therapeutic value are also discussed. In addition, analyzing next-generation sequencing data obtained from public portals and reviewing existing literature, we provide new insights on the potential of DEAD/H-box helicases to act as pharmacological drug targets in cancers.","['(c) The Author 2017.

METHODS: Six patients received alemtuzumab by intravenous infusion every other day three times a week for 12 weeks. The dose was gradually escalated on daily basis (3, 10 and then 30 mg) until the patient tolerated. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of alemtuzumab in Japanese patients and the secondary objectives were to evaluate the overall response rate and the pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: The major treatment-emergent adverse events were anemia, neutropenia (6/6 patients each) and thrombocytopenia (5/6 patients) in hematologic adverse events, and nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, cytomegalovirus test positive and pyrexia (4/6 patients) in non-hematologic adverse events. As serious adverse events, cytomegalovirus infection, pulmonary tuberculosis and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were reported in 1/6 patient each. The overall response rate was 33% (95% confidence interval: 4-78) (1/6 patient each achieved complete response and partial response, respectively) and 3/6 patients had stable disease and 1/6 patient had progressive disease. The median time to response was 2.9 months. After last intravenous dosing (Week 12) of alemtuzumab 30 mg every other day three times a week, Cmax, tmax, AUC0-tau and t1/2 were higher and CL and Vss were lower than the values observed after the first dose. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics results observed with alemtuzumab in Japanese patients were generally similar to those reported in overseas clinical studies. Alemtuzumab at 30 mg by intravenous infusion every other day three times a week for 12 weeks should be safe and effective similarly in Japanese B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.

This is the largest-ever cohort study to evaluate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among long-term survivors of teenage and young adult cancer. METHODS: The population-based TYACSS (Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study) (N=178,962) was linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for England to investigate the risks of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed when 15 to 39 years of age. Observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the general population using standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing risk. RESULTS: Overall, 2782 cancer survivors were hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event-40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3-1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3-5.0), head and neck tumors (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2-3.1), and leukemia (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9-3.1) were at greatest risk. Males had significantly higher absolute excess risks than females (absolute excess risks =7 versus 3), especially among head and neck tumor survivors (absolute excess risks =30 versus 11). By 60 years of age, 9%, 6%, and 5% of CNS tumor, head and neck tumor, and leukemia survivors, respectively, had been hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event. Beyond 60 years of age, every year, 0.4% of CNS tumor survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.1% expected), whereas at any age, every year, 0.2% of head and neck tumor survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.06% expected). CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of a CNS tumor, head and neck tumor, and leukemia are particularly at risk of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event. The excess risk of cerebral infarction among CNS tumor survivors increases with attained age. For head and neck tumor survivors, this excess risk remains high across all ages. These groups of survivors, particularly males, should be considered for surveillance of cerebrovascular risk factors and potential pharmacological interventions for cerebral infarction prevention.","['(c) 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.']","['Bright, Chloe J', 'Hawkins, Mike M', 'Guha, Joyeeta', 'Henson, Katherine E', 'Winter, David L', 'Kelly, Julie S', 'Feltbower, Richard G', 'Hall, Marlous', 'Cutter, David J', 'Edgar, Angela B', 'Frobisher, Clare', 'Reulen, Raoul C']","['Bright CJ', 'Hawkins MM', 'Guha J', 'Henson KE', 'Winter DL', 'Kelly JS', 'Feltbower RG', 'Hall M', 'Cutter DJ', 'Edgar AB', 'Frobisher C', 'Reulen RC']",,"['From Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Science, University of Birmingham, UK (C.J.B., M.M.H., J.G., D.L.W., J.S.K., C.F., R.C.R.);

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using a claims database. SETTING: Medical care institutions representing 9% of all secondary hospitals (acute care hospitals) in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 797 324 admissions, comprising 435 354 patients aged 18-79 years at the time of admission, were enrolled between January 2010 and September 2014. All patients were diagnosed with diabetes or admitted to hospitals that provided laboratory data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of DIC reported by physicians in claims data. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis found that the risk of DIC was significantly higher in T2DM patients than in non-DM patients (fully adjusted OR: 1.39 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.45)), independent of age, sex, admission year and potential underlying diseases. The higher risk of DIC in T2DM patients was apparent in those who were treated with insulin within the 30-day period prior to admission (1.53 (1.37 to 1.72)). When stratified by the potential underlying diseases, the risk of DIC was higher in T2DM patients with non-septic severe infection (1.67 (1.41 to 1.97)) and with solid tumour (1.59 (1.47 to 1.72)) than in non-DM patients with those underlying diseases. The risk was similar between T2DM and non-DM patients with sepsis (0.98 (0.90 to 1.08)) and lower in T2DM patients with acute leukaemia (0.70 (0.59 to 0.84)). CONCLUSIONS: T2DM was associated with a higher risk of DIC, particularly when recently treated with insulin, as well as among admissions with solid tumour or non-septic severe infection.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

DESIGN: Pooling of individual participant data from 16 prospective cohort studies initiated 1994-2008. SETTING: Nationally representative samples drawn from the health survey for England (13 studies) and the Scottish health survey (three studies). PARTICIPANTS: 163 363 men and women aged 16 or older at study induction, who were initially free of a cancer diagnosis, provided self reported psychological distress scores (based on the general health questionnaire, GHQ-12) and consented to health record linkage. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Vital status records used to ascertain death from 16 site specific malignancies; the three Scottish studies also had information on cancer registration (incidence). RESULTS: The studies collectively contributed an average of 9.5 years of mortality surveillance during which there were 16 267 deaths (4353 from cancer). After adjustment for age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, body mass index (BMI), and smoking and alcohol intake, and with reverse causality (by left censoring) and missing data (by imputation) taken into account, relative to people in the least distressed group (GHQ-12 score 0-6), death rates in the most distressed group (score 7-12) were consistently raised for cancer of all sites combined (multivariable adjusted hazard ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.48) and cancers not related to smoking (1.45, 1.23 to 1.71), as well as carcinoma of the colorectum (1.84, 1.21 to 2.78), prostate (2.42, 1.29 to 4.54), pancreas (2.76, 1.47 to 5.19), oesophagus (2.59, 1.34 to 5.00), and for leukaemia (3.86, 1.42 to 10.5). Stepwise associations across the full range of distress scores were observed for colorectal and prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the growing evidence that psychological distress might have some predictive capacity for selected cancer presentations, in addition to other somatic diseases.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

We provide proof of concept data by profiling 60 drugs on 68 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples mostly from resistant disease in cocultures of bone marrow stromal cells. Patient-derived xenografts retained the original pattern of mutations found in the matched patient material. Stromal coculture did not prevent leukemia cell cycle activity, but a specific sensitivity profile to cell cycle-related drugs identified samples with higher cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo as leukemia xenografts. In patients with refractory relapses, individual patterns of marked drug resistance and exceptional responses to new agents of immediate clinical relevance were detected. The BCL2-inhibitor venetoclax was highly active below 10 nM in B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) subsets, including MLL-AF4 and TCF3-HLF ALL, and in some T-cell ALLs (T-ALLs), predicting in vivo activity as a single agent and in combination with dexamethasone and vincristine. Unexpected sensitivity to dasatinib with half maximal inhibitory concentration values below 20 nM was detected in 2 independent T-ALL cohorts, which correlated with similar cytotoxic activity of the SRC inhibitor KX2-391 and inhibition of SRC phosphorylation. A patient with refractory T-ALL was treated with dasatinib on the basis of drug profiling information and achieved a 5-month remission. Thus, drug profiling captures disease-relevant features and unexpected sensitivity to relevant drugs, which warrants further exploration of this functional assay in the context of clinical trials to develop drug repurposing strategies for patients with urgent medical needs.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Frismantas, Viktoras', 'Dobay, Maria Pamela', 'Rinaldi, Anna',

Here we have combined high-throughput immunophenotypic screens with large-scale single-cell gene expression analysis to define the heterogeneity within the LSC population in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients at diagnosis and following conventional tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. Our results reveal substantial heterogeneity within the putative LSC population in CML at diagnosis and demonstrate differences in response to subsequent TKI treatment between distinct subpopulations. Importantly, LSC subpopulations with myeloid and proliferative molecular signatures are proportionally reduced at a higher extent in response to TKI therapy compared with subfractions displaying primitive and quiescent signatures.

We investigated the consequences of SOCS2 ablation for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced enhancement of intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) transient by performing experiments with cardiomyocytes from SOCS2-knockout (ko) mice. Similar levels of SOCS3 transcripts were seen in cardiomyocytes from wild-type and SOCS2-ko mice, while SOCS1 mRNA was reduced in SOCS2-ko. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed increased SOCS3 association with gp130 receptor in SOCS2-ko myocytes. Measurements of Ca(2+) in wild-type myocytes exposed to LIF showed a significant increase in the magnitude of the Ca(2+) transient. This change was absent in LIF-treated SOCS2-ko cells. LIF activation of ERK and STAT3 was observed in both wild-type and SOCS2-ko cells, indicating that in SOCS2-ko, LIF receptors were functional, despite the lack of effect in the Ca(2+) transient. In wild-type cells, LIF-induced increase in [Ca(2+)]i and phospholamban Thr17 [PLN(Thr17)] phosphorylation was inhibited by KN-93, indicating a role for CaMKII in LIF-induced Ca(2+) raise. LIF-induced phosphorylation of PLN(Thr17) was abrogated in SOCS2-ko myocytes. In wild-type cardiomyocytes, LIF treatment increased L-type Ca(2+) current (ICa,L), a key activator of CaMKII in response to LIF. Conversely, SOCS2-ko myocytes failed to activate ICa,L in response to LIF, providing a rationale for the lack of LIF effect on Ca(2+) transient. Our data show that absence of SOCS2 turns cardiomyocytes unresponsive to LIF-induced [Ca(2+)] raise, indicating that endogenous levels of SOCS2 are crucial for full activation of LIF signaling in the heart.",['Copyright (c) 2017 the American Physiological Society.'],"['Rocha-Resende, Cibele', 'Guedes de Jesus, Itamar Couto', 'Roman-Campos, Danilo', 'Miranda, Artur S', 'Alves, Fabiana', 'Resende, Rodrigo Ribeiro', 'Dos Santos Cruz, Jader', 'Machado, Fabiana Simao', 'Guatimosim, Silvia']","['Rocha-Resende C', 'Guedes de Jesus IC', 'Roman-Campos D', 'Miranda AS', 'Alves F', 'Resende RR', 'Dos Santos Cruz J', 'Machado FS', 'Guatimosim S']",,"['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Department of Biophysics, Paulista School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Institute of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; and.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Institute of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Institute of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Institute of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; and.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; guatimosim@icb.ufmg.br.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Due to its profound role in (cancer) stem cell biology and differentiation, the Hedgehog (HH)/Glioma-associated Oncogene Homolog (GLI) signaling pathway may be an attractive novel therapeutic target in AML. In this review, we aim to provide a critical and concise overview of the currently known potential and challenges of HH/GLI targeting.

Therefore, we analyzed the antiretroviral functions of NKT cells in mice infected with the Friend retrovirus (FV). RESULTS: After FV infection numbers of NKT cells remained unchanged but activation as well as improved effector functions of NKT cells were found. While the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was not changed after infection, activated NKT cells revealed an elevated cytotoxic potential. Stimulation with alpha-Galactosylceramide significantly increased not only total NKT cell numbers and activation but also the anti-retroviral capacity of NKT cells. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a strong activation and a potent cytolytic function of NKT cells during acute retroviral infection.

METHODS: The Bmi-1 expression levels in the bone marrow of 104 pediatric ALL patients and 18 normal control subjects were determined by using qRT-PCR. The association between the Bmi-1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of pediatric ALL patients was analyzed, and the correlation between Bmi-1 and the prognosis of pediatric ALL was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Furthermore, the association between Bmi-1 expression and its transcriptional regulator Sall4 was investigated. RESULTS: Compared to normal control subjects, patients with primary pediatric ALL exhibited upregulated levels of Bmi-1. However, these levels were sharply decreased in patients who achieved complete remission. A significant positive association between elevated Bmi-1 levels and a poor response to prednisone as well as an increased clinical risk was observed. Patients who overexpressed Bmi-1 at the time of diagnosis had a lower relapse-free survival (RFS) rate (75.8%), whereas patients with lower Bmi-1 expression had an RFS of 94.1%. Furthermore, in ALL patients, the mRNA expression of Bmi-1 was positively correlated to the mRNA expression of Sall4a. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that Bmi-1 could serve as a novel prognostic biomarker in pediatric primary ALL and may be partially regulated by Sall4a. Our study also showed that Bmi-1 could serve as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of pediatric ALL.",,"['Peng, Hong-Xia', 'Liu, Xiao-Dan', 'Luo, Zi-Yan', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hong', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Chen, Xiao', 'Jiang, Hua', 'Xu, Ling']","['Peng HX', 'Liu XD', 'Luo ZY', 'Zhang XH', 'Luo XQ', 'Chen X', 'Jiang H', 'Xu L']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510623, China."", ""Division of Birth Cohort Study, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510623, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510623, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Zhuzhou Central Hospital, Zhuzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510623, China. jiang_hua18@sina.cn."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510623, China. luoxul64@126.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",PMC5264321,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bmi-1', '*Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Prognosis', '*Sall4']",,2017/01/27 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2017/01/27 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3049-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3049-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 Jan 25;17(1):76. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3049-3.,20170125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While not expressed during normal T-cell development, homeobox transcription factor genes can be reactivated via recurrent chromosomal rearrangements in human T-cell acute leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL), a malignancy often associated with activated Notch and Akt signaling. To address how epigenetic reprogramming via an activated homeobox gene might contribute to T-lymphomagenesis, we investigated a transgenic mouse model with thymocyte-specific overexpression of the Dlx5 homeobox gene. We demonstrate for the first time that Dlx5 induces T-cell lymphomas with high penetrance. Integrated ChIP-seq and mRNA microarray analyses identified Notch1/3 and Irs2 as direct transcriptional targets of Dlx5, a gene signature unique to lymphomas from Lck-Dlx5 mice as compared to T-cell lymphomas from Lck-MyrAkt2 mice, which were previously reported by our group. Moreover, promoter/enhancer studies confirmed that Dlx5 directly transactivates Notch expression. Notch1/3 expression and Irs2-induced Akt signaling were upregulated throughout early stages of T-cell development, which promoted cell survival during beta-selection of T lymphocytes. Dlx5 was required for tumor maintenance via its activation of Notch and Akt, as tumor cells were highly sensitive to Notch and Akt inhibitors. Together, these findings provide unbiased genetic and mechanistic evidence that Dlx5 acts as an oncogene when aberrantly expressed in T cells, and that it is a novel discovery that Notch is a direct target of Dlx5.

This novel anti-CD20 antibody is currently assessed in clinical trials with promising results as a single agent or as part of therapeutic combinations for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. Detailed understanding of the mechanisms of GA101-induced cell death is needed to get insight into possible resistance mechanisms occurring in patients. Although multiple in vitro and in vivo mechanisms have been suggested to describe the effects of GA101 on B-cells, currently available data are ambiguous. The aim of our study was to clarify the cellular mechanisms involved in GA101-induced cell death in vitro, and more particularly the respective roles played by lysosomal and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Our results confirm previous reports suggesting that GA101 triggers homotypic adhesion and caspase-independent cell death, two processes that are dependent on actin remodeling and involve the production of reactive oxygen species. With respect to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), our data suggest that lack of specificity of available antibodies directed against cathepsin B may have confounded previously published results, possibly challenging current LMP-driven model of GA101 action mode.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

LIF binds to the LIF receptor (LIFR) and activates the JAK-STAT3 pathway, but it remains unknown how the receptor complex triggers differentiation or self-renewal. Here, we report that the LIFR cytoplasmic domain contains a self-renewal domain within the juxtamembrane region and a differentiation domain within the C-terminal region. The differentiation domain contains four SPXX repeats that are phosphorylated by MAPK to restrict STAT3 activation; the self-renewal domain is characterized by a 3K motif that is acetylated by p300. In mESCs, acetyl-LIFR undergoes homodimerization, leading to STAT3 hypo- or hyper-activation depending on the presence or absence of gp130. LIFR-activated STAT3 restricts differentiation via cytokine induction.

The goals of this study were to comprehensively assess deviations from theoretical doses and the impact of body-surface area (BSA) on patients' characteristics, physicians' strategy, dose adjustment, and clinical outcome. METHODS: The GOELAMS 2001 phase III trial included 823 AML patients below 60 years of age. In the course of treatment, anthropomorphic parameters and chemotherapy doses were prospectively registered. RESULTS: Very high BSA (>/=2.15 m(2) ) was the factor most significantly associated with the physician's decision to reduce chemotherapy doses during induction and postremission therapy. Despite similar AML characteristics and therapeutic strategies, the very high BSA group exhibited a significantly worse survival (5-years OS of 27%) compared to the low (BSA</=1.5 m(2) ), intermediate (1.5 m(2) <BSA</=2.0 m(2) ), or high (2 m(2) <BSA<2.15 m(2) ) BSA groups (46%, 47%, 56%, respectively) (P=.009). In the very high BSA group, dose capping was associated with worse overall survival, although not significantly (P=.09). CONCLUSION: The presence of a very high BSA is the main reason prompting physicians to reduce chemotherapy doses in adult AML. Furthermore, these patients display a poor outcome and could benefit from full doses calculated on actual BSA.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We discuss a case of invasive fungal disease that invaded the larynx, pharynx, trachea, and pulmonary parenchyma after chemotherapy. The patient, a 46-year-old woman, presented 1 week after undergoing induction chemotherapy. Her initial symptoms were odynophagia and dysphagia. Despite encouraging findings on physical examination, her health rapidly declined and she required an urgent tracheotomy and multiple operations to address spreading necrosis. Because of her inability to heal, she was not a candidate for laryngectomy, so she was treated with conservative management. The patient was then lost to follow-up, but she returned 5 months later with laryngeal destruction and a complete laryngotracheal separation.

Two further, likewise Dioncophyllaceae-type, alkaloids, the dioncophyllines C2 (2) and D2 (3), were identified, along with the Ancistrocladaceae-type compound ancistrocladisine B (4), which is oxygenated at C-6 and S-configured at C-3.

The purpose of our study was to describe population-based testing and treatment practice characteristics for patients diagnosed with CML. METHODS: We analyzed cases of CML using 2011 data from 10 state registries that are part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s National Program of Cancer Registries. We describe completeness of testing for the BCR-ABL gene and availability of outpatient treatment with TKIs and associated characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 685 cases of CML were identified; 55 percent (374) had a documented BCR-ABL gene test with 96 percent (360) of these being positive for the BCR-ABL gene and the remaining 4 percent (14) either testing negative or having a missing result. Registries were able to identify the use of TKIs in 54 percent (369) of patients, though only 43 percent (296) had a corresponding BCR-ABL gene test documented. One state registry reported a significantly lower percentage of patients being tested for the BCR-ABL gene (25 percent) and receiving TKI treatment (21 percent). Limiting analysis to CML case reports from the remaining 9 comparative effectiveness research registries, 78 percent (305) patients had a documented BCR-ABL gene test and 79 percent (308) had documented treatment with a TKI. Receipt of testing or treatment for these 9 states did not vary by sex, race, ethnicity, census tract poverty level, census tract urbanization, or insurance status; BCR-ABL testing varied by state of residence, and BCR-ABL testing and TKI therapy occurred less often with increasing age (BCR-ABL testing: odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95 percent CI, 0.95-0.99; and TKI therapy: OR, 0.97; 95 percent CI, 0.96-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Collection of detailed CML data vary significantly by states. A majority of the case patients had appropriate testing for the BCR-ABL gene and treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, BCR-ABL testing and TKI treatment decreased with increasing age. Further research is needed to understand CML coding, testing, and treatment disparities.",,"['Styles, Timothy', 'Wu, Manxia', 'Wilson, Reda', 'Babcock, Frances', 'Butterworth, David', 'West, Dee W', 'Richardson, Lisa C']","['Styles T', 'Wu M', 'Wilson R', 'Babcock F', 'Butterworth D', 'West DW', 'Richardson LC']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Registry Manag,Journal of registry management,9804163,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', '*Registries']",PMC5291176,,,,2017/01/26 06:00,2018/09/18 06:00,['2017/01/26 06:00'],"['2017/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Registry Manag. 2016 Fall;41(3):134-142.,,,['CC999999/Intramural CDC HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS843741'],,,,,,,,,

We devised a biomarkers-only CLL prognostic system based on the two most important prognostic parameters in CLL (i.e., IGHV mutational status and fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] cytogenetics), separating three different risk groups: (1) low-risk (mutated IGHV + no adverse FISH cytogenetics [del(17p), del(11q)]); (2) intermediate-risk (either unmutated IGHV or adverse FISH cytogenetics) and (3) high-risk (unmutated IGHV + adverse FISH cytogenetics). In 524 unselected subjects with CLL, the 10-year overall survival was 82% (95% CI 76%-88%), 52% (45%-62%), and 27% (17%-42%) for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Patients with low-risk comprised around 50% of the series and had a life expectancy comparable to the general population. The prognostic model was fully validated in two independent cohorts, including 417 patients representative of general CLL population and 337 patients with Binet stage A CLL. The model had a similar discriminatory value as the CLL-IPI.

However, ABT-737 fails to induce apoptosis in cancer cell with high levels of Mcl-1 expression. The pharmacological survivin inhibitor YM155 has been reported to induce downregulation of Mcl-1 expression. Therefore, we investigated the effect of YM155 to sensitize resistance against ABT-737 in Mcl-1-overexpressed human renal carcinoma Caki cells. We found that ABT-737 alone and YM155 alone did not induce apoptosis, but YM155 markedly sensitized ABT-737-mediated apoptosis in Mcl-1-overexpressed Caki cells, human glioma cells (U251MG), and human lung carcinoma cells (A549). In contrast, combined treatment with ABT-737 and YM155 did not increase apoptosis in normal mouse kidney cells (TCMK-1) and human mesangial cells (MC). YM155 induced lysosome-dependent downregulation of Mcl-1 expression in Mcl-1-overexpressed Caki cells. In addition, combined treatment with ABT-737 and YM155 induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibited interaction of Bcl-xL and Bax. Taken together, our results suggested that YM155 effectively improves sensitivity to ABT-737 through downregulation of Mcl-1 expression.",,"['Woo, Seon Min', 'Min, Kyoung-Jin', 'Seo, Bo Ram', 'Seo, Young Ho', 'Jeong, Yong-Jin', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Woo SM', 'Min KJ', 'Seo BR', 'Seo YH', 'Jeong YJ', 'Kwon TK']",,"['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu, 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu, 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu, 704-701, South Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu, 704-701, South Korea.', 'Department of Food Science and Technology, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu, 704-701, South Korea.', 'KMF Co., Ltd., Yuram-ro, Dong-gu, Daegu, 41065, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu, 704-701, South Korea. kwontk@dsmc.or.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (YM 155)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-737', 'Caki cells', 'Lysosome', 'Mcl-1', 'YM155']",,2017/01/26 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2017/01/26 06:00'],"['2016/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-016-2938-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-016-2938-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2017 May;429(1-2):91-102. doi: 10.1007/s11010-016-2938-0.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends the prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF), dosed at 5 mcg/kg and rounded to the nearest vial size. A previous medication use evaluation conducted within a multi-hospital healthcare system demonstrated that only 67% of patients were started on appropriate weight-based dosing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of appropriate weight-based G-CSF dosing in patients on clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with acute leukemia or stem cell transplant recipients who received G-CSF from May 2009 to September 2015 was conducted. Patient admissions were reviewed in regards to neutropenia length, incidence of FN, length of stay, and final disposition (alive or deceased). Admissions were divided into one of three weight-based dosing groups of under 5 mcg/kg, recommended 5 mcg/kg within a 10% range, and over 5 mcg/kg which were named under, recommended, and over, respectively. RESULTS: Ninety-four admissions were included. Average age of this patient population was 58 years old, and the majority of patients were male (53%) and Caucasian (55%). Majority of patients had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (91%). Data showed average duration of neutropenia was around 10 days regardless if the patient received under 5 mcg/kg, the recommended 5 mcg/kg or over 5 mcg/kg G-CSF (10.1 +/- 6.7 days, 8.9 +/- 9.2 days, 10.1 +/- 9.1 days, respectively). Length of stay was similar for patients regardless of initial G-CSF dose (29.6 +/- 16.0 days, 29.1 +/- 18.4 days, and 24.5 +/- 17.0, respectively). However, the incidence of FN was significantly greater for those who received under 5 mcg/kg of G-CSF (87% for under, 68% for recommended, and 54% for over). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, variations from the recommended 5 mcg/kg G-CSF dose did not significantly impact length of neutropenia, length of stay, nor mortality. However, patients who received under the 5 mcg/kg of G-CSF dose may be at a greater risk of FN.",,"['K Hockings, Jennifer', 'K Owolabi, Diwura', 'Broyles, Joyce E', 'C Wheelis, Susan']","['K Hockings J', 'K Owolabi D', 'Broyles JE', 'C Wheelis S']",,"['Methodist University Hospital, 1256 Union Avenue, Memphis, TN, 38104, USA.', 'Methodist University Hospital, 1256 Union Avenue, Memphis, TN, 38104, USA.', 'Methodist University Hospital, 1256 Union Avenue, Memphis, TN, 38104, USA.', 'Methodist Le Bonheur Germantown Hospital, 7691 Poplar Avenue, Germantown, TN, 38138, USA. susan.wheelis@mlh.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Body Weight', 'Female', 'Fever/*prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Febrile neutropenia', '*Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors', '*Leukemia', '*Stem cell transplant']",,2017/01/26 06:00,2017/11/01 06:00,['2017/01/26 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-017-3570-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-017-3570-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2017 Jun;25(6):1853-1858. doi: 10.1007/s00520-017-3570-6.

METHODS: Retrospective chart review and clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Five patients are described. The first patient developed synchronous HCL and CLL and was treated with rituximab for 13 months with HCL in remission and stable CLL. The second patient developed HCL and was treated with cladribine. His disease recurred 7 years later which was retreated with cladribine. Seven years later, he developed asymptomatic CLL. The third patient developed CLL, managed expectantly, then developed HCL 10 months later, and was treated with cladribine. Although his HCL went into remission, there was a slow redevelopment of CLL for which expectant management was done. The fourth patient developed concurrent CLL and HCL, received cladribine, with subsequent development of worsening abdominal lymphadenopathy and was lost to follow-up. The last patient developed concurrent HCL and CLL and was also diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma; this patient was also lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: The development of concurrent HCL and CLL may indicate a common origin. Patients with HCL may subsequently develop CLL, thus mimicking a relapse of HCL.

The GATA1 protein has four functional domains, including two centrally located zinc-finger domains and two transactivation domains at the N- and C-termini. These functional domains play characteristic roles in the elaborate regulation of diversified GATA1 target genes, each of which exhibits a unique expression profile. Three types of GATA1-related hematological malignancies have been reported. One is a structural mutation in the GATA1 gene, resulting in the production of a short form of GATA1 that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain and is found in Down syndrome-related acute megakaryocytic leukemia. The other two are cis-acting regulatory mutations affecting expression of the Gata1 gene, which have been shown to cause acute erythroblastic leukemia and myelofibrosis in mice. Therefore, imbalanced gene regulation caused by qualitative and quantitative changes in GATA1 is thought to be involved in specific hematological disease pathogenesis.

Umbilical cord blood (UCB) HCT outcomes are largely unknown in this population.

It acts as a tumor suppressor in many cancers but is oncogenic in certain tumors. We observed upregulation of RUNX3 mRNA and protein expression in nasal-type extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) patient samples and NKTL cell lines compared to normal NK cells. RUNX3 silenced NKTL cells showed increased apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation. Potential binding sites for MYC were identified in the RUNX3 enhancer region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR revealed binding activity between MYC and RUNX3. Co-transfection of the MYC expression vector with RUNX3 enhancer reporter plasmid resulted in activation of RUNX3 enhancer indicating that MYC positively regulates RUNX3 transcription in NKTL cell lines. Treatment with a small-molecule MYC inhibitor (JQ1) caused significant downregulation of MYC and RUNX3, leading to apoptosis in NKTL cells. The growth inhibition resulting from depletion of MYC by JQ1 was rescued by ectopic MYC expression. In summary, our study identified RUNX3 overexpression in NKTL with functional oncogenic properties.

Here we investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs), measured by CD4/CD25/FOXP3 expression, in predicting the outcome of immunotherapy with the CD19-directed bispecific T-cell engager construct blinatumomab. Blinatumomab responders (n=22) had an average of 4.82% Tregs (confidence interval (CI): 1.79-8.34%) in the peripheral blood, whereas non-responders (n=20) demonstrated 10.25% Tregs (CI: 3.36-65.9%). All other tested markers showed either no prediction value or an inferior prediction level including blast BM counts and the classical enzyme marker lactate dehydrogenase. With a cutoff of 8.525%, Treg enumeration can identify 100% of all blinatumomab responders and exclude 70% of the non-responders. The effect is facilitated by blinatumomab-activated Tregs, leading to interleukin-10 production, resulting in suppression of T-cell proliferation and reduced CD8-mediated lysis of ALL cells. Proliferation of patients' T cells can be restored by upfront removal of Tregs. Thus, enumeration of Treg identifies r/r ALL patients with a high response rate to blinatumomab.

Review of the literature revealed 8 cases of spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma secondary to antiplatelet treatment. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 66-year-old male with a flare of acute gout secondary to uncontrolled chronic myeloid leukemia. The patient was started on dual antiplatelet treatment following a drug-eluted stent placement for symptomatic coronary artery disease. He suffered from an unexplained acute drop of five grams of hemoglobin from 10.4 to 5.8 g/dL and symptomatic anemia. The initial labs excluded occult GI bleeding, hemolysis, and bone marrow suppression. However, an abdominal CT scan showed an approximately 7.2x4.7x6.7 cm spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma involving the left iliacus muscle. The patient was successfully treated conservatively by discontinuing antiplatelet therapy and supportive measures. CONCLUSIONS A spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma often presents without localizing signs and symptoms and therefore should be considered in any case of unexplained blood loss in patients on antiplatelet therapy.

The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor romidepsin and the synthetic cytotoxic retinoid fenretinide both have achieved durable clinical responses in T-cell lymphomas as single agents. We investigated the potential for using these two agents in combination in TCLMs. We demonstrated cytotoxic synergy between romidepsin and fenretinide in 15 TCLM cell lines at clinically achievable concentrations that lacked cytotoxicity for nonmalignant cells (fibroblasts and blood mononuclear cells). In vivo, romidepsin + fenretinide + ketoconazole (enhances fenretinide exposures by inhibiting fenretinide metabolism) showed greater activity in subcutaneous and disseminated TCLM xenograft models than single-agent romidepsin or fenretinide + ketoconazole. Fenretinide + romidepsin caused a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent increase in proapoptotic proteins (Bim, tBid, Bax, and Bak), apoptosis, and inhibition of HDAC enzymatic activity, which achieved a synergistic increase in histone acetylation. The synergistic cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and histone acetylation of fenretinide + romidepsin were abrogated by antioxidants (vitamins C or E). Romidepsin + fenretinide activated p38 and JNK via ROS, and knockdown of p38 and JNK1 significantly decreased the synergistic cytotoxicity. Romidepsin + fenretinide also showed synergistic cytotoxicity for B-lymphoid malignancy cell lines, but did not increase ROS, acetylation of histones, activation of p38 + JNK, or cytotoxicity in nonmalignant cells.

Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of ALL provide a clinically relevant platform for assessing novel drugs, with efficacy generally assessed by enumerating circulating human lymphoblasts in mouse peripheral blood (PB) as an indicator of disease burden. While allowing indirect measurement of disease burden in real time, this technique cannot assess treatment effects on internal reservoirs of disease. We explore benefits of bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to evaluate drug responses in ALL PDXs, compared with PB monitoring. BLI-based thresholds of drug response are also explored.Experimental Design: ALL PDXs were lentivirally transduced to stably express luciferase and green fluorescent protein. In vivo PDX responses to an induction-type regimen of vincristine, dexamethasone, and L-asparaginase were assessed by BLI and PB. Residual disease at day 28 after treatment initiation was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of major organs. BLI and PB were subsequently used to evaluate efficacy of the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax.Results: BLI considerably accelerated and enhanced detection of leukemia burden compared with PB and identified sites of residual disease during treatment in a quantitative manner, highlighting limitations in current PB-based scoring criteria. Using BLI alongside enumeration of human lymphoblasts in PB and bone marrow, we were able to redefine response criteria analogous to the clinical setting.Conclusions: BLI substantially improves the stringency of preclinical drug testing in pediatric ALL PDXs, which will likely be important in prioritizing effective agents for clinical assessment.

One of the cytogenetic findings in AML is structurally highly abnormal marker chromosomes. In this study, we have assessed frequency, cytogenetic characteristics, prognostic impact, and underlying biological origin of marker chromosomes. Given their inherent gross structural chromosomal damage, we speculated that they may arise from chromothripsis, a recently described phenomenon of chromosome fragmentation in a single catastrophic event. In 2 large consecutive prospective, randomized, multicenter, intensive chemotherapy trials (AML96, AML2003) from the Study Alliance Leukemia, marker chromosomes were detectable in 165/1026 (16.1%) of aberrant non-core-binding-factor (CBF) karyotype patients. Adverse-risk karyotypes displayed a higher frequency of marker chromosomes (26.5% in adverse-risk, 40.3% in complex aberrant, and 41.2% in abnormality(17p) karyotypes, P < .0001 each). Marker chromosomes were associated with a poorer prognosis compared with other non-CBF aberrant karyotypes and led to lower remission rates (complete remission + complete remission with incomplete recovery), inferior event-free survival as well as overall survival in both trials. In multivariate analysis, marker chromosomes independently predicted poor prognosis in the AML96 trial </=60 years. As detected by array comparative genomic hybridization, about one-third of marker chromosomes (18/49) had arisen from chromothripsis, whereas this phenomenon was virtually undetectable in a control group of marker chromosome-negative complex aberrant karyotypes (1/34). The chromothripsis-positive cases were characterized by a particularly high degree of karyotype complexity, TP53 mutations, and dismal prognosis. In conclusion, marker chromosomes are indicative of chromothripsis and associated with poor prognosis per se and not merely by association with other adverse cytogenetic features.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Bochtler, Tilmann', 'Granzow, Martin', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Kunz, Christina', 'Mohr, Brigitte', 'Kartal-Kaess, Mutlu', 'Hinderhofer, Katrin', 'Heilig, Christoph E', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Endris, Volker', 'Kirchner, Martina', 'Stenzinger, Albrecht', 'Benner, Axel', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Kramer, Alwin']","['Bochtler T', 'Granzow M', 'Stolzel F', 'Kunz C', 'Mohr B', 'Kartal-Kaess M', 'Hinderhofer K', 'Heilig CE', 'Kramer M', 'Thiede C', 'Endris V', 'Kirchner M', 'Stenzinger A', 'Benner A', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ehninger G', 'Ho AD', 'Jauch A', 'Kramer A']",,"['Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, and.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, and.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, and.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Chromothripsis', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2017/01/26 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/01/26 06:00'],"['2016/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33622-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-09-738161 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Mar 9;129(10):1333-1342. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-09-738161.

This disorder can present as hepatic mass or mass-like lesion. Chemotherapy often is the first line treatment for patients with HL. Thus, an accurate pre-management histological diagnosis is essential to potentially improve clinical outcomes. The present study was to explore the prevalence of HL in ultrasound guided liver biopsies for hepatic mass or mass-like lesions, to investigate HL associated clinicopathological features, to raise the awareness of early recognition and proper diagnosis of this entity, and to assess specimen adequacy in needle core biopsy. METHODS: Twenty-one cases of HL were enrolled. Clinical and pathological characteristics were evaluated, quality of biopsies was assessed and pertinent literature was reviewed. RESULTS: HL was diagnosed in 0.94% of 2242 liver biopsy cases with ambiguous clinical presentation, laboratory tests and image studies. There were two cases of PHL (0.09%), and nineteen cases of SHL (0.85%). Histopathologically, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the most common type, followed by B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Additionally, three lymphocytic infiltration patterns were documented microscopically. The nodular infiltration was the most common type. CONCLUSIONS: HL is a rare entity and histopathology along with ancillary tests remains the only way to make the diagnosis.

Seven patients had large and 3 had small del(7p) clone. For patients with AML, 3 acquired del(7p) either at disease relapse or disease progression, then became refractory to therapy and died shortly thereafter (median 5 months). Detection of del(7p) in patients with MDS, CMML, or PMF appeared to predict poorer prognosis as all 4 patients experienced disease progression or transformation to AML after 5-24 months. In the remaining 3 patients (1 AML and 2 AML in remission), del(7p) was only detected in 10% to 30% of metaphases and was a transient finding that did not appear to have any clinical impact.

Hook. could reduce inflammatory responses in macrophage and brain astrocytes. AIM OF THE STUDY: In the present study, we evaluated whether an ethyl acetate extract (HZE) or a water extract (HZW) of H. zeylanica could reduce inflammatory responses in lung epithelial cells and ameliorate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury in mice. METHODS: Human lung epithelial A549 cells were pre-treated with HZE or HZW (1-10mug/mL), then stimulated with LPS. BALB/c mice received oral HZW for 7 consecutive days, then an intratracheal instillation of LPS to induce lung injury. RESULTS: HZW reduced chemokine and proinflammatory cytokine production in LPS-activated A549 cells. HZW also suppressed ICAM-1 expression and reduced the adherence of acute monocytic leukemia cells to inflammatory A549 cells. HZE had less efficacy than HZW in suppressing inflammatory responses in A549 cells. In vivo, HZW significantly suppressed neutrophil infiltration and reduced the TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum from LPS-treated mice. HZW also modulated superoxide dismutase activity, glutathione, and myeloperoxidase activity in lung tissues from LPS-treated mice. HZW decreased the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappa B, and promoted heme oxygenase-1 expression in inflamed lung tissue from LPS-treated mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that HZW reduced lung injury in mice by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. HZW also reduced inflammatory responses in human lung epithelial cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Cutaneous lesions show exaggerated matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1). In other skin diseases, FLI1 promoter methylation reduces FLI1 expression, and low FLI1 down-regulates MMP1. IL-6 increases FLI1 expression. We hypothesized that epigenetic regulation of FLI1 in cutaneous leishmaniasis, together with IL-6, might determine MMP1 expression. While generally low (<10%), percent FLI1 promoter methylation was lower (P=0.001) in lesion biopsies than normal skin. Contrary to expectation, a strong positive correlation occurred between FLI1 methylation and gene expression in lesions (r=0.98, P=0.0005) and in IL-6-treated L. braziliensis-infected macrophages (r=0.99, P=0.0004). In silico analysis of the FLI1 promoter revealed co-occurring active H3K27ac and repressive DNA methylation marks to enhance gene expression. FLI1 expression was enhanced between 3 and 24hour post infection in untreated (P=0.0002) and IL-6-treated (P=0.028) macrophages. MMP1 was enhanced in lesion biopsies (P=0.0002), induced (P=0.007) in infected macrophages, but strongly inhibited by IL-6. No correlations occurred between FLI1 and MMP1 expression in lesions or infected macrophages (with/without IL-6). We conclude that MMP1 is regulated by factors other than FLI1, and that the influence of IL-6 on MMP1 was independent of its effect on FLI1.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 566 patients who underwent a first HLA-identical allogeneic stem cell transplantation with this conditioning regimen for acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission between 2006 and 2013 and compared the outcomes of 145 (25.6%) patients who received ATG (ATG group) to 421 (74.4%) who did not (no-ATG group). The Kaplan-Meier estimator, the cumulative incidence function, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used where appropriate. RESULTS: Patients in the ATG group were older, received more frequently peripheral blood stem cell grafts from older donors, and were transplanted more recently. With a median follow-up of 19 months, patients in the ATG group had reduced 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (31 vs. 52%, p = 0.0002) and of its extensive form (8 vs. 26%, p < 0.0001) but similar relapse incidence (22 vs. 27%, p = 0.23) leading to improved GVHD and relapse-free survival (GRFS) (60 vs. 40%, p = 0.0001). In multivariate analyses, the addition of ATG was independently associated with lower chronic GVHD (HR = 0.46, p = 0.0001), improved leukemia-free survival (HR = 0.67, p = 0.027), overall survival (HR = 0.65, p = 0.027), and GRFS (HR = 0.51, p = 4 x 10(-5)). Recipient age above 50 years was the only other factor associated with worse survivals. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of ATG with fludarabine and 4 days intravenous busulfan followed by HLA-identical sibling donor allogeneic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia improves overall transplant outcomes due to reduced incidence of chronic GVHD without increased relapse risk.",,"['Rubio, Marie Therese', ""D'Aveni-Piney, Maud"", 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Hamladji, Rose-Marie', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Ozdogu, Hakan', 'Daguindeau, Etienne', 'Richard, Carlos', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Irrera, Giuseppe', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Diez-Martin, Jose L', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Rubio MT', ""D'Aveni-Piney M"", 'Labopin M', 'Hamladji RM', 'Sanz MA', 'Blaise D', 'Ozdogu H', 'Daguindeau E', 'Richard C', 'Santarone S', 'Irrera G', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Yeshurun M', 'Diez-Martin JL', 'Mohty M', 'Savani BN', 'Nagler A']",,"[""Service d'Hematologie et de Medecine interne, Hopital Brabois, CHRU Nancy, Nancy, France. mt_rubio@hotmail.com."", 'IMoPA, CNRS UMR 7365, Nancy, France. mt_rubio@hotmail.com.', 'Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France. mt_rubio@hotmail.com.', ""Service d'Hematologie et de Medecine interne, Hopital Brabois, CHRU Nancy, Nancy, France. m.daveni-piney@chru-nancy.fr."", 'IMoPA, CNRS UMR 7365, Nancy, France. m.daveni-piney@chru-nancy.fr.', 'Universite de Lorraine, Nancy, France. m.daveni-piney@chru-nancy.fr.', 'ALWP Office, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie et de Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France."", 'INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Service Hematologie Greffe de Moelle, Centre Pierre et Marie Curie, Alger, Algeria.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Programme de Transplantation and Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Division, BMT Unit, Hematology Reserach Laboratory, Training and Medical, Baskent University Hospital, Adana, Turkey.', 'Hopital Jean Minjoz, Service d`Hematologie, Besancon, France.', 'Servicio de Hematologia-Hemoterapia, Hospital U.

Therefore, we sought to investigate if publicly available whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing data generated by large public cancer genome efforts, like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), could be used to identify bacteria associated with cancer. The Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA) was used to align a subset of Illumina paired-end sequencing data from TCGA to the human reference genome and all complete bacterial genomes in the RefSeq database in an effort to identify bacterial read pairs from the microbiome. RESULTS: Through careful consideration of all of the bacterial taxa present in the cancer types investigated, their relative abundance, and batch effects, we were able to identify some read pairs from certain taxa as likely resulting from contamination. In particular, the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in the ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples was correlated with the sequencing center of the samples. Additionally, there was a correlation between the presence of Ralstonia spp. and two specific plates of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. At the end, associations remained between Pseudomonas-like and Acinetobacter-like read pairs in AML, and Pseudomonas-like read pairs in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) that could not be explained through batch effects or systematic contamination as seen in other samples. CONCLUSIONS: This approach suggests that it is possible to identify bacteria that may be present in human tumor samples from public genome sequencing data that can be examined further experimentally. More weight should be given to this approach in the future when bacterial associations with diseases are suspected.",,"['Robinson, Kelly M', 'Crabtree, Jonathan', 'Mattick, John S A', 'Anderson, Kathleen E', 'Dunning Hotopp, Julie C']","['Robinson KM', 'Crabtree J', 'Mattick JS', 'Anderson KE', 'Dunning Hotopp JC']",,"['Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA. jdhotopp@som.umaryland.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA. jdhotopp@som.umaryland.edu.', 'Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA. jdhotopp@som.umaryland.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Microbiome,Microbiome,101615147,,IM,"['Acinetobacter/genetics', 'Bacteria/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma/classification/*genetics/*microbiology', 'Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/genetics/microbiology', '*Databases, Genetic', '*Genome, Bacterial', '*Genome, Human', 'Glioblastoma/genetics/microbiology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*microbiology', '*Microbiota', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/genetics/microbiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/microbiology', 'Pseudomonas/genetics']",PMC5264480,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acinetobacter', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Batch effects', '*Cancer', '*Cancer-associated bacteria', '*Genome sequencing', '*Microbiome', '*Pseudomonas', '*Stomach adenocarcinoma']",,2017/01/26 06:00,2017/07/28 06:00,['2017/01/26 06:00'],"['2016/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40168-016-0224-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s40168-016-0224-8 [pii]']",epublish,Microbiome. 2017 Jan 25;5(1):9. doi: 10.1186/s40168-016-0224-8.,20170125,,"['DP2 OD007372/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA206188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,['Dryad/10.5061/dryad.96584'],,,,

Objective: To estimate age-standardized mortality rates by US county from 29 cancers. Design and Setting: Deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and population counts from the Census Bureau, the NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database from 1980 to 2014 were used. Validated small area estimation models were used to estimate county-level mortality rates from 29 cancers: lip and oral cavity; nasopharynx; other pharynx; esophageal; stomach; colon and rectum; liver; gallbladder and biliary; pancreatic; larynx; tracheal, bronchus, and lung; malignant skin melanoma; nonmelanoma skin cancer; breast; cervical; uterine; ovarian; prostate; testicular; kidney; bladder; brain and nervous system; thyroid; mesothelioma; Hodgkin lymphoma; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; multiple myeloma; leukemia; and all other cancers combined. Exposure: County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-standardized cancer mortality rates by county, year, sex, and cancer type. Results: A total of 19511910 cancer deaths were recorded in the United States between 1980 and 2014, including 5656423 due to tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer; 2484476 due to colon and rectum cancer; 1573593 due to breast cancer; 1077030 due to prostate cancer; 1157878 due to pancreatic cancer; 209314 due to uterine cancer; 421628 due to kidney cancer; 487518 due to liver cancer; 13927 due to testicular cancer; and 829396 due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer mortality decreased by 20.1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 18.2%-21.4%) between 1980 and 2014, from 240.2 (95% UI, 235.8-244.1) to 192.0 (95% UI, 188.6-197.7) deaths per 100000 population. There were large differences in the mortality rate among counties throughout the period: in 1980, cancer mortality ranged from 130.6 (95% UI, 114.7-146.0) per 100000 population in Summit County, Colorado, to 386.9 (95% UI, 330.5-450.7) in North Slope Borough, Alaska, and in 2014 from 70.7 (95% UI, 63.2-79.0) in Summit County, Colorado, to 503.1 (95% UI, 464.9-545.4) in Union County, Florida. For many cancers, there were distinct clusters of counties with especially high mortality. The location of these clusters varied by type of cancer and were spread in different regions of the United States. Clusters of breast cancer were present in the southern belt and along the Mississippi River, while liver cancer was high along the Texas-Mexico border, and clusters of kidney cancer were observed in North and South Dakota and counties in West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Alaska, and Illinois. Conclusions and Relevance: Cancer mortality declined overall in the United States between 1980 and 2014. Over this same period, there were important changes in trends, patterns, and differences in cancer mortality among US counties.

However, the resistance of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) to BET inhibitors remains a major challenge. In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms underlying LSC resistance to the BET inhibitor JQ1. We evaluated the levels of apoptosis and macroautophagy/autophagy induced by JQ1 in LSC-like leukemia cell lines and primary CD34(+) CD38(-) leukemic blasts obtained from AML cases with normal karyotype without recurrent mutations. JQ1 effectively induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in JQ1-sensitive AML cells. However, in JQ1-resistant AML LSCs, JQ1 induced little apoptosis and led to upregulation of BECN1/Beclin 1, increased LC3 lipidation, formation of autophagosomes, and downregulation of SQSTM1/p62. Inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitors or knockdown of BECN1 using specific siRNA enhanced JQ1-induced apoptosis in resistant cells, indicating that prosurvival autophagy occurred in these cells. Independent of MTOR signaling, activation of the AMPK (p-Thr172)-ULK1 (p-Ser555) pathway was found to be associated with JQ1-induced autophagy in resistant cells.

However, arm anthropometry offers simple assessments of fat mass and lean body mass; especially valuable in low- and middle-income countries where the great majority of young people with cancer live and access to sophisticated expensive measures of body composition is markedly limited. METHODS: The nutritional status of 75 long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was assessed by arm anthropometry, in addition to BMI, in a cross-sectional cohort study. Normal ranges for triceps skin fold thickness (TSFT, a surrogate for fat mass) and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC, a surrogate for lean body mass) were between the 15th and 85th percentiles for age and sex. Overweight/obesity was classified as a TSFT >85th percentile and sarcopenia as an MUAC <15th percentile. Height normalized indices for TSFT and MUAC were also calculated. RESULTS: Overweight/obesity was identified in 1/3 of subjects by a BMI >25 and by TSFT; and 20% of the subjects had a TSFT >95th percentile. Only two subjects were sarcopenic. None met the combined criteria for sarcopenic obesity. TSFT and MUAC/height indices did not add sensitivity to identification of sarcopenia or obesity. CONCLUSIONS: TSFT is a useful measure of overweight/obesity in this population, but MUAC does not identify a notable proportion with sarcopenia.

However, there are limited data in the literature concerning post-HCT outcomes for older patients in their second complete remission (CR2). METHODS: The purpose of the current study was to retrospectively investigate within the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database parameters influencing posttransplant outcomes for patients 60 years of age or older undergoing HCT for AML in CR2. RESULTS: In total, 196 patients from 78 centers were identified; the median age was 64 years (range, 60-78 years). Seventy-one percent had a Karnofsky performance status >/= 90 at the time of HCT. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens were used in 159 patients (81%). A univariate analysis demonstrated a 3-year overall survival (OS) rate of 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35%-49%), a leukemia-free survival rate of 37% (95% CI, 30%-44%), a cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality of 25% (95% CI, 19%-32%), and a cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) of 38% (95% CI, 31%-45%). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that cytogenetic risk was the only independent risk factor for OS (P = .023) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.14 (95% CI, 0.59-2.19) for intermediate-risk cytogenetics and an HR of 2.32 (95% CI, 1.05-5.14) for unfavorable-risk cytogenetics. For CIR, cytogenetic risk was also the only independent prognostic factor (P = .01) with an HR of 1.10 (95% CI, 0.47-2.56) for intermediate-risk cytogenetics and an HR of 2.98 (95% CI, 1.11-8.00) for unfavorable-risk cytogenetics. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic HCT is a curative treatment option for older patients with AML in CR2, particularly for those with favorable or intermediate cytogenetic risk. Cancer 2017;123:2035-2042.

For patients in Rel1 or primary induction failure (PIF), transplantation versus treatment to achieve a second CR (CR2) and subsequent HCT might yield similar outcomes, but available comparative data are scarce. METHODS: Survival was analyzed in 4682 HCT recipients according to disease status: PIF (N = 1440), Rel1 (failing >/=1 reinduction; N = 1256), and CR2 (N = 1986). RESULTS: Patient, disease, and transplantation characteristics were similar, except that patients in CR2 more often had performance scores of 90% to 100%, de novo AML, and longer CR1 duration. Adverse cytogenetics were more common in patients who experienced PIF. The 5-year survival rate adjusted for performance score, cytogenetic risk, and donor type for CR2 was 39% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37%-41%) compared with 18% (95% CI, 16%-20%) for HCT in Rel1 and 21% (95% CI, 19%-23%) in PIF (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Although survival is superior for patients who undergo HCT in CR2, transplantation for selected patients in Rel1 or PIF may still be valuable. These data can guide decision making about additional salvage therapy versus prompt HCT for patients not in CR, but they also highlight that AML is intrinsically more treatable in patients who have favorable-risk cytogenetics, those with longer CR1 duration, and younger patients with better performance status.

Both CLC and CNTFRalpha are necessary for signaling but so far CLF-1 has only been known as a putative facilitator of CLC secretion. However, it has recently been shown that CLF-1 contains three binding sites: one for CLC; one for CNTFRalpha (that may promote assembly of the trimeric complex); and one for the endocytic receptor sorLA. The latter site provides high affinity binding of CLF-1, CLC:CLF-1, as well as the trimeric (CLC:CLF-1:CNTFRalpha) complex to sorLA, and in sorLA-expressing cells the soluble ligands CLF-1 and CLC:CLF-1 are rapidly taken up and internalized. In cells co-expressing CNTFRalpha and sorLA, CNTFRalpha first binds CLC:CLF-1 to form a membrane-associated trimeric complex, but it also connects to sorLA via the free sorLA-binding site in CLF-1. As a result, CNTFRalpha, which has no capacity for endocytosis on its own, is tugged along and internalized by the sorLA-mediated endocytosis of CLC:CLF-1. The present protocol describes the experimental procedures used to demonstrate i) the sorLA-mediated and CLC:CLF-1-dependent downregulation of surface-membrane CNTFRalpha expression; ii) sorLA-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal targeting of CNTFRalpha; and iii) the lowered cellular response to CLC:CLF-1-stimulation upon sorLA-mediated downregulation of CNTFRalpha.",,"['Larsen, Jakob V', 'Petersen, Claus M']","['Larsen JV', 'Petersen CM']",,"['Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University; jvl@biomed.au.dk.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University; cmp@biomed.au.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (LAMP1 protein, human)', '0 (LDL-Receptor Related Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (SORL1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (cardiotrophin-like cytokine)', '0 (cytokine-like factor-1)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endocytosis', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'LDL-Receptor Related Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC5408589,,,,2017/01/25 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2017/01/25 06:00'],"['2017/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/55019 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2017 Jan 6;(119). doi: 10.3791/55019.,20170106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aim of this study was to identify the candidate circulating markers of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) manifestations, having potential to develop into predictive- or monitoring-biomarkers. A proteomic approach, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in conjunction with mass spectrometry (2DE-MS), was employed for this purpose. Based on the spot intensity measurements, six proteins were found to be consistently dysregulated in CP-CML subjects compared to the healthy controls [false discovery rate (FDR) threshold </=0.05]. These were identified as alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, CD5 molecule-like, stress-induced phosphoprotein 1, vitamin D binding protein isoform 1 and transthyretin by MS analysis [PMF score >/=79; data accessible via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD002757].

Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has in vitro activity against ALL blasts. A phase I-II trial, reported by the Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukaemia and Lymphoma (TACL) consortium, demonstrated that bortezomib with chemotherapy has acceptable toxicity and remarkable activity in patients with relapsed ALL failing 2-3 previous regimens. We evaluated bortezomib in combination with chemotherapy in 30 and 7 children with B-cell precursor (BCP) and T-cell ALL, respectively. Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2) /dose) was administered intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Chemotherapy agents were the same as those used in the TACL trial, consisting of dexamethasone, doxorubicin, vincristine and pegylated asparaginase. Three patients (8.1%) died due to infections.

Herein, we compare the ability of a single topical application of SDF1-ELP to that of SDF1 in healing 1 x 1 cm excisional wounds in diabetic mice. Approach: Human Leukemia-60 cells were used to demonstrate the chemotactic potential of SDF1-ELP versus SDF1 in vitro. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were used to demonstrate the angiogenic potential of SDF1-ELP versus SDF1 in vitro. The bioactivity of SDF1-ELP versus SDF1 after incubation in ex-vivo diabetic wound fluid was compared. The in-vivo effectiveness of SDF1-ELP versus SDF1 was compared in diabetic mice wound model by monitoring for the number of CD31+ cells in harvested wound tissues. Results: SDF1-ELP promotes the migration of cells and induces vascularization similar to SDF1 in vitro. SDF1-ELP is more stable in wound fluids compared to SDF1. In vivo, SDF1-ELP induced a higher number of vascular endothelial cells (CD31+ cells) compared to SDF1 and other controls, suggesting increased vascularization. Innovation: While growth factors have been shown to improve wound healing, this strategy is largely ineffective in chronic wounds. In this work, we show that SDF1-ELP is a promising agent for the treatment of chronic skin wounds. Conclusion: The superior in vivo performance and stability of SDF1-ELP makes it a promising agent for the treatment of chronic skin wounds.",,"['Yeboah, Agnes', 'Maguire, Tim', 'Schloss, Rene', 'Berthiaume, Francois', 'Yarmush, Martin L']","['Yeboah A', 'Maguire T', 'Schloss R', 'Berthiaume F', 'Yarmush ML']",,"['Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Rutgers University , Piscataway, New Jersey.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University , Piscataway, New Jersey.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University , Piscataway, New Jersey.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University , Piscataway, New Jersey.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey.; Center for Engineering in Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Shriners Burns Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Wound Care (New Rochelle),Advances in wound care,101590593,,,,PMC5220551,['NOTNLM'],"['elastin like peptides (ELP)', 'nanoparticles', 'skin', 'stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1)', 'wound healing']",,2017/01/25 06:00,2017/01/25 06:01,['2017/01/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1089/wound.2016.0694 [doi]', '10.1089/wound.2016.0694 [pii]']",ppublish,Adv Wound Care (New Rochelle). 2017 Jan 1;6(1):10-22. doi: 10.1089/wound.2016.0694.,,,['T32 GM008339/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oncogenic NOTCH signaling, which is activated in more than 65% of T-ALL patients by activating mutations in the NOTCH1 gene, has emerged as a major regulator of leukemia cell growth and metabolism. T-ALL NOTCH1 mutations result in ligand-independent and sustained NOTCH1-receptor signaling, which translates into activation of a broad transcriptional program dominated by upregulation of genes involved in anabolic pathways. Among these, the MYC oncogene plays a major role in NOTCH1-induced transformation.

Broadly, the landscape of genetic abnormalities in ATL that include alterations highly enriched in genes for T-cell receptor-NF-kappaB signaling such as PLCG1, PRKCB, and CARD11 and gain-of function mutations in CCR4 and CCR7 Conversely, the epigenetic landscape of ATL can be summarized as polycomb repressive complex 2 hyperactivation with genome-wide H3K27 me3 accumulation as the basis of the unique transcriptome of ATL cells. Expression of H3K27 methyltransferase enhancer of zeste 2 was shown to be induced by HTLV-1 Tax and NF-kappaB. Furthermore, provirus integration site analysis with high-throughput sequencing enabled the analysis of clonal composition and cell number of each clone in vivo, whereas multicolor flow cytometric analysis with CD7 and cell adhesion molecule 1 enabled the identification of HTLV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells in vivo. Sorted immortalized but untransformed cells displayed epigenetic changes closely overlapping those observed in terminally transformed ATL cells, suggesting that epigenetic abnormalities are likely earlier events in leukemogenesis. These new findings broaden the scope of conceptualization of the molecular mechanisms of leukemogenesis, dissecting them into immortalization and clonal progression. These recent findings also open a new direction of drug development for ATL prevention and treatment because epigenetic marks can be reprogrammed.

This treatment provides a new and novel method for eliminating the LSCs that are otherwise not targeted by existing therapies. The antileukemic effect of selenium was dependent on the production of endogenous cyclopentenone prostaglandins (CyPGs), Delta-12 prostaglandin J2 (Delta(12)-PGJ2), and 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). Here, we show that these endogenous CyPGs, produced by mice maintained on selenium-supplemented diets, alleviate the symptoms of CML through their ability to activate the nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). GW9662, a potent PPARgamma antagonist, blocked the antileukemic effect of selenium supplementation by significantly reducing CyPGs. This effect was mediated by an increase in 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-Pgdh) activity, which oxidizes and inactivates Delta(12)-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2 In contrast, treatment with the PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone mimicked selenium supplementation. This treatment led to decreased 15-Pgdh activity and increased CyPG levels, which inhibited CML progression. Selenium-dependent activation of PPARgamma mediated by endogenous CyPGs decreased Stat5 expression leading to the downregulation of Cited2, a master regulator of LSC quiescence.

We performed this retrospective study to identify prognostic factors for post-transplantation outcomes. The CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS) has been validated in subjects receiving nontransplantation therapy and was included in our study. From 2001 to 2012, 209 adult subjects who received HCT for CMML were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. The median age at transplantation was 57 years (range, 23 to 74). Median follow-up was 51 months (range, 3 to 122). On multivariate analyses, CPSS scores, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and graft source were significant predictors of survival (P = .004, P = .01, P = .01, respectively). Higher CPSS scores were not associated with disease-free survival, relapse, or transplantation-related mortality. In a restricted analysis of subjects with relapse after HCT, those with intermediate-2/high risk had a nearly 2-fold increased risk of death after relapse compared to those with low/intermediate-1 CPSS scores. Respective 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates for low/intermediate-1 risk subjects were 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52% to 72%), 48% (95% CI, 37% to 59%), and 44% (95% CI, 33% to 55%), and for intermediate-2/high risk subjects were 38% (95% CI, 28% to 49%), 32% (95% CI, 21% to 42%), and 19% (95% CI, 8% to 29%). We conclude that higher CPSS score at time of transplantation, lower KPS, and a bone marrow graft are associated with inferior survival after HCT. Further investigation of CMML disease-related biology may provide insights into other risk factors predictive of post-transplantation outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We monitored WT1 decrement along the treatment course to identify its significant role as a marker for residual disease in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and tried to suggest its significance for relapse prediction. In this single center retrospective study, we serially measured PML-RARa and WT1 expression from 117 APL patients at diagnosis, at post-induction and post-consolidation chemotherapies, and at every 3 months after starting maintenance therapy. All 117 patients were in molecular remission after treatment of at least 2 consolidation chemotherapies. We used WT1 ProfileQuant kit (Ipsogen) for WT1 monitoring. High WT1 expression (>120 copies/10(4) ABL1) after consolidation and at early period (3 months) after maintenance therapy significantly predicted subsequent relapse. All paired PML-RARa RQ-PCR were not detected except for one sample with early relapse. Patients with high WT1 expression at 3 months after maintenance therapy (n = 40) showed a significantly higher relapse rate (30.5 vs. 6.9%, P < 0.001) and inferior disease free survival (62.8 vs. 91.4%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that high peak leukocyte counts at diagnosis (HR = 6.4, P < 0.001) and high WT1 expression at 3 months after maintenance therapy (HR = 7.1, P < 0.001) were significant factors for prediction of relapse. Our data showed high post-remission WT1 expression was a reliable marker for prediction of subsequent molecular relapse in APL. In this high-risk group, early intervention with ATRA +/- ATO, anti-CD33 antibody therapy, and WT1-specific therapy may be used for relapse prevention.

Therefore, the treatment of AML requires new strategies, such as adding a third drug. To address whether GATA2 could act as a regulator of chemotherapy resistance in human leukemia cells, we observed KG1a cells and clinical patients' AML cells with a classic drug (Cerubidine) and Gefitinib. After utilizing chemotherapy, the expression of GATA2 and its target genes (EVI, SCL and WT1) in surviving AML cells and KG1a cells were significantly enhanced to double and quadrupled compared to its original level respectively. Furthermore, with continuous chemotherapeutics, AML cells with GATA2 knockdown or treated with GATA2 inhibitor (K1747) almost eliminated with dramatically reduced expression of WT1, SCL, EVI, and significantly increased apoptotic population. Therefore, we propose that reducing GATA2 expression or inhibition of its transcription activity can relieve the drug resistance of acute myeloid leukemia cells and it would be helpful for eliminating the leukemia cells in patients.",,"['Yang, Li', 'Sun, Hanxiao', 'Cao, Yanan', 'Xuan, Binbin', 'Fan, Yingchao', 'Sheng, Huiming', 'Zhuang, Wenfang']","['Yang L', 'Sun H', 'Cao Y', 'Xuan B', 'Fan Y', 'Sheng H', 'Zhuang W']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongren Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC5256934,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2017/01/24 06:00,2017/08/12 06:00,['2017/01/24 06:00'],"['2016/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0170630 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-40980 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jan 23;12(1):e0170630. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0170630. eCollection 2017.,20170123,,,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2017 Mar 28;12 (3):e0175005.

Although inhibitors targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway have been successful in the treatment of the disease, the underlying mechanisms leading to BCR over-activity in CLL are not fully understood. In this study, we found that HSP90, a highly conserved molecular chaperone, is overexpressed in CLL compared with resting B cells. HSP90 overexpression is accompanied by the overexpression of several BCR kinases including LYN, spleen tyrosine kinase, Bruton tyrosine kinase and AKT. Chemical and immune-precipitation demonstrated that these BCR constituents are present in a multi-client chaperone complex with HSP90. Inhibition of HSP90 with PU-H71 destabilized the BCR kinases and caused apoptosis of CLL cells through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Further, PU-H71 induced apoptosis in the presence of stromal co-culture or cytoprotective survival signals. Finally, genetic knockdown of HSP90 and its client AKT, but not BTK, reduced CLL viability. Overall, our study suggests that the chaperone function of HSP90 contributes to the over-activity of the BCR signaling in CLL and inhibition of HSP90 has the potential to achieve a multi-targeting effect. Thus, HSP90 inhibition may be explored to prevent or overcome drug resistance to single targeting agents.",,"['Guo, A', 'Lu, P', 'Lee, J', 'Zhen, C', 'Chiosis, G', 'Wang, Y L']","['Guo A', 'Lu P', 'Lee J', 'Zhen C', 'Chiosis G', 'Wang YL']",,"['Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago and.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago and.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago and.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago and.', 'Program in Chemical Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA and Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Benzodioxoles)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '06IVK87M04 (9H-purine-9-propanamine,', '6-amino-8-((6-iodo-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)thio)-N-(1-methylethyl)-)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Benzodioxoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Syk Kinase/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC5645670,,,,2017/01/24 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2017/01/24 06:00'],"['2016/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016494 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.494 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Jun 15;36(24):3441-3449. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.494.

We uncovered both common as well as specific MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 target genes, which were all marked by H3K79me2, H3K27ac and H3K4me3. Apart from promoter binding, we also identified MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 binding at specific subsets of non-overlapping active distal regulatory elements. Despite this differential enhancer binding, MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 still direct a common gene program, which represents part of the RUNX1 gene program and constitutes of CD34(+) and monocyte-specific genes. Comparing these data sets identified several zinc finger transcription factors (TFs) as potential MLL-AF9 co-regulators.

In this report, we identified myoferlin as a novel MKL/SRF target gene by gene expression profiling and verification in vivo in HCC xenografts. Myoferlin was overexpressed in human and murine HCCs triggered by conditional expression of constitutively active SRF-VP16 protein in hepatocytes. Furthermore, myoferlin was required for HCC cell invasion, proliferation and anchorage-independent cell growth.

AIM: To describe cardiometabolic risk in HSCT/TBI survivors and identify anthropometric measurements of adiposity representative of cardiometabolic risks in HSCT/TBI survivors. METHOD: Childhood leukaemia survivors treated with HSCT/TBI (n = 21, 11 males) were compared with chemotherapy-only (n = 31) and obese non-leukaemic controls (n = 30). All subjects (16-26 years) had blood pressure and auxological measurements (body mass index, waist and hip circumferences) and blood tests (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], and oral glucose tolerance tests). Central adiposity was defined as either increased waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) (>0.5), or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (males >0.9, females >0.85). RESULTS: HSCT/TBI survivors showed higher prevalence of hypertriglyceridaemia than both comparison groups and higher prevalence of reduced HDL compared to the chemotherapy-only group. The WHR reported a higher prevalence of increased adiposity in HSCT/TBI survivors compared with WC and WHtR, but such differences were not observed in the other groups. In the HSCT survivors, WHR had the highest number of significant associations with metabolic risk factors, and metabolic risks worsen with time elapsed since primary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: HSCT/TBI survivors have high cardiometabolic risk that is not sufficiently reflected by WC alone. WHR is a useful surrogate marker for increased cardiometabolic risk in HSCT/TBI survivors..","['(c) 2017 S.

Idelalisib is a PI3Kdelta inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the relapsed/refractory setting, and several other PI3K inhibitors are being developed targeting other isoforms of the PI3K enzyme, which results in distinct toxicities and variable efficacy in the clinical setting. Areas covered: We provide a general overview of PI3K inhibitors, recommended applications, and the mechanism and management of toxicities. We further review trials, ongoing and completed, leading to the approval of idelalisib as well other PI3K inhibitors currently in development. Articles were obtained from PubMed, and abstracts were searched for the past 5 years from the websites for ASCO, ASH, EHA, and ICML/Lugano. Expert commentary: PI3K inhibitors provide an important and powerful pharmacologic tool in the armamentarium against hematologic malignancies, especially for relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoid malignancies. Unique toxicities are associated with inhibition of different isoforms of the PI3K enzyme, as demonstrated with the infectious and autoimmune toxicities associated with the PI3Kdelta inhibitor, idelalisib. Due to these unique toxicities, PI3K inhibitors should only be used in formally approved combinations and settings.",,"['Greenwell, I B', 'Flowers, C R', 'Blum, K A', 'Cohen, J B']","['Greenwell IB', 'Flowers CR', 'Blum KA', 'Cohen JB']",,"['a Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Emory University Winship Cancer Institute , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'a Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Emory University Winship Cancer Institute , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'b Division of Hematology , The Ohio State University James Cancer Center , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'a Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Emory University Winship Cancer Institute , Atlanta , GA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Purines/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*PI3K inhibitor', '*autoimmune', '*clinical trial', '*idelalisib', '*infection', '*lymphoma', ""*non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", '*toxicity']",,2017/01/24 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2017/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2017.1285702 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2017 Mar;17(3):271-279. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2017.1285702.

We performed Cox regression analyses to identify risk factors for 2-year NRM and 5-year event-free survival (using EFS as a surrogate for long-term disease control) in a large, updated EBMT registry cohort (n= 694). For the whole cohort, 2-year NRM was 28% and 5-year EFS 37%. Higher age, lower performance status, unrelated donor type and unfavorable sex-mismatch had a significant adverse impact on 2-year NRM. Two-year NRM was calculated for good- and poor-risk reference patients. Predicted 2-year-NRM was 11 and 12% for male and female good-risk patients compared with 42 and 33% for male and female poor-risk patients. For 5-year EFS, age, performance status, prior autologous HCT, remission status and sex-mismatch had a significant impact, whereas del(17p) did not. The model-based prediction of 5-year EFS was 55% and 64%, respectively, for male and female good-risk patients.

While rare in adults, AMKL accounts for 4-15% of newly diagnosed childhood AML cases. AMKL in individuals without Down syndrome (non-DS-AMKL) is frequently associated with poor clinical outcomes. Previous efforts have identified chimeric oncogenes in a substantial number of non-DS-AMKL cases, including RBM15-MKL1, CBFA2T3-GLIS2, KMT2A gene rearrangements, and NUP98-KDM5A. However, the etiology of 30-40% of cases remains unknown. To better understand the genomic landscape of non-DS-AMKL, we performed RNA and exome sequencing on specimens from 99 patients (75 pediatric and 24 adult). We demonstrate that pediatric non-DS-AMKL is a heterogeneous malignancy that can be divided into seven subgroups with varying outcomes. These subgroups are characterized by chimeric oncogenes with cooperating mutations in epigenetic and kinase signaling genes.

T. gondii infection during pregnancy can damage the fetus and cause birth defects; however, the molecular mechanisms of this process are poorly understood. This study aims to determine the activities of autophagy and apoptosis as well as their regulatory mechanisms during T. gondii infection by using human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) as a model of congenital diseases. LC3B, a hallmark protein of autophagy was incrementally upregulated with the infection duration, whereas p62 was downregulated in T. gondii-infected hUC-MSCs. Concurrent to this result, the invasion of T. gondii into hUC-MSCs increased in a time-dependent manner. The expression levels of Bcl-2 family proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bim, Bax, Bid and Bak were not altered; however, Mcl-1 levels in hUC-MSCs were dramatically decreased upon T. gondii infection. In addition, at 24 h post-infection, cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels were elevated in hUC-MSCs. Importantly, Mcl-1 overexpression reduced the levels of autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins in T. gondii-infected hUC-MSCs. Mcl-1 proteins were primarily expressed in the fraction containing mitochondria and strongly interacted with Beclin-1 under normal conditions; however, these interactions were remarkably attenuated by T. gondii infection.

There is limited data on the role of ABC transporter expression on in vitro sensitivity to cytarabine (Ara-C) and daunorubicin (Dnr) in primary AML cells. PATIENTS & METHODS: RNA expression levels of 12 ABC transporters were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR in 233 de novo adult acute myeloid leukemia patients. Based on cytarabine or Dnr IC50, the samples were categorized as sensitive, intermediate and resistant. Role of candidate ABC transporter RNA expression on in vitro cytotoxicity, treatment outcome post therapy as well as the influence of various prognostic markers on ABC transporter expression were analyzed. RESULTS: Expression of ABCC3 and ABCB6 were significantly higher in Dnr-resistant samples when compared with Dnr-sensitive samples. Increased ABCC1 expression was associated with poor disease-free survival in this cohort of patients.

Methods Samples from sick (n = 96) and dead ( n = 15) cats were analysed using reverse transcription PCR. Blood and urine analyses and histopathology were also performed. Results FmoPV RNA was detected in six cats (5.4%), including three sick (in the urine) and three dead cats (tissues). A significantly greater proportion of FmoPV RNA-positive cats had street access compared with non-infected cats. Blood samples from the morbillivirus-positive cats were negative for morbillivirus RNA. Tubular parenchymal cells, lymphoid and plasma cells in kidney and hepatocytes, lymphoid and plasma cells in liver from dead cats were also positive by immunohistochemistry for the viral N protein. Two FmoPV-positive cats were also positive for feline coronavirus RNA and one cat for feline immunodeficiency virus RNA and feline leukaemia virus proviral DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of the six FmoPV-positive cats showed that the strains were grouped into cluster D and had high similarity (98.5-100%) with strains from Japan and Germany. In the three FmoPV RNA-positive sick cats, respiratory, urinary and digestive system signs were observed as well as weight loss, fever and depression in some cats. Similar clinical signs were also seen in the morbillivirus RNA-negative sick cats. FmoPV RNA-positive cats had lower median red blood cell count, haemoglobin, albumin, albumin/globulin and urobilinogen and higher alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin compared with non-infected cats. Significant histopathology of FmoPV RNA-positive dead cats included tubulointerstitial nephritis characterised by severe granular and vacuolar degeneration of the epithelial cells of the cortical and medullary tubules as well as mononuclear cell infiltrates. Widespread lymphoid cell infiltrates were detected in the renal cortex and medullary regions of the kidneys. Cellular infiltration, cholangiohepatitis and focal necrosis in the liver were also found. Although virus-infected cells were found in the kidney and liver of FmoRV RNA-positive cats, tubulointerstitial nephritis, cholangiohepatitis and focal necrosis seen in FmoRV RNA-positive cats were similar to those observed in FmoRV RNA-negative cats. Conclusions and relevance This is the first study to show the presence of FmoPV infection in cats in Turkey. Sick cats, particularly those with kidney disease, should be tested for this virus. The genotypes found in this study were similar to previously reported strains, indicating that circulating morbilliviruses in Turkey are conserved.",,"['Yilmaz, Huseyin', 'Tekelioglu, Bilge K', 'Gurel, Aydin', 'Bamac, Ozge E', 'Ozturk, Gulay Y', 'Cizmecigil, Utku Y', 'Altan, Eda', 'Aydin, Ozge', 'Yilmaz, Aysun', 'Berriatua, Eduardo', 'Helps, Chris R', 'Richt, Juergen A', 'Turan, Nuri']","['Yilmaz H', 'Tekelioglu BK', 'Gurel A', 'Bamac OE', 'Ozturk GY', 'Cizmecigil UY', 'Altan E', 'Aydin O', 'Yilmaz A', 'Berriatua E', 'Helps CR', 'Richt JA', 'Turan N']",,"['1 Department of Virology, University of Istanbul, Veterinary Faculty, Avcilar, Istanbul, Turkey.', '2 Department of Pathology, University of Istanbul, Veterinary Faculty, Avcilar, Istanbul, Turkey.', '3 Department of Virology, University of Cukurova, Veterinary Faculty, Ceyhan, Adana, Turkey.', '3 Department of Virology, University of Cukurova, Veterinary Faculty, Ceyhan, Adana, Turkey.', '3 Department of Virology, University of Cukurova, Veterinary Faculty, Ceyhan, Adana, Turkey.', '1 Department of Virology, University of Istanbul, Veterinary Faculty, Avcilar, Istanbul, Turkey.', '1 Department of Virology, University of Istanbul, Veterinary Faculty, Avcilar, Istanbul, Turkey.', '1 Department of Virology, University of Istanbul, Veterinary Faculty, Avcilar, Istanbul, Turkey.', '4 Cevre Analysis Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey.', ""5 Animal Health Department, Regional Campus of International Excellence 'Campus Mare Nostrum', Universidad de Murcia, Murcia, Spain."", '6 University of Bristol, Langford Veterinary Services, Bristol, UK.', '7 Department of Diagnostic Medicine and Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA.', '1 Department of Virology, University of Istanbul, Veterinary Faculty, Avcilar, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'Feline morbillivirus']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/blood/*epidemiology/urine/virology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Male', 'Morbillivirus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Morbillivirus Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",,,,,2017/01/24 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2017/01/24 06:00'],"['2017/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1098612X16686728 [doi]'],ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2017 Dec;19(12):1206-1214. doi: 10.1177/1098612X16686728.

Although genetic risk variants for individual BCMs have been identified, an agnostic, genome-wide search for shared genetic susceptibility has not been performed. We explored genome-wide association studies of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, N = 1,842), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL, N = 1,465) and multiple myeloma (MM, N = 3,790). We identified a novel pleiotropic risk locus at 3q22.2 (NCK1, rs11715604, P = 1.60 x 10(-9)) with opposing effects between CLL (P = 1.97 x 10(-8)) and HL (P = 3.31 x 10(-3)). Eight established non-HLA risk loci showed pleiotropic associations. Within the HLA region, Ser37 + Phe37 in HLA-DRB1 (P = 1.84 x 10(-12)) was associated with increased CLL and HL risk (P = 4.68 x 10(-12)), and reduced MM risk (P = 1.12 x 10(-2)), and Gly70 in HLA-DQB1 (P = 3.15 x 10(-10)) showed opposing effects between CLL (P = 3.52 x 10(-3)) and HL (P = 3.41 x 10(-9)). By integrating eQTL, Hi-C and ChIP-seq data, we show that the pleiotropic risk loci are enriched for B-cell regulatory elements, as well as an over-representation of binding of key B-cell transcription factors. These data identify shared biological pathways influencing the development of CLL, HL and MM. The identification of these risk loci furthers our understanding of the aetiological basis of BCMs.",,"['Law, Philip J', 'Sud, Amit', 'Mitchell, Jonathan S', 'Henrion, Marc', 'Orlando, Giulia',

RDEA119 had similar effect on PD-L1 and STAT-1 in IFN-gamma activated CLL-1390 cells. Overall, these results indicate that PD-L1 is expressed in canine B cell lymphoma. Its inhibition by MEK1/2 inhibitors suggests a possible treatment strategy using targeted drugs which likely could enhance antitumor immune response.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Kumar, S R', 'Kim, D Y', 'Henry, C J', 'Bryan, J N', 'Robinson, K L', 'Eaton, A M']","['Kumar SR', 'Kim DY', 'Henry CJ', 'Bryan JN', 'Robinson KL', 'Eaton AM']",,"['Comparative Oncology, Radiopharmaceutical and Epigenetics Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri.', 'Veterinary Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri.', 'Comparative Oncology, Radiopharmaceutical and Epigenetics Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri.', 'Comparative Oncology, Radiopharmaceutical and Epigenetics Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri.', 'Comparative Oncology, Radiopharmaceutical and Epigenetics Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri.', 'Comparative Oncology, Radiopharmaceutical and Epigenetics Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Vet Comp Oncol,Veterinary and comparative oncology,101185242,"['0 (AZD 6244)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0', '(N-(3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenylamino)-6-methoxyphenyl)-1-(2,3-dihydroxy', 'propyl)cyclopropane-1-sulfonamide)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '9N3CBB0BIQ (Diphenylamine)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diphenylamine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dog Diseases/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Immunoblotting/veterinary', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/*veterinary', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['MEK1', 'PD-L1', 'canine', 'inhibitors', 'lymphoma']",,2017/01/24 06:00,2018/07/24 06:00,['2017/01/24 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/vco.12297 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Comp Oncol. 2017 Dec;15(4):1527-1536. doi: 10.1111/vco.12297.

We present the case of a boy primarily diagnosed with NF1 with coexisting JXG who developed JMML at the age of 22 months. The clinical course from initial presentation to final diagnosis is detailed and the genetic features and hematologic characteristics are discussed.

Decreasing overall leukemia mortality in children requires a comprehensive understanding of its pathobiology. It is becoming clear that malignant cell-to-niche intercommunication and microenvironmental signals that control early cell fate decisions are critical for tumor progression. We show here that the mesenchymal stromal cell component of ALL bone marrow (BM) differ from its normal counterpart in a number of functional properties and may have a key role during leukemic development. A decreased proliferation potential, contrasting with the strong ability of producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and an aberrantly loss of CXCL12 and SCF, suggest that leukemic lymphoid niches in ALL BM are unique and may exclude normal hematopoiesis. Cell competence ex vivo assays within tridimensional coculture structures indicated a growth advantage of leukemic precursor cells and their niche remodeling ability by CXCL12 reduction, resulting in leukemic cell progression at the expense of normal niche-associated lymphopoiesis.",,"['Balandran, Juan Carlos', 'Purizaca, Jessica', 'Enciso, Jennifer', 'Dozal, David', 'Sandoval, Antonio', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Aleman-Lazarini, Leticia', 'Perez-Koldenkova, Vadim', 'Quintela-Nunez Del Prado, Henry', 'Rios de Los Rios, Jussara', 'Mayani, Hector', 'Ortiz-Navarrete, Vianney', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Pelayo, Rosana']","['Balandran JC', 'Purizaca J', 'Enciso J', 'Dozal D', 'Sandoval A', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Aleman-Lazarini L', 'Perez-Koldenkova V', 'Quintela-Nunez Del Prado H', 'Rios de Los Rios J', 'Mayani H', 'Ortiz-Navarrete V', 'Guzman ML', 'Pelayo R']",,"['Oncology Research Unit, Mexican Institute for Social Security, Mexico City, Mexico; Molecular Biomedicine Program, CINVESTAV, IPN, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Oncology Research Unit, Mexican Institute for Social Security , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'Oncology Research Unit, Mexican Institute for Social Security, Mexico City, Mexico; Biochemistry Sciences Program, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Hospital para el Nino, Instituto Materno Infantil del Estado de Mexico , Toluca , Mexico.', 'Hospital para el Nino, Instituto Materno Infantil del Estado de Mexico , Toluca , Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Pediatrico Moctezuma, SSA , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedicine, CINVESTAV , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Microscopia, Centro de Instrumentos, Coordinacion de Investigacion en Salud, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'UMAE ""Dr. Victorio de la Fuente Narvaez"", Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'Oncology Research Unit, Mexican Institute for Social Security, Mexico City, Mexico; Biochemistry Sciences Program, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Oncology Research Unit, Mexican Institute for Social Security , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'Molecular Biomedicine Program, CINVESTAV, IPN , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine , New York, NY , USA.', 'Oncology Research Unit, Mexican Institute for Social Security , Mexico City , Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC5216624,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCL12', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'leukemic niches', 'pro-inflammatory bone marrow', 'tumor microenvironment']",,2017/01/24 06:00,2017/01/24 06:01,['2017/01/24 06:00'],"['2016/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2016.00666 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Jan 5;7:666. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2016.00666. eCollection 2016.,20170105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maintenance treatment consisted of TV (thalidomide 100 mg daily plus one cycle of intravenous bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 every 3 months) versus T (100 mg daily) versus alfa2-IFN (3 MU three times per week) for up to 3 years. A total of 271 patients were randomized (TV: 91; T: 88; alfa2-IFN: 92). The complete response (CR) rate with maintenance was improved by 21% with TV, 11% with T and 17% with alfa2-IFN (P, not significant). After a median follow-up of 58.6 months, the progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer with TV compared with T and alfa2-IFN (50.6 vs 40.3 vs 32.5 months, P=0.03). Overall survival was not significantly different among the three arms. Grade 2-3 peripheral neuropathy was observed in 48.8%, 34.4% and 1% of patients treated with TV, T and alfa2-IFN, respectively. In conclusion, bortezomib and thalidomide maintenance resulted in a significantly longer PFS when compared with thalidomide or alfa2-IFN. (no.

Acalabrutinib, a more specific BTK inhibitor now in development, also appears to be highly effective in CLL, but the connection of its mechanism with CLL cell death is also unclear. Using dynamic BH3 profiling, we analyzed alterations in the function of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway induced by ibrutinib and acalabrutinib. We studied CLL patient samples treated ex vivo with both drugs, as well as primary samples from CLL patients on clinical trials of both drugs. We found that BTK inhibition enhances mitochondrial BCL-2 dependence without significantly altering overall mitochondrial priming. Enhancement of BCL-2 dependence was accompanied by an increase in the pro-apoptotic protein BIM. In contrast, treatment with the selective BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax enhanced overall mitochondrial priming without increasing BCL-2 dependence. Pre-treatment of CLL cells with either BTK inhibitor, whether ex vivo or in vivo in patients, enhanced killing by venetoclax.

The present study aims to elucidate the effects and molecular mechanisms of miR-144-3p that underlie gastric cancer (GC) development. It was observed that miR-144-3p expression was significantly decreased in GC tissues compared to that in paired non-tumor tissues; moreover, its expression was lower in tissues of advanced stage and larger tumor size, as well as in lymph node metastasis tissues compared to that in control groups. miR-144-3p expression was associated with depth of invasion (P = 0.030), tumor size (P = 0.047), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.047), and TNM stage (P = 0.048). Additionally, miR-144-3p significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion in GC cells. It also reduced F-actin expression and suppressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in GC cells. Furthermore, pre-leukemia transcription factor 3 (PBX3) was a direct target gene of miR-144-3p. PBX3 was overexpressed in GC tissues and promoted EMT in GC cells. The effects of miR-144-3p mimics or inhibitors on cell migration, invasion, and proliferation were reversed by PBX3 overexpression or downregulation respectively. These results suggest that miR-144-3p suppresses GC progression by inhibiting EMT through targeting PBX3.",['Copyright A(c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Conversion of B cells to macrophages was readily induced by the ectopic expression of any C/EBP, and enhanced by endogenous C/EBPalpha and beta activation. High transgene expression of C/EBPbeta or C/EBPepsilon, but not of C/EBPalpha or C/EBPdelta, also induced the formation of granulocytes. Granulocytes and macrophages emerged in a mutually exclusive manner. C/EBPbeta-expressing B cells produced granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP)-like progenitors when subjected to selective pressure to eliminate lymphoid cells. The GMP-like progenitors remained self-renewing and cytokine-independent, and continuously produced macrophages and granulocytes. In addition to their suitability to study myelomonocytic lineage bifurcation, lineage-switched GMP-like progenitors could reflect the features of the lympho-myeloid lineage switch observed in leukemic progression.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

In this study, the distribution of KIR gene, KIR genotypes, HLA-C groups, HLA-Bw4, and KIR-HLA interaction from 273 healthy participants and 253 AML patients (M0-M6) in southern Chinese Han were determined to investigate the relationships among KIR, HLA and AML. The results showed that the frequencies of 2DS4del in M5 patients were significantly higher than those of the controls (65.0% vs 46.5%, P=0.0104, OR=2.135, P<a'). The frequency of KIR genotype BX13 in the healthy controls was significantly higher than that in AML patients (3.7% vs 0%, P=0.0019, OR=20.2, P<a'). No other significant differences in the frequencies of KIR, HLA and KIR-HLA interaction were identified between AML patients and controls. Our study suggests that 2DS4del may conduct a susceptibility to AML, and genotype BX13 might conduct a protective effect on AML.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.
